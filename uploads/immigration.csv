The claim was filed with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Arleta High incident renewed concerns because it happened on the campus perimeter.
School board member Kelly Gonez, who represents the Arleta High area, said the officers acted improperly.","Attorneys announced Tuesday that they have filed a $1-million damage claim against the Trump administration alleging that the recent arrest of a 15-year-old boy outside Arleta High School amounted to the “unconstitutional racial profiling” of a U.S. citizen.

The claim, filed on Monday according to paperwork provided by attorneys, cited “conduct of ICE agents and Border Patrol agents that caused the false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, [and] battery” of the boy on Aug. 11.

The Trump administration on Tuesday denied any wrongdoing, saying that the incident was one of mistaken identity.

According to school district officials, federal agents drew weapons on the boy, who is a student with a disability, and handcuffed him before his mother persuaded the agents that her son was not the individual they were looking for.

The student’s mother, Andreina Mejia, affirmed those details at a Tuesday news conference outside school district headquarters, just west of downtown L.A. While she waited in the car with her son, who attends San Fernando High School, a white truck drove up quickly — so quickly she thought it would hit her vehicle.

At least two masked men with guns approached — one on each side of the car. She said the officers pulled both of them from the car and separated them. Her son had difficulty removing his seat belt, but he did not resist as he was placed immediately in handcuffs.

“I looked at my son’s reaction, and I saw that he was scared,” Mejia said. “He didn’t know what was going on, so I just told him: ‘Don’t make any movement. Don’t move. Just follow instructions.’”

She remembers thinking: “He could be making a movement that he’s not supposed to make, and they could do something to him.”

Mejia said her son has difficulty processing language and expressing himself and receives special services. His disability put him at greater risk, she said, but he handled himself well, telling the officers that he is an American citizen, 15 years old and a student.

Mejia said she volunteered to retrieve identification for her son from their home, although this offer was not accepted. About seven minutes after the confrontation began, officers were persuaded they had detained the wrong person.

An officer then joked, to mother and son, that the boy would have an exciting experience to tell his friends about.

“There’s nothing exciting about getting guns pointed at you, especially when you’re a 15-year-old,” Mejia said.

According to the cover letter of the claim, signed by attorney Luis Carrillo, “the ICE agents and Border Patrol agents falsely claimed that [the student] was a suspect of a crime.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security denied racial profiling.

“Allegations that Border Patrol targeted Arleta High School are FALSE,” the department statement said. “Agents were conducting a targeted operation on [a] criminal illegal alien.”

“What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity,” the statement said. “America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists — truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities.”

Officials added: “This is a case study of billboard law firms trying to turn family resemblance into racial animus to collect clicks, clout, and cash.”

The department also praised the mother for being cooperative in an investigation that led to the arrest — later that same day — of the boy’s cousin, an unauthorized immigrant who, according to the department, had a 2021 misdemeanor conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.

On Tuesday, attorneys for the Mejia family said the Homeland Security account misrepresented the situation. They said the man ultimately arrested is not a member of the same family and is of a different nationality. They do not look alike, the attorneys said.

“There’s no resemblance, except for the brown color,” said Carrillo. “That’s why they were confused thinking that this — her boy — was the gang member when there was never a case.”

Attorney Michael Carrillo said that linking the family to the arrest of a gang member could potentially have put the family in danger.

A claim, such as the one filed in this case, provides a government entity the opportunity to assess and compensate alleged victims. If a claim is denied, parties have the option to pursue litigation. The claim was filed with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In discussing the Arleta High incident, L.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho talked, at a recent news conference, of what he learned from the family, from school administrators and from reviewing video.

“He was released, but the trauma in his mind has not been released,” Carvalho said. “I spoke with the mom. He cries. He is upset. He is depressed. He keeps asking if this is going to happen again.”

Federal officials have said no place is off limits — including schools — as they press to reach President Trump’s goal of 1 million deportations per year.

Immigration agents attempted to enter two Los Angeles elementary schools in April, but the principals turned them away. The Arleta High incident renewed concerns because it happened on the campus perimeter. Immigration agents also recently arrested — on Aug. 8 — an 18-year-old Reseda High senior as he was walking the family dog near their Van Nuys home.

Federal officials have defended the arrest — and ongoing detention — of the Reseda High student, Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, as appropriate because they say he is in the country illegally.

After the Arleta incident, the officials lauded the ultimate arrest of the targeted individual.

“Once again, our agents keeping streets and the American tax-payer safe from criminals and we will keep doing so until the mission is accomplished,” said U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino in a social media post.

“This illegal alien from El Salvador was arrested in Pacoima, CA.,” Bovino posted on social media about the boy’s purported cousin. “Not only was he illegally in the United States, but he also has a misdemeanor in 2021 for ‘carrying a concealed weapon on person.’ He is also suspected of being a member of the MS-13 street gang,” Bovina posted on social media.

Mejia’s attorneys called on President Trump to exempt schools and areas near them from immigration enforcement actions. They also called on the school district to release video footage of the incident. The district has declined requests from multiple parties, including The Times, citing privacy restrictions.

School board member Kelly Gonez, who represents the Arleta High area, said the officers acted improperly.

“Such actions — violently detaining a child just outside a public school — are absolutely reprehensible and should have no place in our country,” Gonez said in a social media post.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d150e08/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+329/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fcc%2Fa76734b34f009aaefe81ba2fc6db%2F1519674-me-arleta-high-student-01-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 18:56:53.456454

(AP) — A Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade arrest by U.S. immigration agents lost an attempt Tuesday to throw out the Trump administration’s case against her.

The prosecution of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan has highlighted the push by President Donald Trump’ s administration to confront state and local authorities who resist his sweeping immigration crackdown.

Democrats have accused the administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to its deportation efforts.

She was arrested at the county courthouse in April and indicted on federal charges in May. She quickly filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and is therefore immune from prosecution.

However, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman on Tuesday rejected that argument and upheld the July recommendation of a magistrate judge who also ruled that the case could proceed.

Adelman said the dispute boils down to Dugan arguing that there is a general rule of immunity for judges from prosecution, with some limited exceptions, while the government argues that the cited exceptions are simply examples of types of prosecutions that have been brought.

“A review of the relevant history reveals the government has the better of the argument,” Adelman wrote.

He said that “the particulars of this case may be unusual,” but “there is no firmly established judicial immunity barring criminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts. There is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered ‘part of a judge’s job.’”

Attorneys for Dugan said in a statement that they were disappointed with the judge’s decision, but “we look forward to the trial which will show Judge Dugan did nothing wrong and simply treated this case like any other in front of her courtroom.”

Steve Caballero, spokesman for prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s Milwaukee, had no comment on the ruling.

Adelman’s decision could be appealed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He scheduled a hearing in the case for Sept. 3.

Dugan has pleaded not guilty to helping a man in the country illegally try to evade authorities. No trial date has been set. She faces up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine if convicted on both counts.

In a motion in May to dismiss the charges, Dugan argued that the federal government violated Wisconsin’s sovereignty by disrupting a state courtroom and prosecuting a state judge.

Dugan also argued that the prosecution under federal law violated the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers because it overrides the state of Wisconsin’s ability to administer its courts.

The judge rejected her arguments.

Dugan is charged with concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.

Agents arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase.

Milwaukee police last week released body camera footage of Dugan saying she didn’t know Flores-Ruiz was in the country illegally. The comments were captured three days before her arrest after Dugan called police because of potentially threatening flyers she and family members had received.

The footage shows Dugan telling police that media reports had been swirling about how she supposedly “hid” Flores-Ruiz in her courtroom. She goes on to say she didn’t know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally, and she denied giving him special treatment.

“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers. She later said, “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

Dugan’s case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.

The Trump administration has unleashed a relentless, coordinated assault on immigrants – tearing families apart through mass deportations, jailing people in inhumane detention centers, and sending armed ICE agents into our schools, churches, and neighborhoods.

Now, they’re seeking to justify and cover up their harmful abuses with misinformation and lies — and it’s up to us to expose the truth.

See if you can dispel fact from fiction… because it’s up to each of us to know exactly what’s really happening.

Email Address

President Trump’s policies have resolved the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Fact

Fiction

Pure fiction! The situation at the U.S.-Mexico border has become an even bigger human rights disaster. While the Trump administration is communicating as if the border has been “handled,” this is far from the truth. Right now, approximately one-third of the entire U.S. southern border is a militarized zone. With the border closed, people are being deported or held in crowded detention centers.

The right to seek asylum in the U.S. no longer exists – meaning that people seeking safety are trapped with nowhere to go, or must return to the danger they fled.

Mass deportations are benefiting the U.S. economy.

Fact

Fiction

Fiction. Mass deportations are incredibly costly, and now funds and resources are being further expended to build horrific detention centers like “Alligator Alcataraz” and use military flights for deportations. The Trump administration’s cruel mass detention and deportation machine is now being supercharged with the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — which gives a $150 billion blank check to ICE and CBP.

Amnesty is doing research on the socioeconomic consequences of Trump’s new budget that will take away Medicaid and food assistance to pay for more cruel deportations.

The U.S. is able to bring back people who have been deported or expelled.

Fact

Fiction

This is a fact, despite what the administration has led us to believe! The Trump administration illegally expelled hundreds of men to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act — sending them to CECOT, a notoriously dangerous mega-prison with inhumane conditions. Many of these men had pending asylum cases in U.S. immigration court, and some had even been granted protection. We’ve learned that these men are still technically under the custody of the U.S. — and this administration has the power to bring them back. That’s why Amnesty continues to advocate in and out of Congress to urge the U.S. to bring back everyone who has been disappeared to CECOT, and it’s why we need your continued activism.

Watch this video before answering the below question.

ICE agents have the authority to enter private spaces without a warrant.

Fact

Fiction

Fiction – although it’s happening anyway, and in many instances, illegally. The Trump administration has emboldened domestic law enforcement agencies to participate in immigration enforcement, from local police to federal agencies like the FBI and DEA. Still, none of these agencies can legally enter private spaces without a warrant signed by a judge. Even as officers drive through immigrant communities in unmarked cars and raid schools and workplaces wearing masks, people still have rights.

There are “millions” of undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

Fact

Fiction

This is a fiction that President Trump has been repeating over and over to justify his mass deportation machine. Studies show that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. citizens. The Trump administration’s inflammatory and racist rhetoric is meant to dehumanize and criminalize our immigrant neighbors, friends, family members, and coworkers. It’s so important for our human rights movement to voice our opposition, defend everyone’s rights, and build true safety and power for our communities.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois says it would fight back in court if President Trump sends the National Guard into Chicago.

Trump has suggested he would send troops there to combat violent crime.

ACLU of Illinois spokesperson Ed Yohnka told IPM News Monday that if that happens, the organization would be closely watching the behavior of those troops.

“Who is it that they’re targeting? How are they doing it, and how are they behaving, Yohnka asked. “Are they using excessive force? Are they using racial profiling?”

He also said the ACLU would also sue on behalf of detained individuals to get them released.

The ACLU has been communicating with groups that serve immigrant and homeless people, who are particularly afraid after seeing videos of the National Guard’s activity in Washington DC, according to Yohnka.

Earlier Monday, President Trump hedged on the idea of sending troops to Chicago, saying he’d prefer to be invited by local officials. Both Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson say they have not requested federal troops.

Yohnka encouraged those feeling overwhelmed by federal policy changes to focus on local action such as speaking up at local meetings to joining library or school boards.

“I know it’s hard to keep up with all that’s happening at the federal level,” he added. “We’ve been encouraging folks to act as much as they can at the local level.”

ACLU fighting immigrant kid exclusion for Head Start

The ACLU of Illinois is involved in a lawsuit to keep Head Start open to all low-income children.

Head Start began 60 years ago as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty” to help children break the cycle of poverty with health screening, social services and education.

When a Republican Congress and then President Bill Clinton were reshaping welfare law in the 1990’s, the early education program was excluded from the changes. New provisions in the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act barred certain immigrants, including those without legal status and those who have applied but not received asylum from signing up for public benefits.

The Trump administration is now reinterpreting the law to apply to Head Start and other education programs.

“I’m thinking that if that’s what Newt Gingrich and the Republicans of the 1990’s meant, they would have said it, and I think he would have heard it again,” Yohnka said. “But apparently, Donald Trump and RFK Jr. are the people who’ve suddenly discovered this.”

The administration says the change would help protect the country’s resources. The rule is on hold until September 3, due to another lawsuit.",https://ipmnewsroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041625_KellyTownHall8_M.Piacente-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 17:56:48.791988

DACA Recipients Fear Losing Health Care Access, Annual Report Shows

One-third of respondents reported worsening health related to concerns about their immigration status

WASHINGTON – A report published today by the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) shows that an overwhelming majority of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients fear losing future access to health care services and many are experiencing worsening health due to concerns about their immigration status.

Concerns about access to health care likely stem from uncertainty around DACA’s future, as well as the Trump administration’s ending of the Biden-era policy allowing DACA recipients to purchase health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). A new Trump administration rule ending the Biden policy – which was a hard fought victory after years of advocacy – went into effect this week.

“All of us should be able to access affordable and reliable health care. Full stop,” said Isobel Mohyeddin, policy associate at the National Immigration Law Center. “After years of data showing DACA recipients are disproportionately uninsured, this year’s report shows that the uncertainty around DACA and narrowing options for recipients to access care have reverberating effects on both their physical and mental health. We demand the Trump administration to reverse its cruel and unnecessary ACA eligibility rule, and Congress must work to repeal health care restrictions for immigrants.”

This is the fourth annual report by NILC tracking DACA recipients’ access to health care. The report analyzes findings from a 2024 survey of 433 DACA recipients administered by Prof. Tom K. Wong of the University of California, San Diego; United We Dream; the National Immigration Law Center; and the Center for American Progress. Top line findings include:

92% of respondents say that without DACA, it will be harder to access services to keep themselves and their families healthy

1/3 of respondents experienced worsened mental or physical health related to concerns over their immigration status

43% of respondents skipped a recommended medical test or treatment because of the cost, while 45% reported skipping a recommended dental test or treatment for the same reason

28% of respondents reported taking on debt to cover the costs of a medical procedure

NILC formally opposed the Trump administration’s rule ending DACA recipients’ access to ACA coverage and urges the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reverse it. NILC also calls on Congress to repeal health care restrictions for immigrants passed in the latest federal budget bill and has long called for Congress to pass the Dream and Promise Act, which would provide the certainty and stability that DACA recipients need to truly achieve healthy lives.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old originally from El Salvador, handed himself into the ICE field office in Baltimore, Maryland, for a check-in on Monday.

The visit was a mandatory condition of his release from federal custody earlier this weekend. However, in a court filing on Saturday, his lawyers said they expected Garcia would be detained again upon attending.

Garcia is charged in an indictment, filed in federal court in Tennessee, with conspiring to transport illegal immigrants into the US.

According to a court filing by his lawyers, immigration officials made an offer to Garcia to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to the charges.

Otherwise, they would seek to deport him to Uganda.

Speaking at a news conference outside the ICE office on Monday morning, Garcia said via a translator: ""This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us.

""God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.""

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Garcia's lawyers, also said: ""There was no need to take him into ICE detention... the only reason they took him into detention was to punish him.""

A judge later ruled Garcia could not be deported after he filed a challenge asking to be allowed due process to fight any removal attempt.

Judge Paula Xinis ruled the 30-year-old must remain detained in the US until she can hold an evidentiary hearing - set for Wednesday.

She added there appeared to be ""several grounds"" for her to have jurisdiction to exercise relief, including that Uganda has not agreed to offer Garcia protections, such as being able to walk freely, being given refugee status, and not being re-deported to El Salvador.

After initially being detained in Maryland - where he lived with his American wife and children - by ICE in March, Garcia was sent to El Salvador, where he was then imprisoned in the country's maximum security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).

This was despite an immigration judge's 2019 order granting him protection from deportation after finding he was likely to be persecuted by local gangs if he was returned to his native country.

The Trump administration admitted deporting Garcia was an ""administrative error"", but said at the time they could not bring him back as they do not have jurisdiction over El Salvador.

After eventually returning him to the US in June, the Trump administration detained Garcia on criminal charges that were filed in May.

The criminal indictment alleges Garcia worked with at least five co-conspirators to bring immigrants to the US illegally and transport them from the border to other destinations in the country.

Minutes after his release on Friday, officials notified Garcia they intended to deport him to Uganda.

Human rights groups and immigration advocates continue to raise concerns over tactics used by federal agents during its operations.

During Monday's interview, Bovino discussed agents not wearing uniforms during operations and the use of face masks.

""We have a multitude of law enforcement missions to carry out,"" he said. ""Our functions here in Los Angeles and nationwide, whether it's on the border or here in Los Angeles, you see that exact same thing.""

Trump defends crime crackdown: 'I'm not a dictator'

Meantime, Trump, at his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, touted his record on crime amid his federal takeover of Washington and threats to do the same in other major cities.

""The line is that I'm a dictator, but I stop crime. So a lot of people say, 'You know, if that's the case, I'd rather have a dictator,'"" he said. ""But I'm not a dictator. I just know how to stop crime.""

Trump said the same on Monday, as he discussed how he would prefer local officials to request his help as he discussed the possibility of ordering the National Guard to Chicago.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, in a press conference on Monday responding to Trump's threat, said that the president and the White House are trying to terrorize Democratic-run cities and states through the threat of unwarranted crackdowns.

""This is not about fighting crime. This is about Donald Trump searching for any justification to deploy the military in a blue city, in a blue state, to try and intimidate his political rivals,"" Pritzker said, flanked by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and a wide array of Chicago and Illinois elected officials and residents.

“To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote.
“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Cullen wrote.

Judicial Immunity Cullen found the administration lacked standing to bring the suit, saying that Supreme Court case law prevented him from issuing an injunction against a judge.","A federal judge has dismissed the Justice Department’s lawsuit against the US district judges of Maryland over a standing order that blocked the immediate deportation of some detained persons.

US District Judge Thomas Cullen, who President Donald Trump appointed during his first term, said Tuesday past rulings lead to the conclusion that he has no choice but to dismiss the case.

“To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote.

He also said the lawsuit is “not ordinary” and that the executive branch must find other paths to raise its concerns with the standing order. He said the courts and the executive branch are each part of the sovereign US government.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches—and the public officials who serve in them—share the same core sovereign interest: To support and defend the Constitution.”

A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t immediately return a request for comment. The department filed a notice of appeal.

Deportation Fights

The Trump administration filed the suit in June against the court over a standing order that blocked for two business days the deportations of detained persons who filed habeas petitions.

The order was issued amid the administration’s crackdown on immigration enforcement, and a Maryland US district judge’s handling of a lawsuit from a wrongly deported Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

The administration initially said it couldn’t return Garcia after he was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite an earlier immigration court ruling against his removal. But he was brought back to the United States to face federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee, which he’s pleaded not guilty to. Abrego Garcia was again taken into custody by immigration officials on Monday, and is seeking to block any deportation.

Cullen said he can “appreciate” the administration’s concern that the Maryland court “encroached on its duty to police core matters of immigration.”

But he said a dispute between the judiciary should be “resolved within the constitutional structure and with due respect for the Judiciary’s co-equal standing with the executive branch,” and that he has to first ensure he has the constitutional authority to preside over the lawsuit. “In so doing, the court’s allegiance is to the Constitution,” Cullen wrote.

Judicial Immunity

Cullen found the administration lacked standing to bring the suit, saying that Supreme Court case law prevented him from issuing an injunction against a judge.

He also said the district court has sovereign immunity from the case, and that the individual judges and court officials named in the litigation have judicial immunity because it was tied to an act done in their “judicial function.”

Cullen further found there was no cause of action that allowed him to hear the lawsuit between the two branches, “and this court will not be the first to create one.”

He said the administration could’ve challenged the standing order at the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, or by petitioning the Fourth Circuit’s Judicial Council.

“The Executive acknowledges these routes are available, but it claims it chose an interbranch lawsuit because those routes are inconvenient,” Cullen wrote. “This purported inconvenience does not warrant the judicial branch’s infringement on the legislative branch’s prerogative of deciding the scope of cases federal courts may review.”

‘Not Normal Times’

The unprecedented litigation came as the administration has assailed judges who’ve ruled against its policies, with Trump even calling for impeachment and some House Republican allies filing articles of impeachment against some jurists. Chief Justice John Roberts and other top federal judges have pushed back against the use of impeachment as a response to unfavorable court rulings.

Cullen referenced the harsh rhetoric in his opinion, saying the “concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.”

He said that typically, the administration could’ve raised its challenged under other options laid out by Congress.

“But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times—at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,” Cullen wrote, referring to the courts. “It’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/0e9cbce/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F3a%2Fd4feebac4c4bb995f95b5fb23ec3%2Fjustice-sarah-silbiger.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 18:57:02.476889

In response to the letter, FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues said the Department of Homeland Security is ""committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people.""
""The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,"" Llargues said.
In June, Mr. Trump said he's looking to ""wean"" states off of FEMA.","A group of current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency officials warned Congress on Monday that the Trump administration's sweeping changes to the disaster relief agency could reverse decades of reforms made after Hurricane Katrina.

The open letter was released as the U.S. this week marks 20 years since Katrina's 2005 landfall — sparking one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, with more than 1,800 deaths and over $200 billion in damage in today's dollars.

The letter argues the Trump administration — which has sought to dramatically shrink FEMA and floated scrapping the agency altogether — had made decisions that ""hinder the swift execution of our mission."" It states that a change in course is necessary to ""prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.""

Released by the advocacy group Stand Up for Science, the ""Katrina Declaration"" says it has 181 signatories. Only 35 people signed their names to the letter, with the rest opting for anonymity due to ""the culture of fear and suppression cultivated by this administration.""

It's addressed to several congressional committees and the FEMA Review Council, which was formed by President Trump earlier this year.

The declaration alleges that Mr. Trump's picks to lead FEMA ""lack proper qualifications,"" and decries the Trump administration for cutting FEMA's staff.

""Since January 2025, FEMA has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a FEMA Administrator,"" the open letter reads.

It also castigates FEMA for terminating grants meant to help state and local governments prepare their infrastructures to withstand natural disasters and extreme weather. Two-thirds of the counties that have received those grants voted for Mr. Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris, a CBS News investigation found earlier this year. A federal judge blocked cuts to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program earlier this month.

In response to the letter, FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues said the Department of Homeland Security is ""committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people."" He said the agency has been ""bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes,"" and defended the Trump administration's handling of natural disasters so far this year.

""The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,"" Llargues said. ""It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.""

FEMA has faced months of upheaval since Mr. Trump's return to office.

Days after his inauguration, the president floated either ""getting rid of FEMA"" or ""fundamentally reforming and overhauling"" the agency, casting it as overly bureaucratic and arguing that state and local governments should take on a larger role in managing natural disasters. In June, Mr. Trump said he's looking to ""wean"" states off of FEMA.

The White House has proposed cutting FEMA's budget for non-disaster grants by $646 million in the next fiscal year. The Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a $36.2 billion budget for FEMA, up from $33.1 billion in the fiscal year 2025 budget.

So far this year, FEMA has lost about one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and buyouts, and the administration has overhauled the contract renewal system for more than two-thirds of FEMA's workforce, CBS News has previously reported.

The agency has had two acting leaders since Mr. Trump returned to office. Christopher Hamilton led the agency until May, when he was fired after saying he didn't support eliminating FEMA.

A lawyer representing Ms. Cook said he was readying a lawsuit to challenge the firing.
He called on her to resign, prompting Mr. Trump to say that he would fire her if she did not.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Mr. Trump that the change was “coming soon.” In June, Mr. Trump claimed that the title of war secretary had been changed to defense secretary to be more politically correct.
Social Security data is highly sought after by criminals and foreign governments, who can use the information for identity theft or to gather intelligence.","That crackdown appears to have now ensnared a different member of the Federal Reserve Board, Lisa Cook. On Monday evening, President Trump fired Ms. Cook because of allegations that she falsified records to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage, a step that could give him greater control over the central bank.

After Mr. Trump announced that Ms. Cook was fired, Mr. Pulte celebrated on social media.

“Thank you President Trump for your commitment to stopping mortgage fraud and following the law,” Mr. Pulte wrote on X. “If you commit mortgage fraud in America, we will come after you, no matter who you are.”

Mr. Pulte, who has more than three million followers on social media, has used his position at the housing finance agency to attack and investigate Mr. Trump’s political enemies. He has accused Mr. Powell of mismanaging the renovation of the Fed’s headquarters and initiated mortgage fraud investigations into Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who prosecuted Mr. Trump and his companies, and Senator Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the effort to impeach Mr. Trump during his first term.

Then he seized on Ms. Cook.

Last week, Mr. Pulte posted images of her signatures that appeared to show that she improperly designated both a condominium in Atlanta and a home in Ann Arbor, Mich., as her primary residence when taking out loans. In doing so, Mr. Pulte said, Ms. Cook appeared to have “falsified bank documents and property records” that could have allowed her to obtain lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms.

“When someone commits mortgage fraud, they undermine the faith and integrity of our System,” Mr. Pulte wrote on X, adding that he was referring the case to the Department of Justice.

Ms. Cook said she would not step down from the central bank’s board, saying that “no cause exists under the law” for Mr. Trump to fire her. A lawyer representing Ms. Cook said he was readying a lawsuit to challenge the firing. She has not been charged with a crime.

Before Mr. Trump fired her, Ms. Cook had issued a brief statement saying she had “no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.” Ms. Cook added that she took “questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve, and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”

The claims against Ms. Cook come as Mr. Trump has railed against the central bank for being slow to cut interest rates and has looked to staff the central bank with loyalists. He has already picked Stephen Miran, a top economic adviser, to fill a seat that recently opened up after another governor, Adriana Kugler, left her post months before her term was up.

Mortgage occupancy fraud can be used to help buyers get lower interest rates or down payments when purchasing a home. According to Cotality, a real estate data provider, mortgage fraud increased slightly in the second quarter of 2025, but just 0.86 percent of all mortgage applications contained fraud.

A 2023 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that on average, between 2 and 3 percent of borrowers misrepresent their occupancy status when applying for a mortgage, though it was significantly higher during the run-up to the financial crisis. Most cases of occupancy fraud are uncovered when a borrower defaults on a mortgage, and it tends to be more common with investor-owned homes.

The role of director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency is usually a low-profile one, but that has not been the case for Mr. Pulte, who has transformed the agency into a weapon for Mr. Trump.

Mr. Pulte, 37, came to run the housing agency with little housing policy experience. A grandson of William Pulte, who was the founder of PulteGroup, one of the largest American home builders, he did not play an active role at the company, though he did serve as a board member from 2016 to 2020.

Before being tapped by Mr. Trump to run housing agency, Mr. Pulte was best known for running his own investment firm and helping to clean up blighted homes in Detroit — not far from where PulteGroup got its start.

His main job as the agency’s director is overseeing the government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are the twin engines that drive the nation’s housing market. Fannie and Freddie have been under government control since the federal government had to bail them out during the 2008 financial crisis to prevent an even greater collapse of the housing market.

Even though the companies are controlled by the government, they operate quasi-independently. But one of the first things Mr. Pulte did was to name himself as chairman of the boards of both companies and oust a number of board members.

In a post on Sunday, Mr. Pulte said reducing fraud was critical to improving the mortgage firms.

“Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are getting stronger each and every day,” Mr. Pulte wrote. “And once we eliminate mortgage fraud, will be even stronger!”

On Monday, he reposted copies of Mr. Trump’s firing letter and hailed the president for becoming the first to ever remove a Federal Reserve governor. He also issued an ominous warning about Ms. Cook’s potential legal fate.

“Mortgage fraud can carry up to 30 years in prison,” Mr. Pulte said.

Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting from New York.

The emerging legal clash threatened to compromise the independence and integrity of the nation’s central bank, a powerful institution at the heart of the economy whose responsibilities are to keep prices stable and the labor market strong. The Fed is supposed to be insulated from the pressures of politics, but Mr. Trump has unleashed an unprecedented string of attacks on its members, all in the hopes of getting them to lower interest rates.

“She can’t have an infraction, especially that infraction,” Mr. Trump said at a meeting of his cabinet, referring to the allegations against Ms. Cook.

“We need people that are 100 percent above board, and it doesn’t seem like she was,” he added, highlighting the fact that he might have a “majority very shortly” at the Fed.

Mr. Trump announced his decision to fire Ms. Cook in a note posted late Monday to social media. The president justified his actions by pointing to a provision in the Fed’s founding statute that allows him to dismiss a board member if he can identify sufficient cause, which is generally understood to mean negligence or malfeasance.

But Ms. Cook’s lawyer, Abbe David Lowell, later said in a statement that the president’s “attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis.” While Mr. Lowell did not elaborate, his comment appeared to echo the myriad issues raised by legal experts, who contend that Mr. Trump has not met the burden under law to warrant a firing — and did not provide Ms. Cook sufficient opportunity to respond.

“We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,” Mr. Lowell said.

Mr. Trump’s attempts to remove Ms. Cook quickly infuriated congressional Democrats, who assailed the president for an abuse of power. The Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday specifically rebuked the White House for engaging in a “racist, misogynistic, and unlawful attack on the integrity and independence” of the central bank.

But the president and his aides appeared unfazed by the criticisms on a day when markets reacted little to the news.

Mr. Trump at one point suggested that he was already considering a replacement for Ms. Cook, even before a legal challenge over her firing was resolved. The president appeared to be referring to Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, whom Mr. Trump previously announced as a replacement for Adriana Kugler, who resigned from the Fed months before the end of her term. Mr. Miran has not been confirmed by the Senate for the role.

Still, much remained uncertain in the immediate aftermath of Mr. Trump’s move to fire Ms. Cook, who has not yet filed her lawsuit. The Justice Department, for its part, declined to comment Tuesday on if or when it would file any charges against the Fed governor, even though the president maintained this week that the accusations of mortgage fraud were sufficient enough “to remove” Ms. Cook from her position.

The Fed, for its part, took no identifiable stance on Tuesday either on the legality of the president’s actions or the allegations levied against Ms. Cook. In its first public comments since the president’s late-night missive, a Fed spokesperson said the central bank would “abide by any court decision.”

“Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “The Federal Reserve will continue to carry out its duties as established by law.”

The allegations against Ms. Cook originated with Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has joined with Mr. Trump in repeatedly savaging the Fed and its members for keeping interest rates steady.

Last week, Mr. Pulte said he had obtained documents showing that Ms. Cook represented two different homes as her primary residence, claiming that she falsified those records to obtain more favorable terms on her mortgages. He called on her to resign, prompting Mr. Trump to say that he would fire her if she did not.

The allegations were only the latest instance in which Mr. Trump and Mr. Pulte have sought to weaponize the instruments of government against the president’s perceived political enemies. They have also attacked Mr. Powell, claiming he is responsible for a cost overrun in the ongoing renovations at the central bank, and Mr. Pulte at one point urged the president privately to fire the Fed chairman.

With Ms. Cook, Mr. Pulte soon referred the allegations to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation, as he dangled the possibility of a prison sentence and called on her to resign.

Ms. Cook resisted those calls, saying in an initial statement that she had “no intention of being bullied” as she pledged to gather “accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.” But Mr. Trump then issued an ultimatum, promising to fire her if she did not depart on her own.

The president acted on that late Monday, writing in a letter posted to social media that Ms. Cook’s actions had compromised her ability to serve as a financial regulator.

“The Federal Reserve has tremendous responsibility for setting interest rates and regulating reserve and member banks,” Mr. Trump said. “The American people must be able to have full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve. In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.”

Appearing early Tuesday on CNBC, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, attacked Ms. Cook as a “crook,” despite at one point acknowledging that the administration possessed only allegations of wrongdoing.

“The crook always says I’m not going anywhere, and why would anybody defend that?” Mr. Lutnick said. “The real question should be, did she commit mortgage fraud, yes or no, and if you did commit mortgage fraud, please get out of the federal government, get out of the seat of the governor of the Federal Reserve and go away.”

What did Mr. Trump say about the name?

At an event in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said the name War Department “just sounded better,” adding, “I think we’re going to have to go back to that.” He said it was a reminder of the country’s record of victories in conflicts under the old name, citing World Wars I and II. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Mr. Trump that the change was “coming soon.”

In June, Mr. Trump claimed that the title of war secretary had been changed to defense secretary to be more politically correct. The next month, in a post on Truth Social praising Mr. Hegseth, the president called him the “Secretary of War.” The president and Mr. Hegseth have been eager to promote a more aggressive image of the military and cut back on rules that restrict its operations.

What’s the history of the name?

George Washington established the War Department in August 1789, just months after the Constitution was ratified and he became the first president. The department oversaw the new nation’s military forces. Its first secretary was Henry Knox, who had served as a commander during the Revolutionary War and had, since 1785, been the war secretary under the Articles of Confederation, an early agreement among the colonial states.

The name was retained for more than 150 years, during which time the United States fought wars against Britain, Spain, Mexico and the Philippines, as well as the Civil War. It also fought wars against Native Americans.

The United States entered World War I in 1917 and, after the attack on the U.S. base at Pearl Harbor in 1941, joined World War II on the side of the Allied powers.

Why was the name changed to the Defense Department?

According to the Truman Library Institute, President Harry S. Truman changed the name as part of the National Security Act he signed in 1947, a time when the United States was the world’s only nuclear power and the Cold War was just starting.

The law merged the Navy and War departments and a newly independent Air Force into a single organization called the National Military Establishment, under a civilian secretary of defense who also oversaw the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Two years later, Congress amended the National Security Act, and the National Military Establishment was renamed the Defense Department. Since then it has overseen wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Richard H. Kohn, a professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who specializes in military history, said the name change in 1949 reflected the department’s expanded duties, which included war fighting, foreign policy, intelligence and, above all, national security.

In a nascent nuclear age, the new name also reflected an emphasis on avoiding war, Professor Kohn said.

“The decision was definitely not about political correctness,” he said. “It was to communicate to America’s adversaries and the rest of the world that America was not about making war but defending the United States, and saying that if that requires war, there are four major armed services.”

Does Mr. Trump have the power to change the department’s name?

The president cannot easily alter the Defense Department’s name or Mr. Hegseth’s title, according to Jamal Greene, a professor at Columbia Law School.

“The president can call the department whatever he wants in informal communication, but the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Defense were so named through acts of Congress, and I am unaware of any legal authority for the president to change those names by executive fiat,” Professor Greene said.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order in January directing the federal government to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, saying that the name had a “beautiful ring.” As president, Mr. Trump has the power to order changes to geographical names as they are used in the United States.

Experts said the change in the gulf’s name put Democrats in an awkward position, since to contest it could be viewed as unpatriotic. A similar dynamic could be at play if the White House tried to revert to the name War Department.

The Defense Department referred questions about the issue to the White House.

Judge Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump, went out of his way to describe the complaint as extremely unusual, offering his own role in the case as a prime example of its unorthodox nature. Because the suit was filed against the state’s entire federal bench, all of the district judges there were forced to recuse themselves and Judge Cullen had to be brought in from his home courthouse in Roanoke, Va., to preside over the case.

Moreover, he used the ruling to take Mr. Trump and some of his top aides to task for having repeatedly attacked other judges who have dared to rule against the White House in a flurry of cases challenging aspects of its political agenda.

“Over the past several months, principal officers of the executive (and their spokespersons) have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘activists,’ ‘radical,’ ‘politically minded,’ ‘rogue,’ ‘unhinged,’ ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional, [c]rooked,’ and worse,” Judge Cullen wrote.

“Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,” he concluded.

Judge Cullen’s plaintive criticism of the Trump administration’s assaults on the judiciary was in many ways reminiscent of a ruling issued in April by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit — for which he once served as a clerk — in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the immigrant from Maryland who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador.

The ruling was written by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, an icon of the conservative legal movement, who expressed deep concerns about the executive and judicial branches “grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.”

“We yet cling to the hope,” Judge Wilkinson wrote, “that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the executive branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.”

The case in front of Judge Cullen began in June when the Trump administration filed suit challenging a standing order put in place the month before. The order said that immigrants who sought to contest their removal from the country in the Maryland federal courts by filing what is known as a habeas petition would automatically be granted a two-day reprieve from being expelled.

The order was intended to give judges time to sort through the complicated legal issues in a flurry of fast-paced cases being filed in Maryland contesting the White House’s aggressive deportation policies. The most prominent of those was a lawsuit brought in March by Mr. Abrego Garcia.

Judge Cullen pointed out in his ruling that the White House took “umbrage” with the standing order because Trump officials believed it hindered their ability “to police immigration matters and enforce the nation’s immigration laws.”

He admitted that such arguments might have gotten “traction” if the administration had made them “in the proper forum.” Trump officials, he said, could have appealed any individual cases where the standing order had actually slowed down an immigrant’s removal or could have contested the underlying validity of the blanket rule in front of the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify such measures.

But instead, Judge Cullen maintained, the administration “chose a different, and more confrontational, path.”

“The executive decided to sue,” he wrote, “and in a big way.”

In dismissing the lawsuit, Judge Cullen agreed with almost all of the arguments put forward at a hearing two weeks ago by a lawyer for the judges, Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases in front of the Supreme Court.

The judge found that the defendants, as federal jurists, were immune from being sued and that the administration’s suit essentially violated the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution by having the executive branch attempt legal action against the judicial branch.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Judge Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches — and the public officials who serve in them — share the same core sovereign interest: to support and defend the Constitution.”

It is not the most likely of crime-busting outfits to take to the streets of Washington. The agency specializes in tasks involving global diplomacy, such as providing protection for the secretary of state and senior aides, conducting background security checks of State Department employees and potential hires, and helping secure U.S. embassies and consulates.

But its officers are now doing beat-cop work in Washington. They are deployed in the city alongside police officers and other federal agents in what President Trump says is a crackdown on crime. Many residents call it theatrical nonsense aimed at scoring political points with voters who know little about Washington.

At least one diplomatic security officer played a leading role in the nighttime arrest on Aug. 19 of Mark Bigelow, 28, a part-time delivery driver for Amazon who was arrested on a charge of having an open container of alcohol, which was in a van.

A diplomatic security officer, Adam Kapettanis, worked with counterparts from other agencies to try putting a handcuffed Mr. Bigelow into a law enforcement vehicle, but Mr. Bigelow resisted, according to an F.B.I. agent’s affidavit in court documents. Mr. Bigelow kicked Mr. Kapettanis in the leg, the text said, citing that as an element in charging Mr. Bigelow with resisting and assaulting federal officers, which carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison.

Elizabeth Mullin, a federal public defender representing Mr. Bigelow, told the court that Mr. Bigelow “was caught up in this federal occupation of D.C.” — a reference to Mr. Trump’s new policy — and that “this was a case created by federal law enforcement.”

When asked on Monday whether the Diplomatic Security Service was playing a role in Mr. Trump’s actions on Washington, the State Department said in a statement to The New York Times that the security service was “actively partnering with the Metropolitan Police Department and other law enforcement to provide interagency support in the ongoing mission to deter and reduce crime in the District of Columbia.”

It added that “consistent with standard practice, D.S.S. routinely assesses its priorities and job functions based on the administration’s strategic interests, while maintaining our mission to lead worldwide security and law enforcement efforts, and to protect State Department people, property and information in 170+ countries and 30+ U.S. cities.”

At least one federal judge in Washington has expressed anger at the overreach by federal agents in the arrests they have been making in Washington.

The State Department’s security service has also been working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in American cities to try to detain noncitizens and deport them. In February, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, deputized up to 600 diplomatic security agents to help with “arresting and deporting illegal immigrants.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has tried to help deport noncitizens who are in the country legally, most notably people who have expressed pro-Palestinian points of view. Federal judges have rebuked him for trying to strip away green cards and visas of people for expressing political opinions, and have ordered those detainees to be released.

The Diplomatic Security Service has more than 2,500 employees worldwide, according to the State Department website. A history page has details on precursor outfits from the American Revolution to the early 20th century. The modern service was established after World War II, as the United States embraced its superpower status, and eventually expanded its duties to include counterespionage, counterterrorism and protecting top foreign officials visiting the United States. Its officers can carry firearms.

A government document from 2009 quoted a Justice Department official saying diplomatic security officers can make arrests based on visa and passport fraud charges.

The service’s operations sometimes come under criticism from other State Department employees. For instance, some Asian American diplomats have accused officers in the unit of unfairly suspecting diplomats with that ethnic background of being potential espionage threats. The service has denied that ethnicity plays a role in its determinations.

No Democrat has won a U.S. House seat in Utah since 2018.

The ruling, which can be appealed, creates an opportunity for a new map that could help Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans will be fighting to hold onto their slim House majority.

It also makes Utah the latest battleground in a national fight over redistricting, as President Trump urges Republican officials to redo congressional maps in his party’s favor. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott is expected soon to sign into law a redrawn map that would deliver up to five House seats to Republicans, prompting Democrats in California to counter with their own new maps designed to offset those potential losses.

The decision in Utah came after the state’s Supreme Court said in July that the legislature had likely violated the state’s Constitution when it repealed a voter-approved measure known as Proposition Four, which required independent oversight of the redistricting process and forbade partisan gerrymandering.

In the judgment, issued on Monday, District Court Judge Dianna M. Gibson said Utah legislators were wrong to redraw the state’s boundaries without adhering to Proposition Four, and that the resulting map violated voters’ constitutional rights to participate in government.

The state’s current congressional map “is the fruit of that unlawful repeal, an extension of the very constitutional violation that tainted the process from the start,” Judge Gibson wrote.

Utah’s Republican legislature had argued that Proposition Four improperly impeded the government’s functioning and inserted voters into the redistricting process, which it said was solely the legislature’s responsibility.

Judge Gibson disagreed, saying voters needed a way to participate in redistricting efforts.

“How district lines are drawn can either safeguard representation and ensure accountability by elected representatives or erode public trust, silence voices and weaken the rule of law,” the judge wrote, calling it “among the most critical responsibilities of our government.”

Utah’s current congressional map, which was adopted in 2021 after lawmakers overruled the suggestions of an advisory board, was in place for the 2022 and 2024 election cycles. Judge Gibson wrote that state officials should urgently redraw the map for the 2026 cycle in a way that meets the requirements of Proposition Four.

Her order gives the legislature 30 days to submit a redrawn map to the court. Republican officials can appeal the ruling, which could delay the timeline and keep the current map in place.

Robert Axson, chairman of the Utah Republican Party, in a statement criticized the ruling as an overreach.

“Once again, certain members of Utah’s judiciary abandon the principles of our Constitutional Republic. Using earlier flawed rulings to justify their opinions over the principles of our founding is a special kind of hubris,” the statement said.

Members of Utah’s Democratic Party applauded the decision. State Sen. Nate Blouin, who represents Utah’s 13th State Senate District, which encompasses parts of Salt Lake City, said that Democratic lawmakers were expecting challenges from Republicans.

“Utah voters got a big win tonight,” he said. “Needless to say, the supermajority will fight back hard and seek to delay us.”

On Monday, Mr. Smith’s legal team sent a letter to the Office of Special Counsel, which has no affiliation with Mr. Smith’s former position. The Office of Special Counsel conducts ethics investigations of government employees, primarily into whether people have violated the Hatch Act, which bars federal workers from using their jobs to work on behalf of a political campaign.

Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, persuaded the agency to investigate whether Mr. Smith, in seeking to quickly bring Mr. Trump to trial, violated the law. Mr. Smith’s conduct, he claimed, appeared “to have no rationale except for an attempt to affect the 2024 election results.”

Mr. Smith and his lawyers, Lanny A. Breuer and Peter Koski, fired back in a three-page letter to the acting special counsel, Jamieson Greer.

“The predicate for this investigation is imaginary and unfounded,” the lawyers wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The New York Times. “Mr. Smith followed well-established legal principles in conducting the investigations into President Trump, and the courts presiding over the resulting prosecutions have already rejected the spurious allegations that the manner in which Mr. Smith prosecuted these cases was somehow improper.”

The letter also noted that while Mr. Greer’s office had publicly confirmed it had opened an investigation, neither Mr. Smith nor his lawyers had received any inquiries from the Office of Special Counsel. A representative for the Office of Special Counsel declined to comment.

Mr. Smith’s lawyers wrote that they “welcome the opportunity to engage with your office and are confident that as you become familiar with the facts and the record, you will conclude that there is no basis to find a violation of the Hatch Act and that these allegations are wholly without merit.”

Mr. Smith, they said, is “a prosecutor who has devoted his career to following the facts and the law, without fear or favor and without regard for the political consequences, not because of them.”

Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as the chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said the argument for a Hatch Act investigation made little sense.

“I just don’t see how this comes anywhere close to a Hatch Act violation,” he said. “If Smith had made public statements shortly before the election about the filings, we would have an issue that would need to be addressed. Or if he’d written Congress, it would need to be addressed. I see no evidence that Jack Smith did anything of the kind. He simply filed pleadings with the court, and the pleadings were accepted by the courts.”

The Trump administration has taken a host of measures meant to punish his perceived enemies, firing many of the people who worked for Mr. Smith, including paralegals and office support staff, and even attacking the law firm representing Mr. Smith by issuing an executive memorandum seeking to strip it of any government business. He has also forced out F.B.I. agents and executives and demoted or reassigned a wide swath of senior Justice Department officials whom Mr. Trump and his top aides do not trust.

In firing scores of law enforcement officials based solely on Mr. Trump’s expansive claim of executive power, the administration has flouted longstanding civil service laws meant to ensure the public receives professional services from government agencies. Many of those fired individuals have sued, but the cases are moving slowly through the courts.

Mr. Smith’s lawyers argued that an ethics investigation by the Office of Special Counsel into how Justice Department prosecutors handled their court cases would radically misuse a longstanding ethics law and interfere with how the federal government investigates corruption.

“This investigation is premised on a partisan complaint that suggests the ordinary operation of the criminal justice system should be disrupted by the whims of a political contest,” the lawyers wrote. “But the notion that justice should yield to politics is antithetical to the rule of law.”

They also urged the Office of Special Counsel not to reach a conclusion without engaging with Mr. Smith’s lawyers.

“In light of the unprecedented nature of this investigation, if you intend to go forward with this in any way, we insist that you engage with us so that any finding by the Office of Special Counsel is fully informed by the record,” they wrote. A fair review of the facts and law, they said “will compel the inescapable conclusion that the prosecutions brought by Mr. Smith were handled in an entirely lawful and appropriate manner.”

“Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology,” he posted on Truth Social, opening a new and potentially contentious chapter in the world’s continuing trade fight.

The post does not call out the European Union specifically, but Mr. Trump and other key administration officials have made it clear for months that they are unhappy with how the 27-nation bloc treats big American technology companies including X and Meta.

Republicans including Vice President JD Vance have criticized an E.U. law, the Digital Services Act, that requires social media companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illegal content and disinformation. Mr. Vance and other officials argue that the law places as an unfair burden on American platforms and undercuts free speech.

This month, Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state, instructed American diplomats to lobby against the rules. And on Monday, Reuters reported that the administration was contemplating sanctions against E.U. officials who were responsible for enacting the key digital regulation.

The social media rules are not the only European technology policy that has provoked the Trump administration. American officials and technology companies have also been critical of the Digital Markets Act, which is meant to prevent large technology platforms from abusing the power that their size gives them. And some European nations have digital services taxes.

The question is whether the European Union will be able to remain unbending when it comes to technology regulation.

Mr. Trump’s outburst comes at a sensitive moment in America’s relationship with the European Union. The two trading partners just last week published the text of a trade deal that they had been working to complete.

The agreement would apply 15 percent across-the-board tariffs on most E.U. exports to the United States, which will be costly for producers across the continent. But it did not seriously weaken digital regulation, which Europeans had greeted as a major victory.

But the deal is not final. The text itself is not legally binding, and even once the agreement is put in place, officials have indicated that it is only a first step. Both sides could bring forward additional asks.

Europeans have suggested that they plan to continue pushing for exemptions for products like wine and spirits. And it is becoming increasingly clear that Americans will continue pushing for a loosening of technology rules.

“All it takes is a single tweet from Trump to suggest that the joint statement isn’t worth the paper it’s written on,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a research consultancy. “Both countries and the E.U.-level are at risk.”

Around the world, tech firms have faced scrutiny for not doing enough to stop the spread of disinformation, engaging in anticompetitive business practices and not paying their fair share of taxes in the countries where they operate.

Mr. Trump’s threat shows his close ties to the U.S. tech industry and willingness to defend its interests abroad. Over the past several years, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, the European Union and others have proposed or adopted laws, regulations and tax policies focused on the tech sector.

The trade measures the president is warning of could be painful for the European Union. Restrictions on computer chip exports, for instance, would harm efforts in Europe and elsewhere to build massive data centers for developing the technology.

Asked about Mr. Trump’s post at a news conference on Tuesday, Paula Pinho, an E.U. spokeswoman, declined to comment in detail on hypothetical measures. But Thomas Regnier, an E.U. spokesman, pointed out that the bloc’s digital regulations did not specifically target American companies, but applied to firms from all over the world.

The stakes are high for Europe. Officials here have long made it clear that they see their regulations as a matter of national sovereignty. Given that, bending to Mr. Trump would amount to allowing the United States to write Europe’s rules.

But E.U. officials have already made major concessions to appease Mr. Trump, accepting higher tariffs on key exports ranging from cars to medicine while promising to make major investment in American technology and energy. The trade deal has been widely greeted as a capitulation on Europe’s part.

The bloc did not have had much of a choice, however.

Although its member states are moving rapidly to increase their own defense outlays and to diversify their customer base away from the United States, the bloc is for now both militarily and economically closely intertwined with America.

Given that, Europe’s leaders have been left trying to appease Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump himself on Monday underscored the tone of recent deliberations, claiming to reporters that “they call me the president of Europe.”

The account by the whistle-blower, Charles Borges, underscores concerns that have led to lawsuits seeking to block young software engineers at the agency built by Elon Musk from having access to confidential government data. In his complaint, Mr. Borges said DOGE members copied the data to an internal agency server that only DOGE could access, forgoing the type of “independent security monitoring” normally required under agency policy for such sensitive data and creating “enormous vulnerabilities.”

Mr. Borges did not indicate that the database had been breached or used inappropriately.

But his disclosure stated that as of late June, “no verified audit or oversight mechanisms” existed to monitor what DOGE was using the data for or whether it was being shared outside the agency. That kind of oversight would typically be provided by the agency’s career information security professionals, Mr. Borges said in his account.

And his complaint cites an official agency security assessment that described the project as “high risk” and that warned of “catastrophic impact” to Social Security beneficiaries and programs if the database were to be compromised.

“Should bad actors gain access to this cloud environment, Americans may be susceptible to widespread identity theft, may lose vital health care and food benefits, and the government may be responsible for reissuing every American a new Social Security number at great cost,” Mr. Borges’s complaint said. He alleged that DOGE did not involve him in discussions about the project, despite his role as chief data officer, leaving him to piece together evidence of what had happened after the fact.

Included in his account, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, are more than two dozen pages of internal emails, memos and other records to document his claims. Mr. Borges’s complaint said that DOGE’s actions “potentially violated multiple federal statutes” designed to protect government data.

Lawyers at the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower protection group, filed Mr. Borges’s account on Tuesday with the Office of Special Counsel as well as with congressional lawmakers. Mr. Borges, 49, joined the Social Security Administration in January after working for more than three years at other government agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and serving 22 years in the Navy, according to his complaint. His lawyers declined to make him available for an interview with The Times.

A spokesman for the Social Security Administration, Nick Perrine, said that the agency took whistle-blower complaints seriously.

“S.S.A. stores all personal data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information,” he said. “The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a longstanding environment used by S.S.A. and walled off from the internet. High-level career S.S.A. officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by S.S.A.’s information security team.”

Mr. Perrine added that the agency was “not aware of any compromise to this environment” and remained “dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data.”

A White House spokeswoman referred questions to the Social Security Administration.

The complaint includes documents showing that DOGE leaders sought to upload the data despite warnings that they could be exposing Americans’ personal information. The documents do not reveal why DOGE pushed for the project, although Mr. Borges said he was later told that the reason was to improve the way the agency exchanged data with other parts of government.

“I have determined the business need is higher than the security risk associated with this implementation and I accept all risks,” wrote Aram Moghaddassi, who worked at two of Mr. Musk’s companies, X and Neuralink, before becoming Social Security’s chief information officer, in a July 15 memo.

Mr. Moghaddassi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

DOGE’s access to Social Security data became one of the earliest flash points in Mr. Musk’s contentious spell in Washington. The billionaire and his allies pushed for DOGE to have unfettered access to the agency’s data, which is strictly protected under federal law, ousting career officials who stood in their way. Mr. Musk advanced false claims of widespread fraud at Social Security to justify the urgency of DOGE’s work.

Privacy advocates and Democrats warned that the confidentiality of Americans’ personal information might be at risk. Social Security data is highly sought after by criminals and foreign governments, who can use the information for identity theft or to gather intelligence. A federal judge temporarily blocked DOGE’s access to sensitive Social Security data in March, but the Supreme Court overruled that decision on June 6.

The agency has also shared data with immigration authorities, as President Trump seeks to carry out his mass deportation agenda.

Although Mr. Musk and many of his allies left Washington after the billionaire fell out with Mr. Trump in May, members of DOGE have continued to occupy key roles in the federal bureaucracy, including Mr. Moghaddassi.

At issue in Mr. Borges’s complaint is the so-called Numident file, a critical database that contains the personal information of everyone who has ever held a Social Security number, living or dead. The agency has issued more than 548 million numbers.

In his complaint, Mr. Borges provided documents showing that DOGE member John Solly, a software engineer working at Social Security, called a career agency employee on June 10 to open discussions about copying Numident data to a “virtual private cloud” server operated by Social Security. Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old DOGE software engineer, was also involved in the project and would be given access to the server, other records show. The request came shortly after the Supreme Court allowed members of DOGE to have access to the agency’s data.

Mr. Solly and Mr. Coristine did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

At least one senior official soon began raising concerns, according to documents disclosed in Mr. Borges’s complaint.

On June 16, Joe Cunningham, the agency’s acting chief information security officer, emailed Mr. Moghaddassi and another top official, attaching a copy of an official risk assessment.

“After a thorough review, we have determined that this request poses a high risk,” Mr. Cunningham wrote, adding that “our current policy requires sign-off from the chief information officer (C.I.O.) to accept these risks.”

The risk assessment stated that DOGE wanted “uninhibited” control over the server to “expedite” its work but had not provided documentation of how it would maintain security, and it warned that “sensitive data could be made public,” according to a copy included in Mr. Borges’s complaint.

In another email to colleagues on June 23, Mr. Cunningham wrote: “We need to address how we can effectively monitor the data and the security controls that will be implemented.”

Two days later, he asked Michael Russo, a senior DOGE-aligned official at Social Security, to sign off on the project, noting that the personal data being uploaded had not been “sanitized,” or anonymized, as he suggested would typically be the case.

“Approved,” Mr. Russo replied less than half an hour later.

Another Social Security employee wrote that a colleague would be “transferring a copy of the Numident data over shortly.”

Mr. Russo declined to comment. Mr. Cunningham did not immediately respond.

Mr. Borges’s complaint stated that he was kept in the dark about copying the Numident data and that his superiors did not address his concerns when he raised them this month.

And he said that after he started asking questions about the project, the agency’s Office of the General Counsel told employees “not to respond to his inquiries.”

“Mr. Borges spent weeks pressing for fixes inside” the agency, Andrea Meza, a lawyer with the Government Accountability Project, said in a statement. “When nothing changed, he used the protected channels federal whistle-blower law provides.”

Mr. Borges’s complaint also includes documents that he said backed up two additional allegations.

He said that in March DOGE officials bypassed normal security procedures and were given “improper and excessive access” to other databases that contained sensitive information about Social Security applicants, including the ability to edit data.

Mr. Borges also said that DOGE officials briefly “appeared to have circumvented” the March 20 temporary court order that locked them out of Social Security data, regaining access to the data over the following weekend before being cut off again on March 24.

The law, which went through months of delays to satisfy the concerns of enough council members to pass, did not come soon enough this summer to save Tacos and Tequila, an annual event celebrating Spokane’s Latino community that would have typically taken place last weekend on a closed city street downtown but was canceled for fear of targeted raids by immigration officials.

“We just don’t feel like it’s safe right now to hold a Latino festival because we are being targeted right now,” said Fernanda Mazcot, executive director of Nuestras Raices Community Center, when the event was canceled in July.

But bill sponsor Councilman Paul Dillon and supporters hope the new law will provide some level of reassurance for future event planners and their attendees.

“Words cannot fully describe the way your blood freezes or the way your entire nervous system becomes an active live wire when you think you may have to be the person who stands against injustice and holds federal agents accountable,” said Nicole Ruiz, an organizer for Nuestras Raíces Community Center – a nonprofit serving the Latino community in Eastern Washington that hosts events like Tacos and Tequila.

“However, there is also something powerful when you know you are backed by the law,” Ruiz added. “Despite the fear, you stand a little straighter.”

The “Safe and Welcome in Spokane” law, originally proposed to impact public events in city parks, now potentially includes any event on public property outside of parks, following the independent city park board’s refusal to take responsibility for enforcement or administration. To qualify, organizers must coordinate with the city permitting office, clearly define the borders of the event with signage or barriers and give attendees “express permission” to enter, such as with a ticket or verbal permission.

The original version of the law was proposed in May as one of the last major legislative actions by former Councilwoman Lili Navarrete, who resigned in late June citing health concerns, but the proposal faltered amid concerns from the park board.

Dillon took up the effort in June shortly after mass protests over immigration arrests, modifying the law so that it no longer included city parks. The ordinance again faced headwinds after Council President Betsy Wilkerson worried it would prevent typical law enforcement from entering if a crime occurred at a protected event.

Though Dillon has insisted the law only impacts immigration officers, the law approved Monday also explicitly allows local, county and state law enforcement to enforce laws relevant to their jurisdictions.

The ordinance was approved Monday 5-2, with Councilmen Jonathan Bingle and Michael Cathcart voting in opposition. Since May, Cathcart has argued the ordinance was more performance than protection, believing that federal law enforcement would not be discouraged from entering an event in violation of the municipal law, and they may actively surveil the perimeter of events that sought such protections.

Police Chief Kevin Hall, asked Monday what officers would do in response to a 911 call about immigration officers violating the city’s law, was clear: observe, attempt to keep the peace, and otherwise do nothing.

“SPD cannot and will not interfere with a federal law enforcement officer,” Hall said.

Instead, the law would potentially give residents the ability to sue the federal government and other parties for violations, similar to a 2018 city law that prohibited warrantless immigration searches at the downtown Greyhound station.

In 2021, Greyhound agreed to a $2.2 million settlement with Washington state for frequently allowing warrantless immigration services just before the first court hearing for a lawsuit brought by then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson. This lawsuit was based on violations of anti-discrimination and other state-level laws, not the 2018 city law, however.

Cathcart disputed that cities had the power to grant residents a right to sue the federal government over alleged violations, which would leave the ordinance toothless.

Other opponents of the law argued that the city should be supportive of federal immigration officials and the White House’s deportation initiative.

“The law is clear that invaders need to be repelled,” said Larry Andrews, owner of HVAC company Andrews Mechanical and a frequent critic of the council. “And the problem with our city right now is we’re in a deficit … and by doing what you’re doing, you’re going to make it even worse, because the (federal) administration is following the laws, and they’re going to pull all of your funding for sure.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/v02UBJ2X3hJm2YVhOX6Tx016ukw=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/08/25/684a61d96d77f.hires.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 16:56:34.893830

A quieter news agenda means the chance to break through with policies.

Multiple government sources have told me that they think Reform UK has beaten both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in the August battle of attracting attention.

That may have been helped by Tuesday's finale in Nigel Farage's summer crime campaign: the unveiling of the party's long-awaited illegal immigration strategy.

A couple of attendees at the news conference, at an aircraft hangar in Oxfordshire, told me what was most notable was not just the boldness of the policy but quite how much money the party had spent on the event.

""It was like a TV variety show,"" said one.

That suggests the party is continuing to attract donors - helped by opinion polls consistently suggesting that a Farage premiership is possible.

Since April, Reform has had a lead over Labour according to these surveys.

Research suggests illegal immigration is also among the top issues for voters, although there is evidence that many have a limited understanding of the balance of illegal and legal migration in the UK.

So has Nigel Farage changed the debate on immigration?

Arguably the rise in small boat crossings since 2018 has been a major factor in crystallizing voters' concerns. It is a very visible, striking, and relatively new form of illegal migration.

These arrivals make up just over a third of those claiming asylum in the UK - many others arrive on a visa and then put in a claim.

Yet the record numbers of crossings have become emblematic of wider anxiety that the asylum system is not working. And prime ministers have struggled to fix it.

Rishi Sunak tried and failed to ""stop the boats"". Keir Starmer also made a major commitment on immigration - to ""smash the gangs"".

No party seems to be arguing that people making perilous journeys across the English Channel is a good thing. And therefore the UK political debate is focussed on who can solve this issue and how.

The solutions on offer from political parties have steadily become more radical in recent months with the Conservatives now examining whether to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Labour government is promising to introduce new legislation by the end of the year to tighten the way some of that convention is used in asylum cases to prevent legal delays.

Yet Reform is undoubtedly proposing the most radical solution - including leaving the convention altogether.

Nigel Farage's plans to tackle illegal immigration are big and would prompt a host of legal and practical challenges.

In his long political career he has regularly been accused of not being interested in policy detail, and at Tuesday's news conference Farage repeatedly deferred to his colleague Zia Yusaf when questioned about Reform's policy.

The policy document handed out to attendees was just four pages long, even if a party source insisted this was just a summary of Reform's - still secret - 100 page plan.

Questions will continues to be asked about how Reform intend to deport unaccompanied children, as well as the dangers of returning people to unsafe countries like Afghanistan where they could potentially face torture or death.

Farage's response was: ""The alternative of course is to do nothing… We cannot be responsible for all the sins that take place around the world.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2935/live/620c7ce0-829c-11f0-a21f-a946aea0c353.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 13:57:13.329496

The reason for the detainment of Utah violinist John Shin by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been revealed.

Last week, Shin’s wife Danae Snow established a GoFundMe page to raise funds for the expensive legal process required to bring him home. At the time, no details on the reason for Shin’s detention had been released.

The family has since hired the Utah law firm Stowell Crayk to help release Shin from an immigration detention facility in Aurora, UT. Snow provided an update to the fundraiser page, saying:

‘In working with the attorneys, I have learned that ICE made the decision to detain John because of an impaired driving ticket he received in 2019 while he was grieving the passing of his father from brain cancer.

‘While our attorneys feel confident that we can get him out of ICE custody on bond, I wanted to let you know as soon as I found out the reason for his being detained.

‘Of course, if this changes your mind about donating, please reach out to me for a refund.’

According to a report by Fox13 News, the attorney Adam Crayk clarified Shin’s immigration status. Crayk said that Shin originally came to the US under his father’s student visa before eventually marrying a US citizen. A family friend confirmed that Shin came to Utah from South Korea when he was ten years old.

Crayk told Fox13 that for reasons beyond their control, the family ’weren’t able to file for the green card in a timely fashion.’

Snow said that Shin was struggling with the death of his father at the time he received the impaired driving ticket, after which he completed the necessary probation.

‘He was stepping into the role of trying to take care of his family and his father’s absence and was really not knowing how to move forward and really just struggling with life without him,’ Snow said.

Shin’s citizenship paperwork has yet to be submitted, but the family and attorney are hoping to obtain Shin a green card after his bond hearing on Tuesday next week.

Snow had initially aimed to raise $28,000. As of 26 August, over $64,000 has been raised towards the fundraiser’s new goal of $70,000.

Friends and supporters of Shin have been playing their instruments at the Utah State Capitol government office and will aim to continue doing so until Shin returns home.",https://dnan0fzjxntrj.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/8/8/40288_93825967_1755708009973657_r_360847.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 13:57:28.562309

Judicial orders spark federal lawsuit

The backstory:

In a highly unusual move, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit in June against the entire federal court in Maryland. The suit was in response to a standing order issued by Chief Judge George L. Russell III, which was designed to prevent the immediate deportation of immigrants who had filed petitions challenging their detentions.

This action was seen as an escalation of the administration's ongoing conflict with the judiciary over immigration enforcement.

The court's response to the lawsuit

What we know:

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who was a Trump appointee who normally sits in Virginia, was specially assigned to preside over the case. In his ruling, he dismissed the lawsuit, finding that it was an improper challenge that went against established legal precedent and the principle of separation of powers.

He stated that the administration should have used a more traditional legal process, such as appealing a decision in a specific case, rather than suing all 15 judges. Judge Cullen's decision notes that the court's standing order was a reasonable and common judicial act intended to preserve its jurisdiction and ensure that immigrants have access to legal counsel.

The lawsuit was filed in response to a ""rising tide of last-minute immigration petitions"" that made it difficult for the court to review cases, according to attorneys for the judges. The dispute highlights the conflict between the executive and the judiciary, with members of the Trump administration criticizing judges who oppose policies set forward by the administration.

The Justice Department argued that the automatic pause in deportations violated a Supreme Court ruling. In his decision, Judge Cullen also criticized the administration's public attacks on the judiciary, calling the effort to ""smear and impugn"" judges both ""unprecedented and unfortunate.""

Paul Clement is a prominent conservative lawyer and former solicitor general who represented the Maryland judges. Clement stated during the hearing that ""there really is no precursor for this suit"" and that the lawsuit was intended to ""limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.""

Local perspective:

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesperson told Newsweek on Tuesday: ""A green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation's laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if our laws are broken and abused. Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) presenting at a U.S. port of entry with criminal convictions may be found inadmissible, placed in removal proceedings, and subject to mandatory detention.""

Why It Matters

Dale Heath's future as a U.S. citizen remains in limbo due to marijuana possession charges of less than 2 ounces from approximately 25 years ago. After successfully renewing his temporary proof of residency annually since 2022, he was reportedly informed by federal authorities in May that renewal was no longer an option ""because there are changes under the new administration.""

President Donald Trump has continually vowed to remove violent offenders from American soil; however, some cases involving nonviolent immigrants lacking criminal records have resulted in broader questions of whether such individuals should be detained and/or deported.

Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley's Deportation Data Project, which compiles federal data, found that roughly 37 percent of ICE arrests in July 2025 were of people with no U.S. criminal convictions or pending charges, doubling to about 92,000 during the first six months of the Trump administration compared with the final half‑year of the Joe Biden administration.

That 37 percent figure is up from 13 percent during Biden's last full month in office in December.

What To Know

On August 4, Dale Heath left his home in Castle Rock, Colorado, to tend to his immigration paperwork at Denver International Airport.

After he was informed by officials that they were unable to properly renew his residency, he was detained and placed inside the Aurora Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility, where he called his wife, Kelli, later that day, according to local news station 9News.

""It was a very like, 'Hey, I'll be right back. I'm going to run and renew my paperwork,'"" his wife, Kelli Heath, told the outlet. ""He honestly didn't even give us a hug or kiss goodbye because it was such a routine activity to go take care of...It was like he was going to the grocery store.""

Newsweek reached out to Kelli Heath via her Facebook page for comment.

Dale Heath came to the U.S. from England in 1991, at age 8 and with a permanent visa, Kelli told CBS News Colorado. He's lived in Colorado for about a decade and, along with his wife, runs Castle Rock Carpet Care, which the couple temporarily closed following his detention. He also volunteered as a coach with Rapids Youth Soccer and served in his children's school community.

His detention stems from two arrests in the year 2001 for marijuana possession of less than 2 ounces, both occurring in Texas, including once before he was 18 years old. Court records show he pleaded no contest in both cases and served probation and short confinement.

""We never knew that it was an issue, because he took care of it at that time,"" Kelli told 9News. ""But come 20 years later, we find out that it was still an issue.""

CBP told Newsweek that Heath, a United Kingdom passport holder and U.S. lawful permanent resident, had previously been found inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act due to a controlled substance violation.

""During his interaction with CBP, Heath attempted to flee after being served a Notice to Appear (NTA) for immigration court,"" they said. ""CBP officers swiftly apprehended Heath, who was subsequently transferred to ICE custody. CBP remains committed to enforcing immigration laws in strict accordance with federal statutes and policies. Heath's case is now under the jurisdiction of the immigration court system, where he remains in custody pending further proceedings.""

Dale was initially questioned in May 2022 at Houston's Hobby Airport by Customs and Border Protection officers after returning from a trip. Initially placed in removal proceedings, he was told to renew his paperwork every year to extend his parole and remain in the country.

Now, the husband and father of two children has remained in detention for about three weeks.

""It is literally like visiting somebody in prison,"" Kelli told CBS Colorado. ""It's through a glass window. You pick up the phone and can talk to them through the phone. So it's not like I can hug him or kiss him.""

""Emotionally, he's a wreck,"" she said. ""Physically, he's a wreck. He lost 12 pounds in the first four days he was there. He's in an area where there's...I'll say real criminals in there—domestic violence, or somebody who is affiliated with a murder. It's just crazy things like that.""

Kelli set up a crowdfunding campaign on the website Free Funder. The campaign, created on August 11, has already surpassed the $10,000 funding goal ($10,751 as of Tuesday morning) and received donations from 109 individuals, including one for $1,500.

""This heartbreaking situation has left his wife and children without his support, both emotionally and financially,"" the campaign page reads. ""In the midst of this sudden separation, they are now navigating overwhelming legal expenses, household bills, and daily living costs, all while holding onto hope for his safe return home.

""The family has always been the first to help others in need, and now, they need our help more than ever.""

What People Are Saying

In a statement to 9NEWS, ICE said it ""continues to issue temporary status documentation such as I-551 stamps on a case-by-case basis,"" but would not comment specifically on Dale's case.

Kelli Heath, in an August 11 Facebook post: ""This has been devastating for us emotionally and financially. Our family business is temporarily closed, and many have asked how they can help. Right now, financial support would make the biggest difference. Even $10 helps.

""We're also setting up a meal train to help with dinners. Thank you to everyone who has checked in on us—your love and kindness mean the world. If I miss responding, please know I see and appreciate you.""

In a scathing 39-page ruling, the judge, Thomas T. Cullen, called the suit “novel and potentially calamitous,” saying that the administration had simpler — and clearly more legal — ways to contest the standing order aside from bringing a suit against all 15 federal judges who sit in Maryland.
Judge Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump, went out of his way to describe the complaint as extremely unusual, offering his own role in the case as a prime example of its unorthodox nature.
Because the suit was filed against the state’s entire federal bench, all of the district judges there were forced to recuse themselves and Judge Cullen had to be brought in from his home courthouse in Roanoke, Va., to preside over the case.

Because the suit was filed against the state’s entire federal bench, all of the district judges there were forced to recuse themselves and Judge Cullen had to be brought in from his home courthouse in Roanoke, Va., to preside over the case.

Moreover, he used the ruling to take Mr. Trump and some of his top aides to task for having repeatedly attacked other judges who have dared to rule against the White House in a flurry of cases challenging aspects of its political agenda.

“Over the past several months, principal officers of the executive (and their spokespersons) have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘activists,’ ‘radical,’ ‘politically minded,’ ‘rogue,’ ‘unhinged,’ ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional, [c]rooked,’ and worse,” Judge Cullen wrote.

“Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,” he concluded.

Judge Cullen’s plaintive criticism of the Trump administration’s assaults on the judiciary was in many ways reminiscent of a ruling issued in April by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit — for which he once served as a clerk — in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the immigrant from Maryland who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador.

The ruling was written by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, an icon of the conservative legal movement, who expressed deep concerns about the executive and judicial branches “grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.”

“We yet cling to the hope,” Judge Wilkinson wrote, “that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the executive branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.”

The case in front of Judge Cullen began in June when the Trump administration filed suit challenging a standing order put in place the month before. The order said that immigrants who sought to contest their removal from the country in the Maryland federal courts by filing what is known as a habeas petition would automatically be granted a two-day reprieve from being expelled.

The order was intended to give judges time to sort through the complicated legal issues in a flurry of fast-paced cases being filed in Maryland contesting the White House’s aggressive deportation policies. The most prominent of those was a lawsuit brought in March by Mr. Abrego Garcia.

Judge Cullen pointed out in his ruling that the White House took “umbrage” with the standing order because Trump officials believed it hindered their ability “to police immigration matters and enforce the nation’s immigration laws.”

He admitted that such arguments might have gotten “traction” if the administration had made them “in the proper forum.” Trump officials, he said, could have appealed any individual cases where the standing order had actually slowed down an immigrant’s removal or could have contested the underlying validity of the blanket rule in front of the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify such measures.

But instead, Judge Cullen maintained, the administration “chose a different, and more confrontational, path.”

“The executive decided to sue,” he wrote, “and in a big way.”

In dismissing the lawsuit, Judge Cullen agreed with almost of all the arguments put forward at a hearing two weeks ago by a lawyer for the judges, Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases in front of the Supreme Court.

The judge found that the defendants, as federal jurists, were immune from being sued and that the administration’s suit essentially violated the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution by having the executive branch attempt legal action against the judicial branch.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Judge Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches — and the public officials who serve in them — share the same core sovereign interest: to support and defend the Constitution.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26dc-judges-ptgf/26dc-judges-ptgf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:57:27.021383

However, under common law, Sheriff Miller is responsible for the Buncombe County Courthouse security and safety,"" Redmond said.
Miller is asking for the same ICE notification it gets for ICE detainers in jail and warrants applicable to any potential courthouse arrest, Redmond said.","The Buncombe County Sheriff's Office confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arrested Jediael Amaya-Sanchez, 46, on Thursday, Aug. 21, outside the Buncombe County Courthouse around 11 a.m.

Asheville Attorney James Mills was outside the courthouse and witnessed the arrest.

""I was standing over there, right by the courthouse, and happened to look over, when suddenly a gray [Ford] Expedition stopped in the middle of the street,"" Mills said. ""And at least two, maybe three armed officers in tactical gear got out and ran into the middle of the median.”

Mills said a Buncombe County bailiff was present who did not know what was happening.

After a hearing in the courthouse, Amaya-Sanchez requested a bailiff to escort him to his car. It was then that suspected ICE agents, one with a U.S. Marshal vest, arrested him.

""They clearly were coming after one person. It was a bit of a fright, with tactical gear and long guns, run towards somebody and literally just grab them,"" Mills said.

""We did not receive prior notification from ICE that they were there to detain that individual,"" said Jorge Redmond, attorney for Buncombe County Sheriff Quintin Miller. ""We were aware of federal officers' presence in the courthouse, but nothing as it relates to detaining anyone. Sheriff Miller does have safety concerns about how that apprehension transpired near the courthouse.""

Redmond said an individual with federal credentials entered the courthouse and asked about courtroom locations before the arrest outside. He confirmed ICE pulled up outside the courthouse.

""Unfortunately, no sheriff in the state of North Carolina prevents these types of situations [ICE apprehensions] from occurring in their respective counties. This is federal law enforcement within the state of North Carolina and Buncombe County. However, under common law, Sheriff Miller is responsible for the Buncombe County Courthouse security and safety,"" Redmond said.

Miller is asking for the same ICE notification it gets for ICE detainers in jail and warrants applicable to any potential courthouse arrest, Redmond said.

""It was shocking in that this is America,"" said Mills. ""Men with tactical vests in the middle of the road taking away a human being.""

Timothy Henderson served as Jediael Amaya-Sanchez's public defender in a jury trial, where he was found not guilty of any charges. He was also working to help his client the day he was arrested outside the courthouse.

""This victim's wife said that within 10 minutes of being acquitted by a jury of his peers, that Mr. Amaya-Sanchez attempted to run her down in the parking garage. That didn't sound like something the man I'd just spent a week with would ever do,"" he said.

Henderson said the hearing was why Amaya-Sanchez was at the courthouse. Henderson was working to get him a bilingual attorney who could help with the civil filing.

Henderson believed the allegations were false.

He added that he is concerned about the potential ICE situation and is in touch with his client's family.

""I spoke to his daughter on Friday evening,"" he said. ""She's been in touch with our office. It looked like Friday, he was in Charlotte [federal custody]. I'm not sure where he is now.""

Amaya-Sanchez was booked on Aug. 23, 2024, for assault with a deadly weapon and breaking and entering before his ICE suspected arrest, according to Buncombe County records. During a jury trial, Amaya-Sanchez's attorney said his client was found not guilty.

Gallagher told OSV News targeting immigration courts for enforcement actions means the government is in some cases, ""arresting people who are complying with the law.""
A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment from OSV News.
""In the area of immigration, due process ensures that those who have a legal basis to remain are not wrongly deported or sent back to their persecutors,"" he said.
""ICE is attempting to short change that process, which should alarm us all.""","As the Trump administration seeks to implement its hardline immigration policies, it has increased enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in immigration courts, prompting alarm from Catholic immigration advocates.

Such instances are taking place across the country: New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently filed court papers in support of a lawsuit to stop arrests of migrants reporting for their hearings at a federal immigration building in Manhattan. Protesters in San Francisco attempted to halt such detentions in that city.

Near the U.S.-Mexico border, Fr. Michael Gallagher, an attorney and Jesuit priest and a member of Jesuit Refugee Service/USA's Caminar Contigo program in El Paso, has been visiting immigration court hearings to help ensure those going into their hearings understand their rights, as well as the possible outcomes of their cases.

Among the consequences ""of these arrests as people come out of court,"" Gallagher said, was a woman who had had been told by a judge to leave her children at home for her appointment followed that instruction, and later, as she ""comes to court and gets arrested as she comes out, and her kids are left at home and don't know where mama is.""

""So that is one of the kind of brutal consequences,"" he said.

Gallagher told OSV News targeting immigration courts for enforcement actions means the government is in some cases, ""arresting people who are complying with the law.""

""It's against fundamental justice,"" Gallagher said.

The Trump administration's changes to Temporary Protected Status — a program for shielding eligible migrants from particular nations from deportation due to dangerous conditions in their homelands — means that there are individuals who first entered the U.S. with legal status who have now been left without it, he said.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment from OSV News.

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, ""Immigration enforcement that targets people attending court hearings is particularly troubling, because we're talking about going after people doing everything they can to regularize their immigration status by following the legal process.""

""As Americans, we value fairness and respect for constitutional rights, including due process,"" he said. ""This is why from Los Angeles to San Diego to El Paso, we've seen church leaders, women religious, priests and ordinary Catholics showing up at court to witness to the human dignity of those who are our neighbors, our parishioners and decent hardworking people.""

J. Kevin Appleby, senior fellow for policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York and the former director of migration policy for the USCCB, told OSV News, ""Targeting immigration courts can violate due process for immigrants, a basic principle of our justice system. Everyone should be able to have their day in court.""

""In the area of immigration, due process ensures that those who have a legal basis to remain are not wrongly deported or sent back to their persecutors,"" he said. ""ICE is attempting to short change that process, which should alarm us all.""

Gallagher said, ""what I'm observing is kind of a real shift towards cruelty, which is very depressing for our country, to become a cruel place."" But he said at the same time, ""the people I meet down at the courtroom — the Catholics and the Protestants and the Jews — are very much in favor of looking at these people as people, first of all, as human beings with inherent dignity.""

In one example of his work helping to educate people about their rights in court, Gallagher said he met a family with a ""little girl who was 2 or 3 years old in a white dress, who was waiting to go to court and doing pirouettes downstairs while I'm explaining to her parents that they might get arrested, the whole family.""

Despite the circumstances, he said, he was struck by how ""she's still a 3-year-old kid and a human being, lovely with a white dress, and a happy child.""

Corbett added that as deportations ""now begin to hit local communities, we're starting to see a groundswell of statements and actions from bishops across the country speaking out in defense of human rights and advocating for essential immigration reforms.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-08/20250825T1015-JRS-PRIEST-IMMIGRATION-COURT-1803093%20%2813%29.jpg?h=82f92a78&itok=T3Ga9Zwz,N,,2025-08-26 12:57:49.893854

Over the past three months, the Trump administration has employed a series of legal tactics in the state to achieve a desired outcome.
The Trump administration also maneuvered within the court system, reaching an agreement to settle a lawsuit against the federal government that effectively gutted a ban on churches participating in political campaigns.
Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre and Andrew Mahaleris, an Abbott spokesperson, declined to respond to questions from ProPublica and The Texas Tribune.
Taken together, Trump’s legal strategies in Texas this summer show a win-at-all-costs mindset that is trampling on legal norms, said University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson.","On July 7, the Justice Department sent a harshly written letter threatening to sue the staunchly Republican state of Texas, notwithstanding its efforts to help elect Donald Trump and the fact that the president had singled out its leaders as key allies in his immigration crackdown.

The letter decried the congressional map previously passed by the state’s Republican-led Legislature as “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” It demanded that Gov. Greg Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton respond the same day with a plan to comply. Otherwise, the Justice Department said, it reserved “the right to seek legal action against the state.”

Despite its adversarial tone, the letter was hardly unwelcome. In fact, it was just the opposite.

It set in motion a chain of events that gave Abbott and Paxton the political cover needed to provide Trump with exactly what he wanted: a mid-decade redrawing of district lines designed to ease that path for his party to maintain control of Congress after the 2026 midterm elections.

Republican lawmakers prioritized passage of the new political map above nearly all other legislation during the state’s second special session, including disaster preparedness and relief for victims of the July 4 flooding that killed more than 130 Texans. The new congressional boundaries, crafted to net Republicans up to five more seats, drew an immediate legal challenge from a coalition of Black and Latino voters who, on Saturday morning, alleged that it discriminates against nonwhite voters. Abbott is expected to sign it into law this week.

“The One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate and is on its way to my desk, where it will be swiftly signed into law,” Abbott said in a statement on Saturday. “I promised we would get this done, and delivered on that promise.”

The series of events is part of a larger trend this summer of the Trump administration using legal action or the threat of the courts to seemingly coerce Republican governors and other politically aligned defendants to do precisely what he wants them to do. The strategy has allowed his administration to sidestep state legislatures and Congress, according to legal experts and critics. In some cases, it has allowed red states to achieve a politically valuable goal they’d wanted all along.

In Texas, Trump has been met with state leaders who have been willing, if not eager, collaborators in carrying out his agenda.

Over the past three months, the Trump administration has employed a series of legal tactics in the state to achieve a desired outcome.

It filed a federal lawsuit and, in one day, killed a decades-old law allowing Texas students who were not U.S. citizens or permanent residents to receive in-state tuition at public colleges and universities if they met specific criteria. The move came just two days after bills to repeal the law failed to pass the state Legislature.

The Trump administration also maneuvered within the court system, reaching an agreement to settle a lawsuit against the federal government that effectively gutted a ban on churches participating in political campaigns. Trump has long opposed the ban, which he vowed to end, but the president lacked congressional support for such a move.

On redistricting, Trump used his heft within the party to force the state Legislature to redraw the typically once-a-decade political map it had approved just four years earlier, leading to a standoff with the governors of Democratic states. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed measures that will ask voters in his state to approve five new districts that would favor Democrats in direct response to Texas’ redistricting.

Trump is not the first president to use a “sue and settle” strategy.

Republicans complained bitterly about the Obama administration encouraging liberal groups and Democratic state attorneys general to file suits against the Environmental Protection Agency, which then led to the rapid adoption of consent agreements for more stringent enforcement of environmental policies than Congress was likely to pass, said Marquette University law professor Paul Nolette.

But Trump’s strategy, Nollette said, is even more aggressive.

Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre and Andrew Mahaleris, an Abbott spokesperson, declined to respond to questions from ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. The White House acknowledged an email seeking comment, but did not provide one.

Taken together, Trump’s legal strategies in Texas this summer show a win-at-all-costs mindset that is trampling on legal norms, said University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson. He is among several legal scholars and lawyers representing civil rights and religious liberty groups who told ProPublica and the Tribune they fear the administration’s strategy to bypass the checks provided by the legislative and judicial branches of government will cause lasting harm.

“One ought to be extremely disturbed by this thoroughly authoritarian administration,” said Levinson, who has taught constitutional law for 45 years. He added that through such initiatives, Trump is “trying to enforce the ‘Führerprinzip’ of absolute loyalty to himself, rather than to abstract constitutional norms.”

“What is truly incredible is the extent to which the GOP has fallen in line,” Levinson said.

“New level”

The first clear sign that the administration was working with the state’s Republican leadership to bypass lawmakers was its successful June 4 effort to nullify the Texas Dream Act.

The 2001 law granted in-state tuition at public colleges and universities to students who lived in the state for three years and graduated from a Texas high school, even if they were not permanent residents or U.S. citizens.

Efforts to repeal or sharply curtail the benefit for immigrant children have gone nowhere in the Republican-led Legislature, including this year. It would never have passed, or remained in place for so long, without the support of Texas Republicans, said former state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, a lead sponsor of the 2001 law. The San Antonio Democrat recalled in an interview that the law, which former Gov. Rick Perry signed, had the support of most major groups representing Texas businesses because many believed that encouraging immigrant youth to pursue higher education expands their lifelong earnings, bolsters the workforce and benefits state coffers.

On June 4, two days after the Legislature adjourned, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sued Texas in federal court in Wichita Falls. There, only one district judge sits — Reed O’Connor, a Trump appointee. Within hours, Paxton, who is charged with defending the state’s laws, joined the federal government in filing a joint motion that asked the court to declare the law unconstitutional. O’Connor, who did not respond to a request for comment about the case, quickly agreed.

Paxton’s communications office did not respond to written questions from ProPublica and the Tribune. It’s unclear if Abbott, who succeeded Perry, supported the move by Bondi and Paxton to bypass the legislative process and kill the law.

Abbott has not said a lot about the issue since his initial run for governor in 2014, and Mahaleris, his spokesperson, did not respond to questions about it. Back then, pressed by Democratic opponent Wendy Davis, who predicted that GOP lawmakers would try to repeal in-state tuition for immigrant youth and said she’d veto any such legislation, Abbott suggested he supported making some changes and left the door open to signing a repeal bill.

“Greg Abbott believes that the objective of the program is noble. But he believes the law as structured is flawed and it must be reformed,” an Abbott spokesperson said at the time.

Had the Republican-led Legislature truly been interested in repealing the law, it would have done so, said Van de Putte, who pointed to this year’s passage of a program that allows families to use taxpayer dollars to fund their children’s private school education. “I mean, they got vouchers,” Van de Putte said. “This wasn’t a policy imperative.”

Van de Putte, now a lobbyist, said that when she heard of Paxton and Bondi’s maneuver, her “heart ripped.”

On June 5, a day after the Justice Department and Paxton worked together to overturn the law, Deputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli exulted over the collaboration, saying that because they “were able to have that line of communication and talk in advance, a statute that’s been a problem for the state for 24 years, we got rid of it in six hours.” In audio obtained by NBC News, Kambli told GOP state attorneys general at a private gathering that the president’s legal team was “learning how to be offensive-minded” and “brought in a lot of people from state-AG world” conversant in the tactics.

The Justice Department didn’t respond to a request for comment about Kambli’s remarks. According to NBC, a department spokesperson did not dispute that Kambli made the statements and said it was “pretty standard” for department lawyers to notify state attorneys general of federal lawsuits ahead of time.

The same day Kambli spoke to the gathering with GOP state attorneys general, Bondi and Paxton issued a joint news release celebrating the victory. Bondi praised Paxton “for swiftly working with us to halt a program that was treating Americans like second-class citizens in their own country.” For his part, Paxton said he was “proud to stand with Attorney General Bondi and the Trump Administration to stop an unconstitutional and un-American law that gave in-state tuition to illegal aliens.” In ensuing weeks, the Justice Department sought to repeat its Texas victory by filing suits challenging immigrant-tuition benefits in Kentucky, Minnesota and Oklahoma. Oklahoma joined Texas in agreeing to end its benefits, while Democratic statewide officials in Minnesota and Kentucky are pushing back.

The effort was “coordinated and planned collusion to circumvent the people and Texas’ legislative process,” said Kristin Etter of the Texas Immigration Law Council, an immigrant rights advocacy group.

Marquette’s Nolette, an expert on state attorneys general, said Paxton, a three-term Republican attorney general, and Trump’s Justice Department have moved to a “new level” of using the courts to achieve favored policy outcomes. He said the collaboration between Paxton and the Justice Department is an expansion of the “sue and settle” approach that the Obama administration employed. In many of those cases, there was at least a provision of the federal Clean Air Act allowing suits against the EPA administrator for lax policing, Nolette said.

“With Paxton, however, he is working with U.S. DOJ to challenge Texas’s own laws. There are no statutes that allow, or even anticipate, this behavior,” he said.

Court tactics

Fresh off its success in dismantling the Texas Dream Act, the Trump administration moved swiftly to overturn a 71-year-old federal law banning nonprofits, including religious institutions, from endorsing political candidates.

The ban, known as the Johnson Amendment, did not specifically target religious groups, but, in the past three decades or so, evangelical churches that tend to align with the GOP have railed against it, saying it impermissibly muzzles their rights to free speech and exercise of religion.

In August 2024, the National Religious Broadcasters, the conservative group Intercessors for America, and two Texas churches — Sand Springs Church of Athens and First Baptist Church of Waskom, near the Louisiana line — sued in Tyler to overturn the Johnson Amendment’s strictures against secular nonprofits as well as churches.

On July 7, their case gained significant momentum when the Justice Department joined conservative lawyers for evangelical churches in filing a motion similar to the one used to end the Texas Dream Act. In both cases, the administration’s intervention set the stage for a consent judgment, an agreement reached between the plaintiffs and the defendants as part of a settlement submitted to the judge hearing the case.

In this instance, the Justice Department said the ban unconstitutionally prohibited nonprofit organizations from engaging in political speech and that religious leaders should be able to endorse political candidates from the pulpit. The proposed settlement of the suit, however, only applied to houses of worship.

Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the consent judgment proposed to U.S. District Judge J. Campbell “Cam” Barker in Tyler amounts to “improper collusion between … the Trump administration and some religious extremists to achieve a policy objective.” Her group supports keeping the Johnson Amendment.

Barker, a Trump appointee, is allowing interested people and groups to file amicus briefs in the case. So far, he has not adopted or rejected the agreement between the administration and the evangelical groups.

Trump, who has said he learned about the Johnson Amendment when he collected evangelical ministers’ blessings as he first ran for the White House in 2015, sought to end it through an executive order. His Capitol Hill allies also tried in 2017 to repeal the tax code’s constraint on churches’ political activity but failed to attract the 60 Senate votes needed to overcome a filibuster.

Holly Hollman, general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, which supports preservation of the Johnson Amendment, said that, if approved by Campbell, the consent order would amount to an end-run around Congress — and one defying most Americans’ wishes.

“The majority of Americans in poll after poll support the rule and don’t want nonprofits, including houses of worship, turned into just another partisan mechanism that divides communities,” Hollman said.

One of the leading Christian conservative lawyers trying to overturn the Johnson Amendment, Michael P. Farris, who represents the National Religious Broadcasters, pushed back on allegations of collusion.

“The answer to your question is pretty simple. This case was filed on August 28, 2024,” or before Trump reclaimed the presidency, he said. “We will not reply further,” said Farris, who played a key role in drafting Paxton’s bid to have the Supreme Court overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to The New York Times.

“We are answering no media questions until the judge rules,” he wrote in an email to ProPublica and the Tribune.

Trump’s work with state officials to reach his desired outcomes is unprecedented and dangerous, said Jim Harrington, retired founder of the Texas Civil Rights Project, a legal group that advocates for voting rights and racial and economic justice. Filing “collusive lawsuits,” such as the ones over in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants and revocation of tax-exempt status for churches that dabble in politics, and carefully selecting courts where the judges are likely to be sympathetic, lets Trump evade constraints created by the framers of the U.S. Constitution, Harrington said.

The administration’s tactics are a quick way to get around recalcitrant lawmakers but risk undermining the judiciary’s role as an independent branch of government, he said.

“Even conservative judges should raise their eyebrows about the undermining of the integrity of the judicial system that’s going on,” said Harrington, who has taught for 27 years as an adjunct law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “This is a really serious attack on our system.”

Race-Based Debates

Legal challenges to Texas’ new map have previously taken years to resolve, raising uncertainty over whether Saturday’s lawsuit will be decided before next year’s midterm election.

A decision will hinge, in part, on how the courts view an assertion by the Trump administration that the congressional map passed by the Legislature four years ago, and defended by GOP lawyers in court as race-neutral, suddenly must be changed because it paid too much attention to race.

Michael Li, senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit public policy institute that works on election- and democracy-related issues, said that the administration’s reasoning is flawed and that both the 2021 map and the new one discriminate against nonwhite voters.

The 2021 map drew intense criticism for its dispersal of nonwhite groups into districts where they’d have less influence. Dramatic gains among Texas’ Hispanic, Black and Asian American communities accounted for 95% of the state’s population growth. But lawmakers drew a map where 23 of the 38 congressional districts had white majorities, even though in the 2020 census, white and Hispanic Texans constituted roughly equal shares of the total population.

To reduce the threat to suburban GOP U.S. House members, diverse neighborhoods in Dallas and Collin counties were removed from districts that were becoming more favorable for Democrats and attached to sprawling rural districts dominated by white Republican voters.

“I’ve stated it, and I’ll state it again — we drew these maps race blind,” said the state Senate’s point person on redistricting at the time, Houston Republican Joan Huffman, who did not respond to a request for comment. “We have not looked at any racial data as we drew these maps, and to this day I have not looked at any racial data.”

During a four-week federal court trial in El Paso that ended last month, Texas officials denied practicing racial discrimination. The three judges hearing the case have delayed issuing a decision, citing the special session in Austin.

In their July 7 letter to Abbott, however, Justice Department lawyers Harmeet Dhillon and Michael Gates warned Texas to change its U.S. House map, which they said was overly biased in favor of creating districts that members of racial minorities could win.

Texas’ 2021 map for U.S. House districts has four suspect “coalition districts,” they wrote, citing three districts near Houston and one in Dallas-Fort Worth where Black and Hispanic voters combine to form a majority. In recent years, all four have been represented by Black or Hispanic Democrats.

Neither Abbott spokesperson Mahaleris, nor Baldassarre, the Justice Department spokesperson, responded to questions.

The Brennan Center’s Li disputed Dhillon and Gates’ characterization of recent rulings by federal judges. Courts haven’t forbidden states from drawing minority-coalition districts but merely stated that the Voting Rights Act doesn’t require states to proactively create them, he said.

“Given that Texas has consistently said it didn’t consider race at all in 2021, there’s certainly not a case for dismantling any of these districts.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/Donald-Trump-Greg-Abbott-1326336246.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:57:31.592691

‘The whole scheme stinks’ Without parliamentary oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda’s Parliament.
The agreement, some Ugandans said, makes sense only as a matter of “economic expediency” for the Ugandan government.
For Museveni, the deal with the US to accept deportees is desirable “for political and perhaps economic reasons”, said Marlon Agaba, the head of a leading anticorruption group in Uganda.
The deal eases pressure on Museveni and may come with trade opportunities, said Agaba, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda.","Ugandans have criticised an agreement with United States President Donald Trump’s administration to receive deportees from the US, questioning the lack of approval from the East African country’s parliament and suggesting the deal is a means to ease political pressure on President Yoweri Museveni.

After facing sanctions from Washington that have targeted many government officials, including the parliamentary speaker, “Museveni will be happy” to transact with the US, said Ibrahim Ssemujju, a lawmaker who is a prominent opposition figure. “He will be asking, ‘When are you bringing them?'”

Ugandan officials have released few details about the agreement although they have stated that they prefer to take deportees of African origin and do not want people with criminal records.

However, the country is being pushed as a deportation location for high-profile detainee Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man and an El Salvador native charged with human smuggling.

Abrego Garcia has become the face of Trump’s hardline anti-immigration policies. He has an American wife and children, has lived in the US state of Maryland for years and has been under protected legal status since 2019 when a judge ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador because he could be harmed in his home country.

He was detained on Monday by immigration officials in Baltimore. The US Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Abrego Garcia “is being processed for removal to Uganda”.

He already has been deported as one of more than 200 people the Trump administration sent this year to El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison as part of Trump’s crackdown on refugees, immigrants and asylum seekers in the US. His case remains a major flashpoint for the Trump administration in its anti-immigration crackdown. Department of Justice lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran citizen had been wrongly deported due to an “administrative error”.

Abrego Garcia was severely beaten and subjected to psychological torture in the El Salvador prison, his lawyers say.

‘The whole scheme stinks’

Without parliamentary oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda’s Parliament.

He said the agreement with the US left him “a little perplexed” because Uganda is struggling to look after refugees fleeing conflicts in neighbouring countries, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.

The agreement, some Ugandans said, makes sense only as a matter of “economic expediency” for the Ugandan government. But it remains unclear precisely what Ugandan authorities are getting in return for accepting deportees. Analysts speculated that Uganda is seeking better trade deals and wants to be in Trump’s good books.

Okello Oryem, the deputy minister in charge of international relations, told The Associated Press news agency that such a deal was “complete rubbish”. He made the comments a day before his permanent secretary confirmed an agreement was in place to accept individuals who are “reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin”.

Negotiators for Uganda are believed to have been reporting directly to Museveni, who has been in power in the country for four decades and who, human rights groups said, oversees a government that conducts unlawful killings, arrests of opposition members and attacks on journalists.

For much of his time in power, Museveni was widely seen as a strong US ally, especially for his support of counterterrorism operations in Somalia when he deployed troops there to fight the al-Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab.

But his stock in Washington has seen steep falls in recent years. Former President Joe Biden’s administration piled pressure on his government over corruption, LGBTQ rights concerns and other rights abuses, and a growing list of Ugandan officials faced sanctions.

Uganda’s LGBTQ community is facing intensified persecution after the enactment of a harsh anti-gay law two years ago, according to a report released in May by Human Rights Watch, which said Ugandan authorities have “perpetrated widespread discrimination and violence” and “spread misinformation and hatred against LGBT people” since the 2023 law was enacted.

In addition to Speaker Anita Among, a key ally of Museveni’s, Ugandan officials sanctioned by the US include the current prisons chief, a former police chief, a former deputy army commander and former government ministers.

For Museveni, the deal with the US to accept deportees is desirable “for political and perhaps economic reasons”, said Marlon Agaba, the head of a leading anticorruption group in Uganda.

The deal eases pressure on Museveni and may come with trade opportunities, said Agaba, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda.

“The Trump administration is about deals, about deal-making, and any strongman would welcome that,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP24232320700554-1755865260.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-26 12:57:58.308615

The decision from U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen came in a novel and unprecedented lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against all 15 judges on the Maryland court in June. The Justice Department had argued that the standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell in May was unlawful and outside the authority of the court.

The judges, represented by Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, sought to dismiss the lawsuit. They argued that the suit presented a dispute between two co-equal branches of government that could not be decided by the courts.

In a 37-page decision, Cullen agreed with the judges in finding that the Trump administration's challenge should be dismissed because, in part, the U.S. does not have the legal right to sue and the judges are absolute immune from the suit.

""Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,"" he wrote. ""The Executive's lawsuit will be dismissed, and its motion for preliminary injunction denied as moot. Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.""

Cullen said that if the Trump administration ""truly believes"" that the standing orders violate the law, it should pursue the paths laid out by Congress.

""Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss,"" he wrote. ""To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.""

While the suit was filed in federal district court in Maryland, Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court in Roanoke, Virginia, was assigned to preside over the case.

Cullen's ruling was not a surprise. In a hearing earlier this month in Maryland, the judge previewed his decision, telling Justice Department attorneys that the ""far less destructive"" move by the Justice Department would be to appeal the standing order in one of the cases where it had been issued, rather than sue another branch of the government to ""accomplish its institutional interests.""

He echoed that position in his decision, writing that ""under normal circumstances,"" it would not be a surprise if the government raised its concerns about the legality of the standing order through the mechanisms laid out by Congress.

""But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times — at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,"" Cullen wrote. ""It's no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue — and in a big way.""

In a footnote in his decision, Cullen criticized the Trump administration's repeated attacks on members of the federal judiciary who have ruled against the president's agenda.

""Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,"" Cullen wrote.

The standing order issued by Russell earlier this year prevents federal immigration officials from removing or altering the legal status of any migrant detainee who filed a habeas corpus petition for two business days.

The court adopted the order to address the rise in migrants in Maryland who were at risk of imminent deportation from the U.S. and sought review of their detentions. Signed by Russell, the chief judge, the order states that it aims to ""preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction"" of the Maryland district court over pending matters, ensure immigrant petitioners can participate in court proceedings and have access to legal counsel, and guarantee the government has a ""fulsome opportunity"" to present its defense.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/26/758f29a3-6d56-4d06-a74c-9c8b6cb9f834/thumbnail/1200x630/8eecd716cdbacf7071ff35308d89c674/gettyimages-2231378443.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:32.000942

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen of Roanoke, Va., had been specially tapped to oversee the case, after DOJ named all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland as defendants in the civil lawsuit.

The Trump administration says the Maryland court exceeded its authority and violated the law when it imposed a temporary, 48-hour freeze on deportations for any migrant who filed a petition challenging their detention.

""Like other government officials, judges sometimes violate the law,"" the Department of Justice wrote. ""This case involves an extraordinary form of judicial interference in Executive prerogatives.""

But Cullen dismissed that argument, arguing the Department of Justice would normally have appealed specific decisions in specific cases, or petitioned the judicial council to change the local rules in Maryland if it didn't like them.

""But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times—at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government.

He said he was dismissing the case because it's a dispute between the judiciary and the executive that can't be litigated in this way in a district court, by suing all the judges.

""To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,"" he wrote.

Supreme Court advocate Paul Clement defends

In normal cases, the Justice Department defends judges when they are sued. But because it was DOJ doing the suing, the judges enlisted prominent Supreme Court advocate Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush years.

""The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,"" Clement said at a recent court hearing. ""There really is no precursor for this suit.""

The judges also received backing in the form of friend of the court briefs from the Maryland State Bar Association, dozens of law firms and 11 retired federal judges. Other former jurists affiliated with the nonprofit Keep Our Republic's Article III Project also spoke out for the judicial defendants.

""It was a sensible step. It's something courts do all the time,"" said Philip Pro, a retired federal judge from Nevada who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who normally sits in Virginia but was assigned the case because the Maryland judges could not participate, wrote in the ruling that filing suit against the judges was not the correct avenue with which to challenge the order.

At issue was a standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell on May 21 and updated a week later that described how federal judges in Maryland should handle cases involving immigrants facing an imminent risk of deportation. The order imposes a temporary stay of deportation for two business days while a case is considered.

The Justice Department sued, saying Russell had no authority to issue such a blanket order that effectively acts as a broad injunction against government actions without any assessment of whether the individual immigrants have valid cases.

But Cullen, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, concluded that the administration would have to find another way to challenge the order instead of taking the unusual and confrontational approach of suing the judges directly.

“Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,"" he wrote.

""Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,” he added.

Russell’s order was issued amid a flurry of Trump administration actions seeking to expedite deportations, sometimes without people being given the opportunity to challenge the decision.

One of the most high-profile cases in the country, involving a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported back to his native country, arose in Maryland.

Cullen wrote in Tuesday's ruling that, among other things, the administration lacked legal standing to sue and the judges are immune from such a lawsuit.

He did not address the substantive question of whether Russell had authority to issue the standing order.

The ruling is in line with comments Cullen made when he heard a hearing in the case in Baltimore on Aug. 13.

Deportation officers within a unit called Enforcement and Removal Operations are the ones who are responsible for immigration enforcement. They find and remove people from the United States who aren’t American citizens and, for a variety of reasons, no longer can stay in the country.

Some might have gone through immigration court and a judge ordered them removed. Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they’ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.

Overall, its activities — and how it carries them out — have polarized many Americans in recent months.

After years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.

Last week, the Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency’s top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.

It’s surging hiring

ICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year’s end.

The agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications — many from former officers.

New recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Ga. That’s a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers — not just ICE agents — from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.

Caleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he’s been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they’re assigned.

It’s preparing for conflict

As Trump’s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.

Vitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency’s data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.

Lyons said that after recent operations in Los Angeles turned violent, ICE is making gas masks and helmets standard issue for new agents. “Right now we’re seeing and we’re having to adapt to all different scenarios that we were never trained for in the past,” he said.

Lyons says the agency is also starting to send out security teams to accompany agents making arrests: “We’re not gonna allow people to throw rocks anymore, because we’re going to have our own agents and officers there to protect the ones that are actually out there making that arrest.”

It’s beefing up specialized units for high-risk situations

About eight deportation officers with military-style camouflage uniforms, helmets and an assortment of weapons stand outside a house yelling, “Police! We have a warrant!” before entering and clearing the house.

They are members of a Special Response Team taking part in a demonstration at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. These officers are like a SWAT team — deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations. They also accompany detainees the agency deems dangerous when they are deported.

“Everybody is trained to serve a warrant,” Vitello said. “These guys are trained to serve high-risk warrants.”

There are roughly 450 deportation officers with the special training to serve on these teams, and Lyons says they have been deployed to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., and Washington.

He said he’d like to have more such units but wouldn’t put an exact number on how many. Vitello said they’re also in the process of getting more specially armored vehicles.

It’s teaching whom agents can arrest, and when

New recruits to ICE receive training on immigration law and the 4th Amendment, which protects against unlawful searches. Longtime officers get regular refreshers on these topics.

In limited situations, ICE agents are allowed to enter someone’s home. Generally, when they’re seeking someone they’re trying to remove from the country, they have an administrative warrant as opposed to a criminal warrant. That administrative warrant doesn’t allow them to enter the house without first getting permission.

Vitello says the new recruits are taught about the different warrants and how the rules differ. And they’re taught that those who allowed ICE to enter their house can change their mind.

“If somebody says, ‘Get out,’ and you don’t have your target, you have to leave,” he said.

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.

The 4th Amendment doesn’t extend to someone’s vehicle, so Vitello said deportation officers do have the authority to arrest someone in a car or truck. Vitello said in the rare case where a target was in a motor home, officers would talk to the agency’s lawyers first to figure out what protections apply.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c239083/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+351/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcf%2F57%2Fcf4b59fa434f94a8cb10f38e8127%2F9657ceed9b5041019388433ea578a4f2.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:58:07.999264

US District Judge Thomas Cullen, who President Donald Trump appointed during his first term, said Tuesday past rulings lead to the conclusion that he has no choice but to dismiss the case.

“To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote.

He also said the lawsuit is “not ordinary” and that the executive branch must find other paths to raise its concerns with the standing order. He said the courts and the executive branch are each part of the sovereign US government.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches—and the public officials who serve in them—share the same core sovereign interest: To support and defend the Constitution.”

A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

Deportation Fights

The Trump administration filed the suit in June against the court over a standing order that blocked for two business days the deportations of detained persons who filed habeas petitions.

The order was issued amid the administration’s crackdown on immigration enforcement, and a Maryland US district judge’s handling of a lawsuit from a wrongly deported Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

The administration initially said it couldn’t return Garcia after he was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite an earlier immigration court ruling against his removal. But he was brought back to the United States to face federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee, which he’s pleaded not guilty to. Abrego Garcia was again taken into custody by immigration officials on Monday, and is seeking to block any deportation.

Cullen said he can “appreciate” the administration’s concern that the Maryland court “encroached on its duty to police core matters of immigration.”

But he said a dispute between the judiciary should be “resolved within the constitutional structure and with due respect for the Judiciary’s co-equal standing with the executive branch,” and that he has to first ensure he has the constitutional authority to preside over the lawsuit. “In so doing, the court’s allegiance is to the Constitution,” Cullen wrote.

Judicial Immunity

Cullen found the administration lacked standing to bring the suit, saying that Supreme Court case law prevented him from issuing an injunction against a judge.

He also said the district court has sovereign immunity from the case, and that the individual judges and court officials named in the litigation have judicial immunity because it was tied to an act done in their “judicial function.”

Cullen further found there was no cause of action that allowed him to hear the lawsuit between the two branches, “and this court will not be the first to create one.”

He said the administration could’ve challenged the standing order at the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, or by petitioning the Fourth Circuit’s Judicial Council.

“The Executive acknowledges these routes are available, but it claims it chose an interbranch lawsuit because those routes are inconvenient,” Cullen wrote. “This purported inconvenience does not warrant the judicial branch’s infringement on the legislative branch’s prerogative of deciding the scope of cases federal courts may review.”

‘Not Normal Times’

The unprecedented litigation came as the administration has assailed judges who’ve ruled against its policies, with Trump even calling for impeachment and some House Republican allies filing articles of impeachment against some jurists. Chief Justice John Roberts and other top federal judges have pushed back against the use of impeachment as a response to unfavorable court rulings.

Cullen referenced the harsh rhetoric in his opinion, saying the “concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.”

He said that typically, the administration could’ve raised its challenged under other options laid out by Congress.

“But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times—at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,” Cullen wrote, referring to the courts. “It’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/0e9cbce/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F3a%2Fd4feebac4c4bb995f95b5fb23ec3%2Fjustice-sarah-silbiger.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:58:32.763291

Ibarra, Kristen Hwang, Kristen Hwang Health",,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/08/immigration-hospitals-workers-fear/,"Specifically, they’re worried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.

“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said.
“Normally, health care workers have no reason to fear law enforcement,” he added, “but we’re in uncharted territory.”","Federal immigration agents are more routinely showing up at California medical facilities as the Trump administration ramps up deportations.

They may come to the emergency room, bringing in someone who’s suffering a medical crisis while being detained. They may wait in the lobby, as agents did for two weeks at an L.A.-area hospital waiting for a woman to be discharged. Or they may even chase people inside, as federal agents did at a Southern California surgical center.

The sight of these agents — often armed and with covered faces — makes many wary and may keep people from seeking care.

Existing hospital policies guide operations when law enforcement brings in a person under arrest, hospital officials say.

“This is nothing new to hospitals,” said Lois Richardson, vice president and counsel at the California Hospital Association. “We get inmates, detainees, arrestees all the time, whether it’s police, sheriff, highway patrol, ICE, whatever it is.” The job for hospital workers remains to provide care, she added, and not to get involved in disputes over why a person is in custody.

Yet immigration attorneys, advocates and health workers have expressed concerns over the handling of some of these cases, both by immigration officers and by some administrators at medical facilities.

Specifically, they’re worried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.

“We have a level of privacy that we owe to patients and their families, and that has just been completely demolished with all of the involvement of ICE coming into hospitals,” said Kate Mobeen, an ICU nurse at John Muir Medical Center in Concord. “It creates just a huge sense of fear, not only in our patient population, but in our employee population and our nurses.”

Patients’ rights, policies face new tests

Sometimes when ICE has shown up at medical facilities with a detained patient, the result has been conflicting messaging about the rules.

On July 29, ICE agents took a man to John Muir Medical Center in Concord because he suffered an unspecified medical emergency while being detained outside the Concord immigration court, according to Ali Saidi, an attorney and the director of Stand Together Contra Costa, a local rapid response and legal services organization.

When Saidi arrived at the hospital as part of the response network, he said hospital staff told him that he was not allowed to see the detained patient, but that the man’s family would be allowed. Then, when the man’s wife arrived, “The rules had somehow changed, and they said no family visit,” Saidi said.

In a statement shared by the Contra Costa Immigrants Rights Alliance, the detained man’s wife, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, Maria, said that when she later talked to her husband, he told her that he was so terrified that he passed out.

“My family and I went to the emergency room and we asked to see him and talk to him to make sure he was okay,” Maria said, in the statement. “The hospital staff would not let us see him and they would not give us any information about what was happening to him. They wouldn’t even answer my questions.”

John Muir officials would not comment on the incident, citing privacy laws. But in an email, Ben Drew, a spokesperson for the hospital, said general policy is that “If a law enforcement agency indicates that visitation presents a safety or security concern, [the hospital] may limit or deny visitation to protect our patients, staff, and visitors.”

Saidi said that when the wife insisted on getting information about the man’s condition, hospital security called the police.

“We understand that emotions are high whenever a family member or friend is in the emergency department or hospital,” said Drew. “The hospital only involves local police in circumstances when a patient or visitor’s behavior becomes abusive, disruptive, or threatening, and cannot be resolved through our own security team.”

Saidi denied that the family was being disruptive, saying that conversations with hospital staff and administration were respectful and no voices were raised.

“The atmosphere in that emergency bay was something like I’ve never seen before in my career,” Saidi said. “There was a chilling effect. Everyone was averting their eyes. You could tell the staff felt bad.”

Multiple emergency department nurses told Mobeen, a local California Nurses Association leader at John Muir, that ICE officers were “very aggressive with staff” and staff were afterwards “emotionally and physically upset” by what happened, she said.

“It’s horrifying to not be able to tell patients’ family members how they are, what their status is,” Mobeen said.

Part of the issue, Mobeen added, is training. Staff were not given adequate training on how to respond to any kind of immigration enforcement action that may occur at the hospital, she said.

Drew, the spokesman for John Muir, countered that the hospital has given guidance on its longstanding law enforcement policy and answered multiple questions since January about what to do if ICE agents show up at their facilities.

Limits for ICE access, sometimes murky

Last month, immigration agents occupied the lobby of Dignity Health’s Glendale Memorial Hospital, even standing behind reception desks, as photos that circulated online showed. Protestors gathered outside the hospital hosting rallies and press conferences.

They were all there because agents had previously brought in Milagro Solis-Portillo, an immigrant from El Salvador, for medical care following her detention. They spent 15 days in the hospital waiting for Solis-Portillo’s discharge before transferring her to another hospital and then taking her into custody, according to local news reports.

In a statement, officials from Dignity Memorial Hospital said they could not legally prohibit law enforcement from being in public areas.

That’s true, say legal experts: Waiting rooms and lobbies are considered public spaces in hospitals. But agents cannot move through hospitals without limits. Law enforcement officials are not allowed to search for people in exam rooms or other private spaces without a federal court warrant.

When agents bring in someone who is in their custody and needs medical care, the application of the law can be more murky.

According to Richardson at the hospital association, how far an agent can go into treatment areas with a detained patient may be decided on a case by case basis. In cases where a detained patient is struggling or resisting, that patient may need guarding, she explained.

And if law enforcement officers do go inside exam rooms, they may hear medical information while on guard. But that isn’t necessarily a privacy violation, according to federal rules. The HIPPA Privacy Rule, the law that sets privacy standards for medical information, has a provision that allows for “incidental disclosures” of information as long as “reasonable safeguards” are applied.

“The hospital will, and the doctor will make reasonable attempts to protect the patient’s privacy.” “What is reasonable is going to depend, again, on what’s wrong with the patient, how the patient is behaving, the nature of the circumstances,” Richardson said.

HIPAA protects the disclosure of medical records, which include names, addresses and social security numbers along with health conditions. State law also requires health facilities to protect this information. According to guidance from the attorney general’s office, health facilities should consider a patient’s immigration status confidential.

At the same time, some disclosures are required if law enforcement can prove lawful custody or show an appropriate warrant. A federal court warrant signed by a judge grants law enforcement immediate access to information or to search a particular area, while an ICE administrative warrant does not require immediate compliance.

Health workers in ‘precarious’ situations

Health facilities generally direct frontline workers not to engage with immigration agents, but rather to immediately contact security or management.

One particular incident at a Southern California surgery center stands out, in conversation with health workers.

On July 8, federal agents targeted three landscapers who had parked outside of the Ontario Advanced Surgical Center. They chased one of the men inside on foot, according to a felony criminal complaint filed against two health care workers in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

In videos of the incident posted online, a masked agent wearing a vest labeled “POLICE ICE” on the back holds a weeping man by the shoulder inside the center while several workers in scrubs stand by. At multiple points in the video workers ask the officer for identification; one worker says, “this is a private business.”

Two workers, Danielle Davila and Jose Ortega, tell the officer to leave. Davila moves between the officer and the man, saying “Get your hands off of him. You don’t even have a warrant.”

Ortega puts an arm between Davila and the officer and says “You have no proper identification.”

The officer says to both workers “You touched a federal agent.” Then Davila responds, “I’m not touching you.”

Davila and Ortega were later charged with two felony counts of assaulting a federal officer and conspiring to prevent a federal officer from performing their duties.

Last week the felony charges were dismissed and both Davila and Ortega pleaded not guilty to a subsequent misdemeanor assault charge. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment on the charges.

Davila’s defense attorney Oliver Cleary said his client believed she was doing the right thing by asking for credentials and a warrant.

“You can’t just come in where people are getting medical care and whisk them away,” Cleary said. “She didn’t know who these people were. They didn’t tell her who they were, and as far as she knew this was a patient of the clinic.”

Carlos Juárez, Ortega’s defense attorney, said arresting and charging health workers with crimes for asking to see a warrant and identification puts them in a “precarious” and “dangerous situation.”

“They did what they needed to do and what they had a right to do,” Juárez said. “What I hope is it doesn’t have a chilling effect on other health care workers.”

Workers say additional training can help

Around the state, health workers say they’d like to see management provide additional guidance on how to respond to such scenarios if they were to play out in their workplace. Some workers are providing training themselves.

Adriana Rugeles-Ortiz, a licensed vocational nurse at Kaiser Permanente Modesto Medical Center, has been leading “Know Your Rights” sessions at her hospital and in her community as part of her union, SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. She said some of her coworkers have expressed anxiety over some of the situations they’ve seen play out in other hospitals.

“Because of my involvement with all the training that we have done to the workers and to the community, personally, I do feel prepared. I am not that confident that we have been able to reach the entire workforce within Kaiser to get them to the level of confidence to deal with it,” Rugeles-Ortiz said.

Dr. Douglas Yoshida, an emergency room physician at Stanford Health Tri-Valley in Alameda County, said additional guidance and training for workers at medical facilities could be of great value.

“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said. “I mean, personally, if someone comes in in ICE custody, within the limits of the law, I want to do everything I can to help [patients.]”

The hospital in Pleasanton that Yoshida works in is located near the county’s Santa Rita Jail; staff, he said, have been used to a law enforcement presence. But the recent incident at John Muir Medical Center, about 30 miles north, as well as the criminal charges filed against the southern California surgery center workers have set people on edge, Yoshida said.

“Normally, health care workers have no reason to fear law enforcement,” he added, “but we’re in uncharted territory.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/071725-Dignity-Health-Glendale-Memorial-Hospital-ICE-CM-01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1334&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:53.704446

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen granted a request by the judges to toss the case, saying to do otherwise “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.”

“In their wisdom, the Constitution’s framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign,” Cullen wrote. “That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another’s authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary’s constitutional role.”

The White House had no immediate comment.

Cullen was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020. He serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the case because all 15 of Maryland’s federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s harsh response to judges who slow or stop its policies.

Cullen expressed skepticism of the lawsuit during a hearing in August. He questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue all the judges as a means of challenging the order.

Signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III, the order prevents the Trump administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in Maryland district court. It blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The order says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.”

The Justice Department, which filed the suit in June, says the automatic pause violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president’s authority to enforce immigration laws. The department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking Trump’s agenda, repeatedly accusing federal judges of improperly impeding his powers.

The lawsuit was an extraordinary legal maneuver, ratcheting up the administration’s fight with the federal judiciary.

Attorneys for the Maryland judges argued the lawsuit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” attorney Paul Clement said during the hearing. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement is a prominent conservative lawyer who served as solicitor general under Republican President George W. Bush. He listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges said the government was simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

In an amended order pausing deportations, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

Attorneys for the Trump administration accused the Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, writing in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the Trump administration in March illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown.

The new lawsuit triggered a blanket court order that automatically pauses deportation efforts for two days. The order applies to immigrants in Maryland who are challenging their detention.

Crowd yells ‘shame!’

Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national, spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

“This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Roughly 200 people gathered and prayed before the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore. Some held signs with messages such as “Stop Detaining Our Neighbors” and “Free Kilmar.”

With Abrego Garcia and his wife standing before them, the crowd spoke in unison: “The people united will never be defeated.”

The crowd waited outside after Abrego Garcia entered the federal building. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him after his detainment, the crowd yelled “Shame!”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office that Abrego Garcia “will no longer terrorize our country.”

But Abrego Garcia’s lead immigration attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said lawyers will fight the administration’s removal attempts.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

What’s next?

Sandoval-Moshenberg told reporters Monday afternoon that Abrego Garcia’s lawyers don’t know when he will have a reasonable fear interview, where he should be able to express his fear of persecution or torture in the country where the U.S. wants to send him. Officials have said it’s Uganda.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have raised concerns about human-rights abuses in Uganda as well as his limited English-speaking skills in a country where the national language is English. But there are also unanswered questions about whether he could be imprisoned or sent on to El Salvador. A judge blocked the U.S. from sending Abrego Garcia back in 2019 because he faces credible threats from gangs there.

Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

“We don’t know whether Uganda will even let him walk around freely in Kampala or whether he’ll be inside of a Ugandan jail cell, much less whether they are going to let him stay,” the attorney said.

If immigration officials determine that Abrego Garcia lacks a reasonable fear of being sent to Uganda, he should be able to ask a U.S. immigration judge to review that decision, Sandoval-Moshenberg said. And if the immigration judge upholds the determination, Abrego Garcia should be able to bring it to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

Sandoval-Moshenberg said that’s the process when someone is slated for deportation to their native country. And he said it should be for third-country deportations as well.

“We don’t even know if the government agrees with that,” he said. “This is all so very new and unprecedented. … We will see what the government’s position on that is.”

Sandoval-Moshenberg also said Abrego Garcia informed ICE over the weekend that Costa Rica was an acceptable country of removal because he had “received assurances from Costa Rica that they would give him refugee status, that he would be at liberty in that country, and that he will not be re-deported onto El Salvador.”

The notice to ICE was separate from the criminal case in which Abrego Garcia declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

“Costa Rica is not justice,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “It is an acceptably less-bad option.”

Reunion with family

Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee and returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

‘Hold Abrego Garcia accountable’

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

“Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,” Gilmartin said.

The U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, calling it an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/2025-08-25T135314Z_1484710839_RC2CEGAK45I7_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MIGRATION-ABREGO-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:57.122542

Today's top stories

Immigration authorities yesterday morning took Kilmar Abrego Garcia into federal custody, where he is waiting to find out how long he will remain in the U.S. The Maryland man was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and later returned to the U.S. The U.S. government now says it will deport Abrego Garcia again — this time to Uganda. In yesterday's court hearing, federal Judge Paula Xinis said it is ""absolutely forbidden"" to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. without giving him the chance to challenge the deportation in court.

🎧 Abrego Garcia's detention has been one of the first high-profile immigration cases of the Trump administration's crackdown, NPR's Jasmine Garsd tells Up First. At the core of his case are questions about due process for undocumented immigrants. Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. from El Salvador illegally in 2011 to escape gang death threats. He has not been convicted of any crimes since coming to the U.S., but the Trump administration accuses him of being a member of the MS-13 gang. He has denied this claim. In 2019, an immigration court ruled that he couldn't be deported back to El Salvador.

President Trump took steps to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook yesterday. This action marks the latest escalation in his efforts to exert control over the central bank, which he has been pressuring to lower interest rates for months. The Federal Reserve is meant to operate independently from political influence by the White House, so Trump's decision may face legal challenges. Bill Pulte, who oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, accused Cook of making false statements on a mortgage application in 2021, before she joined the Fed.

🎧 Pulte says that Cook applied for home loans on two properties just weeks apart, in two different states, stating that each home would be her primary residence. NPR's Scott Horsley says that this would lead to more favorable loan terms. Trump expressed that he does not have confidence in Cook's integrity, and that was cause to remove her. Cook says the president doesn't have the authority to fire her, and she will continue to carry out her duties as Fed governor. If Trump succeeds in ousting Cook, it would create a vacancy that he could fill with someone more aligned with his interests.

The president is vowing to punish Washington, D.C., and other locations across the country for abolishing cash bail. Washington hasn't had cash bail since 1992. The driving force behind the decision was that cash bail disproportionately affects poor Black people who are stuck in jail until trial. Trump's announcement comes as he looks to expand his weekslong military intervention in the nation's capital. He also expressed his hope to expand the National Guard's role in policing.

🎧 Trump says that the bail system has let murderers easily walk free. This is extremely rare, as just 4% of all people released before trial last year in the nation's capital were accused of violent crimes, says Alex Koma of NPR network station WAMU. Many people in Washington doubt that what Trump wants to do is legal, and only Congress can overturn D.C. laws. Local leaders are on edge due to the president's ongoing meddling in the city's affairs. Trump has expressed that he wants to train a special National Guard unit dedicated to public safety in D.C. He has command of the guard in the capital, because it is not a state.

Living better

Living Better is a special series about what it takes to stay healthy in America.

Wearing sunscreen is essential health advice, but many standard sprays and creams miss an important benefit. Over the last decade, more research has focused on hyperpigmentation and melasma. Though ultraviolet radiation doesn't solely cause these conditions, evidence shows that radiation from visible light, which penetrates the skin more deeply than UV rays, can contribute to them. Tinted sunscreens, which contain pigments to match a range of skin tones, block visible light radiation. According to research published in the journal Photodermatology, Photoimmunology & Photomedicine, tinted sunscreens provide better protection against damage from visible light compared to non-tinted products. Here's what to look for on the label.

☀️ The number one ingredient in visible light protection is the chemical compound iron oxide. It provides tinted sunscreen with its color, and is commonly used to lend a skin-toned hue to concealer and foundation.

☀️ A concentration of around 3% iron oxide in sunscreen likely provides the best protection, says Dr. Jenna Lester, associate professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco. She notes that sunscreens that are white or off-white in color likely don't contain sufficient levels of the compound.

☀️ Tinted titanium dioxide does a good job of scattering visible light. Additionally, antioxidants such as vitamin C may help protect against visible light.

☀️ If you cannot find a tinted sunscreen in a shade you like, consider using a foundation with iron oxide, and apply non-tinted sunscreen under it.

Earlier this month, two 15-year-olds in Washington, D.C., were arrested for beating up a man in what is said to have been an attempted carjacking. He was not just any man, but a member of a high-profile Trump initiative. Infuriated, the president lashed out at the city's Democratic leaders.

But because D.C. has an unusual relationship with the federal government, he could do more than complain. And he did: He took over the city's police department (at least temporarily), redeployed federal agents and brought in National Guard troops. Former Fox News personality and current U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro, whose office prosecutes adults charged with serious crimes, complained that more kids — or ""young punks"" as she put it — need to be prosecuted for more crimes at younger ages, even as young as 14.

I've seen this movie before — in fact, I've made this movie before. I was part of a team that reported and produced a documentary on juvenile justice for the PBS series FRONTLINE that first aired in January 2001. That was a time when more and more states were moving juvenile offenders into adult systems. The thing is, then and now, that this happened at a time when crime rates, including among youth, were actually falling … but stats aren't driving this train. There is something about kids who do serious crime that just hits differently.

I can tell you from personal experience that when you see these kids in a lockup, no matter how tatted up or hard they try to look, they look like kids — kids who should be worrying about acne, prom and their SATs, not guns, jacking cars and stickups. The question then, as now, is what should happen when they have gotten into that life? What are we actually trying to accomplish? To get them on the right track or just get them out of sight? Then, as now, it seems we still haven't decided.

“Today, ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and are processing him for deportation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.
If deported, Sandoval-Moshenberg has argued they need assurances that Abrego Garcia won’t be sent back to El Salvador amid fears of persecution.
The lawyer said Abrego Garcia had notified the US government he would be willing to accept deportation to Costa Rica since the country had said it would provide him with refugee status.","Footage of Kilmar Abrego Garcia being arrested by ICE has gone viral after the alleged MS-13 gangbanger slammed the “corrupt government” as he was being hauled away in cuffs.

The 30-year-old El Salvador native is facing the possibility of being deported to Uganda after he was detained by immigration officials in Baltimore on Monday.

The Department of Homeland Security shared a video of him shuffling through the ICE Field Office in the moments after he was detained.

“He doesn’t belong here. He won’t be staying here. America is a safer nation without this MS-13 Gangbanger in it. Good riddance,” DHS wrote alongside the footage.

The clip quickly exploded online after Abrego Garcia, who was released from a Tennessee jail last week as he awaits trial on human smuggling charges, uttered “it’s a corrupt government” as an ICE agent led him away.

“Kilmar is nothing but a petulant child,” one person reacted on X.

Others were quick to point out the “absolute irony” of him slamming the Trump administration.

“So corrupt he still wants to stay here,” one X user wrote.

“He has the gall to mutter ‘corrupt govt.’ Criminals don’t get to call anyone else corrupt,” another raged.

Abrego Garcia’s arrest comes after the Trump administration mistakenly shipped him off to his native El Salvador back in June.

He was subsequently brought back to face criminal charges of transporting migrants living in the US illegally, tied to a 2022 traffic stop during which the construction worker was pulled over on a Tennessee highway with eight passengers in the car, but no luggage.

Abrego Garcia, who has insisted he’s not a gangbanger, has pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on bond last Friday.

His lawyers have claimed US officials offered to send him to Costa Rica in exchange for a guilty plea – or risk being deported to Uganda.

“They’re holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick,” his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “They’re weaponizing the immigration system in a way that’s completely unconstitutional.”

The feds detained him again at the ICE office in Baltimore after reporting for a scheduled interview on Monday.

He has since been sent to a detention facility in Virginia.

“Today, ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and are processing him for deportation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.

“President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer.”

His lawyers quickly filed a lawsuit seeking an order for him not to be deported anywhere unless he has had the chance to contest being sent there.

During a court hearing on Monday afternoon, US District Judge Paula Xinis said she planned to hold additional court proceedings on the administration’s plan to deport him to Uganda.

The judge barred the government from removing him until such a hearing could be held.

If deported, Sandoval-Moshenberg has argued they need assurances that Abrego Garcia won’t be sent back to El Salvador amid fears of persecution.

“We don’t know if Uganda will even let him walk around freely in Kampala or whether he’ll be inside of a Ugandan jail cell,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

The lawyer said Abrego Garcia had notified the US government he would be willing to accept deportation to Costa Rica since the country had said it would provide him with refugee status.

He didn’t say whether he’d agree to plead guilty to the criminal charges he’s facing.

Farage could not explain how Reform’s scheme would be funded, beyond claiming costs would be a fraction of independent estimates.

Unveiling Reform UK’s “Operation Restoring Justice” at a combative Oxford press conference, Farage claimed his party would detain and deport “absolutely anyone” arriving by small boat and ensure they are “never, ever allowed to stay”, insisting this would stop crossings “within days” and “save tens and possibly hundreds of billions of pounds”.

Pressed by reporters, Farage confirmed that women and children would also be detained under the plans, conceding that “how we deal with children is a more complicated and difficult issue” but insisting all arrivals would be subject to removal.

Farage dodged questions repeatedly about how the scheme would work in practice. He was unable to name a single RAF base to be converted into secure detention facilities, despite insisting they would be central to his plans.

He offered no detail on how Reform would secure deportation agreements with countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan, many of which have no return treaties with the UK and are considered unsafe by British courts. Farage could not explain how Reform’s scheme would be funded, beyond claiming costs would be a fraction of independent estimates.

Reform’s leadership said it would repeal the Human Rights Act, leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR), and disapply the 1951 refugee convention and UN convention against torture, with senior party figure Zia Yusuf declaring that “no lawyer and no judge” would be able to prevent deportation flights from leaving.

George Peretz KC, the chair of the Society of Labour Lawyers, said: “The Reform party’s policy is simply not rooted in reality. They want to institute a mass deportation programme with no real, or workable, idea of where people would be deported to.

“Reform’s policy would require a returns policy to be negotiated with regimes such as the Taliban and Iran, and may, by their own admission, involve paying those regimes to do so. Which is impractical and extremely concerning, as well as unlawful (as our own courts ruled in the Rwanda case).”

Kolbassia Haoussou, the director of survivor leadership at Freedom from Torture, called the plans “a gift to repressive regimes” and said Britain would be abandoning one of humanity’s “clearest moral lines”. He said: “This is not who we are as a country.

“Men, women and children are coming to the UK looking for safety. They are fleeing the unimaginable horrors of torture in places like Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran. These laws were created in the aftermath of the second world war to protect us all. If Britain were to abandon this legacy it would hand repressive regimes around the world a gift and undermine the promise to defend our shared right to live a life free from torture.”

The human rights lawyer Adam Wagner KC said Reform’s promises were not only “legally extreme” but fundamentally misleading.

“A lot of the rights contained in the European convention come from British common law: the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, and the right not to be tortured,” he said.

Politicians swiftly challenged the scale and practicality of the plans.

Downing Street accused Farage of not being “serious” about his plans to deport asylum seekers, saying that leaving the CfhrECHR would undermine peace in Northern Ireland.

The prime minister’s spokesperson criticised the Reform leader on Tuesday, saying that any plan that required leaving the ECHR was bound to fail.

“The ECHR underpins key international agreements on trade, security and migration – and the Good Friday agreement,” Downing Street said. “Anyone who is proposing to renegotiate the Good Friday agreement is not serious.”

No 10 refused, however, to criticise other elements of Farage’s speech, including his references to irregular migration as an “invasion” and a “scourge”, as well as his prediction that Britain is “not far away from major civil disorder”.

Asked about those comments, the spokesperson said: “We have to recognise the strength of feeling about this and the pressure that it puts on public services. That’s why we are taking the serious, practical action to address this issue, and not just returning back to the old gimmicks, the old slogans that failed to deal with this and left us with the crisis that we currently face.”

Pushed on whether it would be a good idea to sign a returns deal with Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, as Farage has suggested, Downing Street said: “We’re not going to take anything off the table in terms of striking returns agreements with countries around the world.”

Daisy Cooper, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “Farage’s plan crumbles under the most basic scrutiny. The idea that Reform is going to magic up places to detain hundreds of thousands of people and deport them to countries who haven’t agreed to take them is taking the public for fools. Of course, Nigel Farage wants to follow his idol Vladimir Putin in ripping up the human rights convention. Winston Churchill would be turning in his grave.”

Farage claims the programme would deport up to 600,000 asylum seekers in a single parliament, yet the costings remain opaque.

A report by the Centre for Migration Control, which produced costings alongside the MP Rupert Lowe but is not led by him, estimated a near-identical mass deportation scheme would cost £47.5bn more than five years. Farage insists his plan would provide the same scale of removals for £10bn, but offered no operational blueprint or independent evidence to support the claim.

Farage argued that “over three-quarters” of small-boat arrivals were “young undocumented males” from “cultures entirely different from ours” who were “unlikely to assimilate” and “pose a risk to women and girls”, language likely to draw criticism from equality groups and anti-racism campaigners.

He also spoke of a “genuine threat to public order” if his proposals were not adopted, framing his plan as the only bulwark against rising anger and “civil disorder”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8750ba16c4f388e45d26569c51d06fe59af756a2/280_0_4310_3448/master/4310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a2d0b58dca08832fd0a7df3b55adf002",N,,2025-08-26 10:57:21.669202

Friends of John Shin, a Utah violinist who was detained by ICE one week ago, are planning on playing their instruments in the rotunda until he’s home.

“It was a shock to hear that it was John,” said Shin’s friend Nicole Marriott Fullner, who was playing the oboe Monday at the Capitol. ""He is probably the last person that I would have expected that to happen to.”

“I want all of the state representatives and the council members and anybody who happens to be walking by to know about what's happening in their own state,” said Shin’s friend Gabriel Gordon, who was playing the violin.

While the pleasant sounds echoed through the Capitol, Shin's wife, Danae Snow, was going through a nightmare of her own.

“I can't sleep. I can't eat. It's been really hard to know that he's going to be struggling in the facility in Aurora and hoping that there is a life for him to come back to,” she said through tears.

Shin’s attorney, Adam Crayk, was able to clarify Shin’s immigration status.

“He came in under his father's student visa originally, has married a United States citizen, and for some reasons that were kind of beyond the control of theirs, weren't able to file for the green card in a timely fashion,” he said.

Crayk was able to reveal the reason why Shin was detained.

“There is an impaired driver conviction from 2020, which, for all of our purposes, he successfully completed probation. He did everything he was asked to do. He has the certificates to prove it,” he said. ""But that does make, currently, anybody that has that type of a conviction, they become a priority for immigration.”

Snow said at that time, Shin was struggling with the death of his father.

“He was stepping into the role of trying to take care of his family and his father's absence and was really not knowing how to move forward and really just struggling with life without him,” Snow said.

Crayk said no citizenship paperwork has been submitted yet, but they are hoping to get Shin a green card after his bond hearing next week.

“Do I wish that they would have filed a long time ago? Yes. Did circumstances allow for that? No. Do they now? Yes. Does that change the facts of the case? Nope,” Crayk said.

Snow has since been able to talk to Shin and said he’s coping the best he can.

“He still hasn't got a pillow, and he just wishes he could be home, and so do we,” Snow said.

“I wanted the world to see what an incredible husband and father and person he is, and he's not perfect,” Snow added. ""I wish he wouldn't have made this mistake. I know that we've been doing everything that we can to make it right, and I hope that as I've been able to forgive him, I hope that our community can too.""

In the meantime, violins will continue to play in the Capitol as his loved ones await his return home.

""John, if you're listening to this, I'm sorry. I should have warmed up before,” Gordon joked while playing the violin. ""We're all here for you, and hopefully we'll see you when you get back, very, very soon.""

Shin’s bond hearing is set for next Tuesday.

While there is currently a GoFundMe for Shin’s family to help cover legal fees, Crayk wants those who donated to know something.

“There's a lot of people that did donations on GoFundMe, and I want to make sure that if those people feel uncomfortable, if they feel like, 'Hey, if I had known that there was this impaired driver conviction back in 2020, I probably would not have donated,' I'm happy through Danae to work at making sure those people get a full refund,” he said.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0692cce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/928x487+0+18/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fause1%2Fslices%2F3ce%2Fef205c0e5ea14d77944cbd6904335118%2F3ce0a41f616e4e34b6f3a9a178da2c5c%2Fposter_fca407555e9e41d99ebf034fbc9f99d1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-26 12:58:20.445420

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has ditched the Conservative administration’s flagship plan to send migrants who arrived by unauthorized means to Rwanda.","LONDON (AP) — Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain’s hard-right Reform UK party, said Tuesday that if he wins the next election he will leave the European Convention on Human Rights and immediately detain and deport anyone who arrives in the country illegally, including children.

Farage laid out his plans to tackle illegal immigration following a significant rise in the number of migrants who arrive by boats across the English Channel, and weeks of protests over the government’s use of hotels to house asylum-seekers.

“If you come to the U.K. illegally, you will be detained and deported and never, ever allowed to stay, period,” Farage told a press conference.

“The mood in the country around this issue is a mix between total despair and rising anger,” he added, claiming there is now “a genuine threat to public order” if no action is taken.

He said the issue of “how we deal with children is much more complicated,” but added: “Women and children, everybody on arrival will be detained.”

Despite holding just four of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, Farage ‘s party has gained momentum by seizing on public frustration over successive governments’ inability to bring down the number of migrants coming by boat. National polls have suggested that support for Reform equals or surpasses that of the ruling Labour Party and the Conservatives.

Farage, who has long sought to link problems such as public healthcare and housing to migrant arrivals, reiterated his stance that the U.K. is being “invaded” by migrants. He said he would introduce policies to mass deport hundreds of thousands of people over the first five years of being in government.

Reform will leave the ECHR and repeal or “disapply” all other rights treaties to bar all asylum claims and ensure migrants who arrive without authorization are deported, he added. It will scale up the capacity of detention facilities and secure deals with countries including Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran, to return migrants.

Asked about the prospect of asylum-seekers being tortured or killed if they were sent back to countries they fled from, Farage said: “The alternative is to do nothing ... We cannot be responsible for all the sins that take place around the world.”

Almost 29,000 people have crossed the English Channel by boat so far in 2025, up about 50% from the same period last year. On Monday, 659 migrants arrived in the U.K. by boat.

A much larger number of people — over 111,000 — applied for asylum in the U.K. in the year up to June, official figures show.

Reform’s deportation plans echo similar tough migration policies by Germany, which deported dozens of Afghan men to their homeland last month.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has ditched the Conservative administration’s flagship plan to send migrants who arrived by unauthorized means to Rwanda. Instead, he has pinned hopes on a deal agreed with France last month to send some migrants who cross the English Channel on dinghies and inflatable boats back to France.

U.K. officials have suggested the “one in, one out” plan is a major breakthrough, despite the initial program involving a limited number of people.

The government is also looking to speed up the processing of asylum claims. Officials have housed tens of thousands of migrants awaiting their asylum outcome in hotels at public expense — a controversial policy that has long simmered but tipped into protests in recent weeks after a hotel resident allegedly tried to kiss a 14-year-old girl and was charged with sexual assault. The man has denied the accusation.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/9b562f5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7259x4083+0+378/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fa7%2Fc3%2F9bc1241f6e707fdc18a482a956e8%2F42183606cd66463c83f25cb6e63fdd18,N,,2025-08-26 10:57:26.135026

During the four years William Murcia Henao owned Sabores De Mi Tierra — literally, “flavors of my land” — his West Side Colombian restaurant was celebrated.

Opened in 2021, the Niagara Street eatery quickly earned local media attention, praise from a local blogger and a nomination for a state Business Council award from Assemblymember Jonathan Rivera. The restaurant won particular acclaim for its traditional Colombian dishes, which Rivera and others said was missing from Buffalo.

But then, in May, Murcia Henao was deported to Colombia, part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants. Several months later, his wife and two children, including one born in the United States, opted to follow him via a self-deportation process.

Murcia Henao, his wife and their eldest daughter had arrived in the United States as asylum seekers and were permitted to live and work in the Buffalo area as their case wound its way through the courts. A panel of federal judges rejected their asylum bid earlier this year.

“They were the true meaning of hard-working people, living the American dream, coming here, opening a business, you know, paying their taxes on time, no criminal record whatsoever,” said Katherine Gomez, a legal representative for the family.

Gomez and Rivera’s staff both attempted to intervene with immigration officials, but to avail.

“We did beg ICE, and we did provide a bunch of documentation stating that these people pay taxes on time. They didn’t care, and it was devastating,” Gomez said.

Murcia Henao’s wife, Adriana Botina Rodriguez, while free, was stuck in the family’s Orchard Park home, under surveillance by a black SUV — a hallmark of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She and her children had to sneak to New York City and back under cover to obtain the needed travel documents so they could leave the country without being detained, Gomez said.

The family has since reunited in Colombia. Gomez, meanwhile, purchased the business from Murcia Henao. She’s reopened the restaurant and is working to renovate it. She’s also working to bring a branch of her legal services nonprofit, La Victoria Foundation, to the Hispanic Heritage center currently under construction several blocks away on Niagara Street.

Gomez and Rivera both said the story of the Sabores restaurant highlights the new reality of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration: Law-abiding migrants are now targeted by authorities, leaving their families, businesses and communities at risk, too.

“All this is, is loss,” Rivera said. “It’s children being taken away from their parents. It’s haphazard and chaotic. It’s truly destroying communities.

Had Gomez not purchased the restaurant, he said, “we would have just had an empty storefront on Niagara Street. And who benefits from that?”

A failed asylum bid

Murcia Henao and his family arrived in the United States in 2014, fleeing threats from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as FARC. In court filings, the family said the paramilitary group began targeting Murcia Henao’s brother in 2013 “for working for a hydroelectric dam project that the FARC opposed.” When the soldiers couldn’t locate his brother, Murcia Henao and his wife became their target.

“[Murcia Henao] testified that a man came into a clothing store where he worked, pointed at him, said ‘I found what I was looking for,’ and after buying clothing, said that he knew Murcia Henao’s brother, and that Murcia Henao had two daughters,” federal judges wrote in a filing in his deportation case.

Murcia Henao further alleged that FARC members left a condolence card at his home with a note that read, “We have one of these for each of your family.”

The family also faced extortion from local gangs, Gomez said, who wanted a percentage of the money he earned as a business owner. Eventually, she said, the family couldn’t keep up with the payments.

“So he closed his business, moved to another city, and still they were looking for him, looking for his family,” she said.

The family landed in New York City and lived and worked there before ultimately relocating to Orchard Park. Rivera said Murcia Henao has a brother who lives in the area. There, eldest daughter Salome played flag football and junior varsity basketball. Murcia Henao opened Sabores De Mi Tierra in 2021.

That same year, court records show, an immigration judge in Buffalo denied his application for asylum. Under past administrations, however, such a ruling didn’t mean immediate detention, and Murcia Henao was allowed to pursue appeals of his case as a free man. His restaurant flourished as he did.

Murcia Henao, however, lost before the Board of Immigration Appeals. In early 2023, he appealed his case to a panel of federal judges. His case languished for nearly two years. After a flurry of paperwork filed in 2023, records show, the case sat idle until Trump administration lawyers took over in February.

In March, judges in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Murcia Henao. Citing a 2016 peace accord between the Colombian government and the FARC soldiers, they argued conditions in the country were now safer than they were and that Murcia Henao had failed to demonstrate that he and his family would be persecuted if forced to return. The panel argued that “occasional flare ups of FARC violence” were not enough evidence to prove the family would be at imminent risk.

He was detained by ICE agents in mid April.

After several months in ICE custody, first in Batavia and then at a facility in Louisiana, Murcia Henao was deported to Colombia. Gomez described the detention conditions as “bad” and said his wife and children wanted to avoid detention if possible.

That meant they had to travel surreptitiously to New York City. Gomez said she arranged for the family to leave home at 2 a.m., drive to the city, acquire the needed paperwork, and arrive back home in Orchard Park undetected by the agents parked near their home. They departed for Colombia shortly thereafter, unable to sort out their affairs before they left.

“They left with nothing. They didn’t take all of their clothes or their furniture or their anything,” Rivera said. “They have to start from scratch, despite having a profitable business here.”

Future of the restaurant

After the family arrived in Colombia, Gomez said, Murcia Henao attempted to sell the restaurant. But knowing he had been deported, prospective buyers tried to take advantage of him, making only low-ball offers, Gomez said.

Running out of options, Murcia Henao agreed to sell for $30,000. He was to be paid $10,000 up front and $20,000 after the new owners took over the space. According to Gomez, they stiffed on the second payment.

Murcia Henao, she said, called her from Colombia, not knowing what to do.

“Then I told them, ‘Well, how much is it?’ And he was, you know, he was very shy,” she said. “[I said] ‘Well, let me make calls, make a loan, and I’ll buy it.’”

She did so for $55,000.

Gomez has big plans for the restaurant, which reopened July 18.

First came new flooring. Next up are repairs to the ventilation system. Gomez wants to update the menu, too, and open for breakfast. By the fall, she said, she plans to offer traditional Colombian coffee, croissants and eggs.

She’s also in talks, she said, to open a branch of her legal services nonprofit, La Victoria Foundation, down the block. Assisting Murcia Henao, she said, made her realize that many Latinos here don’t know their rights. Among other work, she wants to host “know your rights” trainings at the restaurant.

“I think people in Buffalo have no clue in regards to how immigration works,” she said. “I want them to know: These are your rights, and this is how you can have successful goals.”",https://www.investigativepost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6026-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:58:05.754011

Enhance your search results with the following special search methods. These tools allow you to fine-tune what data is returned and how it’s matched.

Exact Match ("""")

Use quotation marks to search for an exact phrase or sequence of words:

Example: ""Marketing manager in London""

This will return results that match exactly what’s inside the quotes — word-for-word and in order.

If there are no exact matches, the system will fall back to your default search query (which can be configured separately).

OR Search (|)

Use the pipe symbol (|) to search for any of the listed terms:

Example: Marketing manager | Sales manager | Business manager

This will return any result that matches at least one of the terms. If only one term matches, only that result is shown. If multiple match, all are returned.

Exclude Words (-)

Use the dash (-) to exclude specific words from the search results:

Examples: Marketing manager -indeed.com

Houses in London -zoopla -terraced

This tells the search engine to omit any result that includes the excluded words (e.g., no listings from Zoopla or containing ""terraced"").

Fallback Match (LIKE %query%)

Use this method when no other matching methods succeed.

Example: %economy in 2025 snp stocks%

This functions like a SQL LIKE query — it's a broad, fuzzy match that tries to find results containing the key terms anywhere in the content. It's often used as a final fallback option.

AND Search (&)

Use the ampersand (&) to ensure all terms are included in the results:

Example: Sales & Marketing & London

Only results that contain all three keywords — “Sales”, “Marketing”, and “London” — will be returned.

Even if a page is titled “Sales & Marketing”, it will still be included, as long as all keywords are present somewhere in the content.

Welcome to The Logoff: A federal judge is standing in the way of the Trump administration’s plan to once again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia — this time to Uganda.

Who is Kilmar Abrego Garcia? Abrego Garcia became one of the most high-profile victims of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after he was wrongfully deported to CECOT, a megaprison in El Salvador, earlier this year. The Maryland resident and Salvadoran citizen was returned to the US in June to face questionable criminal charges in Tennessee after Trump officials resisted his return for months.

What just happened? On Monday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Abrego Garcia after he appeared at an immigration check-in in Baltimore just days after being released from jail, and the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to deport him. Hours later, a district court judge in Maryland ordered DHS to suspend deportation proceedings pending a hearing later this week, where Abrego Garcia’s lawyers will have a chance to argue that he fears persecution if deported to Uganda.

Why Uganda? As part of its effort to ramp up deportations, the Trump administration has struck deals with a number of countries, including Uganda, to accept US deportees from unrelated third countries. In Abrego Garcia’s case specifically, his lawyers allege the threat of deportation is coercive. They say the government offered to deport him to Costa Rica if he agreed to plead guilty to the charges he is still facing in Tennessee — and to Uganda if he refused.

What about the criminal charges? Abrego Garcia is currently facing federal criminal charges of human smuggling in connection with a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. The indictment alleges connection with a broader human smuggling ring, but there’s reason to be skeptical, as a veteran federal prosecutor in Nashville resigned over the decision to bring the charges in the first place.

What’s the big picture? Abrego Garcia’s initial deportation was entirely DHS’ mistake, but it’s hard to avoid the sense that the Trump administration is attempting to punish him for it nonetheless by bringing criminal charges and threatening re-removal to an unfamiliar and potentially dangerous third country.

And with that, it’s time to log off…

But come 20 years later, we find out that it was still an issue,"" Kelli said.
At the Aurora detention facility, Kelli said her husband has lost 12 pounds in his first four days and is struggling emotionally.","CASTLE ROCK, Colo. — Dale Heath left his Castle Rock home on Aug. 4 for what his wife thought would be another routine trip to renew his immigration paperwork. By that afternoon, he was calling from the Aurora Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility to say he would not be coming home.

“It was a very like, ‘Hey, I’ll be right back. I’m going to run and renew my paperwork,’” his wife, Kelli Heath, recalled. “He honestly didn’t even give us a hug or kiss goodbye because it was such a routine activity to go take care of... It was like he was going to the grocery store.”

Dale, 42, immigrated from England in 1991 and has lived in Colorado for nearly a decade. He and his wife run Castle Rock Carpet Care, which they temporarily closed after his detention. He also volunteered as a coach with Rapids Youth Soccer and served in his children’s school community.

The family said the detention stems from two marijuana possession charges in Texas more than 20 years ago, when Dale was 18.

""We never knew that it was an issue, because he took care of it at that time. But come 20 years later, we find out that it was still an issue,"" Kelli said.

According to Department of Homeland Security records reviewed by 9NEWS, Dale was questioned by Customs and Border Protection officers at Houston’s Hobby Airport in May 2022 while returning from a trip. During that sworn statement, he confirmed two arrests for possession of less than two ounces of marijuana in 2001. Court records show he pleaded no contest in both cases and served probation and short confinement.

CBP officers confiscated his green card at that airport and placed him in removal proceedings. Since then, Dale has been required to renew temporary proof of residency each year while waiting for an immigration court date.

Kelli said that at his most recent appointment this month, officials told him that “because there are changes under the new administration… they weren’t able to renew it this time around.”

He was taken into ICE custody on the spot and has been held at the detention facility Aurora for three weeks now.

The impact has been immediate.

“It’s been different in multiple ways. We’ve had to temporarily close our business,” Kelli said.

She is now caring for their 9-year-old son Oliver and 12-year-old daughter Zooey alone.

Zooey said the hardest part is starting middle school without her dad.

""Everything's not good, I'll say that,"" Zooey said. ""There's a couple times I've gone to school and started crying.""

Kelli described her son’s reaction as devastating.

“Especially with Oliver, I’ve never seen him cry like that before, and that’s heartbreaking to a mother,"" she said.

At the Aurora detention facility, Kelli said her husband has lost 12 pounds in his first four days and is struggling emotionally.

“Mentally, he’s awful, I mean, to say the least. He’s going to have PTSD from this,"" she said.

In a statement to 9NEWS, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it “continues to issue temporary status documentation such as I-551 stamps on a case-by-case basis,” but would not comment on Dale’s case specifically.

Immigration attorneys told 9NEWS that while people in removal proceedings are always subject to detention under the law, past administrations rarely detained individuals who were not considered flight risks or threats to the public.

Kelli said her husband has had no arrests or tickets in nearly two decades, has passed repeated background checks for his jobs and volunteer coaching, and has successfully renewed his green card multiple times.

“If this was truly an issue, and they truly thought he was a criminal, then I feel like they should have done something a lot sooner than now,” Kelli said.

The family’s next chance at relief comes Sept. 3, when Dale’s case is scheduled for a hearing.

Until then, Kelli said, “We’ve done everything right, and he’s being punished for something that happened as a kid... They're just kind of picking up anybody and everybody and not taking into consideration the other aspects of their life.""",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/d8caac2f-3a7b-4255-96d3-5d61ac2a5173/20250826T033258/d8caac2f-3a7b-4255-96d3-5d61ac2a5173_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:58:14.688132

Brian Kemp is sending approximately 75 members of Georgia’s National Guard to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with immigration enforcement efforts, his office announced Monday. The Peach State is joining 18 other states to mobilize a collective 1,700 troops nationwide.

Guard members will not be tasked with making immigration arrests, but instead will assist with “administrative and logistic support,” according to the governor’s office. Processing and training is scheduled to begin in mid-September.

“I am proud to stand with President Trump’s team in the ongoing efforts to secure our nation’s border and keep Americans safe,” Kemp said in a statement. “With the longest continuous presence at the border of any National Guard, Georgia has led on this front for years and will continue to do so through this latest measure while still meeting all responsibilities and duties the Guard has to the state.”

State officials also stressed that partnerships between the National Guard and other governmental entities are not new. In February of 2024, Kemp authorized members of Georgia’s National Guard to assist with Texas’ border operations.

They also said that the move to have guard members assist with immigration enforcement “is different and separate from” Trump’s recent takeover of the District of Columbia.

State Rep. Eric Bell, a Jonesboro Democrat who served in the U.S. Navy, condemned the use of the Georgia National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement.

“I believe Georgia is standing at a crossroads regarding governance and the protection of individual rights,” he said in a statement. “What is before us is not from foreign shores but from within—the possibility of deploying troops on our own soil, against our own citizens. This is no act of security. I believe this an attempt to create division among Americans and Georgians and could be seen as serving private interests rather than the public.”

Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, also condemned the mobilization of the national guard.

“Unfortunately, this is another authoritarian move by the Trump regime,” Gonzalez said. “Our Georgia governor is going along with these fascist efforts to militarize attacks against our communities with violations of law with no due process for immigration enforcement.”

Experts said the death toll may have been inflated by the upheaval at Fema, claiming it diminished its capacity to respond quickly.
The letter, entitled The Katrina Declaration, accused the Trump administration of disregarding the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act (PKERMA), passed in 2006 with the intention of absorbing the lessons of the disaster.
“Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one,” the signatories wrote.
Those lessons and actions are being disregarded by the Trump administration.” Daniel Llargués, Fema’s acting press secretary, dismissed the criticisms voiced in the letter.","Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) risk exposing the US to another Hurricane Katrina, staff at the agency have warned Congress in a withering critique that also takes aim at its current leadership.

Writing in the run up to this week’s 20th anniversary of the devastating 2005 storm that killed 1,833 people and caused widespread destruction in New Orleans and the Gulf coast, more than 180 current and former Fema employees say the Trump administration’s policies are ignoring the mistakes that led to it.

The letter, sent to members of Congress and a council formed to examine the agency’s future, follows months of criticism of Fema from Trump and senior administration officials, who have threatened to close it, prompting more than 2,000 staff – about one-third of its permanent workforce – to depart, leaving it short of institutional expertise in key positions.

It comes after last month’s deadly flooding in Texas that left at least 135 – including 37 school children – dead. Experts said the death toll may have been inflated by the upheaval at Fema, claiming it diminished its capacity to respond quickly.

The letter, entitled The Katrina Declaration, accused the Trump administration of disregarding the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act (PKERMA), passed in 2006 with the intention of absorbing the lessons of the disaster.

“Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one,” the signatories wrote.

“The inexperience of senior leaders and the profound failure by the federal government to deliver timely, unified, and effective aid to those in need left survivors to fend for themselves.

“Two decades later, Fema is enacting processes and leadership structures that echo the conditions PKERMA was designed to prevent.”

It is also scathing about Kristi Noem, who as homeland security secretary, has overall responsibility for Fema, and about two administrators who have been placed in charge of the agency since Trump’s inauguration.

“Since January 2025, Fema has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a Fema administrator,” the signatories said.

The letter identifies the current Fema acting administrator, David Richardson, who has no previous experience in disaster management, and his predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, who was appointed by Trump only to be fired after publicly saying he opposed plans to abolish the agency.

“Decisions made [by Noem, Richardson and Hamiltion] … hinder the swift execution of our mission, and dismiss experienced staff whose institutional knowledge and relationships are vital to ensure effective emergency management,” it said.

Noem has angered seasoned officials by demanding that contracts worth more more than $100,000 be personally approved by her – a stipulation specialists say significantly slowed the response to the Texas floods.

Richardson’s suitability was questioned after he told staff that he did not know the US had a hurricane season – which lasts from the start of May till 30 November. His office later insisted he was joking.

The letter states: “Our shared commitment to our country, our oaths of office, and our mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters compel us to warn Congress and the American people of the cascading effects of decisions made by the current administration.”

Six statements of opposition in the letter include condemnation of “the ongoing failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator, as required by law”.

It also includes criticism of the administration’s “censorship of climate science”.

“This administration’s decision to ignore and disregard the facts pertaining to climate science in disasters shows a blatant disregard for the safety and security of our nation’s people and all American communities regardless of their geographic, economic or ethnic diversity,” the signatories write.

A petition at the end of the letter demands that Fema be given full cabinet level agency status and defended from interference from the Department of Homeland Security. The department recently ordered Fema agents to assist Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (Ice) agents in immigration raids, threatening to fire those who refused.

Trump, who has set up a review council headed by Noem to consider Fema’s future, has repeatedly said he favors its abolition, though he softened his rhetoric following the Texas floods, amid suggestions that it could be “rebranded” with more of its functions being devolved to the states.

Thirty-six of the signatories – including some currently working at the agency – attached their names, leaving them open to possible retribution. Another 144 withheld their identities.

This month’s blog focuses on the Government’s White Paper which outlines proposed changes to the UK immigration system. It critiques the dangerous use of demonising and divisive rhetoric surrounding migration, especially in the wake of further far-right violence this summer.

“Restoring Control Over the Immigration System: White Paper”

In the Prime Minister’s foreword to the White Paper[1], he describes the recent rates of migration to the UK as an “explosion” causing “[incalculable] damage”. He states that the previous government operated a “one nation experiment in open borders” and failed “to bring inward migration under control”, which has created a “wound […] when it comes to trust in politics”.

In the wake of further anti-migrant protests by the far right across the UK, this is an unfortunate continuation of the worrying trend of politicians using demonising language surrounding migration. Hundreds of refugee organisations have therefore sent an open letter to leaders of the main political parties in the UK asking that they take action to end this and address the “pernicious and insidious currents of racism and hatred underlying these protests”.[2]

Background

The case for reducing net migration is said in the White Paper to be premised on “unsustainable” increases in the rates of migration and the need for “desirable” forms of migration i.e. migration which the Government believes will increase economic productivity. The Government’s proposals in the White Paper to restrict and reduce lower-skilled migration, and increase productivity in the domestic workforce, include:

ending the Adult Social Care Visa route;

increasing the threshold for skilled worker visas to graduate level (RQF 6) and the salary threshold (to £25,600), in order to significantly reduce the number of occupations that are eligible;

increasing access to visa routes for targeting and recruiting “global talent”; and

introducing a requirement for key sectors to produce a “workforce strategy”, outlining the steps employers will take to increase skills and training, in order to engage the domestic workforce.

Use of technology

A key aspect of the White Paper is regarding the use of new technology to increase public confidence in immigration control and strengthen enforcement activity.

Body-worn video cameras, mobile biometric kits and an “advanced data management system” will be introduced to enable immigration enforcement officers identify overseas nationals and access digital identities/immigration statuses.[3] Border Force will use AI and facial recognition technology in order to gather the most accurate information available on each individual seeking to enter the UK.[4] The White Paper also refers to the introduction of new “Intelligence systems” for the purpose of strengthening immigration enforcement, including:

The database for the new eVisa system (digital-only form of immigration status which has replaced Biometric Residence Permits) records data which will enable enforcement action to be taken as soon as someone overstays their visa and to ensure that benefits, services and employment are not accessible such individuals. The database will alert the Home Office where a visa has expired, digital records can be updated in real time, and information will be shared with other government departments.[5]

The Government also plans to develop a “new digital service” which will be capable of showing whether an individual is inside or outside the UK at any time and whether they have complied with the terms of their visa. This data will also be used “to support further immigration applications in more automated ways”.[6]

The increasing use of digital profiling and surveillance technologies to gather sensitive data about individuals who want to enter, leave or remain in the UK, is concerning and risks being disproportionately intrusive and infringing the rights of individuals including under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. There is no clear legal basis for the increasing use of AI and facial recognition technology for immigration control purposes or for storing sensitive biometric data on national database. The Government has not published any policies to set out how sensitive categories of data will be used or shared with third parties.

There is also a concerning lack of accountability which has already been documented by Privacy International in relation to the Home Office’s use of photographs collected from immigration databases onto a secret facial recognition library which the Metropolitan Police has access to.[7]

Settlement and Citizenship

The White Paper proposes a key change to the Immigration Rules in increasing the qualifying period for leave to remain from 5 to 10 years. It prefaces that “settlement” and “citizenship” should be earned and be available to those making “greater contributions” to the UK economy. It is suggested that reductions to the qualifying time period to settle or to naturalise as British will be possible through the introduction of a points-based system.

It is also proposed that English language requirements for skilled workers and settlement are increased from B1 to B2 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages “CEFR”); and that adult dependents be able to demonstrate a basic level of English (Level A1, CEFR) to be granted entry clearance.

The above changes are said to be justified on the basis that they are necessary for “successful integration”, “community empowerment” and “social cohesion”.[8] However, extending the time periods to settle in the UK risks prolonging the precariousness of immigration status and frustrating integration or belonging, which is at odds with social cohesion, the stated aim of the White Paper. Similarly, through introducing a Points Based System the idea of conditional belonging is emphasised, with migrants being required to demonstrate that their contributions are of value to readily secure permanent immigration status.

Asylum

The White Paper confirms the Government will introduce further substantial reforms to the asylum system and border security to reduce irregular and illegal migration. As we explained in our first blog post[9], in the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill 2025, the Government has upheld provisions to criminalise asylum seekers who enter the UK via an irregular route originally introduced in the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.

It is important to note that there are very few refugee and sponsorship schemes currently available to asylum seekers, and that some such as the Afghan Relocation Programme have recently been closed.[10] The criminalisation of migrants on the basis of their mode of arrival to the UK ignores this fact. Statistics confirm that 70% of people who arrived by way of small boats between 2018 and 2024 were from Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, Albania, Syria, and Eritrea – countries from which there are not currently safe or “legal” routes to the UK. Furthermore, 68% of people who arrived by small boat during that same period were granted refugee status[11], showing that the mode of travel is irrelevant to the merits of an asylum seeker’s underlying protection claim.[12]

The White Papers states that new policies will be introduced to ensure that asylum claims by those who enter the UK on other visas can be refused where conditions in the individual’s home country have not “materially changed” since their arrival.[13] The Government has also indicated that it will review existing refugee and sponsorship schemes such as the Ukrainian Scheme, to ensure a clear and sustainable sponsorship framework,[14] and that it will explore a system for allowing UNHCR recognised refugees to apply for employment through existing sponsored work routes.[15]

Concluding points

Following the election, the Prime Minister pledged to uphold the rule of law and the UK’s international human rights obligations. However, the digitalisation of the hostile environment, closing refugee and sponsorship schemes (such as Afghan Resettlement Programme), and proposals to restrict asylum claims as set out in the White Paper, exemplify how the rule of law and international human rights obligations are arguably absent from the Government’s plans to reform the immigration system.

The White Paper encompasses policies that are “as much symbolic as they are substantive. Choosing between them has tangible implications for those directly affected. But those choices also say something – and are intended to say something – about those politicians and parties making that choice”[16]. The White Paper can be read as the Government framing itself as fulfilling a political mandate to reduce migration to the UK and strengthen immigration enforcement. However, now, more than ever, we need a Government that is not afraid to reject divisive and reductive rhetoric and one that will uphold human rights and create protections for the most vulnerable. As the open letter from refugee organisations to party leaders rightly recognises:

“The responsibility to end the divisive politics, racist rhetoric and demonising language of the past is yours. Only then will you bring unity instead of division and cohesion rather than hate.”

Under the plan, named Operation Restoring Justice, Reform UK would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, and strike deals with countries to return those people.
Reform UK says it would make £2bn available to put towards returns deals if it won power, with aid offered as an incentive and sanctions potentially imposed on countries that do not co-operate.
Reform UK said it would aim to scale up deportation charter flights to five per day.
The proposals could face legal challenges and political opposition, with Labour branding it unworkable and the Conservatives accusing Reform UK of recycling their ideas.","Reform UK has said it would offer payments to countries like Afghanistan to enable ""mass deportations"" of migrants who arrive in the UK on small boats.

The party's leader Nigel Farage set out a five-year plan to detain and deport all migrants who arrive in the UK without permission at a news conference in Oxford.

Under the plan, named Operation Restoring Justice, Reform UK would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, and strike deals with countries to return those people.

Reform UK says it would make £2bn available to put towards returns deals if it won power, with aid offered as an incentive and sanctions potentially imposed on countries that do not co-operate.

Launching his plan, Farage described illegal migration as a ""scourge"" on the UK.

""The only way we'll stop the boats is by detaining and deporting absolutely anyone who comes via that route,"" Farage said.

""And if we do that, the boats will stop coming in days because there will be no incentive,"" he added.

Under the plan, people would be arrested on arrival, detained at disused RAF bases and, if agreements were reached, returned to their countries of origin, including Afghanistan and Eritrea, where a significant number of people on small boats come from.

The party says it would build removal centres in remote areas of the country under plans to detain up to 24,000 people within 18 months.

The party would also look to countries such as Rwanda and Albania to house migrants, and seek to use British overseas territories such as Ascension Island as a ""fallback"" if people awaiting deportation could not be sent elsewhere.

Reform UK said it would aim to scale up deportation charter flights to five per day.

Key to the plan is the passage of a new law called the Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill.

Reform UK said the bill would create a legal duty for the home secretary to remove illegal migrants, and ban anyone who had been deported from re-entering the UK for life.

To make removals easier, Reform is promising to leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), repeal the Human Rights Act and ""disapply"" international treaties like the Refugee Convention for five years.

A Reform UK government would give migrants the option to return voluntarily and offer them £2,500 for doing so and pay for the cost of their flight, the party says.

Reform said the plans would cost about £10bn over five years, but would save the government money it spends on asylum hotels and other costs over the long term.

The proposals could face legal challenges and political opposition, with Labour branding it unworkable and the Conservatives accusing Reform UK of recycling their ideas.

The arrival of migrants on small boats has contributed to an increase in asylum claims in recent years and put pressure on the UK government to stop the crossings.

Nearly 28,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel on small boats since the start of the year, and a record 111,000 asylum applications were made in the year to June.

The latest Home Office figures show of those who claimed asylum in the UK in the year to June, about 40% arrived via small boat.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f060/live/7156ea20-8263-11f0-ba76-2552413beb48.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 07:56:35.902022

Some UCLA medical school faculty are members of a broader campus organization, the Jewish Faculty Resilience Group, that has aired complaints publicly for months at UC regents meetings about antisemitism.
In a Monday statement, a spokesperson for the UCLA medical school said it opposed antisemitism.
“Antisemitism has no place at UCLA’s medical school.
Tense disagreements have erupted at the UCLA medical school between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students, faculty and staff since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza.","The UCLA and UC San Francisco medical schools have been given two weeks to submit years of internal documents to a Republican-led congressional committee about alleged antisemitism and how the schools responded, widening the federal government’s far-reaching investigations into the University of California.

The demands from House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) cited reports of Jewish people “experiencing hostility and fear” at each campus and that universities had not proved that they “meaningfully responded.”

Walberg’s letters said the committee would be investigating whether the schools violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.

The additional investigation comes as top UC officials and the Justice Department have begun negotiations over allegations that the UCLA campus overall has been hostile to Jewish students, staff and faculty. The federal government has suspended more than $500 million in health, medical and energy research grants from UCLA and is seeking $1 billion and major campus changes before restoring the funds.

The Trump administration cited alleged Title VI violations when pulling the money.

The House committee said Monday it wanted “all documents and communications” since Sept. 1, 2021, tied to complaints of antisemitic incidents at UCLA and UC San Fransisco. A similar letter was also sent to the University of Illinois College of Medicine.

Some UCLA medical school faculty are members of a broader campus organization, the Jewish Faculty Resilience Group, that has aired complaints publicly for months at UC regents meetings about antisemitism.

The group’s chair, medical school assistant clinical professor of psychiatry Kira Stein, is mentioned in the Monday letter to UCLA as a faculty member who has reported anti-Jewish incidents.

“Federal lawmakers, in their letter released today, echoed what many of us have experienced firsthand: Antisemitism at UCLA is common, corrosive, and continues to be met with silence and inaction from the university administration and local leaders,” Stein said in a statement Monday.

The committee has asked for communications with UCLA’s medical school dean, administrators who work on diversity or restorative justice-related programs, and several other positions as well as data on specific events and courses, including one on “structural racism and health equity.”

It also asked for emails from administrators “referring or relating to antisemitism or the terms Jewish, Israel, Israeli, Palestine, or Palestinian.” And it requests information about a January report focused on the medical school that a UCLA task force on anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim and anti-Arab racism prepared.

That 35-page report said “students, residents and faculty in the David Geffen School of Medicine who express support for Palestinian human rights, and who offer any criticism of Israel’s violation of them, face harassment from within and outside the medical school.”

The House committee has asked for “all documents and communications since October 7, 2023 in the possession of the office of the executive vice chancellor” — UCLA Provost Darnell Hunt — related to that task force. Members of the task force have accused UCLA of not taking complaints of bias incidents against Muslims, Arab Americans and Palestinian Americans as seriously as it has reports of antisemitism.

Walberg said that, in addition to Title VI enforcement, he would use the documents to “aid the committee in considering whether potential legislative changes, including legislation to specifically address antisemitic discrimination, are needed.”

The UCLA medical school is also under a Department of Health and Human Services investigation over accusations that it “discriminates on the basis of race, color, or national origin in its admissions.” UCLA denied the charges and the department has not formally announced the results of its investigation that began in late March. But when it canceled hundreds of millions in grants to UCLA last month, the Trump administration said the action was due in part to its belief that the university illegally uses race in admissions.

In a Monday statement, a spokesperson for the UCLA medical school said it opposed antisemitism.

“Antisemitism has no place at UCLA’s medical school. Protecting the civil rights of our Jewish community members remains a top priority,” the statement said. “We are committed to fair processes in all our educational programs and activities, consistent with federal and state anti-discrimination laws and continue to take specific steps to foster an environment free of antisemitism and other forms of discrimination and harassment.”

A spokesperson for UC San Francisco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The letter comes as the Trump administration has floated the idea of eliminating the agency altogether, and has generally sought to diminish its role while placing more responsibility on states.
The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
The letter was published online but was addressed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council, which the Trump administration set up to explore ways to reform the agency.
The FEMA staffers, which included 143 current and 38 former employees, had additional concerns that they outlined, including cuts to risk reduction programs, climate science and the agency’s workforce.","A group of current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees warned Monday that the Trump administration is weakening the disaster response agency’s capacity and preventing it from carrying out its mission.

In a letter, the 181 current and former staffers particularly pointed to an administration policy requiring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to conduct a “personal review and approval of all contracts, grants and mission assignments over $100,000.”

They said this “reduces FEMA’s authorities and capabilities to swiftly deliver our mission.”

“Consequences of this manual review became tragically clear during the July 2025 floods in Kerrville, Texas, when mission assignments were delayed up to 72 hours; FEMA’s Urban Search and Rescue Branch Chief resigned, citing these delays as cause,” the staffers wrote.

They also lamented there is no congressionally approved administrator helming the agency and said its current leader is not qualified for the position.

The letter comes as the Trump administration has floated the idea of eliminating the agency altogether, and has generally sought to diminish its role while placing more responsibility on states.

The staffers said such policies are making things worse.

“Cuts to these programs prioritize the appearance of cost reduction and empowerment of SLTT [State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial] partners but will result in an opposite outcome,” they wrote.

“When we cannot work directly with our SLTT partners in providing training and technical assistance, we lose critical opportunities to maintain trust, strengthen systems, improve preparedness, and serve the American communities we swore an oath to protect at the moments of their most dire need,” they added.

Acting FEMA Press Secretary Daniel Llargues defended the Trump administration’s moves.

“The Department of Homeland Security, under the leadership of Secretary Kristi Noem, is committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people. For too long, FEMA was bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes that failed to get disaster dollars into survivors’ hands. The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

“It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems,” the statement continued, pointing to reforms including “Rapid, upfront funding was provided in New Mexico following recent flooding — a shift away from slow, reimbursable models that left families waiting for years in the past.”

In a letter called the “Katrina Declaration,” named after the 2005 hurricane that killed hundreds of people, the current and former FEMA staffers said the agency is losing progress made in the aftermath of the storm.

“Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one: the inexperience of senior leaders and the profound failure by the federal government to deliver timely, unified, and effective aid to those in need left survivors to fend for themselves for days,” they wrote.

The staffers noted that such failures resulted in the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA), but warned that current policies could take the nation backwards.

“Two decades later, FEMA is enacting processes and leadership structures that echo the conditions PKEMRA was designed to prevent,” they wrote.

The letter was published online but was addressed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council, which the Trump administration set up to explore ways to reform the agency. It also was sent to various congressional committees.

The FEMA staffers, which included 143 current and 38 former employees, had additional concerns that they outlined, including cuts to risk reduction programs, climate science and the agency’s workforce.

They called on Congress to make FEMA a “cabinet-level independent agency,” defend the agency from “further interference from DHS, including illegal impoundments of appropriated funding,” and protect employees from “politically motivated firings.”

The administration’s cuts to the disaster agency have come under particular scrutiny in light of the deadly floods in Texas. The administration has, in recent weeks, walked back its calls to ax the agency outright, but has doubled down on its assertions that it hopes to dole out less money through the agency and give states more responsibility.

Staffers at other agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have published similar letters.

Speaking after a weekend of protests and counter-protests over the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, the Home Office minister Angela Eagle said the government had inherited a “border security system in tatters” and accused opposition parties of offering “the fag packet plans without the substance on delivery”.

Nigel Farage will on Tuesday outline proposals for a sweeping deportation programme, including the mass removal of asylum seekers arriving in small boats, the detention of new arrivals at military bases, and the rapid expansion of flights to Rwanda and other countries willing to take asylum seekers.

The Reform UK leader’s plans also include withdrawing from the European convention on human rights and replacing the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights prioritising citizens’ rights.

Writing for the Telegraph, he described international treaties governing human rights law as “malign influences” that had been “allowed to frustrate deportations”.

“The time has come to put this country first,” Farage said. “This is all a question of priorities. Is Keir Starmer on the side of the British people, national security and protecting women and girls – or is he on the side of outdated international treaties and human rights lawyers?”

Farage’s intervention comes after a Times poll by YouGov found that 71% of voters believe Keir Starmer is handling the asylum seeker hotel crisis poorly, including a majority of Labour supporters. The findings have intensified pressure on ministers to demonstrate visible progress before a winter in which the use of hotels remains one of the most politically fraught aspects of the small boats crisis.

Eagle, the border security and asylum minister, said Reform’s plans were unworkable and accused the Conservatives of leaving behind a broken system.

“This government inherited chaos in the asylum system and a border security system in tatters,” she said. “Since the election we have been rebuilding the foundations of both, saving £1bn in asylum accommodation costs, increasing removals of those with no right to be here, and bringing forward new laws to make it easier to deport sex offenders, which both Reform and the Tories voted against.

“Under the Tories we had years of fantasy solutions, which we were told would stop the boats, but which simply cost a fortune and had no impact. Reform look to be offering more of the same. These are back-of-the-fag packet plans without the substance on delivery.

“Illegal migration is a complex, global problem requiring serious and sustainable policies, including working closely with partners overseas. Only the Labour government is offering that kind of plan.”

A government source said “by the end of the year at least five more hotels are expected to be closed, with a big surge in closures in the new year”, describing the move as part of a wider effort to end hotel use entirely.

The number of hotels accommodating asylum seekers has fallen from a peak of 400 in 2023, when costs reached £9m a day, to just more than 200 now, with a reduced daily cost of £5.5m, insiders say. In the first half of this year alone, the number of asylum seekers living in hotels fell by 6,000 – a 16% reduction.

Home Office figures show overall asylum costs have dropped by 11%, delivering £1bn in savings last year and a forecast of at least another £1bn to be saved next year. Ministers argue the closures show tangible progress, even as critics continue to highlight delays in processing claims and challenges in securing alternative housing.

Rising public anger over asylum accommodation has been fuelled by high-profile criminal cases and violent incidents. The Scottish Tory leader, Russell Findlay, defended protests outside a hotel housing asylum seekers after Sadeq Nikzad, a 29-year-old Afghan migrant, was jailed for nine years in June for the rape of a 15-year-old girl in October 2023.

Findlay said: “It’s understandable in those circumstances why communities would question the entire integrity and safety of the immigration system. As long as that’s being done lawfully and respectfully that is an entirely right way to protest.”

The fallout from the Epping asylum hotel ruling has also escalated tensions. The high court recently ordered the removal of asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in Essex after local Conservative-led councils mounted a legal challenge. The decision has emboldened other councils to consider similar action.

Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservatives, is hosting a call on Tuesday with Tory councillors, planning law experts and senior party strategists to discuss how councils can coordinate further legal challenges. Attenders include Lord Charles Banner KC; the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp; James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary; Holly Whitbread, a cabinet member at Epping Forest council; and John Cope, the chair of the Conservative councillors’ association.

The Guardian understands the session will aim to “help and encourage Conservative councils to take the lead in fighting to close asylum hotels in their constituency” and “give genuine advice based on a serious plan of action”.

A two-day trial begins on Tuesday at Chelmsford crown court of a man charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl outside the Bell hotel – a case that has fuelled anger locally and sparked fresh protests across Essex.

Despite highlighting falling costs, declining hotel use and tougher enforcement, Labour remains under political pressure. The government has pointed to new deals with France, Bulgaria, Romania, India, Vietnam and Iraq aimed at disrupting trafficking and speeding removals.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87cfad8443230183d9bc83422fc0a657c8bbd298/0_0_5002_4000/master/5002.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00efbea264844cff475ca63bcc6a8ddd",N,,2025-08-26 00:56:27.366837

Khaki said the citizenship clinic typically occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall.
“There isn’t a code a person can point to and say, ‘Oh, here are all the people who are lawfully present under immigration law,’” Gómez said.

To participate in the clinic, people must first attend an information session. This fall, Human Rights Officer Shafina Khaki said the Human Rights Division is keeping immigrant communities informed with safety as a top priority.

Khaki said the citizenship clinic typically occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall. She said participants expressed concerns and fear about their safety due to the current political climate.

“Many residents need more details and explanations on how to navigate this political climate and the laws that are coming down in very real time,” Khaki said.

During the citizenship clinic on Sept. 13, attorneys from American Gateways, a nonprofit serving the low-income Central Texas immigrant community, will provide free assistance to the first 55 people to complete the N-400 application for naturalization, according to the clinic’s flyer. This clinic coincides with the citywide Welcoming Week, a series of events that recognize the contributions and presence of the immigrant community.

A common source of confusion is the distinction between lawful status and lawful presence, said Krystal Gómez, managing attorney at the Texas Immigration Law Council.

“There isn’t a code a person can point to and say, ‘Oh, here are all the people who are lawfully present under immigration law,’” Gómez said. “Lawful presence is not something that is defined in immigration law. It’s usually interpreted as somebody who is not accumulating unlawful presence.”

Some non-citizen students experienced confusion when paying for tuition after the Texas Dream Act was overturned on June 4. This law previously allowed them to qualify for in-state tuition if they resided in Texas for at least three years, graduated from or received the equivalent of a high school diploma in Texas and signed an affidavit agreeing to apply for legal status as soon as they were able to. Gómez said there have been different interpretations of the court order.

“What we’re seeing is essentially chaos,” Gómez said. “The court didn’t offer any kind of guidance on how schools should be implementing their court order, and as a result, we’ve had schools take various positions on what the court order means.”

Gómez said students can reach out to the council with questions to see if they have a pathway toward legal presence or if they need guidance from an immigration lawyer.

Khaki said the division partnered with the Texas Immigration Law Council to provide information sessions on recent immigration policy updates. The division also works closely with American Gateways during the citizenship clinic information sessions.

“That is a really critical spot for residents to come and to understand not only what the city of Austin is doing specifically, but who our partners are, who we’re working with, who we’re supporting here in our community,” Khaki said.

Whitney Drake, managing attorney at American Gateways, said applications for services are made via telephone.

“It doesn’t require people to travel to our office,” Drake said. “Requesting services with a nonprofit organization or having a consultation with a private attorney doesn’t put that individual at any increased risk. All of that information is confidential.”

Drake said American Gateways continues to receive requests for information and services, despite concerns from participants about moving forward with different types of applications.

“One trend that we are noticing is there is a lot of apprehension among the community that we work with to apply for benefits like immigration relief or a visa or things of that nature,” Drake said. “There’s a lot of fear right now.”

Khaki has been expanding the “Know Your Rights” program for the city to ensure people feel a “strong sense of safety and understanding.”

“It’s recognizing that there are immigrant communities that are really fearful of the various changes that are happening at the federal and the state level,” Khaki said. “As a human being who comes from this community, who understands those fears, I really recognize that we have to meet the moment and continue to evolve and understand that almost day-to-day, things are changing.”",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/07-21-25_pro-bono-immigration-help_JulianaBrandao.png,N,,2025-08-26 00:56:32.923402

But Washington is one of few states where DACA recipients will be able to keep their government health insurance — with some caveats.

In Washington, hundreds of DACA recipients, also known as ""Dreamers,"" will still be able to participate in the state’s health exchange. But they'll lose out on about $350 per month of additional federal benefits, according to the state's health benefits exchange. These benefits are federal tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies from the federal government that DACA recipients pay into with jobs they get with work authorization.

DACA first started as a program for children without legal status, so that they were protected from removal proceedings while they attended and completed high school or enrolled in the military when it was briefly allowed. They also received work authorization through the program as they got older. Many of those DACA recipients are now adults with U.S. citizen children of their own.

In 2024, the Biden administration changed the definition of ""lawfully present"" for Affordable Care Act eligibility so that DACA recipients were allowed to participate in state and federal health exchanges. But the Trump administration announced it was reversing that rule change in June.

""We could also see an increase in emergency room visits because of people foregoing preventive treatment,"" she added. ""These circumstances can strain the health care system and lead to challenges in providing timely, high-quality care and access to services.""

Washington DACA recipients who are currently in the state’s health exchange will still be able to keep their health insurance, Alongi said, and they're being notified of what will change for them.

For DACA recipients who need health insurance but can’t afford it, the state has already expanded its own health insurance program to provide Medicaid-like benefits to people without legal status who are considered low income.

That means those DACA recipients could get health insurance through the state. But there's a catch: The program has a waitlist of people wanting to apply.

Guard personnel will conduct training mid-September, ""And should be on duty shortly thereafter,” at several facilities across the state, the governor’s office said in a news release.

The duties of the Georgia National Guard personnel would include “administrative and logistic support tasks and requirements could include, but are not limited to, appointment scheduling, biometric collection, data entry, performing basic vehicle maintenance, and tracking vehicle fleet expenses/utilization.”

Supporting the tasks would allow more ICE agents to be in the field.

The soldiers and airmen “will remain under the control and direction of the Governor and Adjutant General of Georgia.”

The deployment is separate from the “D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force” mission.

“The GANG has a long history of partnering with federal, state and local agencies to ensure the safety and security of our communities, our state, and our nation,” Kemp’s office said.

The governor’s statement came amid reports that President Donald Trump was planning to deploy the National Guard to other major Democratic cities, including Baltimore, Chicago and New York. It also comes after the National Guard was deployed to Washington, D.C., with guns.

A statement from the Georgia National Guard clarified that it “currently has no units in support of the mission” in Washington, D.C.

Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey responded to the announcement Monday night: “Brian Kemp’s decision to deploy Georgia National Guard soldiers to respond to a manufactured crisis is a reckless abuse of state resources and a transparent ploy to win favor with Donald Trump and his MAGA base. Our state’s National Guard members signed up to respond to natural disasters and defend America in war, not be used by Brian Kemp as props in his political theater. They, and the Georgians they bravely stepped up to serve, deserve far better than this misuse of their sacrifice.”

In addition to receiving cease-and-desist orders from several states (Arizona, Illinois, Montana, and Ohio), and ongoing litigation against New Jersey state gaming regulators in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, KalshiEx LLC (Kalshi) is also now embroiled in litigation with regulators in Maryland and Nevada. Kalshi operates as a designated contract market, which allows adults in all 50 states to make financial trades on a broad range of topics — from sports to the weather.

Nevada

Earlier this year, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) issued a cease-and-desist order to Kalshi, notifying the company that it is unlawful to offer event-based contracts on sporting events and election unless it holds an approved license by the Nevada Gaming Commission. In response, Kalshi filed a federal lawsuit stating that it was not required to comply with state gaming laws because those laws were effectively preempted by the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and that it falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). A federal judge in the case granted Kalshi a significant win by temporarily enjoining NGCB from putting a halt to Kalshi’s sports-related futures contracts while the case was ongoing. In making this ruling, the court found, among other things, that Kalshi was likely to prevail on the merits when the case goes to trial.

Maryland

Like Nevada, Maryland’s Lottery and Gaming Control Agency issued a cease-and-desist order to Kalshi, alleging that the company was illegally offering sports gambling without a license. As the company did in Nevada, Kalshi sued Maryland’s gaming regulators in federal court and similarly argued that it was under the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC and that state law was preempted by the CEA.

However, in contrast to the Nevada proceedings, the district court in Maryland denied Kalshi’s request to stop Maryland’s gaming regulators from blocking Kalshi from offering its sports event contracts. The court’s ruling explained that it does not see a clear distinction between Kalshi’s sports event contracts and sports betting. Kalshi immediately filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

Why It Matters

The regulatory scrutiny and litigation facing Kalshi highlight a growing tension not just between courts in different judicial circuits, but between federal and state oversight of financial products. If courts side with state regulators, platforms like Kalshi may face significant operational hurdles and fragmented compliance requirements across different states. Conversely, a ruling favoring federal preemption could pave the way for broader adoption of event-based contracts nationwide. The outcomes of these cases could set important precedents for how similar platforms are regulated in the future, potentially reshaping the boundaries of federal preemption under the CEA and the jurisdiction of the CFTC, and opening new markets to businesses like Kalshi, including in states that have traditionally prohibited or strictly regulated sports wagering.

Kemp also emphasized that assigning the Georgia National Guard to work with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies is nothing new. The governor sent Guard troops to the Texas border with Mexico early last year, accusing the Biden administration of failing to secure the border.

Rather, they will be providing administrative and logistical support, including appointment scheduling, biometric collection, data entry, and performing basic vehicle maintenance in order to free up ICE personnel for law enforcement activities.

Nonetheless, Democrats criticized the deployment decision as unconstitutional and unsustainable.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an already once wrongfully deported Maryland man, has been detained by United States immigration authorities in Baltimore and now faces another potential and immediate deportation by the President Donald Trump administration, this time to Uganda.

Despite Abrego Garcia’s new detention on Monday, a blanket court order automatically pauses any effort by the Trump administration to immediately deport him and other immigrants who are challenging their detention.

Any immigrant seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court is covered by the order, which blocks their removal from the US until 16:00 (20:00 GMT) on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed. In June, the administration sued all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges to challenge the standard order.

Immigration officials in the US say they intend to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, according to a court filing Saturday, in what the man’s legal team describes as an act of “vindictiveness” by Trump’s administration.

Uganda, the east African nation where the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to deport him, recently agreed to a deal to accept certain deportees from the US.

The court filing said the idea of sending Abrego Garcia to Uganda came after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national, spoke at a rally before he turned himself in: “This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Abrego Garcia entered the offices of ICE in a downtown office building on Monday. His wife emerged without him a few minutes later with tears in her eyes.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said a lawsuit had been filed in a federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention, asking for an order that he not be deported. “I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

The face of Trump’s hardline immigration policies

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.

He then became the highest-profile case among more than 200 people sent to the notorious El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison as part of Trump’s crackdown on refugees, migrants and asylum seekers in the US. His case remains a major flashpoint for the Trump administration in its anti-immigration crackdown.

Department of Justice lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran citizen had been wrongly deported due to an “administrative error”.

Abrego Garcia was severely beaten and subjected to psychological torture in the El Salvador prison, his lawyers say.

The alleged abuse was detailed in court documents filed in Abrego Garcia’s civil lawsuit against the Trump administration in June, providing an account of his experiences following his deportation for the first time.

Abrego Garcia – who denies any wrongdoing – now stands accused of involvement in smuggling undocumented refugees and migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and other countries into the US between 2016 and earlier this year.

His trial in his human smuggling case is set to begin in January 2027.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member.

He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and asked a judge to dismiss the case on grounds of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee. He returned to his family in Maryland.

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his lawyers, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25234691293535-1755891766.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-25 20:57:13.650355

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit to fight his deportation until a court has heard his claim for protection, stating that the U.S. could place him in a country where “his safety cannot be assured.”

The lawsuit triggered a blanket court order that automatically pauses deportation efforts for two days. The order applies to immigrants in Maryland who are challenging their detention.

Within hours of Abrego Garcia’s detention, his lawyers spoke with Department of Justice attorneys and a federal judge in Maryland, who warned that Abrego Garcia cannot be removed from the U.S. “at this juncture” because he must be allowed to exercise his constitutional right to contest deportation.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said that overlapping court orders temporarily prohibit the government from removing Abrego Garcia, and that she would extend her own temporary restraining order barring his deportation.

Drew Ensign, a Justice Department attorney, told the judge that he understands Abrego Garcia’s “removal is not imminent” and that the process often takes time.

Crowd yells ‘shame!’

Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national, spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

“This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a interpreter. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

About 200 people gathered, prayed and crowded around Abrego Garcia while he walked into the offices for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore, where he was detained. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him, the crowd yelled, “Shame!”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi told Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office that Abrego Garcia “will no longer terrorize our country.”

Brief reunion with family

Abrego Garcia lived in Maryland for years with his American wife and children and worked in construction. He was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador because the Trump administration believed he was a member of the MS-13 gang, an allegation that Abrego Garcia denies.

His removal violated an immigration judge’s 2019 ruling that shielded him from deportation to his native country because he had “well-founded fear” of threats by a gang there.

Abrego Garcia’s wife sued to bring him back. Facing a U.S. Supreme Court order, the Trump administration returned him in June. He was subsequently charged in Tennessee with human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty and asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

The allegations stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Abrego Garcia was driving with nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. He was allowed to continue driving with a warning.

The Trump administration has said it wants to deport Abrego Garcia before his trial, alleging he is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member.

A federal judge in Tennessee determined that Abrego Garcia was not a flight risk or a danger. He was released from jail Friday afternoon and returned to his family in Maryland.

Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

What’s next?

Federal officials argue that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and that the immigration judge’s 2019 ruling deemed him eligible for expulsion, just not to his native El Salvador.

Attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told reporters Monday that Abrego Garcia is being held in a detention facility in Virginia. His lawyers don’t know when he’ll have a reasonable-fear interview, where he can express fears of persecution or torture in the country the U.S. wants to send him. Officials have said it’s Uganda.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have raised concerns about human rights abuses in Uganda as well as his limited ability to speak English in a country where that’s the national language. But there are also unanswered questions about whether he could be imprisoned or sent on to El Salvador. A judge blocked the U.S. from sending Abrego Garcia back in 2019 because he faces credible threats from gangs there.

Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

“We don’t know whether Uganda will even let him walk around freely in Kampala or whether he’ll be inside of a Ugandan jail cell, much less whether they are going to let him stay,” the attorney said.

If immigration officials determine that Abrego Garcia lacks a reasonable fear of being sent to Uganda, he should be able to ask a U.S. immigration judge to review that decision, Sandoval-Moshenberg said. And if the immigration judge upholds the determination, Abrego Garcia should be able to bring it to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

Sandoval-Moshenberg said that’s the process when someone is slated for deportation to their native country. And he said it should be for third-country deportations as well.

“This is all so very new and unprecedented. ... We will see what the government’s position on that is,” he said.

Abrego Garcia informed ICE over the weekend that Costa Rica was an acceptable country of removal because he had “received assurances from Costa Rica that they would give him refugee status, that he would be at liberty in that country, and that he will not be re-deported onto El Salvador,” his lawyer said.

“Costa Rica is not justice,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “It is an acceptably less-bad option.”

The notice to ICE about Costa Rica was separate from an offer made by federal prosecutors in Tennessee to send Abrego Garcia to the Central American nation in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Family members of the two people arrested in East Palo Alto did not wish to share further details about the arrests that the San Mateo County Rapid Response Network said were targeted.

“They did not pick people up from the street, so it wasn’t random,” said an operator with the San Mateo County network, who declined to be named, citing concerns over personal safety. “They came looking for a particular address and picked up particular people.

While past police raids have been mistaken for ICE activity, Monday’s confirmed ICE sightings sparked fear on social media platforms like Facebook, where East Palo Alto residents shared videos purportedly of the arrests.

The modern debate over amici isn’t an abstract fight about court culture; it’s playing out in the highest-stakes cases, with business groups and federal regulators often on opposite sides of the “v.” Consider the Supreme Court’s decision last Term in Diamond Alternative Energy, where Justice Jackson warned in dissent that decisions about who gets in the courthouse door risk “beget[ting] judicial overreach” and feeding “the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens.” In the same opinion, she cautioned that the Court must avoid any “appearance of favoritism toward well-heeled litigants,” a concern that lands squarely on the terrain where heavyweight amici and the United States regularly collide.

Outside the courtroom, the political branches are watching—and pointing to concrete flashpoints. In April 2024, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse pressed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to explain its “outrageous and unwarranted” lawsuit targeting the CFPB’s credit-card late-fee rule, casting the case as a test of whose interests are being advanced through litigation strategy.

The Role of Amici

None of this unfolds in a vacuum. Scholars have long documented what Kearney and Merrill termed the “rising tide” of amicus practice at the Supreme Court—so much so that “cases without amicus briefs have become nearly as rare as cases with amicus briefs were at the beginning of the century.” They also flagged the Court’s practical “open door” for amici: nearly all motions for leave are granted, and the briefs are widely available to the Justices and their chambers. (For more see Box-Steffensmeir et al., Larsen and Devins, and Feldman and Bruhl).

According to scholar Paul Collins, the reason the practice endures is that, for the Court, amicus briefs are not just advocacy—chambers use them to surface “new or alternative legal positions,” to digest “social scientific and factual information,” and to gauge the “policy implications” of potential rules. Scholars also describe a set of Court-facing channels where amici matter: modest effects on outcomes, contributions to the ideological direction of decisions, and—most consistently—inputs into the content and presence of opinions; at the agenda stage, the volume of amicus filings operates as a credible signal of policy stakes and is among the better predictors of cert grants. Judges and clerks, in interviews, report that high-quality amicus filings can help with technical or implementation questions and, at times, are reflected in citations or adopted arguments—uses that are practical for the Court even when the measurable effect on win-loss rates is limited.

On the ground, the players are familiar. As one of my prior overviews of the 2021 Term noted, amici “are meant to help convince the justices to vote one way or another,” and the docket is populated by repeat players—including the Chamber of Commerce—alongside the United States, the ACLU, and ideologically oriented organizations.

How This Article Proceeds

This article takes that conversation out of the abstract and into a targeted slice of Supreme Court work where these dynamics are most visible: merits cases from the 2022–2024 Terms in which the federal government—either the United States itself or a federal agency—is a party and interest-group amici filed. It is not a study of “amicus success” in the aggregate. Instead, this article focuses on two practitioner-facing questions: first, how frequently particular interest groups aligned with the government’s litigating position (and whether those alignments shift when “the government” is disaggregated into the United States versus federal agencies), and second, how often individual Justices aligned with those same groups in these government-party cases.

It is also worth noting that the data entirely consist of cases decided during the Biden Presidency and the amici’s positions should be taken with the understanding that they were filed based on this administration’s positions. This article does not make normative claims; it describes which groups most often align with government positions. Also, the data is based on the Supreme Court’s dockets, so groups that are listed as “et al.” in the docket are not directly mentioned or measured in this piece.

The data, consisting of 1,192 briefs filed in 82 cases (averaging 14.5 briefs per case) that follow are designed for lawyers who brief, litigate, and advise around the federal government’s position—showing which repeat players file most often in these cases, where their alignments actually sit, and which comparisons are clear enough to plan around.

Who Files and Why It Matters: Top Interest-Group Amici

This article focuses on repeat players—named interest-group amici that file frequently when the federal government is a party—and uses a simple descriptive metric: the share of their filings that aligned with the government’s litigating position (combining the United States and federal agencies for this section).

District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland ruled from the bench on Monday, Aug. 25, that the government cannot deport Abrego Garcia until she can hold a hearing on his latest lawsuit challenging his deportation.

Xinis’ order came just hours after U.S. immigration agents detained Abrego Garcia when he reported to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore for what his attorneys had been told was a mandatory check-in. Agents detained him within 60 seconds of his arrival, said his attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg.

Abrego Garcia’s detention is the latest chapter in a case that started back in March when he was stopped near his home in Maryland and deported to a Salvadoran mega-prison. The case has fueled outrage over the Trump administration’s hardline deportation policies.

Abrego Garcia has spent more than five months in detention, including time in his native El Salvador at a prison known for its harsh conditions. Last week, he was released from criminal custody in Tennessee and returned to his home in the Washington suburb of Beltsville, Maryland.

At the hearing on Monday, Xinis stressed that the government was “absolutely forbidden at this juncture” from removing Abrego Garcia from the United States.

The government's attorney, Drew Ensign, said Abrego Garcia's deportation was not imminent and that it takes time to remove someone to another country. Still, the administration is adamant that he will not be allowed to remain in the United States.

""ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia & are processing him for deportation,"" the White House said in a social media post. ""@POTUS is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, & child predator to terrorize American citizens..."" - @Sec_Noem.""

Abrego Garcia, who has repeatedly denied those claims, arrived at the ICE office Monday with his wife and brother and was quickly surrounded by a crowd of supporters chanting ""Si se puede,"" Spanish for ""Yes we can."" He and his wife embraced in the building's lobby before proceeding through a security checkpoint.

Where is Abrego Garcia being held? Where could he be deported?

Sandoval-Moshenberg said his client is being held in a detention facilitiy in Virginia. U.S. officials have offered to deport him to Costa Rica if he pleads guilty to transporting migrants living illegally in the United States, his lawyers say. When he declined to enter a guilty plea, the U.S. government warned he could be deported to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers say they have entered plea discussions with the government to avoid deportation to Uganda, which they say would be ""far more dangerous"" than Costa Rica.

""They're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. ""They're weaponizing the immigration system in a way that's completely unconstitutional.""

'An acceptably less bad option'

Before his check-in with ICE, Abrego Garcia notified the government in writing that Costa Rica would be an acceptable country for the United States to send him after he received assurances from Costa Rica that he would be given refugee status there and would not be deported back to El Salvador, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

""For him to be removed to Costa Rica is not justice,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said, ""it is an acceptably less bad option.""

Xinis suggested during the hearing that, if Abrego Garcia is deported, federal law may require that he be sent to his country of choice, especially since Costa Rica has agreed to grant him refugee status and not send him back to El Salvador.

Abrego Garcia also filed a second notice with the U.S. government saying he feared removal to Uganda because of human rights abuses in that country and the lack of assurances that Uganda would not send him back to El Salvador, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

Because of that notice, Abrego Garcia is entitled to an interview, Sandoval-Moshenberg said, and the U.S. government cannot remove him from the country until that interview is granted.

Abrego Garcia claims he was beaten, tortured

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported and taken to the Terrorism Confinement Center, also known as CECOT, in Tecoluca, El Salvador, in March. The Trump administration has admitted in court documents that the deportation was a mistake, which it blamed it on an “administrative error.”

Abrego Garcia experienced ""severe beatings"" and ""psychological torture"" in the notorious high-security prison, his lawyers said in a court filing last month. The filing also says that Abrego Garcia experienced ""severe sleep deprivation"" and nutrition so inadequate that he lost 31 pounds.

Lawsuit filed in Maryland seeking to ban deportation

Abrego Garcia has filed a federal lawsuit in Maryland seeking an order to ban deporting him anywhere unless he has had the chance to contest being sent there. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has blamed “activist liberal judges” for blocking administration efforts to remove people living in the U.S. illegally who were suspected of committing crimes.

“By ordering this monster loose on America’s streets, this judge has shown a complete disregard for the safety of the American people,” Noem said. “We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.”

Trump administration has focused on Abrego Garcia

Abrego Garcia, a sheetmetal worker living in suburban Washington, became the face of President Donald Trump's sweeping and controversial deportation tactics.

Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally around 2012 as a teen. Immigration officials issued a final order of removal in 2019, but they said he could not be released to his home country of El Salvador because of credible fears of persecution by gangs in that country.

What Colorado laws does the Trump administration take issue with?
While it makes no mention about immigration enforcement, SB20-083 was signed into law just a year later.","DENVER — Gov. Jared Polis defended state laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement as he defied calls by the Trump administration to eliminate such laws or face legal consequences.

Earlier this month, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened Gov. Polis with legal action and the pulling of federal funds if he failed to respond by Aug. 19 with initiatives he was taking to rescind those laws.

In response, Polis rejected the idea that Colorado was a “sanctuary state,” saying he was “frustrated by the administration's mislabeling… despite conclusive evidence to the contrary,” and asked Bondi to remove the state from a list curated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) describing it as such.

“If ‘so-called sanctuary jurisdiction policies’ have ‘undermined this necessary cooperation and obstructed federal immigration enforcement,’ elsewhere in the country we cannot say, but that has not happened and is not happening here,” the response from Gov. Polis reads. “Thankfully, Colorado is not a sanctuary state.”

Polis then defended the legality of Colorado law, saying the state “fully cooperates with federal authorities in identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminals – regardless of immigration status,” and cited the recent signing of SB25-276 into law, which allows for state and local officials to share information with federal government to assist in criminal investigations or proceedings.

But the governor was also defiant in his response to Bondi as the government seeks to ramp up mass deportations — a key signature policy of the second Trump administration.

“Colorado, like many states, will not allow the federal government to commandeer our public safety resources, and our right to do so is protected by the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution,” the governor wrote, adding state laws require compliance with “valid federal laws.”

Read the full response from Gov. Polis here or in the embed below.

The Tenth Amendment establishes the bounds of the federal government’s authority by balancing its vast power against state sovereignty.

That power has been challenged in court rulings over the past 30 years, which have repeatedly found that the federal government cannot compel states and local jurisdictions to carry out or enforce federal immigration policies. Other rulings have found that threatening states with federal funding cuts is likely unconstitutional, according to the National Immigration Forum.

That hasn’t stopped the Department of Justice from trying to get Colorado and other jurisdictions to eliminate its laws limiting cooperation with U.S. and Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) — with little success.

In late July, a federal judge threw out a Trump administration lawsuit against Illinois and the City of Chicago to upend so-called “sanctuary policies” that interfered with Trump’s mass deportation plans, calling the suit an “end-run around the Tenth Amendment.”

And just last Friday, a second federal judge ruled the Trump administration cannot deny federal funding to cities like Denver because of policies that limit cooperation with ICE, saying in his ruling the executive orders enacted by the Trump administration to do as such were an unconstitutional “coercive threat.”

In a statement, Polis spokeswoman Ally Sullivan decried the state’s labeling as a sanctuary state as well as “the lack of transparency from the federal administration on this and many other items,” while outlining the governor’s focus on improving public safety and apprehending dangerous criminals — whether they are in the country legally or not.

“The Governor encourages the federal administration – and Congress – to focus on actually securing the border, decreasing violent crime, increasing transparency, and passing real immigration reform,” she said.

What Colorado laws does the Trump administration take issue with?

Since taking full control of the state government in 2019, Colorado Democrats have passed several laws aimed at making life easier for undocumented immigrants.

In 2019, Polis signed HB19-1124, one of the most oft cited laws by Colorado Republicans unhappy with the state’s immigration policies. Officially known as the “Protect Colorado Residents From Federal Government Overreach Act,” the law prevents law enforcement officers from arresting or detaining someone on the basis of their immigration status or holding someone past their release from jail just so they can be immediately detained by immigration agents.

While it makes no mention about immigration enforcement, SB20-083 was signed into law just a year later. The law protects individuals from being arrested for civil infractions while they are inside a courthouse or while on their way to or from court proceedings.

In 2021, Gov. Polis then signed SB21-131 into law, which prohibits state employees from looking into a person’s immigration status and sharing that information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), unless it’s to comply with a court-issued subpoena, warrant or order.

Two years later, Polis signed HB23-1100 into law, which further restricts state cooperation with immigration enforcement officials by prohibiting any state agency or local government from entering into agreements with private entities for the detention of in individuals in immigration detention facilities.

Earlier this year, Polis signed the latest measure expanding protections for immigrants without legal status. SB25-276 prohibits local government officials and employees from sharing personal identifying information about someone’s immigration status with ICE, and limits where immigration agents can go within a public child care facility, school, hospital or library without a warrant signed by a judge.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/66c9454/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x2873+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2F4b%2F73b2622a4c9f9087de6cb265c418%2Fap-20203752374316.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 19:56:41.478776

The case has become emblematic of Trump's crackdown on illegal migration.","A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the deportation to Uganda of a Salvadoran man at the center of a row over US President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March and then sent back to the United States, was arrested in Baltimore on Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on X.

Abrego Garcia, 30, who was released last week from a jail in Tennessee, where he is facing human smuggling charges, and allowed to go home to Maryland pending trial, ""will be processed for removal to Uganda,"" the Department of Homeland Security said.

Lawyers for Abrego Garcia immediately filed a lawsuit contesting his deportation and District Judge Paula Xinis temporarily blocked his removal from the country while she holds further hearings on his case.

Abrego Garcia was required to check in with ICE in Baltimore on Monday as one of the conditions of his release.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia's lawyers, told a crowd of supporters outside the ICE field office that his client was immediately taken into custody when he turned up for the appointment.

""Shame, shame,"" chanted the protestors, who were holding signs reading ""Free Kilmar"" and ""Remove Trump.""

The attempt to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda adds a new twist to a saga that became a test case for Trump's sprawling crackdown on illegal immigration -- and, critics say, his trampling of the law.

Abrego Garcia had been living in the United States under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.

Then he became one of more than 200 people sent to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison in March as part of Trump's crackdown on undocumented migrants.

But Justice Department lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran had been wrongly deported due to an ""administrative error.""

He was returned to US soil only to be detained again in Tennessee on human smuggling charges.

- 'Completely unconstitutional' -

Abrego Garcia denies any wrongdoing, while the Trump administration alleges he is a violent MS-13 gang member involved in smuggling of other undocumented migrants.

On Thursday, when it became clear that Abrego Garcia would be released the following day, government officials made him a plea offer: remain in custody, plead guilty to human smuggling and be deported to Costa Rica.

He declined the offer.

""That they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

The case has become emblematic of Trump's crackdown on illegal migration.

Right-wing supporters praise the Republican president's toughness, but legal scholars and human rights advocates have blasted what they say is a haphazard rush to deport people without even a court hearing, in violation of basic US law.

His wife Melissa says he is a legal green card holder and is also a disabled veteran, injured during his time in the service.

According to CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Zahid Chaudhry was at a naturalization hearing in Tukwilia when he was detained.

Melissa says he is a devoted father and family man and a community leader who advocates heavily for veterans.

She spoke as part of the ""emergency protest"" Sunday, calling for his release.

""This is an incredible show of support on 48 hours notice,"" she said.

Melissa says Zahid was born in Pakistan, and lived in the US for 25 years. Although he remains in detainment, she said she was finally allowed to talk to him behind a barrier of plexiglass this weekend.

""His beaming smile is the same. Bless his beautiful heart. He is under a lot of pressure. He is psychologically extremely lonely and being kept in isolation. He is having a lot of difficulty getting any communication out,"" said Melissa.

Melissa says Zahid signed up to serve the county before 911,and was severely injured during training, and over worries about his health.

""He was on active duty, activated for Iraqi Freedom. He suffered multiple injuries to his back and his neck, at least one of which included a trampling by his brother soldiers in full battle rattle as they were leaping off a truck,"" said Melissa. She is pictured speaking to the crowd below Sunday.

""We are calling for his immediate release and naturalization,"" said Micaela Romero, digital organizer and communication, Washington Community Action Network (WACAN). ""This is us coming together the way he would want. Zahid is a light in our community. We are just demanding he get the citizenship that he deserved.""

Melissa says he is active with a local chapter of ""Veterans for Peace"". Zahid previously spoke to FOX 13 during a memorial tribute to UW graduate Aysenur Eygi in September 2024 after she was shot and killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank.

""I couldn’t hold my tears yesterday, it’s Rachel Corrie all over again. Twenty-one years ago, it was Rachel Corrie,"" said Zahid, during that 2024 interview. He was referencing another local woman who was killed by an Israeli bulldozer back in 2003. The picture below is from that interview.

""He was doing it the right way, and they arrested him and have him in there now,"" said Alex Scheel, member of About Face: Veterans Against the War. ""His detainment is totally unjustified. He was going to his regular appointments.""

Scheel says he didn't know Zahid personally, but understands his advocacy as a fellow veteran.

""We all learn lessons in the miliary. We all have different experiences, but us in ""About Face"" and ""Veterans for Peace"" understand that the wars that happen over there, the occupations that happen over in Palestine and Iraq and Afghanistan and Somalia all over the world, come back and haunt us,"" said Scheel.

Romero says the protest Sunday is part of ""a week of action"" by WACAN.

As for next steps, Melissa says Zahid was given a stay by a judge from the 9th circuit court, so the family is working on getting him released so he can work on his legal case from home.

""We are asking the judge for a custody re-determination, saying he does not have to be kept behind bars. He has always shown up for all of his hearings. He’s not a flight risk, not a threat. Bring him back to us while things work their way through,"" said Melissa.

""If we believe in the constitution, then immigration is a civil matter, not criminal, and no one should be kept behind bars like this.""

FOX 13 reached out to ICE to ask why he was detained, and we are waiting to hear back.

Attorney General James argues these policies unlawfully endanger families, undermine public safety for all New Yorkers, and threaten the integrity of the justice system.
“Courthouses are dedicated to the pursuit of justice, not targeted harassment and arrests,” said Attorney General James.
Attorney General James argues that millions of immigrants, including 640,000 undocumented New Yorkers, are essential to the state’s workforce, tax base, and civic life.
Attorney General James emphasizes that New York has already fought and won against unlawful courthouse arrests.","NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today took action to stop U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) alarming practice of making arrests in federal immigration courthouses. In an amicus brief filed in African Communities Together v. Lyons, Attorney General James urged the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to block new federal policies that authorize widespread arrests in immigration courthouses and allow the federal government to abruptly dismiss immigrants’ cases. Attorney General James argues these policies unlawfully endanger families, undermine public safety for all New Yorkers, and threaten the integrity of the justice system.

“Courthouses are dedicated to the pursuit of justice, not targeted harassment and arrests,” said Attorney General James. “With these cruel and unlawful courthouse arrests, the federal government is weaponizing fear to push immigrants into the shadows, drive families apart, and risk everyone’s safety. I will not stand by while New Yorkers are stripped of their rights and our courts are used for intimidation.”

Attorney General James argues that arresting individuals as they appear for immigration hearings chills participation not only in immigration court, but across the entire justice system. As a result of this unlawful policy, immigrant New Yorkers are more likely to be afraid to testify in state and local courts, pursue orders of protection against their abusers, or generally participate in critical court hearings. This chilling effect makes it harder for prosecutors to hold criminals accountable and denies victims their day in court, undermining public safety for all New Yorkers.

Attorney General James explains that because these policies prevent immigrants from pursuing their immigration cases without risking arrest and deportation, they drive people into the shadows, where fear prevents families from reporting crimes, seeking health care, or accessing other vital services. This erosion of trust leaves entire communities more vulnerable to violence, exploitation, and public health risks. When parents are too afraid to bring their children to the doctor, communicable diseases spread more easily; when families avoid schools or places of worship, children’s education and community ties suffer. Attorney General James underscores the dire consequences of these fears, pointing to a tragic case in which a child died after his parents delayed seeking medical care because they feared hospital officials would report them to immigration authorities.

The brief also highlights the devastating toll these policies take on families and communities. Attorney General James argues that millions of immigrants, including 640,000 undocumented New Yorkers, are essential to the state’s workforce, tax base, and civic life. These courthouse arrests and detentions – which are occurring before the immigrants have a chance to prove their legal right to remain in the United States – rip parents from their children, destabilize households, and impose deep and lasting trauma. Arbitrary courthouse arrests and case dismissals are especially harmful to children who are left to cope with financial instability, food and housing insecurity, and the loss of a primary caregiver. Research shows that these children face extreme psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD, effects that often persist well into adulthood. As a result, states are forced to shoulder the burden, providing costly social services and support to families left in crisis.

Attorney General James emphasizes that New York has already fought and won against unlawful courthouse arrests. In 2020, Attorney General James secured a landmark ruling preventing the first Trump administration from making civil immigration arrests in and around state courthouses, and that same year, New York codified that protection through the Protect Our Courts Act. Attorney General James argues that the federal government’s new policies, however, revive many of the same harms New York’s laws were designed to end, now targeting immigrants in federal immigration courthouses.

Attorney General James is urging the court to stay enforcement of these dangerous and unlawful policies while litigation continues, to protect immigrant rights and safeguard the integrity of courts in New York and across the country.",https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/oag-social-preview.png,N,,2025-08-25 17:56:49.470703

America is a country that prizes freedom and the rule of law. Yet every day, we hear news of ICE raids on construction sites, Venezuelans shipped to foreign prisons without hearings, and sports tattoos treated as proof of criminality.

Delivered at the 2025 Objectivist Summer Conference, her talk is now available online.

While the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has made the headlines recently, Vergara Cid shows that the same lawlessness has spanned decades. The Obama administration, notorious for its record deportations, simply carried forward policies Congress had long codified.

Trump’s crackdowns threaten to further erode due process, which Vergara Cid identifies as the crucial legal safeguard which “stands between you and authoritarianism.” Today’s victims are peaceful immigrants; tomorrow, the target could be any American who dares to challenge the state.

Öztürk, a Turkish national and PhD student at Tufts University, was detained this spring and held in an ICE facility in Louisiana for six weeks before a federal judge ordered her release.

Öztürk was arrested under a rarely invoked statute after she co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper supporting student government resolutions critical of Israel's military conduct in Gaza. In her habeas petition, she asserted that the government had retaliated against her for exercising her protected First Amendment rights.

""Without presuming to speak for all of Jewish America—a diverse community that holds a multitude of viewpoints—amici are compelled to file this brief because the detention of Rümeysa Öztürk for her protected speech violated the most basic constitutional rights,"" the organizations say in their brief, emphasizing that freedom of expression, particularly on matters of public concern, is a cornerstone of American democracy and extends to academic settings and campus discourse.

In the appeal, the government is arguing that the Immigration and Nationality Act stripped the Vermont federal court of the right to review Öztürk's habeas petition and that she was first required to pursue her First Amendment claims in immigration court before obtaining a federal court hearing. As amici emphasize, meaningful review of First Amendment claims generally means rapid, prioritized review. ""Further, any regime under which Öztürk remains in detention for months despite a fundamental violation of her First Amendment rights sends a strong signal to all other potential noncitizen speakers that they risk detention, however ultimately unlawful, if they raise their voices in protest.""

The brief also expresses concern regarding any suggestion that actions taken against Öztürk are necessary to combat antisemitism: ""The government . . . appears to be exploiting Jewish Americans' legitimate concerns about antisemitism as pretext for undermining core pillars of American democracy, the rule of law, and the fundamental rights of free speech and academic debate on which this nation was built.""

Drawing on historical context, amici note that many Jewish Americans are especially attuned to the dangers of government actions taken in response to political expression, emphasizing that the protection of free speech has long served as a safeguard for minority communities in the United States, and that its erosion, particularly when connected to academic or political discourse, warrants close scrutiny.

“The government is paying other countries to take immigrants, as if these people are goods that can be bartered.","(OSV News) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident at the center of a high-profile immigration case, surrendered to U.S. immigration authorities in Baltimore on Aug. 25, and faces possible deportation to Uganda, a nation that recently agreed to accept certain deportees from the U.S., even those that have no ties to the country like Abrego Garcia.

His detention comes just days after he was released from a jail in Tennessee on Aug. 22, more than five months after his arrest and deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador that U.S. courts later found unlawful. He returned to his family in Maryland, and was expected to be detained at his check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, on Aug. 25.

J. Kevin Appleby, senior fellow for policy at the Center for Migration Studies in New York and the former director of migration policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, told OSV News, “Deporting him to Uganda far away from his family reveals the cruelty embedded in this administration’s immigration policies.”

“It sends a signal that this administration will stop at nothing to remove certain immigrants, even if they have a legal basis to remain,” Appleby said. “Part of the message to immigrants here is self deport or we will send you to a third country on another continent. He is being used to create even greater fear among immigrants, even those with legal status.”

Although the government acknowledged in court filings that there was an administrative error in deporting Abrego Garcia to a prison in El Salvador, the Trump administration said it was not seeking his return to the U.S. Abrego Garcia, who is married to a U.S. citizen and has a 5-year-old child, has not been convicted of a crime.

The Trump administration has alleged Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, but his lawyers have said there is no evidence he is in that gang.

In a post on X, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, “ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and are processing him for deportation.”

“President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,” she said.

According to his lawyers, Abrego Garcia has not been convicted of a crime — he was only charged with smuggling unauthorized immigrants after his return from El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison, which was reportedly described by a warden there as a “cemetery of the living dead.” Abrego Garcia has protested his innocence.

Abrego Garcia reportedly declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, but DHS said in a separate post on X they would process him for deportation to Uganda.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to carry out deportations of some immigrants, who lack legal authorization to live and work in the U.S., that are “known as “third-country removals.” The people subject to these orders are sent to countries not specifically identified in their removal orders or to countries with which they have no preexisting ties.

Vivana Westbrook, state and local advocacy attorney for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, also known as CLINIC, said in a statement shared with OSV News, “We are deeply disappointed in the treatment of not only Kilmar, but so many others across the country who are being separated from their families and kept in deplorable conditions in detention centers within the United States.”

“Our values as a Catholic community to uphold the dignity of every person are directly contrary to the prospect of sending immigrants to third countries where they have no family or friendly connections, where they do not know the culture, where they could be separated from their loved ones by thousands of miles, where there could be severe human rights problems or conflict zones, where they might even remain in detention, and often, where they do not speak the language,” Westbrook said. “The government is paying other countries to take immigrants, as if these people are goods that can be bartered. We do not have access to those agreements so have no assurance that these countries will respect the basic human rights of the people they receive.”

“The cruelty and vindictive treatment of migrants needs to be widely rejected,” Westbrook added. “We need to demand better from our political leaders.”

Jaime Contreras, 32BJ SEIU executive vice president and SEIU Latino Caucus chair, said in a statement, “Trump’s unrelenting and inhumane hunt to single out an individual and ignoring court decisions is not just un-constitutional but puts all Americans in danger.”

“Deporting Kilmar Garcia halfway around the world is a shameful and is a shocking picture for the entire world to see that damages our standing in the world even further,” Contreras said. “The bottom line is that Garcia deserves to be free.”

OSV News reached out to the Baltimore Archdiocese for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church instructs that the “more prosperous nations are obliged, to the extent they are able, to welcome the foreigner in search of the security and the means of livelihood which he cannot find in his country of origin.” The Catholic Church’s teaching also makes clear human laws regulating migration are also subject to divine justice, but it has not yet issued official teaching exploring the morality of deportation beyond the magisterium of St. John Paul II.

The late pontiff’s 1993 encyclical “Veritatis Splendor” (“Splendor of Truth”) and 1995 encyclical “Evangelium Vitae” (“The Gospel of Life”) both quote the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes,” the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, naming “deportation” — without defining it — among various specific acts “offensive to human dignity” that “are a disgrace, and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer injustice, and they are a negation of the honor due to the Creator.”

Being attorney general of a blue state during a Trump administration has proved to be a high-stakes launching pad.","Attorneys general from around New England struck a defiant posture at a town hall gathering on a recent Friday evening.

Together they pledged that nothing is off the table when it comes to holding immigration officials accountable, lauded the courts for standing firm so far, and pointed at an ever-growing pile of litigation targeting the Trump administration’s actions on everything from energy policy to anti-discrimination law.

“All of us probably have a target on our back,” Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said, speaking from the IBEW Local 103 union hall in Dorchester. “But we say bring it on.”

The town hall included the region’s Democratic AGs — Campbell, William Tong of Connecticut, Peter Neronha of Rhode Island, Charity Clark of Vermont and Aaron Frey of Maine. Billed as “United in Justice,” the gathering was distinctly aimed at Trump administration policies that the group has declared will damage the region and its residents.

Attorneys general, advocacy organizations, and individuals have leveled dozens of lawsuits at the Trump administration. They say that executive actions targeting immigration, the global economy, public health and scientific research funding, higher education, and marginalized groups are “unlawful” and “damaging.”

“After last November’s election and the anxiety that goes with it, we all felt our fight was gonna get a little tougher, a little steeper, and our work a lot harder,” said introductory speaker Lou Antonellis, business manager of the Dorchester union and executive vice president of the building and construction trades with the Greater Boston Labor Council. “And those words ring truer and truer every day for Americans because of this administration. Unless, of course, you’re rich.”

A union member at the town hall noted the administration’s antagonism toward renewable energy options, when unions are training their members on offshore wind work. Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in Boston federal court this month to block Trump’s pause on all federal wind-energy approvals.

Being attorney general of a blue state during a Trump administration has proved to be a high-stakes launching pad. Gov. Maura Healey made a national name for herself as attorney general by, like her successor Campbell, taking an aggressive stance toward the first Trump presidency. Her office sued the administration nearly 100 times, while Campbell has filed more than a dozen suits against the administration in the first 100 days of the new Trump term.

Immigration’s ‘tricky spot’

State law enforcement officials are in a tricky spot when it comes to defending against some federal policies, the attorneys general noted, especially around immigration. Multiple attendees asked what the state can do to push back on what one described as an “autocratic police state.”

There is significant federal authority to enforce and create immigration policies, placing the attorneys general in “uncharted territory” in figuring out how to wield state power against federal actors.

The offices are putting out guidance for individuals and organizations, fighting against policy changes that would claw back immigration protections like Temporary Protected Status, connecting people with lawyers, and reminding law enforcement that it does not need to enable Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Campbell spoke complimentarily of the decision by Worcester’s police chief to request that charges be dropped against the distraught 16-year-old daughter of a woman arrested in an ICE incident that has drawn intense backlash.

But “nothing is off the table” when it comes to pushing back on ICE oversteps, she said.

“If the US attorney can threaten us about us getting in the way of these policies and immigration enforcement, well guess what? We can bring it back,” Campbell said, adding slyly, “in a collaborative and loving way.”

Neronha, of Rhode Island, said withholding cooperation to federal agents looking to “commandeer” state law enforcement could be a serious impediment to ICE efforts.

He also laid out how he sees the administration’s playbook in general: bypass congressional power of the purse, strip allocated taxpayer dollars from essential programs or make sweeping declarations on constitutional matters, and challenge the legitimacy of district courts when they issue nationwide injunctions blocking the president’s actions.

“What we’re dealing with here, in my view, is a creeping authoritarianism,” he said. “And it’s not really creeping, is it?” To constituents who are looking for hope, he asked that they remember “every day there are lawyers who get up in the morning, like my colleagues here and all across the country in Democratic states, and fight for you. We are your lawyers. We are fighting for you, and we are winning.”

The latest legal volley from a collective of Democratic attorneys general – including the five New England AGs participating in the town hall – challenges a federal threat to withhold billions of dollars in transportation and disaster-relief funds unless states agree to cooperate with certain immigration enforcement actions.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in an emailed statement to Axios that no funding has been withheld.

New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella, who was elected president of The National Association of Attorneys General in December and has not joined attorney general coalitions suing the Trump administration during this second term, is the only Republican attorney general in New England and was the only regional AG not present. A spokesperson said Formella had a full schedule for New Hampshire law enforcement memorial day, but the spokesman was not aware of Friday night’s town hall.

As attorney general of the most conservative New England state – though it narrowly voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election – Formella’s office does not always split along partisan lines. He joined other Republican attorneys general in suits against former President Joe Biden, such as a volley against a vaccination-testing mandate, but also brought a civil rights lawsuit in 2024 against members of the neo-Nazi group Nationalist Social Club-131 who allegedly harassed a Concord cafe hosting drag story hours.

The day before the town hall, Campbell and Tong joined Democratic attorneys general from New Jersey, Washington, and California after US Supreme Court arguments on Trump’s executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship for the children of parents who enter the US illegally or on a temporary visa.

Tong noted on Friday that so far the “courts are holding,” but some of the voices in the current administration are still talking about potentially “de-naturalizing” American citizens like his parents, Tong said.

The case currently before the nation’s high court is ostensibly about whether lower court judges can issue injunctions halting presidential executive orders nationwide – rather than only applying to a specific set of plaintiffs who bring suits inside specific jurisdictions – but justices toyed with whether they should consider the underlying merits of the birthright citizenship suit as well.

“I think what’s most important is not just the limited argument today,” Campbell said. “It’s that everyone should care about this birthright citizenship issue. It is not just about the access to citizenship and the privileges afforded by citizenship. If they can dismantle the 14th Amendment in our Constitution, they can also dismantle the other rights and privileges afforded our residents.”

The president took to his social media platform, Truth Social, after the arguments before the Supreme Court.

“The Radical Left SleazeBags, which has no cards remaining in its illegal bag of tricks, is, in a very coordinated manner, PLAYING THE REF with regard to the United States Supreme Court,” he posted. “They lost the Election in a landslide, and with it, have totally lost their confidence and reason. They are stone cold CRAZY! I hope the Supreme Court doesn’t fall for the games they play. The people are with us in bigger numbers than ever before. They want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”

Trump continued lashing out throughout Friday after the US Supreme Court maintained a block on his deportations under wartime law.

The US government is ultimately “an honor system,” Tong said, constructed of people bound together by belief and commitment to democratic principles. No higher power is going to force Trump to comply with the rule of law, but the country is too diverse and decentralized to be “swallowed whole” by any one administration, he added

“Be as noisy and chaotic and boisterous as we can be,” he said, “in every state and every jurisdiction, and make it hard for them every step of the way.”

But human rights laws and other conventions can’t be cherry-picked.
Universal human rights became Labour’s defining mantra in the 1990s, when Tony Blair substituted the party’s red flag of workers’ control with the red rose of the brotherhood of man.
With the nation deemed an oppressive “construct”, mass immigration guaranteed by universal human rights was seen as the means to better humanity.
That’s what the human rights culture has done.","With estimates of up to 1.2 million illegal migrants in Britain, last year 38 per cent more small boats landed on UK shores than during the previous year. More than 32,000 asylum seekers are currently accommodated in hotels, a higher number than when the government came to power.

The crisis has been exacerbated by a High Court ruling that will force the Home Office to relocate up to 138 asylum seekers from the Bell Hotel in Epping because it didn’t have planning permission to become a transit camp.

Now, other local authorities are lining up to bring similar cases to court to shut their own areas’ asylum hotels, which are acting as dangerous flashpoints for local anger. It is, therefore, hardly surprising that, according to a YouGov poll for The Times, 71 per cent of voters believe the prime minister is handling the asylum hotel issue badly, including 56 per cent of Labour voters.

Britain is the destination of choice for illegal migrants because it’s where they know they can disappear and almost never be sent back or deprived of numerous benefits. And that’s because the British courts are punctilious about observing the provisions of human rights law and other relevant international conventions.

More and more voices are now saying Britain must extricate itself from these conventions, at least in part. The government itself has inched in this direction. It has set up a review of Article 8 of the European human rights convention, which lays down the right to respect for private and family life that has frustrated many attempts to remove illegal migrants.

But human rights laws and other conventions can’t be cherry-picked. Nigel Farage understands this, which is why he is announcing his proposal for the “mass deportation” of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, if his party gets into power, by scrapping human rights laws altogether and derogating from other international treaties.

Whatever the possibly unworkable details of his plans, the small boats crisis can’t be ended without scrapping these international laws and conventions. Yet Sir Keir Starmer won’t do this because the principles underlying them are an article of faith for the party and the left in general. Universal human rights became Labour’s defining mantra in the 1990s, when Tony Blair substituted the party’s red flag of workers’ control with the red rose of the brotherhood of man.

This was far more than a slick rebranding exercise. It reflected a profound shift in progressive circles — and the Tories meekly fell into line — towards universalism and multiculturalism; the notion that it was racist for a western nation to privilege its own culture over any other. The nation was viewed with contempt as the source of division, bigotry and war. The very idea of policing its borders was considered racist. With the nation deemed an oppressive “construct”, mass immigration guaranteed by universal human rights was seen as the means to better humanity.

So, the prospect of sending migrants back to oppressive regimes was regarded as an utter anathema.

It is, indeed, a moral obligation to help refugees from persecution, within manageable limits. But there’s certainly no obligation to admit people in unmanageable numbers or those who may pose a danger to Britain, either because they themselves subscribe to extremist ideologies or because they won’t assimilate to core principles such as respect for women or people from other faiths.

Allowing them in, as Farage said, is to privilege the rights of people from abroad over the rights of British people. That’s the inevitable consequence of universalism, which destroys the bargain of citizenship between individuals and their nation.

That’s what the human rights culture has done. That’s why the government is no longer able to police the nation’s borders — without which it no longer runs a meaningful nation, which it despises anyway. So with citizenship trashed, politicians and the police are now held in contempt and the streets have become flashpoints because the rule of law, the hard currency of citizenship, no longer has any purchase. This is why Labour has lost the red wall.

Having trashed the very idea of the nation to which the working class is so passionately attached, the government can only come up with one feeble proposal after another to prevent itself from facing up to the destruction the progressive classes have wrought and which now threatens its own survival.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F19b6f0c5-c7dc-4c41-b861-36ad5cbd5afe.jpg?crop=1455%2C818%2C73%2C51&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-25 15:56:51.105937

Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was erroneously deported to his home country in March and held in the notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, becoming the face of President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation regime. After the Trump administration spent months claiming falsely that Abrego Garcia could not be recovered from El Salvador’s custody, he was returned to the U.S. in June and jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.

Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. His attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda on Saturday. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X Monday morning that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia, and DHS said in a statement that he was “being processed for removal to Uganda.”

DHS did not reply to The Intercept’s request for additional information prior to publication.

“Numerous agencies of the U.S. government have been tasked with trying to get rid of Mr. Abrego and to cover up the administration’s mistake in sending him to El Salvador,” said Yael Schacher, the director for the Americas and Europe at Refugees International. “In its punitive approach to deportation, the administration undercuts the whole premise of civil immigration law; in its transactional dealings with third countries, it undermines human rights and the protection of refugees worldwide.”

The United States is pursuing deals with around a third of the world’s nations to expel immigrants to places where they do not hold citizenship. Once exiled, these third-country nationals are sometimes detained, imprisoned, or in danger of being sent back to their countries of origin — which they may have fled to escape violence, torture, or political persecution.

The nations that the Trump administration is collaborating with to accept these expelled immigrants are some of the worst human rights offenders on the planet.

The Trump administration has expelled more than 8,100 people in this manner since January 20, and the U.S. has made arrangements to send people to at least 14 nations, so far, across the globe. Of them, 13 have previously been cited by the State Department for significant human rights abuses.

The State Department recently sanitized its annual human rights reports, whitewashing the records of some of the world’s most notorious nations. Even this year’s stripped-down report paints Uganda as a pariah state. “Significant human rights issues included credible reports of: arbitrary or unlawful killings; disappearances; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; [and] arbitrary arrest or detention,” among many other abuses, according to the new report issued this month.

Uganda is a relatively new addition to the Trump administration’s global gulag for expelled immigrants: The country reached an agreement with the U.S. to accept some deportees last week. In total, the Trump administration has solicited 64 nations to participate. Fifty-eight of them — roughly 91 percent — were rebuked for human rights violations in the State Department’s past human rights reports.

The Trump administration has sought, or struck deals with, or deported third-country nationals to Angola, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Ivory Coast, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Libya, Kosovo, Malawi, Mauritania, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Palau, Panama, Peru, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, The Gambia, Togo, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe; these 58 were previously taken to task by the State Department for significant human rights abuses. Tuvalu and Santa Lucia were also cited in the report for having repressive laws on paper but were not found to enforce them in practice. Only four of the 64 total nations solicited by the Trump administration— Antigua and Barbuda, Cabo Verde, Costa Rica, and Saint Kitts and Nevis — received a clean bill of human rights health from the State Department in the past.

To justify Abrego Garcia’s second attempted expulsion, the Department of Homeland Security claims he is a member of MS-13, a gang that’s known for its prominence in El Salvador but originated in Los Angeles. His family denies the government’s allegations.

“President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,” Noem said.

And Trump has won even in cases in which there are serious arguments that his administration defied a lower court, said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.

Early in Joe Biden’s presidency, defending the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, Alito stressed that its orders did not make precedent.
He mentioned no specific case or judge, but the message could easily be read as a yellow flag for lower courts.","In Donald Trump’s long-running feud with federal judges, the president has found some support in an unlikely place: the nation’s highest court.

A growing sense of frustration with some lower courts — articulated in terms that at times sound similar to Trump’s own rhetoric — has crept into a series of opinions this summer from the Supreme Court’s conservative justices as they juggle a flood of emergency cases dealing with Trump’s second term.

“Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” Justice Neil Gorsuch admonished in an opinion last week tied to the court’s decision to allow Trump to cancel nearly $800 million in research grants.

The rebuke, which was joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, flipped the narrative that it is Trump who has pushed legal boundaries with his flurry of executive orders and support for impeaching judges who rule against him. A wave of legal conservatives took to social media to tout Gorsuch’s warning.

“This is now the third time in a matter of weeks this court has had to intercede in a case ‘squarely controlled’ by one of its precedents,” wrote Gorsuch, who was Trump’s first nominee to the high court. (Kavanaugh was Trump’s second.) “When this court issues a decision, it constitutes a precedent that commands respect in lower courts.”

Other conservatives have been just as harsh this year. Justice Samuel Alito in March accused a federal judge in another case involving a Trump policy as committing an “act of judicial hubris” and “self-aggrandizement of its jurisdiction.”

The Supreme Court has been consistently siding with Trump on the emergency docket for months, including in high-profile cases dealing with immigration, spending and the leadership of independent agencies. And Trump has won even in cases in which there are serious arguments that his administration defied a lower court, said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.

“Gorsuch’s opinion in the NIH funding case is perhaps the most direct articulation yet of why — because the justices seem more concerned with lower courts correctly reading the tea leaves in their (often unexplained) rulings than with the executive branch behaving properly before the rest of the federal judiciary,” Vladeck said.

In a biting dissent in the research grant decision on Thursday, liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson described the result as “Calvinball jurisprudence,” in reference to the popular “Calvin and Hobbes” comic.

“Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules,” Jackson wrote. “We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins.”

Trump’s attacks on federal courts have subsided somewhat since the spring, when he repeatedly took to social media to rail against lower court judges and also privately complained about some members of the Supreme Court whom he appointed during his first term. But many of the president’s allies continue to work the refs and misstate the judiciary’s role — reflexively chalking losses in court up to politics.

“We will not fall to rogue judges,” Trump’s former personal lawyer Alina Habba told Fox News last week after a federal judge ruled that she was not legally serving as the acting US attorney for New Jersey. “We will not fall to people trying to be political when they should just be doing their job — respecting the president.”

Rewarding lawlessness?

Critics say it is Trump who is to blame for the tension between the executive and judicial branches, not only because of his rhetoric but also because of how the Justice Department has handled a number of high-profile cases.

In a scathing dissent in an emergency case earlier this summer, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the court of “rewarding lawlessness” by siding with Trump in one of those cases.

“This is not the first time the court closes its eyes to noncompliance, nor, I fear, will it be the last,” Sotomayor wrote, dissenting from the court’s decision to allow the administration’s deportations of certain migrants to countries other than their homeland. “Yet each time this court rewards noncompliance with discretionary relief, it further erodes respect for courts and for the rule of law.”

Sotomayor and Jackson, both liberals, are the only two on the Supreme Court who have served on district courts, where judges often take the initial stab at applying precedent to new litigation. Most of the other justices were formerly appeals court judges, where they review those first attempts by the district courts.

Gorsuch’s sharp lines — not to mention Trump’s winning streak at the high court — suggests that at least some of the justices believe that some lower courts are overreacting to the administration’s moves.

“Justice Gorsuch is making the obvious point that lower courts are required to follow the Supreme Court’s emergency orders as much as any other decree,” said James Burnham, an attorney and former Gorsuch clerk who served as general counsel for Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. “The defiance of the Supreme Court’s emergency orders by some lower courts is unprecedented, extraordinary, and the Supreme Court must deal with it decisively.”

Carrie Severino, president of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, cheered Gorsuch’s opinion on social media, writing that “yet again” it had “become necessary to remind district judges not to flout orders of the Supreme Court.”

But just how judges are supposed to approach the Supreme Court’s emergency orders — particularly when they are opaque or include little explanation — has been open to debate.

Early in Joe Biden’s presidency, defending the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, Alito stressed that its orders did not make precedent. Unlike the court’s regular merits docket, emergency orders are almost always decided without the benefit of oral argument or extensive briefing. They do not resolve the underlying legal questions of a case — only what happens while the litigation continues.

“It’s one thing when there’s a majority opinion with clear language that resolves a legal question in a way everyone will understand, whether or not we agree with it,” Vladeck said. “It’s something else entirely when the justices provide literally zero analysis in support of a ruling, expect the lower courts to nevertheless understand which argument(s) they relied upon, and then subsequently chastise the lower courts for not reading their minds — and that something is hubris. If the court wants lower courts to treat its analyses as precedent, it should, you know, provide them.”

In recent weeks, a majority of justices have sought to reinforce the notion that short-term orders should control the outcome of similar cases.

In its fractured decision Thursday, a 5-4 majority said that US District Judge William Young erred by requiring the administration to revive nearly $800 million in National Institutes of Health research grants Trump canceled because they dealt with gender or diversity.

The high court’s unsigned opinion, which allows the NIH to keep those grants frozen, pointed to an earlier unsigned emergency order from April that permitted officials to block millions of dollars in grants to states intended to address teacher shortages.

Young, who was named to the court by President Ronald Reagan, said he had “never seen government racial discrimination like this.”

In its most notable decision this year, the Supreme Court stripped the power of lower court judges to issue so-called nationwide injunctions that have been used to shutdown policies adopted by presidents of both parties. That potentially landmark ruling came in a challenge to Trump’s executive order intending to end birthright citizenship.

Lower courts are continuing to work through whether there are other avenues judges can use to temporarily halt policies they believe are unconstitutional.

Kavanaugh: Judges are not ‘policymakers’

In a decision last month allowing Trump to remove three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission who were appointed by Biden, the court similarly pointed to an earlier unsigned emergency order that dealt with firings at labor agencies. At issue in both cases was whether the president may fire board members at independent agencies despite a federal law intended to shield them from removal for political reasons.

The CPSC firings, the court said in a brief, unsigned opinion on July 23, were “squarely controlled” by the earlier decision. Although the court’s “interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits,” a majority of the justices reasoned, “they inform how a court should” decide short-term questions “in like cases.”

The emergency docket has been a topic of debate as some of the justices have traveled the country for speaking engagements during the court’s summer break.

Speaking in California in July, Justice Elena Kagan — a member of the court’s liberal wing — suggested the high court could do more to “explain things better” so that lower court judges and the public understand clearly what the Supreme Court is deciding.

Days later, speaking to a group of judges and attorneys in Kansas City, Kavanaugh defended the court’s sometimes terse emergency orders.

Kavanaugh kicked off his speech by extolling the virtues of an independent judiciary. And he stressed that judges have a part to play in maintaining that independence.

He mentioned no specific case or judge, but the message could easily be read as a yellow flag for lower courts.

“Members of the judiciary have an important responsibility, of course, that goes with maintaining the independence — that responsibility, of course, to get it right, to do our hard work, to understand our role in the constitutional democracy,” Kavanaugh said. “We’re not the policymakers.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2019-02-06t040459z-752072577-rc1f74467ab0-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-25 15:57:41.829631

Mayra Flores, the millennial Republican who upset a border-district Democrat amid the Biden border crisis, said Texas redistricting is anything but disenfranchisement of minority voters as its critics claim.

""Four of the five new districts are actually Hispanic-majority districts. And, remember, in the previous map, the Democrats’ biggest complaint was that Hispanics were not represented well,"" Flores, who is rumored to be considering returning to Congress in 2026, told Fox News Digital.

Flores said that beyond the crowing about mid-decade redistricting, the left’s complaints about the new district lines are driven purely by political concerns.

""They're upset because these Hispanics – they’re conservative Hispanics – have voted for President Trump. This map actually is more of a representation of what Texas is today,"" said Flores, who was born in Tamaulipas, what is now one of the most violent Mexican states in terms of cartel violence. It directly abuts her home district.

In 2024, 12 of 14 Texas border counties flipped red and went for President Donald Trump, in part because of such concerns – including one that hadn’t gone Republican since 1912.

In 2022, Flores won a special election for the then-34th District, but then lost the seat to Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in the next race.

""Conservative Hispanics contribute to the political landscape by supporting Republican candidates, policies; particularly on issues such as economic development, family values, religious freedom and, of course, border security,"" she said.

She said liberal interests sued over the current maps, and that there is surprise over how many Hispanics in Texas actually support border security and conservative policies.

Flores said Hispanics and Latinos are not a homogeneous voting bloc for the left, pointing also to Florida, where Latinos and other minorities came out in large numbers for Trump – and where two Cuban-American lawmakers, Reps. Maria Salazar and Carlos Gimenez of Miami-Dade are both Republicans.

Politicians therefore need to seize the redistricting opportunity to make sure every congressional district is representative proportionally to their state’s political and ethnic makeup, she said.

Critics point to New England – where no state currently has a Republican member of Congress, despite conservative pockets in places like Massachusetts, Maine, and Connecticut – as a prime example.

By contrast, Democrats have lambasted the mid-decennial redistricting as a power grab orchestrated from afar by Trump.

Democrats and liberal voices, however, disagreed with Flores’ assertions.

""The Don demanded. The Texas Legislature complied. Voters got hurt,"" blared a Monday editorial from the San Antonio Express-News.

The paper accused Republicans of directly ""diluting"" Latino and Black representation in the new map by ""packing them into districts where they have more of a majority than needed to win representation of those seats"" or ""dispersing them into multiple districts where they lack the numbers to have a say in who their representatives are.""

Along with other Democrats, the paper also referenced the new map’s merging of Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Gregorio Casar into the same district confines near Austin.

Casar is a millennial ""Squad"" member and Doggett is, conversely, the longest-serving member of the state’s delegation. Doggett indicated last week he won’t run again if facing Casar.

Casar told NPR the new map attempts to ""silence the voices of my constituents and get folks like me out of Congress,"" by adjusting Austin-area lines – and claimed it violates the Voting Rights Act.

Additionally, Bexar County, which includes San Antonio, went about 55-45 for former Vice President Kamala Harris, but Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, is also among its political ranks. The county would see an increase in proportional representation for Republicans, according to reports.

In California, which is about half Democratic and left-leaning independent, only nine of 52 congressional districts are held by Republicans. In Maryland, lawmakers finally redrew what a judge called a ""broken-winged pterodactyl"" of a Democratic district that included several noncontiguous pieces of Baltimore suburbs.

Flores said Texas, Florida, California and New York are worth revisiting on a congressional-districting basis if only for the trends of major ingress to the first two from the latter two states.

""We want to make sure that again every congressional district is a representation of the overall state and for critics to say that this [Texas] map silences the voices of minorities when four of the five of them you map are actually Hispanic majority,"" Flores said.

""Look, Hispanics are switching toward the Republican Party and will continue to support the Republican Party because the Democrat Party has gone so far left, and you would think that after 2024, they would have learned their lesson and they would come more to the middle,"" Flores said.

While South Dakota’s congressional delegation acknowledged the need for labor reform, there’s no quick or simple solution.

Last month, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said mass deportations of undocumented immigrants are going to be done everywhere, and agriculture is no exception.

She said the plan was to have a 100% American workforce. That announcement has many in agriculture worried about labor gaps and how to fill them. Historically, undocumented workers have filled some of those gaps for producers and farmers.

Officials estimate that today, about 40-45% of the agriculture workforce is made up by undocumented immigrants.

The issue came up at a South Dakota Farm Bureau Federation forum at Dakotafest in Mitchell.

US Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the answer has to come in two parts. The first…“Secure the border! Which the president has effectively done.”

He said with that first part achieved, policy makers can look ahead to the second: fixing the labor system in agriculture.

He said the issue is finding a way to get the workforce here legally. Thune said the answer is going to come somewhere in the middle of the political aisle.

“I would say that in terms of legislating on that it’s been tried in the past; it’s very complicated. The Democrats holy grail on immigration is citizenship: they want everybody to get citizenship. And, of course, the Republicans it’s build a wall. And there are a lot of things that we could do that we could probably agree on,"" Thune said. ""I hope we can get that back on track. I think President Trump is probably the right person to do that because he’s been so effective at securing the Southern border. And so if he wanted to lead a legislative effort on immigration, I think there’d be a lot of people who would like to work with him and partner with him on that.”

However,US Sen. Mike Rounds said there’s a big “if” ahead to any sort of resolution.

“Look, it’s not going to happen unless President Trump agrees to work with us. You can’t do it without having the Administration work with you on it,"" Rounds said. ""But I do think also the fact that the president had employed folks in his businesses that were H2Bs, he understands it. He gets it.”

Rounds said he’s heard worker’s unions complain that immigrants are taking away American jobs, but he said that argument weakens when factoring in South Dakota’s low unemployment rate.

“And when you’re under 2%, it’s really tough to find people who are going to come out and work in the livestock industry, that are going to work in the dairies. But in other countries, culturally they still see that, and they see it as a way to get to America and eventually they see it as an opportunity for perhaps their children to have a better way of life a long time into the future,"" Rounds said. ""They take the dollars, they bring them back to their home countries, they improve things there. So H2Bs and H2As I think are critical, but we need to modify them so that they work better for the ag communities in places like South Dakota.”

South Dakota’s lone representative in the House of Representatives, Dusty Johnson agreed with his Senate counterparts. He said with the Southern border secured, “That does give us an opportunity to start to have the conversation with the White House about what comes next. I was at the White House three weeks ago, the president said it himself,"" Johnson said. ""He said, ‘We want to continue to have this be a country where some of the hardest working, some of the most talented people in the globe, want to come be a part of the American dream. Now, the details get really messy. But I think there is renewed interest in looking at how we can make these work visa programs serve our country’s interest.”

A bill in the US House of Representatives called the Farm Workforce Modernization act would reform the H-2A visa program for agricultural producers. The bipartisan bill has been introduced many times since 2019 and is currently awaiting action.

South Dakota Searchlight reports Rep. Johnsonvoted against a version of the bill in 2023, citing it was a “special deal for California” that hurt meat, cheese and biofuel processing.

Sen. John Thune told reporters after the event that while it might be an uphill battle, he thinks the president might have an appetite for revamping some visa programs.

""And I think lifting the caps on some of the visas: H2As, H2Bs, the ones that we use here in South Dakota, would be a great step in the right direction. But I think the longer-term issue is going to be trying to figure out how to codify and get some of these changes into law,"" Thune said. ""And I think the president also has a lot of latitude there to work with, and I think if he can find some willing partners in the Democrats, I think you know, some sort of legislation policy, a piece of legislation that we could pass is not outside the realm of possibility.”

Thune said ultimately, that may be the best long-term solution for such a complex issue.

Tags: Immigration","WASHINGTON (OSV News) — As the Trump administration seeks to implement its hardline immigration policies, it has increased enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in immigration courts, prompting alarm from Catholic immigration advocates.

Such instances are taking place across the country: New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently filed court papers in support of a lawsuit to stop arrests of migrants reporting for their hearings at a federal immigration building in Manhattan. Protesters in San Francisco attempted to halt such detentions in that city.

Visiting immigration court hearings

Near the U.S.-Mexico border, Father Michael Gallagher, an attorney and Jesuit priest and a member of Jesuit Refugee Service/USA’s Caminar Contigo program in El Paso, has been visiting immigration court hearings to help ensure those going into their hearings understand their rights, as well as the possible outcomes of their cases.

Among the consequences “of these arrests as people come out of court,” Father Gallagher said, was a woman who had had been told by a judge to leave her children at home for her appointment followed that instruction, and later, as she “comes to court and gets arrested as she comes out, and her kids are left at home and don’t know where mama is.”

“So that is one of the kind of brutal consequences,” he said.

Father Gallagher told OSV News targeting immigration courts for enforcement actions means the government is in some cases, “arresting people who are complying with the law.”

“It’s against fundamental justice,” Father Gallagher said.

The Trump administration’s changes to Temporary Protected Status — a program for shielding eligible migrants from particular nations from deportation due to dangerous conditions in their homelands — means that there are individuals who first entered the U.S. with legal status who have now been left without it, he said.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment from OSV News.

Hope Border Institute calls immigration enforcement targeting people attending court hearings ‘particularly troubling’

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, “Immigration enforcement that targets people attending court hearings is particularly troubling, because we’re talking about going after people doing everything they can to regularize their immigration status by following the legal process.”

“As Americans, we value fairness and respect for constitutional rights, including due process,” he said. “This is why from Los Angeles to San Diego to El Paso, we’ve seen church leaders, women religious, priests and ordinary Catholics showing up at court to witness to the human dignity of those who are our neighbors, our parishioners and decent hardworking people.”

J. Kevin Appleby, senior fellow for policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York and the former director of migration policy for the USCCB, told OSV News, “Targeting immigration courts can violate due process for immigrants, a basic principle of our justice system. Everyone should be able to have their day in court.”

“In the area of immigration, due process ensures that those who have a legal basis to remain are not wrongly deported or sent back to their persecutors,” he said. “ICE is attempting to short change that process, which should alarm us all.”

‘A real shift towards cruelty’

Father Gallagher said, “what I’m observing is kind of a real shift towards cruelty, which is very depressing for our country, to become a cruel place.” But he said at the same time, “the people I meet down at the courtroom — the Catholics and the Protestants and the Jews — are very much in favor of looking at these people as people, first of all, as human beings with inherent dignity.”

In one example of his work helping to educate people about their rights in court, Father Gallagher said he met a family with a “little girl who was 2 or 3 years old in a white dress, who was waiting to go to court and doing pirouettes downstairs while I’m explaining to her parents that they might get arrested, the whole family.”

Despite the circumstances, he said, he was struck by how “she’s still a 3-year-old kid and a human being, lovely with a white dress, and a happy child.”

Corbett added that as deportations “now begin to hit local communities, we’re starting to see a groundswell of statements and actions from bishops across the country speaking out in defense of human rights and advocating for essential immigration reforms.”

Abrego Garcia's attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit to fight those removal efforts until a court has heard his claim for protection, stating that the U.S. could place him in a country where ""his safety cannot be assured.""

The new lawsuit triggered a blanket court order that automatically pauses deportation efforts for two days. The order applies to immigrants in Maryland who are challenging their detention.

Crowd yells 'shame!'

Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national, spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

""This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,"" Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. ""God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.""

Roughly 200 people had gathered and prayed in front of the Baltimore field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some held signs with messages such as ""Stop Detaining Our Neighbors"" and ""Free Kilmar.""

With Abrego Garcia and his wife standing before them, the crowd spoke in unison: ""The people united will never be defeated.""

The crowd waited outside after Abrego Garcia entered the federal building. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him after his detainment, the crowd yelled ""Shame!""

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. But Abrego Garcia's lead immigration attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said lawyers will fight the administration's removal attempts.

""I expect there's going to be a status conference very promptly, and we're going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,"" he said.

Reunion with family

Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee and returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them ""for everything.""

'Hold Abrego Garcia accountable'

Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, which recently agreed to accept certain deportees from the U.S. He declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Filings in federal court show the Costa Rican government saying Abrego Garcia would be welcomed as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face detention.

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a ""clear danger"" and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

""Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,"" Gilmartin said.

The U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's earlier determination that he faced a ""well-founded fear"" of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, calling it an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours' notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.

""Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),"" it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/hendersondispatch.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/ab/aabe2038-3858-51f0-93a8-3db3c58ce626/68ac857e28a22.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-08-25 14:57:45.289457

The letter followed a visit earlier this month to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Aurora by U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Centennial and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood.

Crow and Neguse are among a dozen House Democrats who have sued the Department of Homeland Security over a new ICE policy requiring lawmakers to obtain prior approval to conduct facility oversight visits. But despite providing advance notice of their Aug. 11 visit, the four Colorado Democrats said that ICE personnel accompanying them were unable to provide much of the information they asked for.

“They failed to answer many of our questions and repeatedly encouraged us to instead email ICE’s Office of Congressional Relations,” they wrote in their letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons. “The inevitable delays caused by routing our questions through OCR, rather than the ICE employee leading the oversight visit, prevent meaningful oversight from taking place in a timely manner.”

The letter includes four pages of questions about the Aurora facility, which is operated by private prison company The GEO Group. The facility has a total capacity of 1,532 detainees and has long been the target of criticism from activists over allegations of inhumane conditions and dehumanizing treatment.

Among the concerns highlighted by the Aug. 22 letter are reports of an air conditioning system within the detention center “not functioning for period of time in July.” Detainees in one of the facility’s housing pods were reportedly relocated as a result. The letter also mentions “reports on several occasions of water outages in the facility, including in July and August of this year.” Other issues raised include recent prohibitions on orientation programs previously conducted by legal aid groups, as well as increased signage and “repeated visits” from ICE staff pressuring detainees to “self-deport.”

The lawmakers also want more detailed demographic information about detainees in the facility, including their countries of origin, the number of detainees entering and leaving the facility on a weekly basis, and the percentage of detainees who have not been convicted of a violent crime.

Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old Utah nursing student without a criminal record, was detained in the Aurora facility for 15 days earlier this year before being released on bond. She called her stay a “nightmare” and described having to eat soggy bread and being “treated better than others who didn’t speak English.”

Internal ICE planning documents obtained by The Washington Post indicate that up to three new immigration detention centers could be operational in Colorado by the end of the year. The lawmakers’ letter to DHS says that an ICE staffer told them that one of those potential facilities, in the town of Hudson, is “under contract with ICE.”

Trump similarly deployed National Guard members to Los Angeles last month amid a surge in demonstrations against Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts.

Trump said Friday that Chicago would likely be the next target of his efforts to crack down on crime, homelessness and illegal immigration.

“I think Chicago will be … next,” Trump told reporters at the White House.

“And then we’ll help with New York.”

The Washington Post reported Saturday that the Pentagon for weeks has been planning a military deployment to Chicago.

The planning could involve several options, the Post reported, including sending a few thousand members of the National Guard as soon as September to patrol the city’s streets.

“Donald Trump’s flagrant abuses of power must end,” Krishnamoorthi said. “Our brave servicemen and women are not pawns in his political games.”

Krishnamoorthi said he introduced legislation to block any president from deploying the military into states without a governor first requesting the intervention.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) said he was talking to Gov. JB Pritzker (D) and other local officials about preparing for “any potential unconstitutional military deployments to Chicago.”

“The Governor, the Cook County Board President, and I are in complete alignment: Chicago is not calling for a military occupation of our city,” Johnson said in a statement. “We are currently evaluating all of our legal options to protect the people of Chicago from unconstitutional federal overreach.”

BALTIMORE — This morning, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was arrested at his ICE check-in appointment. The government intends to deport him to Uganda, a country with which Abrego Garcia has no association.

Abrego Garcia is represented by lawyers at CASA, who hosted a vigil and rally in his support outside the location of the arrest.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration – by its own admission – wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a torture prison in El Salvador in the middle of the night and with no due process. According to his lawyers, he suffered severe mistreatment there including isolation, beatings and psychological torture. After repeated court orders to return him, the administration finally brought him back but then immediately prosecuted him on federal smuggling charges. On Friday, over the administration’s objections, a federal court released him to his family in Maryland while his case proceeded.

However, the government has now tried to force Abrego Garcia to accept deportation to Costa Rica as part of a plea agreement to end his criminal case. As punishment for not accepting that proposal, they then served notice to his lawyers that the administration will deport him to Uganda. Today, he was arrested during his ICE check-in.

Sarah Mehta, Deputy Director of Policy and Government Affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union, released the following statement in response:

“The Trump administration’s obsessive and petty cruelty is on full display in this latest move to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father they admitted to wrongfully deporting to a torture prison, to a country with which he has no relationship. This vindictive behavior is not just about Mr. Abrego Garcia; this is once again the administration showing that it can weaponize the law to punish people standing up for their rights and make our immigrant neighbors afraid of being rapidly exiled, including to places where they may be persecuted.”

But if EU leaders have their way, we may soon see Brussels, not Britain, celebrating the first complete migration pact with Rwanda.","When Emmanuel Macron was asked about the UK’s plans to send migrants to Rwanda, he could not have made his contempt more clear.

Europe must not “go and look for a third country, for example in Africa, and send our immigrants there”, the French president proclaimed in April 2024. “This is a betrayal of our values and will lead us down the path of new dependencies on third countries.”

But one year on, this is precisely what the European Union seems to be planning – as it pivots from a softer touch on migration to an approach that even the tough-talking Tory government was forced to abandon when its own Rwanda scheme was thrown out by the Supreme Court in November 2023.

Against a rising tide of Right-wing populism, officials in Brussels are drawing up new rules as nation after nation – from Denmark in the north to Italy in the south – turns to Rwanda-style asylum processing schemes.

Indeed, the interior ministers of Germany, France, Austria, Poland, Denmark and the Czech Republic convened for a special migration summit on the Zugspitze, Germany’s highest mountain, last month. At a resort on the peak of the 9,718ft-high mountain in Bavaria, they agreed that member states needed “more freedom of action” to deport asylum seekers, and that “the establishment of return centres in third countries should be legally permitted”.

‘Overwhelmed asylum capacities’

Under the proposed reforms, said to have the backing of the majority of the bloc, EU members would be allowed swiftly to reject asylum seekers and deport them to a third country they deem safe, such as Rwanda, even if the applicant has no link to that nation whatsoever. They also open the door to creating “offshore hubs” in the Middle East or North Africa, where asylum seekers would have their claims processed on the EU’s behalf by a host government.

Both ideas are similar to the UK’s failed Rwanda scheme, which would have sent asylum seekers to Rwanda for their claims to be processed and then to remain there even if the asylum claim was granted.

The proposals are a far cry from the munificent era of the 2015 refugee crisis, when Angela Merkel, then Germany’s chancellor, declared “wir schaffen das” (we can do it) as the bloc witnessed an influx of 1.3 million people.

Critics have also warned that the reforms are legally unsound, eye-wateringly expensive and could lead to gross human rights violations of asylum seekers in the countries to which they are sent.

But with first-time asylum applications hovering close to – or above – the one million mark in recent years, a surge in support for far-Right parties and the weaponisation of migrants by countries such as Russia, there is growing momentum behind a Rwanda-style model for the EU.

“If you want to grant protection to those that are in need, you need a properly working system that is able to differentiate as early as possible between those who are in need of protection and those who are not,” she says.

A stark shift in Germany

A decade ago, European attitudes to asylum seekers were markedly different: crowds of Germans gathered at Munich’s central train station to cheer and greet new arrivals.

But the mood has since soured on mass migration across the bloc, and perhaps most strikingly in Germany – where the far-Right, anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AFD) party secured an unprecedented second place in last February’s elections, making it the de facto opposition.

Under the country’s current chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who has loudly and repeatedly distanced himself from the migration policy of Merkel, German police have been turning away asylum seekers from their land borders since May.

Merz himself says Germany’s asylum capacity has been “overwhelmed”, a sentiment echoed by leaders in Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland – where vigilante groups have resorted to policing the borders themselves.

According to a report earlier this month, the Merz government has already launched talks with Rwanda on an asylum scheme, perhaps in the hope that the new EU reforms will clear any legal hurdles the deal would otherwise face. When asked by The Telegraph what progress has been made so far, a German interior ministry spokesman said they “do not comment on ongoing negotiations with other countries”.

However, sources in Merz’s centre-Right Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) party say there is great appetite to replicate the scheme that was attempted by Rishi Sunak before the collapse of his government. “We want to erase any legal obstacles that exist under EU level for such a scheme,” a CDU source in Berlin says.

They add a caveat: even if talks with Rwanda are going on behind closed doors, Merz’s coalition of his centre-Right CDU party and the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD) are split on the issue. “It’s not very likely that the SPD accepts a Rwanda plan any time soon,” the source says, raising the possibility that the plan will never get full political backing.

Even so, Alexander Dobrindt, the German interior minister, has gone as far as claiming that “models involving third countries have majority support… a vast majority of member states have made it clear that this is a path the EU must take”.

‘A rekindling of a longstanding concern’

Another key player in the EU’s migration debate is Denmark, which holds the rotating EU presidency and, unlike Germany, has been consistently sceptical towards mass migration.

Having had its own failed Rwanda plan, which was shelved amid a backlash in January 2023, the Nordic nation now appears to feel increasingly vindicated as other member states warm to outsourcing asylum.

“While immigration has certainly returned to the forefront of the Danish debate – after nearly five years of relative silence on the issue – I wouldn’t describe it as a major shift in public attitudes. Rather, it’s a rekindling of a longstanding concern,” says Mikkel Bjørn, an MP for the Right-wing Danish People’s Party.

To cite just one example, in 2016 Denmark was criticised for what was considered at the time to be callous treatment of asylum seekers: seizing their valuables upon arrival to help fund their accommodation. Now, somewhat similar ideas are being floated across the EU, alongside plans for Rwanda-style processing schemes.

However, human rights groups are deeply concerned by the new push in the bloc to try to succeed where Sunak and his ministers failed.

Amnesty International has warned that the Rwanda model and others, such as Italy’s migration pact with Albania, are deeply cynical, violate human rights laws and are an abdication of Europe’s responsibilities.

Under the deal struck by Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s government last year, Rome planned to transfer migrants to centres in Albania while their applications for asylum in Italy were being considered. But the move was challenged by Italian courts, forcing authorities to pivot and use the facilities to house those awaiting deportation from Italy instead. Most of the few dozen transferred to Albania under the scheme have also had to be returned to Italy before being repatriated.

“A lot of different initiatives are being bandied around, but all of them are doing the same thing, which is shifting the EU’s responsibility for asylum outside of the bloc,” says Olivia Sundberg Diez, a migration expert at Amnesty International.

“Whenever there have been similar schemes, you see a very similar pattern of human rights violations taking place,” she adds, referring to Australia’s notorious processing centre on the island of Nauru, where refugees were kept in inhumane conditions, denied proper medical care and in some cases driven to suicide attempts, according to a 2016 Amnesty report.

Inflated expectations

Despite such concerns, officials in Brussels appear confident the Italian model will work in the future. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Financial Times such a scheme “will be possible again”, adding that member states would “make the necessary adjustments” required to ensure asylum processing could be outsourced to countries not part of the bloc.

But even if the EU pushes ahead with such schemes, Diez says they still risk breaching international law and being abandoned just like the UK-Rwanda model, which racked up a £700m taxpayers’ bill despite never coming into force.

“From our experiences, it’s very dangerous for policymakers to be inflating the public’s expectations of what these schemes can accomplish, and we don’t believe they can be implemented in a way that’s compliant [with international law],” she adds.

But it appears increasingly unlikely the bloc will be deterred. And now, it will be up to the European Commission, the EU’s civil service, to make the lofty vision of the Zugspitze summit a reality. Should they succeed where Sunak failed, it would be a bruising twist of irony for Brexiteers.

The Maryland construction worker became the face of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador.

He was returned to the US in June but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the 30-year-old married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member.

He denies the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

The Salvadoran national spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

“This administration has hit us hard but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Abrego Garcia entered the offices of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a city centre office building. His wife emerged without him a few minutes later, appearing to have tears in her eyes.

Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said in a tweet that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. Abrego Garcia’s lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said a lawsuit had been filed in federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention asking for an order that he not be deported.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

Abrego Garcia was released on Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee. He returned to his family in Maryland. Video of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything”.

Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, which recently agreed to a deal to accept certain deportees from the US. He declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Filings in federal court show the Costa Rican government saying Abrego Garcia would be welcomed as a legal immigrant and would not face detention.

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

“Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,” Mr Gilmartin said.

The US mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there.

Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pre-trial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.",https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjVcXFwvMDhcXFwvMjUxMzE5NDZcXFwvZWQzNWY4MzMzYzllNDllY2E1MDI2Y2Q5Mjg2MWFmZDYtMS5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYyNyxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZVxcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6ImI0MGI0MDM1YWEzY2M0NmE4MGZjYjliNDI1ODRhYzgxMDc2YjBjNzcifQ==/man-at-centre-of-us-immigration-storm-faces-possible-deportation-to-uganda.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 11:58:39.575945

The Trump administration is asking the justices to allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to continue using aggressive, dragnet tactics in their immigration crackdown in the Los Angeles area, which civil rights groups have said amount to racial profiling.

Beyond statistics, there are some communities in which immigrants maintain a critical role in terms of child care.","Since the outset of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, Carolina Reyes, the director of the Arco Iris Bilingual Children’s Center in Maryland, had to start having conversations with parents about whom she should contact in case they disappear in an ICE raid.

“I had to say, ‘You need to have a plan. I know it’s difficult, but you need to have a plan,’” Reyes told Salon. “I know it’s difficult, but you need to have a plan. And then they were like, ‘No, I don’t want to talk about it.’ I was like, ‘I understand, but you have to because, unfortunately, you don’t know if you go to work and something happens, who’s going to take care of your child? What is going to happen? What do I have to do?”

According to Reyes, this is only one of many difficult conversations she has had since the beginning of the Republican mass deportation campaign earlier this year.

“We had a meeting with my teachers where we need to prepare if ICE comes. As a school, we are not allowing anybody to come into our school. We close the door and we lock down a little bit, if that’s the case. We are not going to release anybody, not to, particularly ICE or anything like that. We call parents too. We talk about it, and if we see ICE or any situation where we feel uncomfortable, parents will be notified,” Reyes said.

From 2011 until the beginning of Trump’s second term, child care facilities had been off limits for ICE raids. Trump ended the protection afforded to child care facilities and other sensitive locations in January, telling immigration officers to “balance a variety of interests” when conducting operations in or around such locations.

While it’s not clear whether ICE has conducted any raids on early childhood education centers yet, the rule change earlier this year and the administration’s readiness to detain children and families have left providers across the country in a state of anxiety with organizations advising that providers prepare for potential raids.

The potential for direct raids on facilities isn’t the only issue impacting parents and children since the beginning of the GOP mass deportation campaign. For many of the families Reyes has worked with, parents are afraid to go to work because they’re worried that they, or one of their family members, might be targeted by ICE. At the same time, Reyes said, ICE had targeted those seeking food assistance at places like local churches, which left families of mixed immigration status with nowhere to turn.

“Here in Maryland, ICE was going to those places too, to arrest people, so we started our own food program a little bit here, asking our own families to donate food so that families didn’t have to go to those places,” Reyes said.

And the fear in the community goes beyond just noncitizen residents.

“I did have some families who were concerned and worried, even though they had legal status in the United States, you know. But they’re immigrants, so we look like immigrants and Latinos, and some of them were concerned about that too,” Reyes said.

Reyes’ experience is only a keyhole view into the dramatic effect that Trump and the GOP’s policies are having on the child care industry and the families that rely on it in the United States.

The child care and early childhood education industry is among those most impacted by Trump’s immigration policies. According to the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at Berkeley, around 500,000 workers in the industry are immigrants, accounting for about 21% of the industry’s workforce nationwide.

The percentage of child care workers born outside the United States varies widely by state as well. In Florida, for example, 38% of early childhood educators were born outside the United States, while in a state like Vermont, the number is closer to just 3%.

Beyond statistics, there are some communities in which immigrants maintain a critical role in terms of child care. The 19th detailed in a report this year the detention of Orozco Forero, a worker who cared for children with Autism and was the only provider who would take some children in her community.

One child care provider located near Columbus, Ohio, who wished to be identified only as Ann, told Salon that since Trump’s mass deportation campaign began, they’ve been having a hard time finding new workers.

“I have two who, in the middle of the hiring process, disappeared, or they no-showed. And then I found out from other trusted sources who know them that they are involved in immigration proceedings,” Ann said. “Even today, there’s one woman who was supposed to start with us — I don’t know the correct immigration or political term — she’s got clearance to be in the US. She’s originally from Mexico. Her father’s here, but they were able to get her immigration status made legit, if I can say it that way. But she’s disappeared for two weeks, and then I found out today that she’s had to travel to Cleveland for a court proceeding. I said to the other person who knows her, I just asked her, ‘is she okay?’”

Ann said that the new problems haven’t been limited to hiring workers either. She told Salon that immigrant families have recently had problems getting financial benefits through Ohio’s Publicly Funded Child Care program for their children, who are American citizens.

“Now what’s happening is I have immigrant families who have immigrant children, and U.S.-born children, we are having a hard time getting the families care and benefits for their entire family, including the U.S.-born child, and that’s when I start losing all hope in this,” Ann said.

In the past, Ann said, she would be able to appeal the decision made by the county government to the state government with a high success rate. Now, however, she says families are increasingly being denied at the state level, too.

According to Arabella Bloom, a researcher at the center, the mass deportation campaign, which impacts parents, children and the people who staff child care centers, is hitting a system that was struggling to begin with.

“I think something important to note about childcare is that the system that we currently have right now — it’s kind of generous to call it a system,” Bloom said. “It’s very patchwork. Programs are happening in public schools, but programs are also happening in people’s homes. And so there’s not like a cohesive early childhood system. It’s a lot of programs kind of operating on their own. You know, many early childhood programs are for-profit, but they’re barely making ends meet.”

Bloom said that, even for those workers who are not immigrants, there is a “real fear about interacting with immigration,” especially among Hispanic workers and other people of color.

The pressure from Trump’s mass deportation campaign comes in addition to more direct attacks on immigrants’ access to early childhood education from his administration and the Republicans in Congress.

The Trump administration announced in July, for example, that it would be making undocumented immigrants, who are already largely ineligible for federal benefits, ineligible for Head Start and that administrators for Head Start would be checking for eligibility based on immigration status.

“This decision undermines the fundamental commitment that the country has made to children and disregards decades of evidence that Head Start is essential to our collective future,” Yasmina Vinci, executive director of the National Head Start Association, told the Associated Press at the time.

Bloom explained that some changes in the recent GOP budget also stood to have an outsized impact on the workers in the early childhood education industry, especially cuts to SNAP and Medicaid.

“We know that roughly 43% of early educators rely on public benefits to make ends meet because pay is so low, so it’s kind of just a like a perfect storm of at the same time that immigration efforts are ramping up, and that’s obviously going to be very impactful for the one in five early educators who are immigrants,” Bloom said.

The GOP attacks on public benefits and immigration policy “threaten the supply of care that’s already hard to find,” Rachel Wilensky, a senior analyst on child care and early education at the Center for Law and Social Policy, told Salon.

Wilensky cited a CLASP study from 2018, which found that immigration actions like those being carried out by the Trump administration this year, and those that were conducted in the first administration, left a lasting impact on the physical, social and emotional development of young children.

“Good nutrition, regular health care, a stable and healthy living environment, and nurturing care are necessities for children to grow and learn and ultimately do well in school, in their jobs, and throughout their lives,” Wilensky said. “When children don’t have their basic needs met—or when they experience hardship and distress—it undercuts their growth and development and can have enduring effects. Immigrants have been central throughout our nation’s history, and their experiences matter for our future. The success of the United States is tied to the health and well-being of immigrants, as well as their success in school and later careers.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/ice-arrest-2230437083.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 11:58:21.040044

The appellate ruling means Nepali immigrants immediately lose TPS while their Latin American co-plaintiffs lose legal status next month.
The administration faces multiple lawsuits from immigrants and civil rights groups to retain the protections.
The government also cited a May 19 Supreme Court decision permitting DHS to terminate TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans as rationale for ending the status for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.
Nevertheless, a three-judge panel issued the order staying Thompson’s decision after an urgent request from the Trump administration.","The Trump administration can proceed with plans to rescind temporary deportation protections for more than 60,000 Honduran, Nepali and Nicaraguan immigrants, a federal appellate court in San Francisco ruled Aug. 20.

The two-page decision by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California overturned a July 31 lower-court ruling preventing the Department of Homeland Security from terminating Temporary Protective Status for the immigrants while their lawsuit opposing the move continues to be litigated.

TPS shelters migrants fleeing war and natural disasters from deportation and allows them to work in the U.S. legally as their asylum cases move through the immigration court system.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced the designation would end Aug. 5 for Nepali immigrants and Sept. 8 for Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining the conditions in their home nations have changed and no longer meet the conditions of TPS. The appellate ruling means Nepali immigrants immediately lose TPS while their Latin American co-plaintiffs lose legal status next month.

DHS is also seeking to rescind the status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela, and to end humanitarian parole programs, as well. The administration faces multiple lawsuits from immigrants and civil rights groups to retain the protections.

National TPS Alliance II v. Noem argues Trump decided to end Nepali, Honduran and Nicaraguan TPS without a proper review of the conditions in those countries and the decision was “motivated by racial animus.”

In her order temporarily halting Noem’s action, U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco said the plaintiffs made a compelling case that race motivated the decision to remove their protections: “The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty and the American dream. That is all plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names and purify their blood. The court disagrees.”

Thompson added that Trump’s 2023 statement claiming migrants are “poisoning the blood of our country,” and his January executive order equating the presence of immigrants with an “invasion” lend credence to the claims of racism.

“Plaintiffs provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the secretary’s TPS Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua terminations were based on a preordained determination to end the TPS program, rather than an objective review of the country conditions,” the court ruled.

In oral arguments at the Ninth Circuit Aug. 19, the Justice Department dismissed Trump’s “poisoning” comment as “ancient” history and argued courts have no authority to interfere with Noem’s handling of TPS, Politico reported.

The government also cited a May 19 Supreme Court decision permitting DHS to terminate TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans as rationale for ending the status for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said the cases are not analogous because the plaintiffs in National TPS Alliance II v. Noem have been in the U.S. a decade or more, while Venezuelans affected by the Supreme Court decision won protections much more recently.

“The thing we had in the Supreme Court had nothing to do with these at all,” Arulanantham said during the hearing.

Nevertheless, a three-judge panel issued the order staying Thompson’s decision after an urgent request from the Trump administration.

“The court’s failure to provide any reasoning for its decision, including why this was an ‘emergency,’ falls far short of what due process requires and our clients deserve,” Arulanantham said in response. “The decision simply sanctions the government’s power grab, exposing tens of thousands of people to illegal detention and deportation.”

The ruling confirms the administration is “systematically de-documenting” immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for decades while starting businesses and families with American-citizen children, said Jessica Bansal, attorney at the National Day Laborer Organization.

“The court’s unexplained decision to let the TPS terminations take effect — despite a district court finding them likely unconstitutional — will cause tremendous, senseless hardship for tens of thousands of families, including over 40,000 U.S.-citizen children of TPS holders,” she said.

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network lamented the decision and expressed concern for the fate of TPS holders from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.

“More than 63,000 immigrants from those three countries stand to lose their status rapidly and be uprooted from families, jobs and communities,” CLINIC Executive Director Anna Gallagher said.

Plaintiffs in the case said they are devastated by the Ninth Circuit’s order.

“I am heartbroken by the court’s decision. I’ve lived in the U.S. for years, and my kids are U.S. citizens and have never even been to Nepal. This ruling leaves us and thousands of other TPS families in fear and uncertainty,” said plaintiff Sandhya Lama, a TPS holder from Nepal.

Why it matters: Abrego Garcia's detention comes after the Trump administration indicated in court filings that it planned to deport him to Uganda after returning him earlier this year from a high security prison in El Salvador.

The big picture: The El Salvadoran, who was living in Maryland with his wife and children until being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement this March, now faces a criminal trial in addition to fighting his deportation case.

A federal judge has said Abrego Garcia can be deported but not to his home country, El Salvador, because of the danger he would face there.

The Trump administration had mistakenly deported him there in March, leaving him in the high-security prison known as CECOT. Abrego Garcia alleges that he was tortured there.

When the administration was ordered to bring him back, Abrego Garcia was charged with human trafficking in a Tennessee federal court. That trial will begin in January.

What they're saying: ""The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him, to punish him for exercising his constitutional rights,"" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia's attorneys, said on the steps of Baltimore's G.H. Fallon Federal Building.

He added Abrego Garcia has a ""constitutional right to fight back against being illegally deported to El Salvador, his constitutional right to speak up through his court filings on the torture and treatment that he received in El Salvador at the direct request of our government.""

The other side: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed Abrego Garcia's detention on X.

""President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,"" she wrote.

The latest: Sandoval-Moshenberg said that Abrego Garcia has filed another lawsuit in federal court in Maryland to ensure he has due process in any potential third-country removal.

""They don't have present legal authority to remove him to Uganda because he's requested a reasonable fear interview. He has the right to court proceedings,"" he said.",https://images.axios.com/3ccOFvkttSQ8oBpsQ2GPWCa_Geo=/0x0:5444x3062/1366x768/2025/08/25/1756127468471.jpeg,N,,2025-08-25 11:58:24.380069

Luke Tryl: No, I don’t think that is the case.
Luke Tryl: I think people like the idea that something is being done.
Luke Tryl: Yeah, absolutely.
Luke Tryl: So most British people are proud of a flag.","We spoke to Luke Tryl, who’s Executive Director of the think tank and research agency More in Common UK, on how concerned voters are about immigration.

Cathy Newman: These protests this weekend turn out as pretty muted. Does that mean people don’t by and large care that much about the problem of immigration and asylum hotels, or not?

Luke Tryl: No, I don’t think that is the case. What we’ve seen over the past year is both the salience of immigration and channel crossings rising up the public’s agenda. We track the public’s top issues every week and this week, for the first time, whilst cost of living was still number one, levels of immigration actually overtook the NHS just for the number two spot. And then in fourth, it was channel crossings. So a big issue for the public. And we’ve also seen opposition increase. When we asked two years ago if you would support asylum seekers being housed in temporary accommodation in your area, it was basically split, slightly more opposed than supported. That has changed. And the number who are strongly opposed has risen by 21 points in a two-year period.

So something has definitely shifted, but what I should say is that’s very different to violence and violent protests, and we know from our research that most Brits, the overwhelming majority, condemn violence, bigotry, intimidation of the sort we’ve seen in some of those protests.

“Most Brits, the overwhelming majority, condemn violence, bigotry, intimidation of the sort we’ve seen in some of those protests.”

– Luke Tryl

Cathy Newman: Right, and I’ll pick up on that in just a second, but where does all this leave Sir Keir Starmer’s announcement, overhauling the asylum system? Sort of quite complex, it might be quite time consuming. Is that going to register with people or not?

Luke Tryl: I think people like the idea that something is being done. You know, this is one of those issues where people I think sort of almost want to throw everything at the wall within what’s possible, within what’s legal and see what sticks – the returns deal with France, the work on the gangs, the announcement today on the new courts and judicial process. I think it does cast an image in people’s minds of something being done but you’ve got to remember the public patience on this issue is wearing really thin. They think they’ve been told time and time again we are going to, as Rishi Sunak said, stop the boats and they’re going to have to want to see some progress because it’s becoming a real political issue for the government.

Cathy Newman: And it will take time for the Labour government’s proposals to go in and bed in. So let’s come to Nigel Farage, then, because he’s promising mass deportations, a withdrawal from European treaties on human rights and torture. It’s a lot more dramatic, isn’t it? Does that resonate with the public?

Luke Tryl: Well, we know if you ask people who are planning on voting reform, what is the main reason that you’re voting for the party, immigration is way ahead. You know, they’re as close to being a single issue party as you get in British politics. So there’s no doubt it’s their strong point. But I do think there are a couple of risks in Reform’s approach. For instance, when we last polled on the European Court of Human Rights, we found 58% of the public wanted to stay in. That was actually up over the past year, and I think the idea of getting into long protracted debates with Europe again puts lots of people off. There’s also amongst the British public no desire for cruelty towards people who travel here. People will often say in the same breath, ‘oh, I’m a bit worried, you know, about pressure on services. Can we afford this at a time when Britain’s struggling? But equally, I can understand, it must be terrible to make that decision to leave your country and travel here.’

Cathy Newman: Well, because, you know, some of the people in the hotels where the protests are, they’ve come from Afghanistan, from Eritrea, many will have been tortured. Is there public sympathy for them still?

Luke Tryl: Yeah, absolutely. When we speak to people, they will say, the decision to have to leave your country and the circumstances which some of these people have been in is terrible. The worry comes down to – number one, pressure on services, number two, can we afford it? And I think the danger for Reform UK is they can take a hard line on stopping illegal crossings but a British public balance control and compassion.

“I think the danger for Reform UK is they can take a hard line on stopping illegal crossings but a British public balance control and compassion.”

– Luke Tryl

Cathy Newman: Let’s come to flags, because there are a lot of flags behind Frances and in her piece just now. There’s been this outbreak of flag flying in the wake of all the protests over asylum hotels. How is the St. George’s flag seen by the public?

Luke Tryl: So most British people are proud of a flag. In fact, when you ask people how do you feel when you see the St. George’s Cross flying, most Brits say that it makes them feel happy, they feel good about it. They like celebrating our national culture. Most Brits are very patriotic. But it’s a bit more subtle than that kind of American style standing up during the Pledge of Allegiance. So whilst on important days or on civic buildings, people expect to see the flag. I just wonder if the sort of flags everywhere, it looks a little bit odd. It jars a little with that kind of muddling through sense of patriotism that lots of Brits have.

He faces possible efforts by the Trump administration to deport him to Uganda.

The 30-year-old Salvadoran national was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the 30-year-old married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He denies the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution. Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to the smuggling charges.

Here's the latest:

Special envoy Keith Kellogg was speaking in Kyiv on Monday about efforts to end the three-year war between Russia and Ukraine as a lack of progress fuels doubts about whether a peace settlement could be on the horizon.

Officials are “hoping to get to a position where, in the near term, we have, with a lack of a better term, security guarantees” that address Ukraine’s fears of another invasion by Russia in the future, Kellogg said.

""That's a work in progress,"" Kellogg said of the potential security guarantees after attending Ukraine's annual National Prayer Breakfast along with politicians, business leaders and diplomats.

A week ago, President Trump said he'd set in motion arrangements for direct peace talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But Russian officials have signaled that such a summit won't happen any time soon.

The president plans to sign an executive order threatening to revoke federal funding from local and state governments that allow cashless bail, according to a White House official. The official requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the matter before a public announcement later in the morning.

Trump has been escalating his focus on public safety, particularly in Democratic cities such as Washington, where he’s deployed National Guard troops and federal agents over the objections of local officials.

— Chris Megerian

The president is scheduled to sign executive orders at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. One involves ending cashless bail, according to the White House Assistant Press Secretary. Another is designed to crack down on those who burn the American flag, which is an act protected by the First Amendment.

At noon, he's scheduled to greet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. The two will then participate in a bilateral meeting and a lunch, where they're expected to discuss trade and defense issues.

President Trump will sign an executive order later Monday that’s meant to crack down on those who burn the American flag, which is protected by the First Amendment.

The order calls on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute those who break laws “in ways that involve desecrating the flag,” according to a White House official.

Under the order, Bondi would also pursue litigation with the intent to potentially change what is allowed on flag burning under the First Amendment. The administration would also be allowed in some cases to deny or revoke visas to foreigners who participate in the act.

Trump has long demanded punishment for those who burn a U.S. flag, although the Supreme Court has ruled that doing so is a form of constitutionally protected free speech.

The court order signed by Chief Judge George Russell III automatically pauses any effort by the Trump administration to immediately deport Abrego Garcia.

Any immigrant seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court is covered by the order, which blocks their removal from the U.S. until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed. In June, the administration sued all of Maryland's 15 federal judges to challenge the standard order.

Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, says a lawsuit had been filed in federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention asking for an order that he not be deported.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

This latest development makes good on a directive issued late last week by Trump's defense secretary.

A Defense Department official who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly said some units on certain missions would be armed — some with handguns and others with rifles. The spokesperson said that all units with firearms have been trained and are operating under strict rules for use of force.

An Associated Press photographer on Sunday saw members of the South Carolina National Guard outside Union Station with holstered handguns.

A statement from the joint task force that has taken over policing in the nation’s capital said units began carrying their service weapons on Sunday and that the military’s rules say force should be used “only as a last resort and solely in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.” It said the force is committed to protecting “the safety and wellbeing” of Washington’s residents.

But the court documents weren’t publicly available. They filed it in the federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, where U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has been presiding over a string of hearings for the original case.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s story begins in his native El Salvador, but it’s become increasingly unclear where it will end.

A local gang, Barrio 18, began extorting his family for “rent money.” When he was 12, the gang threatened to take Abrego Garcia away until his father paid “all of the money that they wanted.”

Abrego Garcia eventually fled to the U.S. illegally around 2011, the year he turned 16, according to documents in his immigration case. He found work in construction.

In March 2019, Abrego Garcia went to a Home Depot seeking work as a laborer when he and three other men were detained by local police, court records say. They were suspected of being in MS-13 based on tattoos and clothing, according to the records.

Abrego Garcia became a flash point in Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's earlier determination that he faced a ""well-founded fear"" of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The latest filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

On Friday, Abrego Garcia returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

Take care of yourself.” LISTEN: EL PASO MATTERS PODCAST","It was a hot July summer day in Miami when, looking to make a little extra income, Ricardo Quintana Chavez took to the beach to sell ceviche.

In just four weeks since, he’s been in four different detention centers – including the Dade County jail, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Florida known as Alligator Alcatraz, and two immigration detention facilities in El Paso.

“Hace un mes que no veo el sol. He bajado de peso 15 libras y tengo barba del siglo 19. Estoy desesperado y tambien por mi familia,” Quintana told El Paso Matters during a brief phone call from the East Montana Detention Facility on Fort Bliss. “I haven’t seen sunlight in a month. I’ve lost 15 pounds and have a 19th-century beard. I’m distressed for myself and for my family as well.”

Quintana, 57, an investigative journalist from Peru, said he sought asylum in the United States in 2021 after receiving death threats for his coverage of the Peruvian presidential elections and government corruption. While he had authorization to remain and work in the United States while his asylum case was heard, he said a definitive court date had never been set.

While in Florida, he worked in restaurants, ride-share companies and for a Peruvian natural products company. But as his salary and work hours were cut, he said he looked for ways to make extra income.

When he was detained in Miami for the civil infraction of selling items on a public beach without a permit, he paid the $180 fine – but was released to ICE agents who quickly and unexpectedly took him to Alligator Alcatraz. He was there through Aug. 8, when he was transported to the detention facility in Northeast El Paso, and transferred to the Fort Bliss center Aug. 15.

The $1.2 billion ICE detention complex – which will be the largest federal detention center for civil detainees in the country when it expands to accommodate 5,000 people – opened Aug. 1. Within two weeks, it held about 1,000 people.

The facility includes a game room, library, dining area and health care areas. The white reinforced tent facility sits on military land in the desert north of Montana Avenue near George Dieter Drive. It is staffed by ICE personnel and temporary employees who work under a private contractor.

“Es mejor aquí, si, pero mejor que que?” (“It’s better here, yes, but better than what?”) Quintana asked about the facility on the Eastside, which he characterized as cleaner, bigger and “more humane” than the one in Florida. In Alligator Alcatraz, he said, he was made to use the restroom while shackled and with an ICE agent in front of him with his back turned.

“When they took me to the county jail in Miami, that’s when my misfortune began,” he said in Spanish. “It was traumatic to be shackled at my feet and hands as if I had committed a major crime – or a crime at all. How is it that being in this country – with the government’s permission at that – is now a crime? Why was I considered to have legal status when it came to paying taxes but not now?”

Quintana came to the United States on a visitor visa for two weeks in 2019, and returned to Peru within the required time, according to his family. In August 2021, he returned to the United States on another visitor visa.

At that time, his family said, they received a letter containing death threats against him and his family stemming from his work as a journalist. Quintana said that’s when he decided to request asylum – a move his family supported for his safety. He was granted authorization to remain in the country and work here.

On July 20, he was selling ceviche on the beach when he was approached by local police. He was taken to the county jail and issued a fine, which he paid. Upon his release, he was turned over to ICE agents, who accused him of having overstayed his 2019 visa, he said, adding that he wasn’t given an opportunity to present the necessary documents needed to prove otherwise.

He was transported to Alligator Alcatraz, a converted airstrip at the abandoned Dade-Collier airport in the marshy Everglade wetlands just west of Miami. The center has a capacity of about 3,000 people and is among several ICE facilities erected to expand immigrant detention capacity under President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

In response to a lawsuit by environmental groups, a federal judge on Thursday ordered that detainees be moved out of the facility within 60 days, no longer accept new detainees and that equipment such as generators and fencing be dismantled.

“En una miseria increíble,” Quintana said Thursday, recounting that it took 12 hours to be processed into the facility – all while shackled. Eventually he was placed in a 13-by-10-foot cell with about 30 other people. The facility was overcrowded and dirty, he said, and the meals were like dog food. “It’s unbelievably miserable.”

He said he – like many others – weren’t told why they were being transferred to Texas. At the Northeast El Paso facility, he said, staff were generally nicer and more tolerant than in Florida. But detainees were still demeaned, he said.

Nights are always the worst, he said.

“Los llantos y gritos de la gente desesperada te rompe el corazón, especialmente porque sabemos que la mayoría de los que estamos aquí no deberíamos,” he said. “The cries and screams of desperate people break your heart, especially because we know that the majority of those here shouldn’t be.”

Civil rights organizations such as ACLU Texas, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Border Network for Human Rights have denounced what they call inhumane conditions at the detention facilities, also protesting that they’re being built on military bases with Department of Defense dollars.

On Thursday, the groups gathered alongside the veterans organization Common Defense in El Paso, saying in a statement that converting the base into an immigration detention center is “a betrayal of our values, a misuse of resources, and a stain on our nation.” The groups pointed out that a tent facility leaves detainees exposed to brutal heat and sandstorms.

“Military bases are meant to protect our freedoms, not cage human beings,” Common Defense’s Lead Texas Organizer and Air Force veteran Britni Cuington said in a statement. “The fact that ICE is detaining people at Fort Bliss is disgraceful and unacceptable.”

Waiting to be sent home

For Quintana, the site of a detention center is not a concern as much as being locked up not knowing where he stands or where he might be sent next.

Quintana said he wants to self-deport rather than wait to be officially removed, which can take much longer than the alternative, he said. Under voluntary departure, he’d be allowed to leave at his own expense and on his own terms. A forced removal, or deportation, carries consequences such as reentry bans.

The wait might be especially long since deportation flights to Peru are much less frequent. In July 2025, four deportation flights to Peru were recorded – compared with 54 to Guatemala, the highest for any receiving country that month, according to an ICE flight monitor known as Witness at the Border, now under the organization Human Rights First.

Since Trump’s inauguration in January through July, 1,036 deportation flights have been recorded – an increase of 15% over the same time the previous year, according to the flight monitor.

At the same time, detentions of immigrants continue on the rise: As of Aug. 10, more than 59,000 people were in ICE detention – 70% without any criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, or TRAC. The majority of detainees – over 13,000 – are in Texas.

TRAC isn’t yet reporting the number of detainees at the East Montana facility, but another ICE detention center in East El Paso had an average daily population of just over 800 in early August. The tent facility in Northeast reported just under 200 at that time.

Quintana, a longtime reporter and editor who last worked for Digital TV Peru, graduated from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima and the Universidad de San Martin de Porres, earning communication and journalism degrees. He said men of all ages and backgrounds are being detained at the East Montana facility.

He said his heart breaks most for the young men who braved traversing thousands of miles across dangerous countries with the goal of working and earning a little money to send home. Now they’re imprisoned, he said, and they’re too young to understand why.

Journalist’s case gets news, government attention

For Quintana, his reporting background has helped his story get news coverage in his home country, he said, prompting his case to be discussed in a foreign relations committee hearing by the Peruvian congress Aug. 18. Committee members said that the government should seek to help Peruvians detained not just in authoritarian countries, but in democratic countries where they’re essentially being disappeared.

Sadith Tavara, Quintana’s wife, said journalism has always been a way of life for him. “He’s a police investigative journalist and he’s very passionate about his profession, about ensuring that people know the truth,” Tavara told El Paso Matters.

Quintana’s family had struggled to find an attorney, particularly as he’s been moved around so much. On Friday, he talked to an attorney who is now working to get his case file from Florida to set up a hearing, Tavara said.

“We’re a little more hopeful, but we won’t be at ease until he’s home,” Tavara said.

Tavara said the family most fears that he’ll remain locked up longer than his mental health can handle – or that he’ll be deported to a country other than Peru. Their hope, she said, is that he’s allowed to self-deport soon.

“A place like that can break anyone,” she said, adding that being jailed in a foreign country where he’s unwanted has been difficult for her husband. “We want him back.”

Quintana’s sister, Monica, called his situation, like that of many others, a violation of civil rights.

“Everything that is happening is devastating for families who are undergoing the same travesty,” she said.

She said she’s been able to talk to her brother almost daily. On days she doesn’t hear from him, she fears the worst. On a recent call, she said, he broke down and there was little she could say to comfort him.

“You just don’t know, “ she said, “and not knowing is the worst.”

In his call with El Paso Matters, Quintana said he has changed his perspective about the United States.

“Estoy viviendo la pesadilla americana,” he said. “I’m living the American nightmare.”

“No pienso regresar nunca más en mi vida,” he added. “I don’t plan to ever return in my lifetime.”

Quintana said he had planned to return to Peru soon: His ailing mother is 81 and has had heart complications.

On Aug. 10, his family was being interviewed by a Peruvian news organization, Cuarto Poder, when he called his mother to check in.

“Tranquila, mami, tranquila. Ya pronto nos veremos las caras o sea lo que quiera Dios.

Cuidate,” he told her as she sobbed. “Remain calm, mami, remain calm. We will see each other face-to-face soon, God willing. Take care of yourself.”

In a statement after his detention, Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said Abrego Garcia is being processed ""for removal to Uganda.""

At the core of Abrego Garcia's case is the question of due process under President Trump's aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The man was arrested in March and sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to the Central American country because of the ""well-founded fear"" of gang persecution there. The Trump administration conceded Abrego Garcia's removal was an ""administrative error,"" and returned him to the U.S. in June, to face criminal charges.

He was indicted on two charges, including conspiracy to transport undocumented immigrants and unlawful transportation of migrants without legal status.

The Trump administration has said it intends to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, despite the latter government indicating last week it prefers to receive people from other African countries and individuals without criminal records.

Associated Press

BALTIMORE (AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia surrendered to U.S. immigration authorities in Baltimore Monday and faces possible efforts by the Trump administration to deport him immediately.

The 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

“This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Abrego Garcia entered the offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a downtown office building. His wife emerged without him a few minutes later, appearing to have tears in her eyes.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a tweet that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said a lawsuit had been filed in federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention asking for an order that he not be deported.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

Abrego Garcia became the face of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee. He returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, which recently agreed to a deal to accept certain deportees from the U.S. He declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Filings in federal court show the Costa Rican government saying Abrego Garcia would be welcomed as a legal immigrant and wouldn’t face detention.

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

“Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,” Gilmartin said.

The U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours’ notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.

“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.

Now They're Suing.,Francesca D’Annunzio,,,,,https://www.texasobserver.org/dems-in-congress-are-being-denied-access-to-ice-facilities-now-theyre-suing/,"“As part of its campaign of mass deportation, the Trump-Vance administration has stretched the U.S. immigration detention system far beyond its capacity.
Those mandates for unfettered oversight were a direct response to Trump’s attempts to block members of Congress under his first administration.
Texas has the largest immigration detention capacity in the country, putting the state on the front lines of Trump’s mass deportation agenda.
(A report from several advocacy groups found that dozens of deaths between 2017 and 2021 in ICE detention facilities could have been prevented with adequate medical care.)
Earlier this year, the Trump administration gutted some of the entities tasked with facility oversight, including the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman.","At least a dozen Democratic members of Congress have been denied entry to federal immigration facilities this year when they showed up to conduct oversight as President Donald Trump has ramped up his mass deportation efforts—and now they are suing the Trump administration.

The lawsuit was filed in the federal district court for the District of Columbia on July 30 by 12 Democrats from the House of Representatives, including El Paso Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, who has provided oversight of such facilities for several years.

“As part of its campaign of mass deportation, the Trump-Vance administration has stretched the U.S. immigration detention system far beyond its capacity. More people are being held by the United States in immigration detention than ever before, with many facilities housing more individuals than they were built to contain,” the lawsuit states. “Reports of mistreatment have been widespread and have included disturbing details of overcrowding, food shortages, lack of adequate medical care, and unsanitary conditions.”

Since 2019, Congress has adopted statutory provisions stating that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may not use federal funds may to prevent members “from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house” noncitizens, per the lawsuit. Those mandates for unfettered oversight were a direct response to Trump’s attempts to block members of Congress under his first administration.

However, since June, several members of Congress have been turned away when attempting to enter and examine federal immigration facilities, including privately run detention centers and ICE field offices where immigrants have been detained.

Escobar currently serves on the House Appropriations Committee and its Subcommittee on Homeland Security, which oversees DHS. In her six years serving Congress, she and her staff members have conducted numerous visits to DHS facilities, and identified issues that saved taxpayers money or improved facility conditions for detainees. Prior to this year, she had only been turned away once, in 2019, from a facility when attempting to conduct oversight.

“It is not acceptable for the Trump administration to ignore the law and limit Congressional oversight and authority; this cannot go unchallenged,” Escobar said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.

U.S. Representative Greg Casar, an Austin Democrat, is among the latest members of Congress to be turned away when requesting to conduct oversight duties. On August 15, Casar attempted to access the Don T. Hutto Detention Center in Taylor, which is operated by DHS contractor CoreCivic, to conduct oversight after receiving complaints that the air conditioning was not functioning properly and that detainees were “boiling.” The congressman, along with Austin-based attorney Andrea Jarero, who was trying to visit a client, were both denied access by CoreCivic.

When journalists, activists, Casar and his staff arrived at the detention facility, CoreCivic employees had blocked off access to the building’s parking lot with traffic cones and two white vans. A CoreCivic employee exited his vehicle, and told Casar he’d need to schedule any visits at least seven days in advance.

“This advance notice is necessary to ensure proper scheduling and to avoid any intrusion on the President’s Article II authority to oversee executive department functions,” the employee said, reading from a piece of paper.

The statutory provisions of recent DHS appropriations bills explicitly say that they may not “be construed to require a Member of Congress to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a [DHS] facility.”

However, per the lawsuit, the Trump administration has unilaterally enacted a new policy that requires seven calendar days’ notice ahead of any visit to a DHS facility.

“What are they hiding, if they will break the law and not let a member of Congress in?” Casar said. “What are they hiding if they’ll violate constitutional rights and not let a lawyer in?”

Casar said that he intends to join his fellow Democratic members of Congress as a plaintiff in the lawsuit—though he has not done so yet.

Texas has the largest immigration detention capacity in the country, putting the state on the front lines of Trump’s mass deportation agenda. As of early August, more than 13,000 immigrants were detained in Texas facilities, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC)—far more than any other state. That number will likely continue to grow: a new, $1.24 billion immigration detention camp opened last week on Fort Bliss, a military base in El Paso, and is poised to be the nation’s largest once it reaches its full capacity to hold 5,000 people. (Escobar was allowed to access that facility on August 18, and said it held 1,000 detainees at that time, though she was not able to speak to any.)

Recent events bring new urgency to immigration detention inspections: as of late June, 13 people had died in ICE detention this fiscal year—which is the same amount of deaths for the entirety of fiscal year 2024. (A report from several advocacy groups found that dozens of deaths between 2017 and 2021 in ICE detention facilities could have been prevented with adequate medical care.)

Additionally, more people are detained in ICE custody than ever before, and that number will likely continue to grow. The agency is also set to receive historic levels of funding; HR1, Congress’ recent tax cuts-and-spending bill, contains $75 billion for ICE detention and removal operations.

As spending ramps up, oversight mechanisms have been stifled. Earlier this year, the Trump administration gutted some of the entities tasked with facility oversight, including the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman.

Escobar, the El Paso Democratic House member, said oversight is supposed to be multi-layered, but now “Trump has effectively done away with government watchdogs,” she told the Texas Observer.

Since the other agencies tasked with holding DHS accountable in detention centers have had major staff cuts, the role of members of Congress in conducting oversight of immigration detention is more important than ever, she said.

“There’s absolutely no reason for [DHS Secretary] Kristi Noem to block members of Congress from our legal ability to enter a facility unannounced,” Escobar said. “Unless she believes she has something to hide.”",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1518-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 09:56:21.259689

In their new maps, Texas legislators poured more Republican voters into those South Texas districts.
Three Latino Democrats currently represent the Alamo City and its metro area: Cuellar, Joaquin Castro and Greg Casar.
In California, Latino voters are also crucial to Gov.
Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley’s district would swing into Sacramento, picking up many more Latino voters than he now has in the majority white Eastern Sierra.","Latinos unleashed a political earthquake after voting for Donald Trump, who has long painted the country’s largest minority as an existential threat, in unexpectedly large numbers in the fall.

This swing to MAGA helped Trump win, kicked Democrats into the political wilderness, launched a thousand thought pieces and showed politicians that they ignore Latinos at their own risk.

Now, Latinos once again hold the power to make or break American politics, thanks to redistricting fights shaping up in Texas and California. And once again, both Democratic and Republican leaders think they know what Latinos want.

In the Lone Star State, the GOP-dominated Legislature last week approved the redrawing of congressional districts at the behest of Trump, upending the traditional process, to help Republicans gain up to five seats in the 2026 midterms. Their California counterparts landed on the opposite side of the gerrymandering coin — their maps, which will go before voters in November, target Republican congressional members.

Texas Republicans and California Democrats are both banking on Latinos to be the swing votes that make their gambits successful. That’s understandable but dangerous. If ever a voting bloc fulfills the cliche that to assume something makes an ass out of you and me, it’s Latinos.

Despite President Reagan’s famous statement that Latinos were Republicans who didn’t know it yet, they rejected the GOP in California and beyond for a generation after the passage of Proposition 187 in 1994. When Hillary Clinton supporters whispered during the 2008 presidential race that Latinos would never vote for a Black candidate, they gladly joined the coalition that put Barack Obama in the White House. Trump increased his Latino support each time he ran — to the point that in 2024, a bigger proportion of Latinos voted for him than for any previous Republican presidential candidate — even though Democrats insisted that Latinos couldn’t possibly stomach a man that racist.

Many Latinos hate being taken for granted and don’t like the establishment telling them how to think. It’s classic rancho libertarianism, the term I created in the era of Trump to describe the political leanings of the people with whom I grew up: Mexican Americans from rural stock who simultaneously believed in community and individualism and hated the racist rhetoric of Republicans but didn’t care much for the woke words of Democrats, either.

Such political independence exasperates political leaders, yet it’s long been a thing with Latino voters across the U.S. but especially in Texas and California, where Mexican American voters make up an overwhelming majority of each state’s Latino electorate. As Republicans in the former and Democrats in the latter launch their initial redistricting volleys, they seem to be forgetting that, yet again.

The GOP is hoping voters in South Texas, one of the most Latino areas of the U.S., will carry their Trump love to the 2026 congressional races. There, two of the three congressional seats are held by Democrats Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, despite a swing from most of the region’s 41 counties supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016 to just five going for Kamala Harris eight years later.

In their new maps, Texas legislators poured more Republican voters into those South Texas districts. They also configured new districts in the Houston area and central Texas so that Latinos are now the majority, but voters favored Trump last year.

But a lawsuit filed hours after the Texas Senate moved the maps to Gov. Greg Abbott for his approval alleged that all the finagling had created “Potemkin majority-Latino districts.” The intent, according to the lawsuit, was to dilute Latino power by packing some voters into already Democratic-leaning districts while splitting up others among red-leaning districts.

The legislators especially threw San Antonio, a longtime Democratic stronghold that’s a cradle of Latino electoral power, into a political Cuisinart. Three Latino Democrats currently represent the Alamo City and its metro area: Cuellar, Joaquin Castro and Greg Casar. Under the new maps, only Castro is truly safe, while Casar is now in a district represented by Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who has announced he will retire.

“We have three Hispanic-predominated districts in South Texas that we believe we can carve out for Republican leadership,” state GOP Rep. Mitch Little bragged on CNN this month. “It’s good for our party. It’s good for our state. And we need to ensure that Donald Trump’s agenda continues to be enacted.”

The thing is, fewer and fewer Latinos are supporting Trump’s agenda. In Reuters/Ipsos polls, his Latino support dropped from 36% in February to 31% this month. Only 27% of Latinos approved of his performance in a Pew Research Center poll released this month.

If this slide continues through next year and Latinos continue to reject MAGA, Texas Republicans would have done Trump’s gross gerrymandering and sparked a nationwide legislative civil war for nothing.

In California, Latino voters are also crucial to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting push — but Democrats are hoping they’ll be GOP spoilers, despite their recent tack to the right.

Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley’s district would swing into Sacramento, picking up many more Latino voters than he now has in the majority white Eastern Sierra.

Proposed districts for Democrats Josh Harder and Adam Gray in Central California and Derek Tran in Orange County, all of whom the party is trying to buttress after they squeaked through in close elections in the fall, also include areas with more Latinos. A new congressional district in southeast L.A. County would probably be filled by a Latino Democrat.

Powerful Latinos in the state have already come out in favor of Newsom’s so-called Election Rigging Response Act, and the governor is counting on them to convince Latino voters to approve the maps in November.

But all this shuffling is happening a year after those very voters jolted state Democrats. Although the party still holds a super-majority in Sacramento, Democratic legislators serve alongside the largest number of Latino GOP colleagues ever. The biggest swings to Trump happened in areas with larger Latino populations, according to a Public Policy Institute of California report published last month.

The president’s popularity is especially souring in California due to his deportation deluge — but whether Latinos will support redistricting is another matter.

Although 51% of Latinos support Newsom’s performance, only 43% said they would vote yes on his redistricting push — the lowest percentage of any ethnic group, according to a UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll conducted for the Los Angeles Times. The poll also found that 29% of Latinos are undecided on redistricting — the highest percentage of any group.

Such skepticism is the bitter fruit of a generation of Democratic rule in Sacramento, at a time when blue-collar Latinos are finding it harder to achieve the good life. Politicians blaming it all on Trump eventually created a Chicken Little situation that pushed those Latinos into MAGAlandia — and Newsom, by constantly casting redistricting as a necessary uppercut against Trump, is in danger of making the same mistake.

California Latinos have helped to torpedo liberal shibboleths at the ballot box more often than Democrats will ever admit. A Times exit poll found 45% of them voted to recall Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 while 53% voted yes on the anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 in 2008 even as a bigger majority voted for Obama. So egghead arguments about how redistricting will save the future of democracy won’t really land with the rancho libertarians I know. They want cheaper prices, and Trump isn’t delivering them — but neither is Newsom.

Latinos, as another cliche goes, aren’t a monolith. They could very well help Republicans win those extra congressional seats in Texas and do the same for Democrats in California.

But any politician betting that Latinos will automatically do what they’re expected to ... remind me what happens when you assume something?",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c899c9d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6a%2F99%2Ff16ef9d242a99b2f74e200ae2bd3%2F1518278-me-newsom-redistricting-plan15-ajs.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 09:56:25.133473

As he arrived for his immigration check-in, Mr. Abrego Garcia was greeted by the cheers of dozens of supporters.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Christie, who have known each other for decades, once had a good relationship.
Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Kushner in 2020 and named him ambassador to France this year.
On his way to the United States, Mr. Lee made a stopover in Tokyo and met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.","Outside the office, a lawyer for Mr. Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said that the stated intention of the meeting with ICE was for an interview. “Clearly, that was false,” he said, adding that the immigration authorities did not say why Mr. Abrego Garcia was being detained or even where he would be taken.

The crowd of supporters descended into chants of “boos” and “shame” to the news, and immigrant rights volunteers in yellow vests shielded Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family members as they left the building.

Shortly after, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers filed a legal action known as a habeas petition in Federal District Court in Maryland seeking to stop his removal to Uganda. The petition claimed that the Trump administration had re-arrested him without first giving him the opportunity to express “fears of persecution and torture in that country.”

Mr. Abrego Garcia should have a grace period of two business days from being deported again under a standing order issued in May by the chief federal judge in Maryland. The order automatically stopped the government from following through on expulsions of immigrants for 48 hours after they filed habeas petitions.

Over the weekend, his lawyers had accused the Trump administration of seeking to “coerce” a guilty plea from him on the charges of human smuggling that were brought against him in an indictment in June.

The lawyers said the administration had promised to send Mr. Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, where he could live freely as a legal resident, if he pleaded to the charges and agreed to serve whatever prison sentence he eventually received. Otherwise, the lawyers said, Trump officials said they would deport Mr. Abrego Garcia “halfway across the world” to Uganda, where, the lawyers said, “his safety and liberty would be under threat.”

“The government now seeks to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda as punishment, notwithstanding that Costa Rica is willing to take him in as a refugee,” one of the lawyers, Sean Hecker, said after the detention. “The government’s campaign of retribution continues because Mr. Abrego refuses to be coerced into pleading guilty to a case that should never have been brought.”

The arrest in Baltimore was the latest twist in a long-running saga that began this spring, when the Trump administration removed Mr. Abrego Garcia to a notorious terrorism prison in El Salvador, despite a court order that expressly barred him from being sent to the country. Then, after weeks of complaining that they were powerless to bring him back to U.S. soil, Trump officials did exactly that — not merely to correct their own mistake but to file criminal charges against him.

As he arrived for his immigration check-in, Mr. Abrego Garcia was greeted by the cheers of dozens of supporters. His wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and his brother, Cesar, were by his side. Speaking to the crowd, he thanked the people who had stood with him and delivered an emotional plea to immigrants and the immigrant rights community to keep up the fight and not lose hope.

“Brothers and sisters, my name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia,” he said. “And I always want you to remember that today, I can say with pride, that I am free and have been reunited with my family.”

Mr. Abrego Garcia, dressed in jeans, sneakers and a black, gray and white polo, appeared nervous when he first arrived. His eyes shifted from reporters to rally goers, and he took a deep breath. His voice broke as he spoke about how the memories of his family and playing with his children on a trampoline had sustained him while he was detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

But he held back his tears and finished his statement with resolve. He said those moments would continue to fuel him as he continued his legal battles and reminded the audience that his case was not about one immigrant family but the many targeted under the Trump administration’s crackdown.

“To all of the families who have also suffered separations or who live under the constant threat of being separated,” he said, “I want to tell you that even though this injustice is hurting us hard, we must not lose hope.”

He continued: “God is with us, and God will never leave us. God will bring justice to all of the injustice.”

As he climbed the steps to the federal building, with immigration agents around, the scene turned chaotic. Mr. Abrego Garcia bowed his head as he slowly walked into the building. The crowd chanted “ICE go home” and “Si se puede,” or “yes you can” in Spanish.

“Our shared commitment to our country, our oaths of office, and our mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters compel us to warn Congress and the American people of the cascading effects of decisions made by the current administration,” the FEMA employees wrote in the letter.

They added that they hoped their warnings would “come in time to prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.”

Representatives for FEMA and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hurricane Katrina’s landfall in Louisiana and Mississippi caused an estimated 1,833 deaths and $161 billion in property damage and shook the country’s confidence in the government’s ability to handle disasters. President George W. Bush faced intense criticism for the slow federal response to Katrina’s devastation in New Orleans, leading to the resignation of Mr. Bush’s FEMA administrator, Michael D. Brown, and the passage of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act.

That landmark law imposed new eligibility criteria for FEMA administrators, requiring that they have a “demonstrated ability in and knowledge of emergency management.” It also prohibited the homeland security secretary from interfering with FEMA’s “authorities, responsibilities or functions,” among other things.

But the Trump administration has ignored both requirements of the law, the FEMA employees wrote in the letter.

Mr. Trump installed first one and then another acting FEMA administrator who lack experience in emergency management. The current acting head, David Richardson, told employees in June that he did not know the United States had a hurricane season — a comment that unnerved FEMA employees who heard it. The agency later said Mr. Richardson was joking.

And Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has become directly involved in FEMA operations. She has imposed new spending rules that have delayed hundreds of FEMA contracts and that hampered FEMA’s response to the catastrophic floods that swept through Central Texas in July.

At the same time, the administration has eliminated billions of dollars in FEMA grants intended to help communities better withstand disasters. The administration is also now requiring disaster survivors to provide email addresses when applying for FEMA aid, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times — a change that could prevent people with limited internet access from receiving vital assistance.

And the very future of the agency is unclear. In June, Mr. Trump said he wanted to eliminate FEMA after the end of hurricane season and move emergency management efforts “back to the state level.” After the Central Texas floods in July, when many Americans were focused on the rescue efforts, the administration’s rhetoric softened and officials spoke instead of reforming the agency.

Still, about 2,000 employees have left FEMA since Mr. Trump took office, accounting for about one-third of the agency’s permanent work force. Those who resigned included some of the agency’s most accomplished leaders. The situation has alarmed the FEMA employees who signed the letter, which lamented the loss of “experienced staff whose institutional knowledge and relationships are vital to ensure effective emergency management.”

Of the 182 FEMA employees who signed the letter, 36 attached their names, while the rest withheld their identities for fear of retaliation. The letter was sent to the leaders of several congressional committees and to the FEMA Review Council, which Mr. Trump created to provide recommendations on overhauling the agency.

A FEMA employee who helped organize the letter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said many workers declined to sign their names because they worried about being put on administrative leave. That was the fate of 144 employees at the Environmental Protection Agency after they signed a similar letter criticizing the administration.

A second FEMA employee who helped organize the letter, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she wanted to sound the alarm before it is too late and the next hurricane has struck.

This year’s Atlantic hurricane season has been relatively quiet, with Hurricane Erin avoiding landfall in the United States last week. But forecasters say hurricane season could ramp up before it ends on Nov. 30, with storms supercharged by warmer ocean waters fueled by human-caused climate change.

The company’s share price fell more than 16 percent Monday to fresh record lows in trading in Copenhagen.

“This latest development from the hostile U.S. administration is yet another blow to Orsted and makes the stock difficult to invest in,” Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at the Wall Street research firm Bernstein, wrote in a note to clients.

The wind farm, called Revolution Wind, aimed to supply electricity to 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut by next spring.

Revolution Wind is a 50/50 joint venture between Orsted and Skyborn Renewables, a company in the investment portfolio of BlackRock’s infrastructure unit.

The order on Friday to stop work on one of the Danish company’s premier projects heaped pressure on the company, which is seeking new funds from investors.

Earlier this month, Orsted rattled investors when it announced that it would need to raise 60 billion Danish kroner, or about $9.4 billion, by issuing new shares because of its inability to sell a stake in Sunrise Wind, another project off the East Coast of the United States.

In her note, Ms. Venkateswaran said that the order to cease work on Revolution Wind was “out of the blue” given that the project, according to Orsted, is 80 percent complete.

In a letter to Orsted ordering it to halt construction, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which supervises offshore development, mentioned “protection of the environment” and concerns about “national security” but gave little further detail.

On Monday, Orsted said that it would proceed with “preparation” for the planned share issue and that the Danish government, which owns 50.1 percent of the company, continued to support the offering.

Of the Revolution Wind project, the company said it “was evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously with permitting agencies and, potentially, through legal proceedings.”

Earlier this year, Equinor, the Norwegian energy giant, and Governor Kathy Hochul of New York were able to persuade the Trump administration to reverse an order to stop another large project, Empire Wind, off Long Island. Equinor wrote down nearly $1 billion in value because of the resulting delays.

Analysts say Orsted faces difficult decisions in the United States. Abandoning these projects would waste the capital already invested and lead to cancellation fees to contractors.

Yet putting additional money into U.S. projects is now risky, given the skepticism of the Trump administration about offshore wind. “It remains to be seen if management are willing to take such risk or decide to walk away,” wrote analysts from Citigroup.

Mr. Christie, a Republican who was a federal prosecutor before he was elected governor, had been discussing Mr. Trump’s connection to recent F.B.I. searches of the Maryland home and Washington office of John R. Bolton, a national security adviser in the president’s first term.

The raid last week of Mr. Bolton’s home and office was an escalation of a yearslong inquiry into whether he collected or leaked sensitive national security information. That episode, and Mr. Trump’s threat against Mr. Christie, were the latest examples of how the president’s campaign of retribution has undercut the principle that law enforcement should keep a distance from politics.

Mr. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform late Sunday that Mr. Christie had lied about 2013 lane closures on the George Washington Bridge “in order to stay out of prison, at the same time sacrificing people who worked for him.” The president was referring to a decision by Mr. Christie’s associates to close access lanes to the bridge, which links New Jersey and Manhattan, in order to punish the Democratic mayor of a New Jersey town.

“Chris refused to take responsibility for these criminal acts,” Mr. Trump wrote. “For the sake of JUSTICE, perhaps we should start looking at that very serious situation again? NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW!”

The 2013 “Bridgegate” closures created days of traffic jams, and the scandal tarnished Mr. Christie’s reputation and helped to destroy his 2016 presidential candidacy. Mr. Christie has long denied any knowledge of the plan. He could not immediately be reached for comment.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Christie, who have known each other for decades, once had a good relationship. Mr. Christie initially served as the head of Mr. Trump’s first presidential transition team, and he helped Mr. Trump with debate preparations in the run-up to the 2020 election.

But their relationship soured after Mr. Trump refused to concede the 2020 election to Joseph R. Biden Jr. When Mr. Christie ran for president again last year, he was the most vocal Trump critic in the Republican primary field. And members of Mr. Trump’s family are said never to have warmed to Mr. Christie, who led the prosecution that resulted in the 2005 conviction of Charles Kushner, the father of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and former adviser, Jared Kushner. Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Kushner in 2020 and named him ambassador to France this year.

In 2016, two of Mr. Christie’s associates were convicted of wire fraud and other federal charges for their roles in the bridge closure, but the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the convictions four years later. Mr. Trump said at the time that the court’s decision was a “complete and total exoneration” of Mr. Christie, who was not charged in the case, “and all others involved.”

It was not immediately clear what aspect of Mr. Christie’s Sunday appearance on ABC’s “This Week” had led Mr. Trump to threaten him on social media.

Mr. Christie mentioned the president by name after he was asked by the journalist Jonathan Karl whether Vice President JD Vance, who has defended the criminal investigation into Mr. Bolton, is playing a role in it.

Mr. Christie responded by mentioning what he called the administration’s disregard for the idea of separation between the president and criminal investigations. He noted that Mr. Trump had recently described himself as the nation’s “chief law enforcement officer.”

“Donald Trump sees himself as the person who gets to decide everything, and he doesn’t care about any separation,” Mr. Christie told Mr. Karl. “In fact, he absolutely rejects the idea that there should be separation between criminal investigations and the politically elected leader of the United States. This is much different than it’s ever been run before.”

He said Mr. Trump had telegraphed this approach during his 2024 presidential campaign.

“He told you he was going to do this, that he was going to have a Justice Department that acted as his personal legal representation, and that is what they’re doing,” Mr. Christie said.

The search of Mr. Bolton’s Maryland home and Washington office came days after Mr. Trump attacked him for criticizing his approach to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. Mr. Bolton was pushed out of the first Trump administration in 2019, after he disagreed with the president on several foreign policy challenges.

In a statement, Maj. Michael A. Maxwell said that the change was directed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. On Friday, officials said Mr. Hegseth authorized Guard members to carry their weapons, though without giving specifics on how often members would be armed as they walked through the city.

Major Maxwell emphasized that service members would operate under established rules for the use of force, employing it “only as a last resort and solely in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.”

He said that more than 2,200 Guard troops were deployed in Washington as of Sunday, including about 900 D.C. members and others from Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.

Mr. Trump ordered the deployment of troops in Washington two weeks ago, saying that they would help an array of federal agents crack down on crime in the city. But their mission remains vague, and much of the overall federal law enforcement effort has focused on low-level crimes and detention of undocumented immigrants.

Major Maxwell said Guard members would assist in surveying for “community restoration” projects and aid the D.C. police in staffing at public transit stops as the school year began.

Outside Union Station, as travelers waited quietly with their luggage to be picked up, several protesters jeered the half-dozen armed Guard members patrolling the area. One demonstrator, Nadine Seiler, heckled the troops while carrying a sign reading “Free D.C. Release the Epstein Files”; her partner in an orange vest banged a cowbell.

Ms. Seiler, 60, who is from Trinidad and Tobago, called the rollout of the troops in Washington a “manufactured crisis” by Mr. Trump.

She added, “As somebody who bought into American ideals and America’s vaunted Constitution, I can’t articulate how disappointed I am in lawmakers and the American people,” who she said were idle in a time of crisis.

Abbey Schneider, 51, a former Washington resident who was in town visiting family, said near the station that Sunday was the first time she and her daughter had seen Guard members armed after spotting them while out at night last week. “I have a visceral reaction to it,” Ms. Schneider said. “I feel it is unnecessary and a little bit scary. It feels like an escalation.”

The two leaders have a lot in common. Both survived assassination attempts before taking office. Both share an interest in meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. But their priorities diverge when it comes to the seven-decade-old alliance between their two countries — especially over a potential conflict between China and Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own.

Tens of thousands of U.S. troops have long been stationed in South Korea to deter North Korea, which has nuclear arms. But the Trump administration is demanding that Seoul take greater responsibility for its own defense, as Washington expands the role of its troops based in South Korea to help contain China. South Korea fears that this “strategic flexibility,” as the United States calls it, could leave it more vulnerable to the North and increase the chances of the South getting sucked into a war over Taiwan.

Seoul and Washington should ensure that strategic flexibility “will not undermine South Korea’s security” and the allies’ combined abilities to deter North Korea, Mr. Lee’s national security adviser, Wi Sung-lac, told reporters on Friday.

The allies have found some common ground over that principle, Mr. Wi said. But officials were also wary of Mr. Trump’s unpredictability.

“If the president somehow feels that he needs to elicit some more public statements from Lee Jae Myung as a partner in countering the Chinese economic and military threat, that might put President Lee in a position that would take him beyond his current talking points​,” Sydney Seiler, a Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said during an online panel discussion this past week.

Officials in Seoul are also concerned that if China ​invades Taiwan​ and the United States uses its forces in South Korea to defend Taiwan, China and North Korea ​could open another military conflict on the Korean Peninsula.

Similar concerns were behind a 2006 joint statement ​in which the United States agreed to respect South Korea’s position that “it shall not be involved in a regional conflict in Northeast Asia against the will of the Korean people.” Only then did South Korea agree to respect “the necessity for strategic flexibility” of the U.S. forces in ​South Korea.

But that was before the United States saw China as its biggest security threat and made defending Taiwan from Chinese aggression a priority. In recent weeks, some policy analysts in Washington have suggested that the U.S. military should drastically reduce its presence in South Korea because it cannot freely use its bases there to fight a war elsewhere.

If South Korea resists Washington’s demand on strategic flexibility, “the United States can simply relocate key components of its forces in South Korea to another ​region where it will face less constraint in sending them into a Taiwan contingency,” said Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean presidential adviser for diplomacy and national security.

This month, Gen. Xavier Brunson, the top U.S. military commander in Korea, said​ it should not be considered a foregone conclusion that the United States would want South Korea to join in a conflict between Taiwan and China.

But “what’s being asked of Korea is to be stronger” against North Korea so that the U.S. military might be able to “do other things,” General Brunson told reporters at the U.S. base in Pyeongtaek.

On his way to the United States, Mr. Lee made a stopover in Tokyo and met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. In a nod to Washington, Mr. Lee and Mr. Ishiba agreed to improve bilateral ties so that their nations could cooperate better with the United States to help contain China and North Korea. They also compared notes on an overlapping set of challenges, including Mr. Trump’s high tariffs and his pressure on U.S. allies to increase their military spending.

​Seoul and Washington have yet to hash out the details of the broad-stroke trade deal they agreed to​ last month. Mr. Trump agreed to lower his tariffs on South Korea’s exports, like Samsung phones and Hyundai cars, to 15 percent in return for a $350 billion investment package from the country​. He has also said that South Korea should ​increase its annual contribution to the upkeep of​ the U.S. troops on its soil​ to $10 billion​, more than nine times the current level​.

​These demands have some South Koreans wondering if it would be better to try to defend their country without U.S. troops. In recent years, surveys have shown that a majority of citizens want South Korea to build its own nuclear weapons instead of relying on the United States for protection.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/25/multimedia/25trump-news-promo915am/25trump-news-mwfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 09:56:35.018283

Advocates condemn federal deportation push against Abrego Garcia

Immigrant rights group CASA sharply criticized the federal government Monday for its handling of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's case, calling him a ""martyr"" for resisting what they describe as illegal deportation practices.

""Kilmar is being made an example of,"" said Lydia Walther-Rodriguez, CASA's chief of organizing and leadership, in a press release. ""They're throwing the entire federal apparatus at one father of three to prove that no one should dare challenge their authority.""

The statement comes amid growing backlash over the Trump administration's efforts to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, despite ongoing legal proceedings and public support from elected officials. CASA called the government's actions ""torturous"" and demanded an immediate end to what it views as retaliatory enforcement.

Trump to sign order targeting D.C.'s cashless bail policy

Trump is expected to sign an executive order Monday aimed at ending Washington, D.C.'s longstanding cashless bail system, according to a senior White House official. The order would pressure the district to abandon the policy by threatening to withhold federal funding and project approvals.

The directive also calls for suspects arrested in D.C. to be placed in federal custody rather than local detention, further expanding federal control over the city's criminal justice process.

D.C. has operated under a cashless bail framework since 1992, allowing judges to release defendants pretrial based on risk assessments rather than financial conditions. Critics of Trump's move say eliminating the policy could disproportionately harm low-income residents and undermine judicial discretion.

The order follows a series of aggressive federal actions in the capital, including arming National Guard troops and threatening deployments to other cities. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office declined to comment on the pending order.

What did Kilmar Abrego Garcia do?

The Trump administration accuses Kilmar Abrego Garcia of being a member of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang designated as a terrorist organization. The allegation stems from a 2019 police encounter in Maryland, where officers cited his clothing, tattoos, and a confidential source as indicators of gang affiliation. Abrego Garcia denies the claim, and his attorneys argue that the evidence is speculative and uncorroborated. He has never been convicted of gang-related activity in the U.S. or El Salvador.

In 2025, Abrego Garcia was indicted on federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee after being stopped while transporting several passengers. He pleaded not guilty, and his legal team says he was driving construction workers between job sites. No trafficking charges were filed at the time of the stop.

A domestic violence allegation also surfaced in 2021, when his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, filed a protective order claiming physical abuse. She later withdrew the petition, stating the couple had resolved the matter privately through counseling. Vasquez Sura continues to support her husband publicly and denies any gang involvement.

Despite these allegations, Abrego Garcia was granted protection from deportation to El Salvador in 2019 due to threats from rival gang Barrio-18. He has complied with immigration check-ins since then and maintains that he poses no danger to the community. His legal team argues that the government's efforts to deport him—particularly to Uganda—are retaliatory and politically motivated.

About Abrego Garcia's possible Uganda deportation

Kilmar Abrego Garcia could be deported to Uganda, the Associated Press reported on Saturday, citing a court filing.

The Salvadoran man, who was mistakenly sent to the high-security CECOT prison in El Salvador by the Trump administration in March, was returned to the United States in June following a lengthy court battle to face the human smuggling charges tied to a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee.

He was then held in pre-trial detention in Tennessee, from which he was released on Friday.

Following his release, his attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told CBS News. He declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica, which offered to receive him, so officials have turned to Uganda, which has agreed to receive deportees although preferably ""individuals from African countries.""

Newsweek has contacted the DHS for comment via email.

Abrego García detained by ice at Baltimore check-in

Kilmar Abrego García was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Monday morning after reporting to the agency's Baltimore field office, according to his attorney. The check-in was part of the conditions of his release pending trial on federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee.

Abrego García, a Maryland construction worker, had been released from criminal custody on Friday after months of legal battles stemming from what his lawyers describe as a wrongful deportation to El Salvador earlier this year.

The check-in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore was part of the conditions of his release from federal custody on parole on Friday.

While such meetings are usually routine and are meant for case updates, Abrego's attorneys said they expected he would be taken into ICE custody during the check-in after the Trump administration announced over the weekend its intenton to deport him to Uganda.

""There was no need to take him into ICE detention. ... The only reason they took him into detention was to punish him,"" for using his constitutional right to speak up and fight proceedings, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego's attorneys, said Monday morning.

He said lawyers asked ICE officers why Abrego was taken into custody, and the officers would not answer. The ICE officers would also not give information as to where Abrego is going, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

Abrego spoke at a news conference before heading into his ICE appointment on Monday morning, surrounded by family, supporters, faith leaders and his legal team, who were all calling for his freedom.

""My name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and I want you to remember this, remember that I am free and I was able to be reunited with my family,"" he said in Spanish before a translator repeated in English.

""This was a miracle. Thank you to God and thank you to the community,"" Abrego added. ""I want to thank each and every one of you who marched, lift your voices, never stop praying and continue to fight in my name.""

It's the latest move by the government to boot Abrego from the country after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, in violation of a 2019 court order. After much legal resistance, Abrego was returned to the U.S. in June and hit with human smuggling charges out of Tennessee, which he pleaded not guilty to.

The Trump administration has repeatedly accused Abrego of being a gang member part of the notorious MS-13, which his attorneys have denied. Abrego’s lawyers have said he illegally immigrated to the U.S. when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland to escape gang violence in El Salvador.

The Trump administration offered Abrego a plea deal last week, his lawyers said in a Saturday court filing that was part of their efforts to get the charges in Tennessee dropped over what they consider to be ""vindictive"" and ""selective"" prosecution.

If he pleads guilty to the federal charges out of Tennessee and serves time, he can be deported to Costa Rica. The Costa Rican government said he'd live as a free man there, according to the filing.

Before Monday morning's appointment, Sandoval-Moshenberg said his client would not be taking the plea deal as Abrego ""will not accept charges of which he's not guilty."" This means the agreement to be deported to Costa Rica could be off the table.

Abrego's attorneys rebuffed the Trump administration's apparent attempt to strong-arm him.

""What they’re trying to do here is punish him. They’re trying to use the deportation system, and specifically, they’re trying to use which country they’re planning on deporting him to as a means of punishing him for exercising his constitutional rights,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Saturday outside Abrego's brother's home in Maryland.

""As he was leaving the jail in Tennessee on Friday he'd been given a notice requiring him to check in at 8 a.m. this morning,"" Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. ""The notice stated that the reason was interview — clearly that was false.""

Sandoval-Moshenberg said Abrego Garcia had filed a new lawsuit challenging his confinement and deportation to any country ""unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court, as well as his full appeal rights.""

Sandoval-Moshenberg said the ICE officer did not answer when asked about the reason for Abrego Garcia's detention and would not say which detention center he would be taken to or commit to providing paperwork.

""There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshall Service and basically on house arrest,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. ""The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.""

Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January on federal human smuggling charges.

Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial detention on Friday. In a legal filing Saturday, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said Abrego Gracia was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica, which he declined.

He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.

CBS News reported Saturday that hours after he was released, his attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia, who entered the country illegally, was directed to appear at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore on Monday morning. The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement Sunday that he was glad to ""welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.""

""The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring Ábrego García back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda — to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,"" Van Hollen said. ""As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.""

An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country. But the government could legally seek Abrego Garcia's deportation to another country, such as Uganda.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" that ""I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the President of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.""

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this summer approved requests from the Department of Homeland Security to begin holding immigrants at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, Camp Atterbury in Indiana, and Fort Bliss in Texas, while also expanding migrant detention at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, according to correspondence obtained by NPR and confirmed by the Pentagon.

At Fort Bliss, ICE has already begun holding detainees in tent-like facilities, with capacity expected to reach 5,000 people — the largest civil immigration detention site in the United States. In Indiana and New Jersey, officials say the bases could soon accommodate between 1,000 and 3,000 people each. Together, the bases form the core of a new DHS strategy to process and deport immigrants from the country’s interior on an unprecedented scale.

Advocates Warn of Internment Echoes

Civil rights groups say the reliance on military bases for immigration detention is “deeply concerning” and risks normalizing the use of military infrastructure for civilian law enforcement.

“What we’re seeing with Fort Dix is an overreach that we shouldn’t normalize when it comes to the use of military facilities or military resources for immigration detention,” said Ami Kachalia of the ACLU of New Jersey. She and others compared the move to the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, when the U.S. government used military sites to confine citizens and residents based on ancestry.

Christopher Purdy, an Iraq War veteran who once served at Fort Dix, called the new policy the opposite of the humanitarian mission that military bases fulfilled during the 2021 Afghan evacuation. “Instead of taking people out of harm’s way, what they’re actually doing is putting people in danger,” Purdy told DocumentedNY. “Using the military to enforce immigration law is incredibly dangerous to this country.”

Military Readiness vs. Civilian Detention

Hegseth has insisted the deployments will not harm military training or readiness. In letters to lawmakers, he wrote that bases would remain focused on military missions, while ICE contractors and staff handle “all care and custody” of detainees, including meals, transportation, and medical services. Defense officials emphasized that no active-duty personnel would directly guard or process immigrants.

Still, the Pentagon has authorized National Guard troops to assist with detention-related “riot control” and guard duty, raising fears of militarization. Already, Guard units are helping ICE in Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, with hundreds more expected to be called up in at least seven additional states.

Lack of Transparency and Oversight

Lawmakers from New Jersey and Indiana — nearly all Democrats — say they have been left in the dark. Rep. Herb Conaway (D-N.J.) condemned the plan as “an inappropriate use of our national defense system and military resources,” while Rep. Andre Carson (D-Ind.) said his questions about detainee conditions remain unanswered.

The secrecy extends beyond Congress. The ACLU and immigrant rights groups have been denied details about detainee housing, deportation flight operations, or whether attorneys will have reliable access to clients on bases that are otherwise closed to the public. “If members of Congress can’t get inside to conduct oversight,” Purdy said, “what chance do asylum lawyers have?”

Billions in New Funding

The expansion comes on the heels of a congressional spending package that allocated $45 billion for immigration detention centers and $30 billion for ICE personnel, transportation and operations. Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar,” said the administration’s goal is to double U.S. detention capacity to 100,000 beds. “The faster we get the beds, the more people we can take off the street,” Homan said.

A Divisive Model for the Future

Supporters of the move, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), have hailed the Fort Bliss facility as proof of the administration’s commitment to mass deportations. But opponents warn it risks turning military posts into civilian prison camps.

“Military bases are not designed, staffed, or equipped for civilian detention operations,” said Jason Houser, ICE’s former chief of staff, in an interview with The Washington Post. “Detention at these facilities complicates oversight, legal access, and monitoring — raising the risk of violations and lack of transparency.”

For now, immigrant advocates say there is still time to stop the plan from fully taking hold. “These are not wartime operations,” said Sarah Mehta of the ACLU. “These are not national security operations. This is immigration detention, and we should not be using our armed forces to carry it out.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wm9O!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe74bebae-94f4-430d-a7f2-b6537a826f59_1000x667.webp",N,,2025-08-25 11:58:27.601410

What Trump is building is not a system of immigration law but a system of exclusion.","Key points:

Trump’s immigration agenda targets all immigrants, not just the undocumented.

Temporary visa holders and naturalized citizens face revoked visas and denaturalization threats.

Historians warn that the current immigration policies echo past injustices.

The Trump administration’s second-term immigration agenda has been billed as a crackdown on so-called “illegal” immigrants. The reality is much broader and much more dangerous.

In 2025, Trump’s policies have swept far beyond the undocumented. Temporary visa holders, asylum seekers, recipients of humanitarian status, lawful permanent residents, and even naturalized citizens have found themselves in the government’s crosshairs.

The result is a sweeping system of exclusion, one that undermines due process and chips away at the core promise of equal protection under the Constitution.

Since January, the administration has moved aggressively to revoke visas from students and workers over minor violations or even social media posts deemed critical of the government. It has gutted humanitarian protections such as Temporary Protected Status, shut down parole programs for multiple nationalities, and created new barriers to asylum.

It has also gone after permanent residents. Green card holders now face subjective vetting based on so-called “anti-American activity” online. The administration has backed legislation to deport lawful residents for old convictions, including DUIs.

Even citizenship itself is under threat. The Department of Justice has been directed to prioritize denaturalization cases, sometimes over paperwork errors.

In January, Trump issued an executive order attempting to restrict birthright citizenship guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment. Federal courts quickly blocked it, but the message was unmistakable.

As the administration has leaned on obscure legal theories to justify its agenda, Trump’s advisors have floated invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law passed during the John Adams administration, to override due process and accelerate deportations.

Expedited removal — a fast-track deportation procedure once limited to border cases — has been expanded to sweep up people across the interior.

Civil rights groups are fighting back. Legal challenges have slowed some of the administration’s moves, but the scale of enforcement has already changed the landscape.

On July 4, Trump signed into law the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — OBBBA — which the National Immigration Law Center describes as a historic rollback of immigrant protections. The law strips lawfully present immigrants of access to health insurance, nutrition assistance, and even the Child Tax Credit. It raises fees across the board for humanitarian applications, putting due process out of reach for many families.

Even more, OBBBA pours billions into detention and deportation. It provides $45 billion for immigrant detention, including family detention, and $75 billion for border militarization, including $47 billion for continued wall construction.

According to The New York Times, deportations surged to nearly 1,500 people a day this summer. ICE has added more than 50 new detention facilities, including private prisons and military bases. Almost all of the increase in arrests, the Times reported, has been among people with no criminal record.

The government is not distinguishing between undocumented and documented, between recent arrivals and longtime residents. It is casting suspicion on entire communities, reducing legal status to a temporary privilege the state can revoke at will.

Unfortunately, this is not as new as we would like to think it is.

After Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal and incarceration of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans. Two-thirds were U.S. citizens. None were ever charged with espionage or sabotage.

As historian Susan Kamei documents in When Can We Go Back to America?, Roosevelt acted despite intelligence reports concluding Japanese Americans posed no security threat. Instead, racist hysteria and economic opportunism drove the mass removal. California agricultural leaders saw Pearl Harbor as their chance to eliminate Japanese American farmers, openly saying they wanted their land.

The legal justification was flimsy. Officials concocted a “legal fiction” that the entire West Coast was a war zone, even though there was no evidence to support it. The Supreme Court upheld the orders in Korematsu v. United States, deferring to claims of “military necessity.” Justice Robert Jackson dissented, warning the ruling left behind “a loaded weapon” for future abuses.

That loaded weapon is now in Trump’s hands.

The echoes are chilling. Then, Japanese Americans lost homes, businesses, and freedom because of ancestry. Today, immigrants of all statuses are being treated as perpetual suspects, their rights contingent on government approval.

Then, the courts failed to stand up to executive overreach. Today, judges are again asked to decide whether expanded expedited removals and denaturalization campaigns will be allowed to stand.

Then, mass incarceration was justified as a temporary emergency. Today, mass detention is funded through 2029, with billions locked in to expand ICE, militarize the border, and normalize indefinite family detention.

The incarceration left lasting scars. Families lost everything overnight.

Survivors carried deep grief, as Representative Robert Matsui, who was born in camp, once asked: “How can a nation founded on principles of individual rights suddenly deny the due process rights of an entire group of people?”

The answer is the same in 2025 as it was in 1942: through fear, prejudice, and unchecked power.

It took more than four decades for Congress to apologize and offer redress. By then, many incarcerees had passed away. Norman Mineta, who entered camp as a boy and later became a Congressman and a Cabinet secretary, insisted America must remember so history would not repeat.

But history is repeating. The lessons of incarceration are being ignored.

What Trump is building is not a system of immigration law but a system of exclusion. It is a system that punishes families for where they were born, strips rights from lawful residents, and even threatens the constitutional bedrock of citizenship itself.

The question is whether Americans will stand by, just as most did in 1942, or whether we will resist now. The voices of survivors warn us that silence is complicity.

As George Santayana famously wrote, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Kamei adds her own corollary: “Those who don’t know our past will find a way to reinvent it”.

Trump has reinvented it. The rest of us must decide if we will let it stand.

Any immigrant seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court is covered by the order, which blocks their removal from the U.S. until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed. In June, the administration sued all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges to challenge the standard order.

--

Kilmar Abrego Garcia surrendered to U.S. immigration authorities in Baltimore Monday and faces possible efforts by the Trump administration to deport him immediately.

The 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

“This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Abrego Garcia entered the offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a downtown office building. His wife emerged without him a few minutes later, appearing to have tears in her eyes.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a tweet that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said a lawsuit had been filed in federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention asking for an order that he not be deported.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

Abrego Garcia became the face of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee. He returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, which recently agreed to a deal to accept certain deportees from the U.S. He declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Filings in federal court show the Costa Rican government saying Abrego Garcia would be welcomed as a legal immigrant and wouldn’t face detention.

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

“Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,” Gilmartin said.

The U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours’ notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.

“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.

In July 2025, the Trump administration announced its plans to use the military base to hold thousands of people facing deportation.
“Using the military to enforce civil law [and] immigration law is incredibly dangerous to this country,” Purdy said.
Following the Trump administration’s memo announcing plans to detain immigrants at military bases, New Jersey Congressmen Herb Conaway and Donald Norcross said the administration has given them no information about the base, despite them requesting full transparency.

In July 2025, the Trump administration announced its plans to use the military base to hold thousands of people facing deportation.

But immigrant justice advocates are concerned that the military base, with its capacity to hold between 1,000 to 3,000 immigrants in detention, would be repeating a shameful history of America’s past when the nation used the military in civil immigration affairs to incarcerate Japanese Americans during World War II. The base currently serves the Air Force, Army and Navy.

The additional lack of transparency about how the facility will operate makes advocates even more worried as New Jersey contends with detention centers already in operation, including New Jersey’s Elizabeth Detention Center with 1,300 beds and the recently opened 1,000-bed center, Delaney Hall.

“The use of the military for interior enforcement is deeply concerning,” said Ami Kachalia, a campaign strategist with the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). “What we’re seeing with Fort Dix is an overreach that we shouldn’t normalize when it comes to the use of military facilities or military resources for immigration detention.”

The use of the Department of Defense (DOD) resources, staff and facilities in civil proceedings, is fairly unprecedented in recent years, Kachalia said. ​​

“This action, in some ways, reopens a shameful chapter of U.S. history putting […] visa holders and long term residents in camps on a military base, harkens back to a dark era [of] Japanese internment, and we must make sure we’re learning from the past and not repeating it,” Kachalia added.

Christopher Purdy, director of the Chamberlain Network, an organization that “organizes veterans in defense of human rights,” said that the use of military bases to hold immigrants originated as a humanitarian effort from the Biden administration during the Afghan evacuation in 2021. Purdy, who served in Iraq in 2011 as a soldier and also formerly worked at the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, said they airlifted 100,000 people out of Kabul into military bases around the world — including Fort Dix — while they sought asylum. The Obama administration also held unaccompanied children at military bases until 2014.

Today, he says the Trump administration is doing the opposite. “Instead of taking people out of harm’s way, what they’re actually doing is putting people in danger.” Like Kachalia, Purdy believes the usage of military installations to conduct civil proceedings and detain immigrants echoes the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II.

“Using the military to enforce civil law [and] immigration law is incredibly dangerous to this country,” Purdy said. “We have a clear separation between law enforcement and the military for a reason, and to use the military in this way is going to put a lot of people at risk.”

Kachalia said that she is concerned that the use of this infrastructure will result in even more enforcement that will impact New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Delaware. She is concerned that the uncertain timeline of this operation calls into question many things such as conditions and access to sufficient food, heating and staffing.

Lack of transparency

After numerous requests by the ACLU and members of Congress, the DOD and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have yet to provide information about the base, a fact that concerns advocates worried about the militarization of immigration enforcement and detention and what that will mean.

Sarah Mehta, deputy director of the ACLU’s immigration team, said that advocates are still trying to learn about the plans for Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst and hope to get more information about who the immigrant population to be detained there will be, how long they’re going to be in detention and if they will be deported from the base.

“These are not wartime operations,” Mehta said. “These are not national security operations.”

She added that it was unclear if the military would still be able to use the base, or use the base for deportation flights. “We haven’t got a public answer about that yet,” she said, “but it could […] really shift the way that people are detained. It can speed up their deportations if they end up using the airfields.”

It is also unclear where detained immigrants will be housed in the base. Purdy said that there are modern barracks as well as World War II era barracks there, but he is unsure what kind of setting immigrants will be in.

He’s not the only one left out of the loop.

Following the Trump administration’s memo announcing plans to detain immigrants at military bases, New Jersey Congressmen Herb Conaway and Donald Norcross said the administration has given them no information about the base, despite them requesting full transparency.

They asked the DOD and ICE administrators to provide them a timeline for operations and information about facility construction and base operations, information about reimbursement and funding, detainee qualifications, and methods of coordination with local authorities by mid-August.

“We condemn in the strongest possible terms the decision by the Trump administration to use Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst as an immigrant detention center,” Congressman Conaway said in a press release. “This is an inappropriate use of our national defense system and military resources.”

Barriers in access to the facility

Among concerns of transparency, Purdy said that as members of Congress have been turned away from entering immigrant detention facilities in California and New York to exercise their oversight, questions remain about the possible additional blocks immigrants at the base will confront when trying to obtain legal counsel for their asylum or deportation hearings.

“This is just another barrier that’s going to be put up in front of their lawyers who are going to have to find ways to get onto posts, and go through another checkpoint that could be weaponized to keep lawyers out,” Purdy said. “If a member of Congress can’t access their legal rights in this environment, what would an asylum attorney be able to do?”

In addition to legal counsel, he believes there are also going to be barriers for protestors, who could be turned away from entering the base.

While protesting at the base might be difficult, there are still ways to oppose it. Mehta said that it is important for people to contact their members of Congress, the DOD, the DHS, and let them know that their communities don’t want the use of the military and their bases to be used in this way. She explained that Congress can exercise oversight and the public can still make their opposition known.

“I think it’s really important for there to be as much vocal opposition as possible, for people to make their feelings known to their local, state and federal representatives, and to try to push against this so that they won’t end up using this base,” Mehta said. “My understanding is it’s not currently in use, and there’s still hopefully a window of time to use public pressure to stop its activation.”",https://bunny-wp-pullzone-0pcifvcfq2.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4-3J5A4819-jpg.webp,N,,2025-08-25 09:56:45.597273

The partnership with ICE has become a lucrative revenue source for the small county 26,400 people.

Local officials said the partnership with ICE has kept them from raising taxes on residents. But immigrant advocates say it has separated breadwinners from their families.

BRAZIL, Ind. — The Clay County Jail is a nondescript building near the heart of this small town, just across the street from the courthouse and a block south of the main thoroughfare.

From the outside, it doesn't look much different than other jails in rural county seat communities across Indiana.

But the similarities end at the door.

Inside, on any given day, the jail is packed with people from outside the county. Some were arrested in Indianapolis and other Indiana cities. Others were hauled in from out of state. Most speak Spanish or another foreign language. And each one represents money in the bank for the county.

The Clay County Jail, about 60 miles southwest of Indianapolis, doubles as one of the major U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers in Indiana and the Midwest. Just seven months into President Donald Trump’s second term, ICE has already funneled more than 3,000 men and women through the jail, paying the county $85 for each day it holds an immigration detainee.

The jail was generating a profit by holding inmates from other agencies long before the Trump administration's aggressive push for mass deportations, which relies heavily on detaining immigrants regardless of criminal history. For more than a decade, the partnership with ICE has been a lucrative revenue source for the small county with a population of 26,400 people. Officials have used the windfall to give raises and bonuses to county workers and help pay for other projects — all without raising local taxes.

The new crush of detainees just means an even bigger gusher of federal dollars.

The county's general fund soared to $13.5 million this year, thanks in part to the jail's partnership with ICE. That's a 224% jump from 2013, when the county first began housing ICE detainees. The jail's budget this year, $4.9 million, is about a third of the general fund. The remainder covers other county expenses and agencies, including the prosecutor's office and the sheriff's department.

In the first four months of this year alone, Clay County has already billed ICE $2.7 million for housing, transporting and feeding detainees, according to invoices from the Clay County Sheriff's Department. That's more than twice the jail's entire budget in 2013.

Members of the Board of Clay County Commissioners and the president of the Clay County Council didn't respond to interview requests from IndyStar or declined to comment about the jail's role with ICE. Clay County Sheriff Brison Swearingen, who oversees the jail, also declined to comment and denied a request for a tour of the jail.

But County Commissioner Paul Sinders explained the rational for the partnership during a conversation with a reporter in 2021: Immigrants detained by ICE are going to be jailed somewhere, so why not here?

At that time, officials were considering whether to approve an expansion project that ultimately added 285 beds to the jail.

The expansion, a windowless 45,420-square-foot jail pod attached at the back of the original building, opened last year. As of early August, the jail had an average daily ICE detainee population of 256, according to TRAC, a research organization at Syracuse University that tracks government data.

""People don’t realize, I believe, that with the ICE inmates it helps keep taxes down,"" Sinders told the Indiana Lawyer. Without the added income, the commissioner said, ""if there’s a shortfall, basically taxes are going to go up, and at this time there is no need for that.""

But immigrant rights advocates have accused Clay County of misusing federal funds meant to maintain humane conditions at the jail. They say this new era of enforcement has led to the costly and unnecessary detention of immigrants who aren’t public safety threats.

Stacy Suh, program director for the Detention Watch Network, a national coalition of advocacy groups, said the crackdown ""creates a perverse financial incentive to keep people incarcerated,"" as local governments face shrinking budgets.

Increasing rates, rising numbers, higher demand

Some county jails, especially those in rural communities, have long relied on renting out beds to other counties, state agencies and the federal government to raise revenue. ICE, for example, has a large network of 200 detention facilities nationwide, including several dozen county jails that have contracts to house immigration detainees.

Clay County first signed an agreement with the U.S. Marshals Service to house federal inmates in 2006, earning a per diem rate of $45 for each person detained for more than two days. The federal government does not pay for detainees who were released within 48 hours.

The contract was modified in 2013 to allow ICE to house immigrants facing deportation at the jail. By 2015, Clay County was receiving $55 per day for each detainee.

In 2021, Illinois passed a law banning new ICE detention centers in the state and ending existing contracts with county jails. Hannah Cartwright, an attorney and co-executive director of Mariposa Legal, an Indianapolis nonprofit that represents immigrants, said this created a demand for more bedspaces in neighboring states.

At that time, the Clay County Jail was the only long-term ICE detention center in Indiana. The following year, the Clay County Commissioners voted to expand the jail.

With the new addition, the jail's ICE detainee population soared — and so did its per diem rate.

By 2024, the daily rate had grown to $85.

That year, the county had 1,052 ICE book-ins, according to a jail log from the sheriff's department. This number includes those who were released or transferred to other facilities.

This year, the ICE book-ins have already nearly tripled. From January to July, the county had 3,503 book-ins.

These numbers significantly dwarf the size of the local inmate population. From January to July, for example, 598 book-ins came from local police and county arrests, as well as some who were held for the Indiana Department of Correction and other state agencies.

The jail took in more ICE book-ins in each of the last two months alone: 673 in June and 677 in July.

ICE partnership seen as a win-win

Last year, Clay County billed ICE $4.3 million for housing, transporting and feeding detainees, according to monthly invoices from the sheriff's department. In just the first four months of this year, the bills have already topped $2.7 million.

To hear officials talk about the partnership, it's a win-win for Clay County and its residents.

County employees received a 3% raise and a 2% bonus, County Commissioner Bryan Allender said in 2021, according to the Brazil Times. Officials were able to buy a new $83,000 HVAC chiller, thanks to ICE funds, the paper reported.

The county was also able purchase new facilities for the local health department and community corrections, as well as a storage building for the sheriff's department. Officials would've had to raise taxes to pay for these projects, County Commissioner Marty Heffner said during a meeting in 2021.

""We are looking at what is best for everyone in Clay County,"" Sinders said, according to the Brazil Times, ""not just the small picture of today, but the big picture of our future generation.""

The jail's 2025 budget showed it allotted $1.5 million for jail officers and more than $650,000 for shift supervisors and drivers to transport ICE detainees. The jail also budgeted $600,000 for inmate meals and $900,000 for medical and hospital costs.

ICE money is 'not a blank check'

Immigrant rights advocates say some of the ways Clay County has used the funds are unethical and illegal.

A lawsuit filed by the National Immigrant Justice Center alleged officials treated the detention of immigrants ""like a cash cow"" while keeping ""grossly inadequate conditions"" at the jail. The lawsuit, which was filed before the jail expansion, alleged officials have spent ""hundreds of thousands of federal dollars"" on expenses unrelated to making sure ICE detainees are held in humane conditions. The lawsuit cited the pay raises and bonuses to county employees and the $83,000 cooling system for the courthouse.

At the same time, the lawsuit alleged that ICE — because it has been increasingly dependent on the county for detention needs — has let the misappropriation slide.

""ICE was fully on notice of that,"" said Mark Feldman, a senior litigation attorney for the center, ""and they just continued to look the other way.""

The lawsuit is still pending. Last year, U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt dismissed Clay County and county officials from the case. But the judge allowed some of the key allegations against ICE — including that it abdicated its responsibility to enforce rules on how Clay County uses federal funds — to move forward.

Feldman said the judge's ruling, while split, reinforces their central argument: ""The money from ICE is not a blank check.""

'It's heartbreaking, and ... we're paying for that'

Advocates and immigration lawyers describe partnerships with ICE as a revenue-generating detention machine built on the backs of some of society's most vulnerable, including many who aren't public safety threats. They point to ICE's own data showing majority of those arrested have not been convicted of crimes or are facing civil immigration violations.

""I wouldn't want to sustain our county based on the mass incarceration of non-citizens, and I certainly wouldn't want to do that based on the mass incarceration of non-citizens in deplorable conditions ... I wouldn't want my taxes to go towards that,"" Feldman said. ""That's exactly what has been happening in Clay County.""

""I would say even more so now, when you have an administration that is hell bent on detaining anyone regardless of criminal history, regardless of danger to the community and has made it fairly clear that they care even less about the conditions people are detained in,"" Feldman added.

Still, more jurisdictions have jumped at the chance to join the Trump administration's sprawling detention apparatus — and earn thousands, if not millions, to supplement local tax revenues.

Three more Indiana counties, including Marion, have reached agreements to house ICE detainees. The other two counties, Clinton located outside of Lafayette and Clark across the Ohio River from Louisville, referred inquiries about those partnerships to ICE, which has not responded with records requested by IndyStar.

Marion County's Adult Detention Center has more modest numbers. During the first seven months of this year, the jail had 945 ICE book-ins. Marion County, which charges ICE a per diem rate of $75 per detainee, has so far received $586,725.

The Miami Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison north of Indianapolis, and Camp Atterbury, a military training facility to the south, are also slated to house up to 2,000 ICE detainees altogether. Gov. Mike Braun told reporters in early August that his goal is for the Trump administration to compensate Indiana for its efforts.

Cartwright, the Indianapolis immigration attorney, said using large facilities, whether they're prisons or military bases, to detain as many people as possible is an ""abnormal"" pattern under the Trump administration.

""It harkens of prison camps from the past,"" she said.

Advocates also say detaining immigrants, often in counties hours away from where they lived, not only isolates them from their attorneys and support network, but also forces even those with meritorious immigration cases to accept deportation. They say it has separated breadwinners from their families and needlessly traumatized their children.

Martha Maust, a volunteer for Indiana AID, a nonprofit that helps ICE detainees in Clay County by connecting them with lawyers and other resources, recalled talking to a woman whose 3-year-old toddler has been asking about her since she was arrested for driving without a license earlier this year.

""It’s heartbreaking, and we’re doing that,"" Maust said. ""We're paying for that. We, the U.S. We, the country.

Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, plans to introduce a new fast-track process for asylum appeals to curb judges’ power and speed up deportations.
Ms Cooper said “completely unacceptable” delays in the appeals process were leaving failed asylum seekers in the system for years.
There are about 51,000 asylum appeals waiting to be heard, with decisions taking a year on average.
She said: “We inherited an asylum system in complete chaos with a soaring backlog of asylum cases and a broken appeals system with thousands of people in the system for years on end.","Migrants will be waved through even faster despite Sir Keir Starmer’s plans to reform asylum tribunals, the Tories have said.

Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, plans to introduce a new fast-track process for asylum appeals to curb judges’ power and speed up deportations.

But Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said tinkering with the appeals process will do nothing to prevent migrants trying to come to the UK in small boats.

He said, despite the reforms, judges will still over-interpret human rights laws to let people in.

Instead of meaning migrants are deported more quickly when they lose a case, he suggested the fast-track tribunals would simply mean that they get a faster ruling allowing them to stay in Britain because appeals are likely to be upheld.

Mr Philp’s comments come as Sir Keir is under further pressure from within Labour to get tougher on migration.

Lord Blunkett, who served as home secretary under Sir Tony Blair, said ministers should be willing to suspend the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Refugee Convention for a temporary period.

Ms Cooper said “completely unacceptable” delays in the appeals process were leaving failed asylum seekers in the system for years.

There are about 51,000 asylum appeals waiting to be heard, with decisions taking a year on average.

Because measures to speed up initial judgments have been put in place, appeal delays are thought to be the largest cause of pressure in the asylum accommodation system.

Mr Philp said: “These tweaks go nowhere near far enough. The underlying rights, which allow most illegal immigrants to stay here, are not changing.

“Simply waving illegal immigrants through even faster to full housing and welfare rights will not fix the problem.

“And immigration judges will still apply ever-expanding common-sense defying definitions of ECHR rights to allow foreign criminals and illegal immigrants to stay here.”

He added: “This year has been the worst in history for illegal immigrants crossing the Channel and we’ve seen the highest number of asylum claims for a quarter of a century. These tiny tweaks will not change that.

“The Government is too weak to do what’s really needed – such as repeal the Human Rights Act for all immigration matters and deport all illegal immigrants immediately upon arrival, which Conservatives would do.”

Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform UK, said: “Labour have failed on all their promises on boats and asylum claims; no one believes another quango initiative will make any difference.

“This Government is in chaos, riddled with hard socialists who believe in open borders.”

Lord Blunkett said he did not favour leaving the ECHR permanently but backed temporary suspension as a “blunderbuss measure”.

He told The Times: “At the moment the issue is so toxic and beginning to get out of the Government’s grip to the point it is very hard to bring it back. A further package of actions is absolutely vital to start controlling both the public narrative and the delivery.

“If this slips out of our hands, it’s incredibly difficult to pull it back. Once people have got it in their heads that the Government haven’t a grip and that this is an intractable problem, they will turn on you. That is meat and drink. It’s the old cry, ‘For God’s sake, do something’.”

Under the new scheme, ministers will introduce a 24-week deadline for first-tier tribunals on asylum appeals by foreign offenders and those receiving accommodation support.

They believe the current tribunal system, which covers a wide range of different cases, does not ensure failed asylum seekers can be returned as swiftly as possible or accommodate a fast-track system for safe countries.

The Government will set out further details of planned reforms to the asylum system in the autumn, drawing on other European countries with faster appeal processes, including some that run independent appeal bodies similar to the one being proposed.

Ms Cooper said the overhaul would result in a system that was “swift, fair and independent, with high standards in place”.

She said: “We inherited an asylum system in complete chaos with a soaring backlog of asylum cases and a broken appeals system with thousands of people in the system for years on end.

“That is why we are taking practical steps to fix the foundations and restore control and order to the system.

“We are determined to substantially reduce the number of people in the asylum system as part of our plan to end asylum hotels.”

She continued: “Already since the election we have reduced the backlog of people waiting for initial decisions by 24 per cent and increased failed asylum returns by 30 per cent.

“But we cannot carry on with these completely unacceptable delays in appeals as a result of the system we have inherited, which mean that failed asylum seekers stay in the system for years on end at huge cost to the taxpayer.”

Earlier this month, official figures showed 111,084 people had applied for asylum in the UK in the year to June 2025 – the highest number for any 12-month period since records began in 2001.

The record number of applications came as the backlog of claimants waiting for an initial decision dropped to 90,812 at the end of June.

There were 32,059 asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June. Labour has promised to stop using the sites by 2029.

PM handling issue badly

A YouGov poll for The Times found that 71 per cent of voters believe the Prime Minister is handling the asylum hotel issue badly, including 56 per cent of Labour supporters.

The survey of 2,153 people carried out on August 20-21 found 37 per cent of voters viewed immigration and asylum as the most important issue facing the country, ahead of 25 per cent who said the economy and 7 per cent who said the health service.

Protests by groups opposed to the hotels and counter-demonstrations took place in towns and cities across Britain on Saturday.

In Bristol, mounted police were brought in to separate rival groups in Castle Park, and officers clashed with protesters.

The government has insisted that the deportees pose no security threat and that the deal was struck purely to reinforce Eswatini’s long-standing ties with Washington.

When the deportees were transferred in July, the government said the move was “the result of months of robust high-level engagements.”

Spokesperson Thabile Mdluli added that “the five prisoners are in the country and are housed in correctional facilities within isolated units, where similar offenders are kept.”

At the same time, Mdluli appeared to acknowledge human rights concerns, noting that accepting individuals whose countries of origin are not Eswatini raised sensitive issues.

“As a responsible member of the global community, the Kingdom of Eswatini adheres to international agreements and diplomatic protocols regarding the repatriation of individuals, ensuring that due process and respect for human rights is followed,” she said.

Mdluli also revealed that Eswatini would work with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) “to facilitate the transit of the inmates to their countries of origin.”

“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers.
Dugan told Milwaukee police that she directed federal agents “down the hall to the administrative offices.
“We live in very difficult times,” Dugan told the officers.","MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Milwaukee judge charged with obstructing a federal agency and concealing a wanted person who was in the country illegally told police days after the incident in her courtroom that “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

The comments were captured on body camera footage by Milwaukee police inside Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan’s home three days before her arrest in April. Dugan told officers she was not aware of a criminal investigation into her conduct.

Dugan was indicted in May and faces charges of concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had arrived to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.

Four days later, on April 22, Dugan called police to her house about a flyer from an anti-government group that she, her mother and her sister found at their homes. Police photographs of the flyer show it included a religious screed about how to pronounce the name of God and assertions that Wisconsin residents can legally carry concealed knives.

Her conversation with officers, as captured on their body cameras, was released by police to The Associated Press on Friday. It was first reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

The footage shows Dugan telling police that media reports had been swirling about how she supposedly “hid” Flores-Ruiz in her courtroom. She goes on to that she didn’t know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally and she denied giving him special treatment.

“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers. She later said, “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty and is fighting to have the charges against her thrown out. The charges against her underscore a clash between Donald Trump’s administration and local authorities over the Republican president’s sweeping immigration crackdown.

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to make an example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition.

Dugan has not publicly commented on the allegations.

She told police that she didn’t know Flores-Ruiz’s immigration status.

“I don’t know if he’s an illegal immigrant, which is what they’re claiming,” Dugan said. “I’m not supposed to know that. When they come in front of me, I’m not supposed to know that.”

Dugan denied hiding Flores-Ruiz who federal agents came into her courtroom to arrest.

“I did not hide this migrant in the jury room or in my chambers,” she said. “I had him leave out the back door, which I do when the circumstances warrant it.”

Video from the hallway showed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney leaving through a side door about 12 feet from the main entrance.

According to an FBI affidavit, witnesses heard Dugan say something to the effect of “wait, come with me” before ushering Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through the door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, the affidavit alleges.

In her motion to dismiss, Dugan argued that her conduct amounted to directing people’s movement in and around her courtroom, and that she enjoys legal immunity for official acts she performs as a judge.

Dugan told Milwaukee police that she directed federal agents “down the hall to the administrative offices. What happened after that is their business.”

Agents arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase.

“We live in very difficult times,” Dugan told the officers. “We all know that. Very difficult.”

Dugan’s defense attorneys released a statement noting that her comments to police came before she was aware of the criminal investigation.

“Her comments reinforced that she did nothing wrong in this matter and treated the misdemeanor case like any other in her courtroom,” her attorneys said in the statement.

(AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Aug. 22 declined to dismiss felony charges against two attorneys and a former aide to President Donald Trump who advised Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year.

Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland rejected the motions to dismiss the 11 felony charges filed against the three defendants. The charges are for using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump that year.

Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin, Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised the campaign, and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020, all were initially charged in June 2024. The case has stalled as the judge considered their attempts to have the charges dismissed.

Each of the 11 of the felony charges they face carries the same maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

“Troupis does not show that the First Amendment protects the right to commit forgery, does not show that the government violated his right to due process by entrapping him into that forgery, and does not show prosecutors must exercise discretion to charge an accused of his preferred offense,” the judge said in rejecting the motions to dismiss.

Attorneys for each of the defendants did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment.

The charges were brought by Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat. Kaul is considering running for governor in 2026. He declined to comment.

Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and again in 2024 but lost it in 2020 and tried unsuccessfully to overturn his defeat.

The state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.

Federal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.

Electors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party’s electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome. Two states, Maine and Nebraska, allow their electoral votes to be split between candidates.

The Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence.

They argued that the charges should be dismissed because no crime was committed in having Republican electors meet and cast their ballot to preserve their legal options in case the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump’s favor in a lawsuit challenging the Wisconsin vote.

They also argued that federal law should take precedence in this case, and that such charges can’t legally be brought in state court.

They further argued that the facts showed no crime was committed and also because prosecutions for election crimes can only be brought by the county district attorney, not the state’s attorney general.

The judge rejected all of their arguments.

Alternatively, Abrego could take a plea deal the Trump administration offered.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man who the government says was mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, will meet with immigration officials Monday under the looming threat of a second deportation, this time to Uganda.

Abrego's case — a flashpoint in the Trump administrations crackdown on immigration — is now at a major crossroads.

He was released from federal custody on parole Friday and had a tearful reunion with his family after nearly half a year apart.

But the Trump administration has doubled down on its resolve to deport him, alleging he is a member of the violent gang MS-13 — a claim his attorneys have repeatedly denied.

Abrego had been deported in March in what the White House called an “administrative error,” and after a tedious legal saga, he was returned to the United States in June. But he was immediately detained again, this time on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He pleaded not guilty to those charges.

Minutes after his release, immigration authorities notified Abrego that they intend to deport him to Uganda. Separately, the Trump administration offered him a plea deal that would ensure his eventual deportation to Costa Rica.

On Friday night, the government informed Abrego that he has until ""first thing"" Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, ""or else that offer will be off the table forever,"" Abrego's attorneys wrote in a filing as part of their efforts to get the charges in Tennessee dropped over what they consider to be a ""vindictive"" and ""selective"" prosecution.

Here are how Monday's appointment may play out:

Monday’s ICE check-in

Abrego will have a check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore on Monday as part of the conditions of his release from federal custody on parole.

Typically, such an ICE check-in is a brief meeting with an officer from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations to review case status, provide updates and confirm where a person is living. Usually, a person is released until the next scheduled check-in.

But Abrego's attorneys told NBC News they expect he will be taken into ICE custody during the check-in, given the Trump administration's notice of its intention to deport him.

A judge ruled in July that the government had to provide 72 hours’ notice, excluding weekends, if it intends to deport Abrego to a third country, which the Justice Department provided Friday afternoon.

Abrego’s lawyers have said he illegally immigrated to the United States when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland to escape gang violence in El Salvador.

His deportation to El Salvador violated a 2019 court order that protected him from being deported to his home country because of concerns that he’d be persecuted by violent gangs. But that order doesn’t prevent his deportation to any other country.

What may happen from here?

Several paths could unfold from here: Abrego could take the plea deal and eventually be deported to Costa Rica or he could refuse to and be deported to Uganda, or his lawyers could fight Uganda as a deportation option.

If Abrego doesn’t change his plea in the Tennessee federal case, he could be deported to Uganda as soon as Wednesday.

However, Abrego couldn’t face the criminal charges of human smuggling brought against him by Justice Department in that case if he is removed from the country. His trial is set for January in Nashville.

Last week, Uganda agreed to a deal with the United States to take deported migrants, as long as they don’t have criminal records and aren’t unaccompanied minors. Uganda’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said Uganda prefers that migrants sent there be of African nationalities.

Abrego’s attorneys could also try to prevent his deportation to Uganda altogether and try to convince an immigration judge within 72 hours that he is likely to experience persecution or torture there. An immigration judge would have to agree to prevent his deportation to Uganda.

On Saturday, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego’s attorneys, accused the government of “punishing” Abrego for “exercising his constitutional rights.”

“It is preposterous that they would send him to Africa, to a country where he doesn’t even speak the language, a country with documented human rights violations, when there are so many other options. This family has suffered enough,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said outside Abrego’s brother's home.

He said they intend to “fight tooth and nail” against deportation to Uganda, South Sudan, Libya and “any other completely ridiculous country that they can come up with.”

What if Abrego takes a plea deal?

Alternatively, Abrego could take a plea deal the Trump administration offered.

That deal would require him to plead guilty to both counts of the criminal indictment against him in Tennessee, serve time and then be deported.

Should Abrego plead guilty or be convicted by a jury, the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison. Under either scenario, U.S. District Judge Wesley Crenshaw in Nashville would determine how much time he would serve.

If he is eventually deported to Costa Rica, Abrego would be welcomed as a refugee and live as a free man, the Costa Rican government said in a letter one of Abrego's attorneys submitted to the court as part of the filing in the Tennessee case.

In the filing, attorney Sean Hecker said the Justice Department, Homeland Security and ICE were “using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat.”

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadorian migrant whose months-long court fight has emerged as a flashpoint of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, will report Monday to the ICE Field Office in Baltimore, where he is expected to be arrested and deported to Uganda, his attorneys told Fox News Digital.

The news caps an extraordinary, six-month court battle over Abrego Garcia's legal status that has spanned two continents, touched off dozens of lengthy court hearings, and involved three federal judges in Tennessee and Maryland.

The Department of Justice has said Abrego Garcia is a member of the El Salvadoran gang MS-13, was caught in Tennessee allegedly driving a van full of illegal migrants, and has been accused by his wife of beating her. His supporters have painted him as a hard-working father who has been vilified by the Trump administration, and have pointed to a judge's ruling that said the government failed to provide sufficient evidence that he is a member of MS-13.

Now, Abrego Garcia is slated for deportation to a third country, after an immigration judge ruled he could not be sent back to his homeland because he faced danger there.

The latest development in Abrego Garcia's saga comes days after the Justice Department offered to send him to Costa Rica on Thursday, in exchange for a guilty plea to criminal charges of human smuggling, brought against him while he was still detained in Salvadorian custody earlier this year.

Abrego Garcia declined the offer.

ABREGO GARCIA RELEASED FROM JAIL, WILL RETURN TO MARYLAND TO AWAIT TRIAL

His attorneys used the spurned offer to bolster their motion to dismiss the criminal case against him on the grounds of ""vindictive"" and selective prosecution by the Trump administration.

They said the plea deal offer shows that the Trump administration had embarked on a pressure campaign against their client, and one in which several government agencies— the Justice Department, ICE, and DHS— were ""using their collective powers to force"" their client to choose between the plea and Costa Rica, or not accepting the offer, and what they termed the ""rendition to Uganda.""

""In conjunction with that proposal, the government produced a letter to Mr. Abrego’s counsel confirming that he could live freely in that country, which would accept him as a refugee or grant him residency status, and promise not to refoul him to El Salvador,"" his attorneys said in a court filing on Saturday.

It was not until after he rejected that offer, they said, that the government ""informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning — precisely when he must report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office — to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever.""

JUDGE PRESSES TRUMP DOJ ON ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION; ANSWERS LEAVE COURTROOM IN STUNNED SILENCE

The plans were detailed in several documents, including the official notice sent Friday to Abrego Garcia's attorneys by ICE's Office of the Principal Legal Adviser (OPLA), and in the Saturday court filing from his attorneys.

Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally when he was a teenager, and lived in Maryland with his wife and children, prior to his removal to El Salvador in March. His family sued, saying his deportation to El Salvador violated a 2019 court order blocking him from being sent back to his home country.

After months of legal wrangling, the Trump administration in May returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S., where he was slapped with charges of human smuggling; an investigation that originated from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee and which began in April.

ABREGO GARCIA LAWYERS FILE MOTION TO DISMISS CRIMINAL CHARGES FROM TRUMP DOJ

Should ICE immediately arrest Abrego Garcia, their actions would likely defy a court order handed down by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, an Obama appointee, which sought to preclude ICE from immediately arresting Abrego Garcia upon return.

Fox News reported Friday that DHS and ICE officials, frustrated with Abrego Grcia's release, had been consulting with the Justice Department and ICE's lawyers about how to go about removing him from the U.S.

Lawyers for the Justice Department vehemently opposed Abrego Garcia's release from custody, arguing at an evidentiary hearing earlier this year that he was a danger to the community and describing him as a member of MS-13 — a claim that was rejected by a judge in a ruling earlier this year.

Even so, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem blasted Abrego Garcia's release from criminal custody on Friday, saying in a statement that the Trump administration ""will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.""

DC is under military occupation. This is not hyperbole.

Trump mobilized 800 National Guard troops on Aug. 11 to patrol DC’s streets. Now six Republican-led states, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are sending hundreds more, potentially doubling that number. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered an emergency commissioner to replace DC’s police chief, a move DC has blocked in court, and while Trump can legally sustain this intervention for only 30 days, the President is asking Congress to make the takeover indefinite. Given DC’s small size, this deployment of the National Guard is nearly twice as dense as that of Los Angeles earlier this year.

What does this look like on the ground?

Advertisement

ID Checkpoints on the streets, M-ATV infantry mobility vehicles rolling by Union Station, heavy patrolling of majority Black and brown neighborhoods by masked men, racial profiling and harassment of people who are working and going about their business. ICE arrests have spiked.

Disappointingly, the immediate reaction of the media and DC policymakers was to respond with logic—evidenced-based interventions and not criminalization are needed to improve the situation of unhoused people in the District, DC crime rates are actually at a 30-year low—according to Mayor Muriel Bowser—and Trump is exaggerating the numbers. DC’s Police Union even welcomed the “support” with the caveat that federal law enforcement would have to be sensitive to the local context.

To see this debate play out is like living in an alternate reality. Trump doesn’t actually care about ending homelessness, or the safety of DC residents, and logic (forget evidence-based policymaking) left the building a long time ago. To engage with the false arguments surrounding the takeover is to miss the authoritarian power grab happening before our eyes. This occupation is not about crime nor homelessness, it’s a testing ground to crack down on groups considered to be “undesirable” to a white supremacist America and a step toward large-scale militarization. We must treat Trump’s actions as part of what we know his project to be, not what he says, because while officials argue over crime statistics, federal forces continue to descend on the city with very little practical solidarity from Democrats and other national leaders.

A Testing Ground for Control

Why is this really happening in DC? Many Americans don’t know that DC’s roughly 700,000 residents, majority non-White, don’t have voting representation in Congress. DC was historically a federal district under direct Congressional jurisdiction. The city won “home rule,” that is, the right to have an elected local government, in 1973, but Congress maintains the power to overturn local laws. DC residents have fought for decades to get statehood—key to ending our systemic disenfranchisement. In DC, our license plates say, “taxation without representation.”

DC’s unique status makes it an easier target for this kind of federal takeover, but it also produces conditions for the kind of mass social crackdown that Trump is trying to justify.

In March, Congress passed a resolution mandating a federal spending freeze. While such freezes usually carve out an exemption for DC’s budget, which has to be approved by Congress, such an exemption was absent from the bill, effectively cutting the city’s budget by $1.1 billion and forcing the city to make cuts to services and important programs that protect domestic workers, renters, low-income families, and other populations particularly vulnerable to Trump’s racist and xenophobic policies. Additionally, DC bore the brunt of DOGE’s mass firings, losing an estimated 40,000 federal jobs and thus a great deal of fiscal income (estimated at another $1 billion loss over the next 3 years). National policies also have devastating local impacts. According to the DC Fiscal Policy Institute, the “Big Beautiful Bill” passed on July 4th transfers the burden of SNAP food benefits from the federal government to the city, costing DC up to an additional $50 million. It also imposes bureaucratic barriers to Medicaid, including work requirements,that threaten health care access for up to 114,000 DC residents. The city is poised to face significant economic hardship, and Mayor Muriel Bowser’s traditional “trickle down” approach to growth will likely leave most working DC families behind. In short, the government is producing more poverty just as it intensifies its criminalization of the poor.

A Ploy for Privatization?

Occupation is seldomly just about military control; it often lays the groundwork for privatization and corporate profiteering. Trump has become a vocal supporter of “freedom” cities– a project with precedent in Honduras after a military coup d’etat in 2009 that gives tech and venture capitalists control over a special jurisdiction within the country. In Honduras, Honduras Prospera Inc., a company registered in Delaware, founded the first private city and created its own government and regulations—a takeover that Hondurans have resisted. The private cities, technically Economic Development and Employment Zones (ZEDEs), have been declared unconstitutional in Honduras, but Próspera has used an international investment tribunal to demand up to $10.7 billion from the Honduran government. The backers of the Próspera private city and a network of libertarian tech capitalists including Palantir’s Peter Thiel and other moguls have secured support from the Trump administration to create “Freedom Cities” in the U.S.—a lesser-known promise of Trump’s electoral campaign. Some in the network openly called for the Presidio Park in San Francisco to be converted to a “Freedom City,” just as Trump signed an executive order in February to eliminate the Presidio Trust responsible for protecting the park. Another private city group, Praxis, claimed to be “revitalizing Western civilization” by seeking to form a private nation in Greenland, just as Trump’s government declared its intention to annex the island.

INTERVIEW: How Donald Trump and the MAGA Movement Will Legalize and Deploy Vigilantes to Push Their Agenda, with David Noll

In Honduras, it was precisely crime rates and so-called failed government that were used as justification for private control. While Trump and DHS’s campaign to control US cities is about consolidating authoritarian power, we should also be vigilant of potential corporate takeovers like these.

The theater of control and actual political violence are interconnected phenomena. DC is being used as a testing ground not just for authoritarianism but for racist suppression of a historically Black and diverse city. But DC is a city full of vibrant and strong people. Those of us who are from and live in the district love it with all our hearts. As Washingtonians fight to keep our democratic rights, we need the active support of people across the U.S. who can pressure their Congressional representatives.

Whether Abrego Garcia ends up in Costa Rica depends on his next moves in court.","If you ever watch American news networks, you are probably familiar with a Salvadoran man at the center of a heated US immigration battle could end up in our neighbor Costa Rica if he accepts a guilty plea, according to court documents filed by his lawyers. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who US officials wrongly sent to a harsh prison in El Salvador earlier this year, now faces deportation to Uganda after turning down the deal. This case highlights the Trump administration’s aggressive stance on migration and raises questions about Costa Rica’s role in accepting deportees from the US. Abrego Garcia, 30, lives in Maryland USA with his family.

He denies charges of human smuggling and ties to the MS-13 gang, which the government uses to justify their actions. Officials deported him to El Salvador in March, ignoring a court order that blocked such a move. He spent months in a maximum-security prison there before the US Supreme Court stepped in and ordered his return in June. Back in the US, authorities arrested him right away on the smuggling charges. A federal judge in Tennessee released Abrego Garcia on Friday after more than 160 days away from his family. But less than a day later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told his lawyers they plan to deport him to Uganda as early as Monday.

His team calls this a punitive tactic to force a guilty plea. The plea offer came Thursday: stay in custody, admit to the charges, serve any sentence, and get deported to Costa Rica instead of El Salvador or elsewhere. Court filings include a letter from Costa Rican officials confirming they would accept Abrego Garcia and let him live here legally. He rejected the deal, prompting the Uganda threat. This development pulls Costa Rica into the spotlight. Their country has long served as a safe haven for migrants fleeing violence in Central America. With stable politics and a focus on human rights, Costa Rica hosts thousands of refugees from Nicaragua and other neighbors.

Accepting someone like Abrego Garcia fits that pattern, but it also tests Costa Rican resources. Costa Rican migration authorities have not commented publicly on the letter or the case. Still, the agreement shows close ties between San José and Washington on immigration matters. The US often works with regional partners to handle deportees, and Costa Rica has cooperated in similar situations before. Critics in Costa Rica worry about the implications. If the US starts sending more people here under plea deals, it could strain public services already stretched by recent migrant waves. Local groups like the Defensoría de los Habitantes have raised concerns over housing and job access for newcomers.

One advocate said, “We support refugees, but we need clear plans to integrate them without overwhelming communities.” The Trump administration defends the approach as part of a broader crackdown on illegal migration. Supporters see it as tough enforcement, while opponents label it as overreach that ignores due process. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers argue the Uganda deportation aims to coerce him, calling it “vindictive” and against the law. For those in Costa Rica, this story serves as a reminder of their position in regional migration flows. As the US pushes harder on borders, countries like Costa Rica and Panama may see more requests to take in deportees. Whether Abrego Garcia ends up in Costa Rica depends on his next moves in court. His team filed to dismiss the charges Saturday, citing government misconduct. A hearing could come soon.

“This is an unprecedented attempt to use Section 1357(g) as authority for an independent state-run detention facility,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit asks a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to bar the state from detaining people at the facility and to declare that the state lacks the authority to operate the Everglades detention center.
The federal law “does not provide authority for state agencies to hold immigration detainees during the removal process.","Calling it ""exactly the kind of disaster that Congress took pains to avoid,"" attorneys for immigrants held at a detention center in the Everglades filed a lawsuit alleging Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration lacks the authority to run the facility.

The lawsuit, filed Friday in the federal court’s Middle District of Florida, is the third major legal challenge to the detention center, erected by the DeSantis’ administration as part of the state’s support of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

DeSantis and state officials maintain that they are operating the facility through what are known as 287(g) agreements, which local governments can enter with the federal government to provide training and authority to local police to help enforce immigration laws.

But the lawsuit filed Friday contends that the agreements do not give authority to state agencies or their contractors to run detention centers and that the officers who are working at the Everglades facility lack federally required training to participate in immigration-enforcement efforts.

“The lack of authority to operate the facility has resulted in unprecedented challenges that people in immigration detention typically do not face, including being held without charge, not receiving initial custody or bond determinations, not appearing in the detainee locator system, and not being able to access their attorneys or immigration court,” the lawsuit said.

Operations at the Everglades center, dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" by state officials, “are in stark contrast to typical ICE (federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operations,” the lawyers argued.

The 287(g) agreements are part of a federal law known as 1357(g) that allows states to support federal immigration-enforcement efforts.

“This is an unprecedented attempt to use Section 1357(g) as authority for an independent state-run detention facility,” the lawsuit said. “In the thirty years since the statute was enacted, state officers have never claimed the authority to detain people under this statute, other than the short period after an arrest during transport to an ICE facility.”

The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Florida, Community Justice Project, and National Immigrant Justice Center filed the lawsuit on behalf of a detainee identified as “M.A.” and also are seeking class-action certification in the challenge.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to bar the state from detaining people at the facility and to declare that the state lacks the authority to operate the Everglades detention center.

The federal law “does not provide authority for state agencies to hold immigration detainees during the removal process. And it certainly does not let them place detention in the hands of untrained, unsupervised private contractors who are not and cannot be deputized to perform immigration functions. By ignoring these standards, Florida has created exactly the kind of disaster that Congress took pains to avoid,” the lawsuit said.

Questions about the state’s authority to run the facility also have been raised in two other legal challenges.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams on Thursday sided with environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida in a lawsuit alleging that state and federal officials failed to comply with a federal law requiring an environmental-impact study be conducted before the detention center was erected.

Williams’ order gave the state 60 days to begin winding down the facility. Lawyers for DeSantis quickly asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. District Court of Appeals to put her ruling on hold while the state's appeal proceeds.

Lawyers for DeSantis have argued, in part, in that case that the federal environmental law did not apply because the state is operating the facility.

Speaking to reporters Friday morning, the governor — who has fiercely defended the state’s immigrant-detention efforts — shrugged off Williams’ decision.

“We knew the minute this judge got the case, we knew exactly what she was going to do. This is not anything that was unexpected, but we will make sure to get the job done in the end,” he said.

In a separate lawsuit, attorneys representing detainees allege that people being held at the center have inadequate access to legal representation and confidential meetings with their attorneys.

The latest legal challenge said that court records in the other cases show the facility is “Florida-owned and Florida-operated.”

“State and federal officials have stated in court filings that Florida exercises ‘complete discretion’ over operations and over who is detained at the facility,” Thursday’s lawsuit said.

Numerous state agencies have 287(g) agreements allowing their law-enforcement officers to participate in immigration efforts, the lawsuit noted.

“But those agreements do not give any authority to the state agencies themselves — only to those individual employees who have been fully trained and certified by DHS (Department of Homeland Security),” the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit also said it is unknown how many state officers working at the facility have completed federally required training, which can take months.

DeSantis earlier this month announced that the state plans to convert a shuttered state prison in Baker County into a second immigrant-detention center. That facility will be staffed by members of Florida’s National Guard.

The Florida Department of Emergency Management is set to receive $605 million from the Trump administration for the state’s immigrant-detention efforts. The department hired contractors to help build and operate the Everglades facility, which can hold up to 4,000 people and is estimated to cost roughly $450 million per year.

The lawsuit alleges that federal law does not allow the private contractors to be “deputized to perform any immigration functions.”

The lawsuit also alleges that workers at the facility are pressuring detainees to sign voluntary deportation orders.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee4c87d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1f%2Fd9%2Fb3a616404829a0ed535a5c2ae981%2Fap25185566158203.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 20:56:27.699668

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is an agency inside the Department of Homeland Security that is integral to President Donald Trump’s vision of carrying out the mass deportations he promised during the campaign. Deportation officers within a unit called Enforcement and Removal Operations are the ones who are responsible for immigration enforcement. They find and remove people from the United States who aren’t American citizens and, for a variety of reasons, no longer can stay in the country.

Some might have gone through immigration court and a judge ordered them removed. Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they’ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.

Overall, its activities — and how it carries them out — have polarized many Americans in recent months.

After years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.

Last week, The Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency's top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.

ICE is surging its hiring

ICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year's end.

The agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications — many from former officers.

New recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. That's a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers — not just ICE agents — from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.

Caleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he's been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they're assigned.

ICE is also preparing for conflict

As Trump’s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.

Vitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency's data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.

Lyons said that after recent operations in Los Angeles turned violent, ICE is making gas masks and helmets standard issue for new agents. ""Right now we’re seeing and we’re having to adapt to all different scenarios that we were never trained for in the past,"" he said.

Lyons says the agency is also starting to send out security teams to accompany agents making arrests: “We’re not gonna allow people to throw rocks anymore, because we’re going to have our own agents and officers there to protect the ones that are actually out there making that arrest.""

And it's beefing up specialized units for risky situations

About eight deportation officers dressed in military-style camouflage uniforms, helmets and carrying an assortment of weapons stand outside a house yelling “Police! We have a warrant!” before entering and clearing the house.

They are members of a Special Response Team taking part in a demonstration at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. These officers are like a SWAT team — deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations. They also accompany detainees the agency deems dangerous when they are deported.

“Everybody is trained to serve a warrant,"" Vitello said. “These guys are trained to serve high-risk warrants.”

There are roughly 450 deportation officers with the special training to serve on these teams, and Lyons says they have been deployed to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and Washington.

He said he'd like to have more such units but wouldn't put an exact number on how many. Vitello said they're also in the process of getting more of the specially armored vehicles.

ICE teaches whom agents can arrest — and when

New recruits to ICE receive training on immigration law and the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unlawful searches. Longtime officers get regular refreshers on these topics.

In limited situations, ICE agents are allowed to enter someone's home. Generally when they're seeking someone they're trying to remove from the country, they have an administrative warrant as opposed to a criminal warrant. That administrative warrant doesn't allow them to enter the house without first getting permission.

Vitello says the new recruits are taught about the different warrants and how the rules differ. And they're taught how those who allowed ICE to enter their house can change their mind.

“If somebody says ‘Get out,’ and you don’t have your target, you have to leave,” he said.

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.

As ICE sees it, Vitello said, deportation officers do have the authority to arrest someone in a car or truck. Vitello said in the rare case where a target was in a motor home, officers would talk to the agency's lawyers first to figure out what protections apply.

Zach Womer, a Philipsburg resident who is running for the state house of representatives, was in the crowd at the protest.","A large crowd and chants of “shut it down” filled Cold Stream Dam and Recreation Park on Sunday afternoon during a protest against the nearby Moshannon Valley Processing Center.

The facility, located merely miles away from the park and just over the Centre County border in Morris Township, Clearfield County, is the largest federal detention center in Pennsylvania.

The rally was organized by several civil rights and Indivisible groups from across the state. In addition to drawing awareness to the facility that’s privately owned by the Florida-based GEO Group, organizers of the rally set out to demand the Clearfield County Commissioners end the contract between the county, ICE and the GEO Group.

The crowd of hundreds was largely a mix of people from central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Megan Guidi of the Pittsburgh Women for Democracy said they were all there as “one commonwealth united to oppose the cruelty and unnecessary detention” happening near Philipsburg.

“This isn’t just a Philipsburg issue. It’s not just a Clearfield County issue, it’s a Pennsylvania issue. And when we have a Pennsylvania issue, we stand together,” Guidi said.

Luther Gette, a Philipsburg Borough Councilmember, welcomed everyone to the borough.

“We are not only bound as Americans to do these things, we are bound as citizens of the state of Pennsylvania to do these things. Whose statue is on top of the City Hall in Philadelphia? William Penn. Did he invite the immigrants and the needy and the poor to come to Pennsylvania? He did. Now it’s up to us. It’s our generation. Many, many things have gone wrong in Pennsylvania and all over the world … but many things can also go right, if we will just insist on that right,” Gette said.

The Moshannon Valley Processing Center has been in the spotlight during President Donald Trump’s second term due to his aggressive deportation campaign for authorized immigrants, though activists have sounded the alarm about potential abuses at the facility for years.

Guidi and other speakers talked about some issues with the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, like the at least three ACLU lawsuits filed tied to it, including one related to inhumane conditions and lack of language access. She said more than 15 days in solitary confinement is torture, according to United Nations experts, but a 2024 study shows in ICE detention, the average stay in solitary confinement is 27 days.

“According to ICE’s own data, no facility makes use of solitary confinement as much as the Moshannon Valley Processing Center. As of this spring, 147 people were locked in solitary confinement every month. To put that into perspective, the next highest ICE facility held 82 per month,” Guidi said.

There have also been two deaths at the facility since it opened in 2021, including the death earlier this month of Chaofeng Ge, a 32-year-old Chinese national, was found dead by the facility’s staff, hanging by his neck in the shower room of his detention pod.

In an ICE news release focused on Ge, the agency wrote that it “remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure, and humane environments. Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.”

Protesters called on the Clearfield County Commissioners to shut down the processing center by ending the contract, freedom for those in the detention center and not transfers into other facilities, and long term they wanted to see all detention centers shut down locally and nationwide.

Some unnamed speakers shared stories from people who had been detained there, or from their family members. They spoke of poor conditions, inadequate nutritional food options such as fresh fruit, lack of visiting information for family members and being threatened by guards.

An average of 1,374 people were at the detention center as of Aug. 4, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data distribution organization founded at Syracuse University.

As speakers shared their message with the hundreds of people gathered in the park, cars and trucks driving by honked in support and waved to the dozens of people lining the bridge and the fence of the park. There were a handful of counter protesters throughout the afternoon and some cars revved their engines and made inappropriate hand gestures out their windows.

Zach Womer, a Philipsburg resident who is running for the state house of representatives, was in the crowd at the protest. He said what brought him to the protest was faith, rather than politics. He talked about the Gospel of Matthew and welcoming strangers.

“I think that if you are a Christian and you believe the Gospel of Matthew, and you are a Protestant, you should be able to — even if it’s something that it’s controversial, I guess, I think that’s kind of the whole point, is standing up when it’s controversial, not when it’s something that’s popular or something that’s good for you to do, to get some sort of a claim. It’s just, I wanted people to see someone like me, a long bearded hillbilly, that supports what they do and cares about people,” Womer said.

He said he doesn’t necessarily agree with everyone at the protest but he was proud to see so many people out and caring about the community on a hot, Sunday afternoon. He said it was a great example of what people can do when they get together.

In an ideal world, Womer said, there would not be private prisons. But the number one thing that needs to happen is transparency, he said.

“If I’m winning a state level office, I won’t have the ability to go to the center. I won’t have the ability to shut it down, but I will always be a loud advocate for, we need to be able to see what’s happening in this prison,” he said. “...To have a prison a mile from my home where I don’t know what’s going on — there’s lots of reports of abuse. I think that represents something that’s fundamentally un-American, and I think that’s something everyone can get around. … I think the goal should be to reduce harm, and whatever gets that done is what I’m interested in.”

Sunday’s protest came after about 50 people gathered in late July outside of the Moshannon Valley Processing Center to draw awareness to the facility.

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is an agency inside the Department of Homeland Security that is integral to President Donald Trump’s vision of carrying out the mass deportations he promised during the campaign. Deportation officers within a unit called Enforcement and Removal Operations are the ones who are responsible for immigration enforcement. They find and remove people from the United States who aren’t American citizens and, for a variety of reasons, no longer can stay in the country.

Some might have gone through immigration court and a judge ordered them removed. Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they’ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.

Overall, its activities — and how it carries them out — have polarized many Americans in recent months.

After years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.

Last week, The Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency's top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.

ICE is surging its hiring

ICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year's end.

The agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications — many from former officers.

New recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. That's a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers — not just ICE agents — from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.

Caleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he's been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they're assigned.

ICE is also preparing for conflict

As Trump’s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.

Vitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency's data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.

Daily life is changing in many communities across the US as President Donald Trump and his administration step up their immigration crackdowns. Officials vow they’ll carry out the largest deportation operation in American history, put more undocumented immigrants behind bars and eliminate abuse in the immigration system.

Just over seven months in, it’s too soon to say whether they’ll hit all the targets they’ve set. But their messaging as Immigration and Customs Enforcement gets a massive infusion into its budget couldn’t be clearer: This is only the beginning.

Authorities are ratcheting up arrests and detentions in highly publicized operations. And as fears of immigration raids spread, there’s also another story unfolding that’s quieter but no less dramatic.

No press releases get issued when an immigrant family slips into the shadows. But CNN reporters across the country are starting to see what that looks and feels like – and the unexpected ripple effects that can follow.

‘Everything has changed’ at a once-popular quinceañera shopping spot

For years, Lupita Batres had a front-row seat as generations of young women prepared for joyful occasions. From the stall where she sells colorful hand-woven skirts, scarves and purses at Plaza Fiesta, she’d watch girls going from store to store in search of lavish dresses for quinceañeras and confirmations. She’d see family members picking out presents. And occasionally, she’d help someone find just the right gift.

Now she says that kind of business has virtually disappeared from the mall outside Atlanta.

“I haven’t heard of anyone throwing parties, quinceañeras or weddings right now,” Batres says. “And if they do, ah Dios mio, what a risk, right? Being at a party like that.”

On a Friday afternoon, Batres carefully arranges bracelets and trinkets as she waits for customers. So far, none have shown up. On some days, she says the only faces she sees are other vendors. Some customers are even avoiding grocery stores, she says, let alone gift shops.

“They send someone else to shop for them, someone with papers,” she said. “It has changed everything, even how we eat.”

Maria López, who’s worked at a Plaza Fiesta jewelry store for 14 years, says the mall has never faced a moment like this.

López remembers when Plaza Fiesta was so popular visitors flocked here from other states across the Southeast. The once dilapidated mall’s fortunes turned in the late 1990s when developers transformed it into a marketplace catering to the growing Latino community. On weekends, the stores pulsed with life. Chatter floated through the aisles, children ran ahead of their parents to the indoor playground and lines stretched out from the food court. Now it’s eerily quiet.

“People are scared of being arrested just for being outside,” López says. “There is always this tension, this feeling that something could happen. And it is exhausting.”

At Ivan Marín’s graphic design business, a display showcases rows of sparkly and intricate quinceañera invitations. It used to be common for him to get mass orders for party invitations, and also for T-shirts for family reunions, Disney vacations and community events. But not anymore.

“Everything has changed. … Now people don’t travel. Parties at home are very restricted,” he says. “It’s just family.”

After 10 years in the US, she’s singing her last hymns with her church choir

A woman with her curly hair bunched into a bun smiles as she walks through the sanctuary of her Maryland church, where light is streaming through the stained-glass windows.

The 38-year-old undocumented immigrant, who asked to be identified by her last name, López, feels like a weight has been lifted from her shoulders. But a month ago, everything felt far darker.

López rushed to the emergency room that night. Back in El Salvador, she’d worked as a nurse. And she’d never been the kind of person to blow health problems out of proportion. Based on the pain she felt, she was convinced she was having a heart attack.

Until the next day, when doctors told her that her heart was fine. She’d had an anxiety attack, they said.

That’s when López knew she had to make a change. Worries over immigration raids were consuming her. Every daily task seemed suddenly fraught with danger.

López loved the US and once dreamed of bringing her children to live with her here. Now the risks no longer seem worth it. And López recently bought a plane ticket to return to El Salvador, where she hopes to use money she saved over more than a decade working in the US as a restaurant manager to open her own pharmacy.

“I feel so happy to be leaving,” she says. “A life with fear isn’t life.”

Father Vidal Rivas says the choir member isn’t the only person in his congregation at St. Matthew’s Episcopal Church in Hyattsville who’s decided to depart.

For weeks, he’s been looking out at the pews during noon mass and noticing far fewer people in attendance. At a service where more than 200 people once regularly gathered, these days about half that number are showing up.

The summer vacation slump could be partially to blame, he says. And many stalwarts are still coming. But Rivas says in recent days he’s heard from several families who told him they’re leaving the US. He’s also fielded calls from parishioners who are hunkering down and feel that coming to church is too risky, especially given that it’s known for having a largely immigrant congregation.

Rivas tries to reassure them. Church doors are locked during services now, no trespassing signs are on the doors and online videos of the services don’t show parishioners’ faces. And being well known, he feels, should make them safer.

“It gives us certain protection, because it’s a very visible church,” he says.

But during services, when Rivas makes announcements about upcoming church events, he also reminds churchgoers to fill out forms designating guardians for their children in case someone is detained or deported.

When he hears about families who are deciding to leave now on their own terms, he worries about the economic crisis his church could face if too many members depart. But even more, he says it’s devastating to think about all the talent the church community is losing.

The guy who always knew how to fix anything that was broken. The committee members who organized cookoffs and bake sales. The reader whose booming voice made Biblical passages come alive. And now, the always-smiling singer in the choir’s front row.

Her friends in the choir didn’t believe she was leaving until she showed them her plane ticket.

“They call me the joy of the choir, because I’m always laughing and joking,” López says.

But lately, López says, it’s been much harder to be light-hearted. Fear already stopped the choir from holding rehearsals at members’ homes. Only now, as her plans to leave fall into place, can she feel her joy returning. It was hard to share the news with the choir, she says, which has become like a family. She’s ready to leave the US behind. But this group’s love, López says, is one thing she’ll always carry with her.

Instead of picking cherries, they’re home with the shades drawn

Lisa and her three children sit with the shades drawn in their central California home.

Normally they’d be in Oregon picking cherries at this time of year. They’re among many migrant workers who travel to different locations along the US west coast as the seasons change. But this year, with immigration enforcement intensifying, they decided not to make the trek.

Lisa, who asked to be identified by a pseudonym because several members of her family are undocumented, is protected from deportation by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But her parents and husband aren’t, and they’re keenly aware that these days the slightest misstep could land them behind bars.

So this summer, rather than traveling to Oregon and enjoying the outdoors, she’s been staying inside with her three US citizen kids as much as possible. The children try to amuse themselves with TV and video games, but their boredom is clear. When CNN visited recently, one child was sitting alone and tossing a frisbee in the air.

“We love the outside, up there in Oregon. We used to go to the waterfalls, all those beautiful places that they have. It was so much fun for our kids. And for ourselves, too,” Lisa says.

Lisa knows staying inside is taking a toll on her family; with so much less time playing in the sun, her younger daughter was recently diagnosed with Vitamin D deficiency.

But even so, outside their home, Lisa feels the risks are greater. She’s thinking of homeschooling her children in the fall, just to be safe.

At his cherry orchards in northern Oregon, Ian Chandler says many migrant workers like Lisa’s family didn’t show up this year as immigration enforcement intensified in California.

“That kind of had a chilling effect on people wanting to move,” Chandler says.

The result: cherries are rotting on the trees, in what Chandler says is costing him at least $250,000 in revenue.

In Woodbridge, Virginia, Todos Supermarket owner Carlos Castro is also struggling with worker shortages, though for a different reason.

He recently had to let the butchers and bakers he’d trained to work at his store go after the Trump administration revoked their work permits when it ended humanitarian parole programs for Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.

“They had important jobs…that can’t be filled very easily,” he says. “Great employees, this is the saddest thing, productive people with the desire to take care of their families, to get ahead, they take away their visas and give them a letter with the number of days they have to leave the country. And then for us as a company, we’re left scrambling to cover them.”

The butchers were trained in using the complicated heavy equipment behind the meat counter. Now the remaining staff are struggling to keep up with orders, he says.

“What could be done quickly before now takes more time, and people get discouraged, and they leave and don’t buy anything,” Castro says.

After several raids, an unexpected visitor greets workers outside a Home Depot

It’s something Ricardo never imagined would happen.

In more than a decade of regularly waiting for day labor jobs at a Home Depot parking lot in Southern California, he’s seen plenty of things.

There were the people who refused to pay him after a week of work.

There were the men who gave him checks that bounced.

But until this year, he says he’d never seen immigration authorities targeting this location. In recent months, he says, they’ve come three times.

Ricardo narrowly missed being detained; during two of the raids, he happened to be working elsewhere. And on one occasion, he’d just gotten picked up from the Home Depot for a job minutes earlier.

But despite those close calls, the 60-year-old from Mexico, who asked to be identified by his first name, says he keeps waiting for work there. Most day laborers, he says, don’t have the luxury of staying home.

“There are some people who’ve stopped going out, but I have bills to pay, I have to work,” he says.

Recent immigration arrests in the Los Angeles area have had a dramatic impact, he says. Far fewer workers have been waiting at the Home Depot, he says. And the number of people coming by with offers of work has also decreased significantly.

“People are afraid to go there and pick up people because of immigration,” he says.

On a typical day before, at least two dozen workers would wait in the parking lot, he says. Now, on some days, just three or four are there with him. Recently, though, he says the number of workers started to grow after local volunteers began waiting nearby and alerting them about anyone who looked suspicious.

On one recent summer day, his decision to stick it out paid off.

An unexpected visitor came to the Home Depot parking lot: Jesús Morales, a TikTok influencer known for surprising day laborers and street vendors with theme park visits and donations to support their work.

Morales took Ricardo and another worker to a water park that day. And a few weeks later, he raised thousands of dollars for them in a GoFundMe campaign, hoping the workers would take some time off and stay safe.

Ricardo says he was overwhelmed by the generous donation. But he still can’t afford to stop looking for work. So many jobs seem to be drying up right now, in what’s usually the busy season, and he’s worried about the months ahead.

“Imagine how it will be when we get to October, November and December. It’s scary. That’s why I have to work now and save money,” he says.

Ricardo says he’s well aware of the risks.

“You just have to believe in God,” he says, “and if it’s your turn, then that’s it.”

A school principal notices a different way her students are vanishing

Marisol loves walking with her two children to the elementary school near their home in San Antonio, Texas. But as they get ready for classes to begin this year, she’s come to a difficult realization: Walking to school isn’t safe.

Inside her car, she hopes they’ll feel more protected. But if raids in the area intensify, she says she’ll be weighing an even more stressful question: Is sending them to school at all too risky? Last year, she already kept them home twice.

“I’m always saying, ‘Go to school, go to school, don’t be afraid.’ And I try to be brave,” says Marisol, who asked to be identified by her middle name because her family is undocumented. “But in the end, you get scared, and you don’t send them, and these fears get into your head, these monsters, asking ‘What could happen if I go to get them and they grab me outside the school? Or when I’m going from home to work? What will the children do?’ It’s a constant fear.”

Hearing those fears from parents breaks Velia Cortalano’s heart.

In the last school year, she says, multiple families kept their kids home from her school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on several occasions as immigration enforcement fears spread. Each time, Cortalano would try to convince them their children were safe at school. Most of the kids returned eventually. But she says one family left and never returned.

“The kids packed up all their things,” she says, “and then they just didn’t come back.”

Just as troubling as those sudden disappearances, Cortalano says, is a different sort of absence that’s even more prevalent in her classrooms.

“Even though they might be here, they’re not able to fully engage, because there’s that fear. ‘I’m here, but where’s my mom?’ or ‘Who’s going to come and pick me up?’”

Cortalano estimates that’s the situation for about a third of the students at Cien Aguas International School, where she’s the executive director. Many students in the K-8 school are part of immigrant families, she says. The strain is bubbling up in different ways, depending on students’ ages, and it makes it more difficult for everyone to learn. Several girls told her they felt like they had to be perfect and shouldn’t speak Spanish anymore. And some kids were roleplaying as “la migra versus the immigrants” until a gym teacher intervened.

“It’s been difficult for all the kids to sift through and manage in a healthy way. … It’s a lot of pressure,” she says.

The school does what it can to help students cope, she says. Among their strategies: a designated “wellness room” that includes soft lighting, a space for meditation and yoga exercises – and a punching bag.

Between raids and rumors, some restaurants are struggling

During what used to be the lunchtime rush, many tables sit empty at Spoon & Pork in Los Angeles.

Running a restaurant has never been easy, with razor-thin margins and rising costs. Co-owner Jay Tugas says the recent increase in immigration enforcement has been another devastating dent in the Filipino restaurant’s business.

“People don’t want to spend money. They don’t want to go out … People are scared. And I know it’s not just my restaurant, it’s pretty much everyone,” he says.

And employees often are scared to come to work.

“Everybody’s legal, but they’re still afraid they’ll get hassled or taken away, just because of how they look or how they talk,” says Ray Yaptinchay, another co-owner of the restaurant. “It’s just crazy, and it’s pretty sad, and it’s disrupted pretty much our whole industry.”

After rumors about immigration raids spread on social media and messaging apps, a 20-year-old Guatemalan immigrant saw a similar slump in business at the Mexican restaurant he manages in northeast Mississippi. He asked to be identified by his initials, J.F., because he’s undocumented and fears he could be targeted for speaking out.

That week earlier this year, he says, many nearby businesses closed when workers didn’t show up. His stayed open. And all day, he braced himself.

“You had this fear, just waiting to see if they were going to come through the door,” he says.

Among employees, morale has plummeted, he says, and comments from some customers can be tough to bear. Recently, after he asked how her meal was, one woman gave him a surprising response: “I hope they deport all of you soon.”

At a Mexican restaurant in Corpus Christi, Texas, rumors of ICE raids have also affected business.

“Sometimes we’re all alone for hours,” says L.V., a Guatemalan server at the restaurant who asked to be identified by her initials.

Some regular customers have stopped showing up, she says. And those who are still coming seem more somber.

The other day, she waited on a man who used to frequent the restaurant with his wife and children. Now he’s eating alone. The rest of the family has left the country, he told her, because the risks were too great.

“You can see he’s not OK, and how much he misses them,” she says.

She’s trying to keep her family safe from behind the wheel

At first, Esmeralda thought she’d leave the country and study abroad when Trump returned to power. But seeing many places she knows targeted during recent immigration raids in the Los Angeles area sparked a new feeling in her.

“My community has been terrorized. … At first I felt fear,” she says, “but then I was angry, actually. … This is my city. This is my state. And I’m going to stay here to protect not only myself, my livelihood, but the people that I know.”

The 30-year-old, who was brought to the US from Mexico when she was 3, has DACA and a driver’s license. She asked to be identified by her first name to protect undocumented members of her family. She’d driven her parents and siblings around when asked before. But now, she says what started as something convenient has become a necessity.

“Don’t even think about taking the bus,” she warned them.

Similar concerns have been spreading in LA after reports of authorities boarding public transportation and targeting people waiting at bus stops. Ridership on the city’s bus system downtown is down 35%, officials said in a recent court filing.

LA County Supervisor Janice Hahn says it’s a telling sign that represents just “a fraction of the toll” on immigrant communities.

“People aren’t just worried about taking the bus — they are terrified of leaving their homes or going to their jobs or going to the hospital,” Hahn said in a statement to CNN.

From behind the wheel of her gray Ford SUV, Esmeralda says she’s doing what she can to help. She’s extending her efforts beyond her family, too, delivering groceries locally to people who are too scared to leave their homes.

Quiet grocery delivery networks like the one Esmeralda recently joined are popping up in communities across the country, from LA to Chicago to Philadelphia.

“They don’t advertise much, they’re using WhatsApp, and they have a good system,” says Denisse Agurto, who leads a non-profit advocacy group in the Philadelphia suburb of Norristown.

Many residents in Norristown, which is about 35% Latino, were rattled recently after immigration authorities targeted a Latino supermarket there in July. CNN affiliate KYW reported that 14 undocumented immigrants were taken into custody that day.

Now Agurto, executive director of Unides Para Servir Norristown, says Latinos in the area are terrified.

“They’re not coming out of their houses,” she says, and the community’s main business corridor looks like a ghost town.

Undocumented immigrants aren’t the only ones who are worried. US citizens like her are fearful, too, says Agurto, adding that she’s started carrying around her passport.

In a Facebook group, locals recently discussed which grocery stores could be safe to go to now. One commenter warned neighbors to be skeptical: “Given how this situation is, we can’t trust anyone. Question: Is this an infiltrator from ICE who wants to know where we’re going next?”

For some, hiding isn’t an option

Days before the Colombian heritage festival he’s been hosting for over a decade was slated to start in July, Jorge Ortega’s phone rang.

“Something happened at the museum,” the voice on the other end told him. “It looks like some federal agents showed up.”

The presence of federal law enforcement in a Chicago museum parking lot sparked a flurry of rumors and panic in the city’s immigrant communities. A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman later denied authorities were targeting the National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture that day, stating they merely had a quick briefing in the parking lot about a narcotics investigation, CNN affiliate WLS reported. But many in the neighborhood remained unconvinced.

The museum is in Humboldt Park, where the Great Colombian Festival also takes place every year, and Ortega knew he needed to act quickly.

In some cities, festivals have been cancelled after similar incidents. Concerts and sporting events have reported dips in attendance.

But for Ortega, calling off this festival wasn’t an option.

“I was really nervous … You think in your head, ‘What if no one shows up?’ Or the biggest worry for me was how were we going to keep the community safe?”

Fears forced organizers to take more precautions, he says, including last-minute emergency planning and increased security for the event.

And still, half the vendors who’d been slated to come to the festival didn’t show up.

“Many of the workers didn’t want to come to work. They were afraid that they would be detained,” Ortega says.

Ultimately, attendance numbers for the three-day event dropped significantly. But still, more than 6,500 people came. Restaurants and vendors who participated sold out. And Ortega says he sees an important lesson in the experience.

“We celebrated our independence, kept moving forward, presented our culture. And in the end, we won. … I think we defeated fear,” he says. “Because if you live with fear, what are we going to do? Am I going to stay locked up at home doing nothing? That’s not life.”

Next year, Ortega plans to organize the festival again. In the face of uncertainty, he’s still determined to push forward.

So are many vendors at Georgia’s Plaza Fiesta.

Miguel Pollania, a photographer who’s worked at the mall for more than two decades, remembers when his shop was so busy, he needed assistants just to handle the weekend rush.

Today he’s frustrated by false rumors about immigration enforcement at the mall that are scaring many would-be customers.

“They saw a picture online, maybe just mall security, but they think it is immigration,” he says. “And that is enough to keep them away.”

But Pollania is holding out for better times. He looks around his studio and points to a frame in the center of his display wall. It’s a series of traditional baby portraits, featuring multiple poses in circular cutouts. The infant pictured is the child of someone he took a baby portrait of 20 years ago.

“We have been here 22 years,” Pollania says. “We have seen a lot. We have survived a lot.”

And through it all, Pollania and other vendors keep coming to work at Plaza Fiesta.

They sweep the floors, open their stalls and wait, hoping that someday soon customers will return.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bus-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-24 17:56:46.143790

As part of the forthcoming fast-track asylum process revealed by the Sunday Times earlier this month, the Home Office said today that a new independent body of professional adjudicators will be set up to deal with asylum appeals instead of judges in the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber).

The Home Office explained: ""The new body will be fully independent of government with safeguards to ensure high standards and is expected to use the expertise of independent professionally trained adjudicators focusing particularly on asylum appeals, and will allow capacity to be surged so cases can be cleared. It will have statutory powers to prioritise cases from those in asylum accommodation and foreign national offenders.""

Increasing numbers of asylum claims and increasing numbers of asylum decisions have pushed the backlog of asylum appeals in the First-tier Tribunal (IAC) to more than 50,000. In total, the Tribunal now faces a backlog of over 100,000 cases.

Although the number of sitting days in the First-tier Tribunal (IAC) has increased, the Home Office says it still cannot keep pace with fluctuating and growing demand. Therefore, an alternative approach is needed to provide broader and more flexible capacity.

In addition, the Home Office announced today that ministers are introducing a new legal requirement for appeals from individuals receiving asylum accommodation support, as well as appeals from foreign offenders, to be decided within a 24-week timeframe.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper MP described the asylum system as being ""in complete chaos"" when Labour took power, citing the large backlog of cases and a slow appeals process that leaves many people in the system for years. She said the Government is taking steps to restore control and order, including reducing the backlog of initial asylum decisions by 24% since the election and increasing returns of failed asylum seekers by 30%.

She added: ""But we cannot carry on with these completely unacceptable delays in appeals as a result of the system we have inherited which mean that failed asylum seekers stay in the system for years on end at huge cost to the taxpayer. Overhauling the appeals system so that it is swift, fair and independent, with high standards in place, is a central part of our Plan for Change.""

Further details of the new fast-track asylum appeals system will be set out in the autumn.

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticised the proposed changes as ""minor tweaks"" that ""go nowhere near far enough"". Philp added that a Conservative government would ""repeal the Human Rights Act for all immigration matters and deport all illegal immigrants immediately upon arrival"".

A number of experienced immigration lawyers recalled on social media that immigration judges were called adjudicators prior to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, and that a fast-track system for asylum appeals was introduced by the previous Labour government in the early 2000s. That fast-track system was found to be unlawful by the courts, as the time limits made it impossible for there to be a fair hearing of appeals in a significant number of cases.",https://www.ein.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/tribunal-logo.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 16:56:37.779418

The protest is being held from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the Cold Stream Dam.

Of course a 90-year-old agency is unconstitutional, you rubes

It’s nice of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to give a helping hand to the ongoing destruction of a functioning administrative state and the complete collapse of protections for workers.

And it’s tough to think of a better way to do it than ruling that the structure of a 90-year-old congressionally created agency that forms the backbone of labor relations in America was probably just a ghost all along.

Yes, according to the worst federal appellate court, the structure of the National Labor Relations Board islikely unconstitutional.

The court agreed with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which had argued that the NLRB impermissibly limited the president’s ability to remove board members and the administrative law judges who handle labor cases.

The NLRB has been in the crosshairs ofcorporations like Amazon and SpaceX, which hate labor oversight and want it gone.

Lucky for them—though not for the rest of us—their interests dovetail with President Donald Trump’s goal of eliminating all restrictions on his power. And since the Supreme Court already let himillegally remove one of the appointed NLRB members months ago, the fix was pretty much in.

9th Circuit makes sure a week doesn’t go by without letting the administration kick more people out

On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appealsswept aside a lower court ruling that was barring Trump from stripping Temporary Protected Status from over 60,000 people from Nepal, Nicaragua, and Honduras.

Congress created the program to allow undocumented immigrants to legally stay in the United States if the Department of Homeland Security determines that conditions in their home country are too dangerous to return to.

Trump and Vice President JD Vance spent the 2024 campaign whipping racists into a frenzy

over Haitians with TPS status and, once they took office, set about stripping the status from everyone their racist little hobgoblin minds could think of.

Related | Vance knew Haitian immigrants weren't eating pets—and lied anyway

Of course, there has been no court ruling affirming that the administration can do this.

Instead, there are court rulings that they cannot, but since the Supreme Courtallowed Trump to strip protected status from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants while litigation continues, the administration is just going to keep throwing more people out.

The administration’s argument here was the usual: It is extremely harmed if it can’t do what it wants when it wants, and the courts can’t even review their decision to remove TPS status. Sure seems like the greater harm would be to the people who are being deported en masse.

Farewell again, Ten Commandments—but also likely not for long

Two weeks ago, it was Arkansasgetting slapped down for its unconstitutional law mandating the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. This week, it was Texas.

U.S. District Judge Fred Biery, with the patience of a saint, wrote a55-page decision to try to painstakingly explain basic civics to the state of Texas, which hasalready appealed.

The Texas law would have required the display of the King James Version of the Ten Commandments in schools, and was basically identical to a Louisiana law the 5th Circuit struck down earlier this year.

The whole point of these cases is to get something to a theocratic Supreme Court in the hopes the right-wing majority will sign off on jamming conservative evangelical Protestantism into public schools, but at least for now, we have Biery’s objectively funny decision to bring us joy:

Even though the Ten Commandments would not be affirmatively taught, the captive audience of students likely would have questions, which teachers would feel compelled to answer. That is what they do. Teenage boys, being the curious hormonally driven creatures they are, might ask: “Mrs. Walker, I know about lying and I love my parents, but how do I do adultery?” Truly an awkward moment for overworked and underpaid educators, who already have to deal with sex education issues, ... and a classic example of the law of unintended consequences in legislative edicts.

Yeah, unfortunately it’s legal for military attorneys to do civilian prosecutions

As the Trump administration continues its efforts to subdue the residents of the nation’s capital, there’s news that 20 members of the Judge Advocate General Corps, known as JAG, from the Department of Defense havebeen tapped to work as special assistant United States attorneys—aka federal prosecutors—and will prosecute civilian crimes.

This seems bad, and it probably is, but unlike so many other things the administration is doing, this one isactually legal. During the first Reagan administration, the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel concluded this was unlawful, but then Congress passed a law authorizing it.

Presumably, this is also in part because Jeanine Pirro, Fox News host turned United States attorney for the District of Columbia, justwhined about how her office was understaffed.

It is, indeed, thanks to the massive purge of prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6 cases. There’s an additional benefit to using JAG attorneys as your temp agency: unlike civilians, they can’t just quit.

This is likely the first time we’ve seen “Calvinball” in a Supreme Court opinion, but it won’t be the last

In an absolute messof a decision, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the administration can cancel $783 million in National Institute of Health grants.

Per the 5-4 conservative majority, the states and private plaintiffs being arbitrarily stripped of millions in public health do have recourse: They can go to the Court of Federal Claims, which is the court you go to for contractual disputes with the government.

Of course, this isn’t a contractual dispute. These are grants that have already been issued and approved.

Per a different 5-4 majority, however, the underlying reason the administration gave for the terminations—that they represented forbidden wokeness, basically—was likely unlawful. That weird result is because Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the majority in saying that the reason for the grant terminations is unlawful, but also joined the majority in saying they can go ahead and do it anyway. Got it.

“Calvinball” shows up in Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s blistering dissent: “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.”

Takeover Is Scaring Immigrant Parents Out of Taking Kids Back to School,Jessica Washington,,,,,https://theintercept.com/2025/08/24/washington-dc-national-guard-ice-school/,"Teachers claim that the D.C. school system has been unhelpful, treating the situation as business as usual and even discouraging organizers from providing guidance to families on school grounds.
But even with added support, some families are still scared to return to school next week.
“I talked to a parent today who has been hiding in their apartment since there was a raid next to their building,” said an elementary school teacher who has been assisting with the emergency carpools.
“They’ve just been sitting on their hands,” said the elementary school teacher.
And the other elementary school teacher said that DCPS told principals “not to speak up” on the issue.","Washington, D.C.’s large immigrant population is facing a reign of terror: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have flooded neighborhoods with large Latino populations, imposing checkpoints and hanging a threat over families’ heads as kids and parents prepare to go back to school next week.

Instead of worrying about having the right notebooks for the school year, many families are now afraid of getting detained by ICE on their way to school drop-off and pickup, three school staff members and local organizers told The Intercept. Teachers claim that the D.C. school system has been unhelpful, treating the situation as business as usual and even discouraging organizers from providing guidance to families on school grounds.

“Most parents’ biggest concern is that something will happen to them on the way to school in front of their children,” said Hillary, an elementary school teacher in the city who asked to be identified by her first name because she was concerned her activism might get her school targeted by ICE, “or it’s going to happen before they’ve been able to pick up their children from school, and there will be no one to come get their kids.”

The climate of fear is fueled by multiple levels of intensified federal policing. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to deploy the National Guard to the District of Columbia. The Trump administration subsequently federalized the local police force and ordered further co-operation between them and ICE officials. And upon entering office in January, Trump revoked the sensitive zones memo that once prevented ICE from operating within schools, hospitals, and churches.

In May, Hillary and a group of other teachers, parents, and community volunteers formed a rapid response team to counter increased ICE and homeland security presence in D.C. They alerted families of suspected immigration enforcement presence and offered services like walking children to their parents’ cars. They’re anticipating they’ll need to increase their efforts as school starts in the coming week.

“[We’re] trying to get walking groups. So if parents are maybe uncomfortable walking students to school by themselves or picking students up by themselves, we might have school staff, volunteers in the neighborhood, parents in the school who are providing a safe passage,” Hillary said, adding that she knows several other schools are pursuing similar efforts.

Amy Fischer, an organizer with the D.C. group Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said she’s been working alongside volunteers like Hillary to protect immigrant families as they head back to school next week. She said undocumented parents weren’t the only immigrants who needed community protection.

“So many of the people are asylum-seekers who have pending asylum applications, they have a work permit, and under the law, should not be detained because they have a pending asylum claim,” Fischer said. “But many, many of those people are being picked up.”

Fischer said that this is all uncharted territory for D.C. residents. “We previously never had checkpoints in D.C., and the previous types of enforcement that we had were much more targeted, so they would be going after a specific individual, not just sort of random pickups on the street,” she said.

Despite the fear, Fischer said that residents have been largely stepping up to help find solutions for families, whether that’s offering to give students rides or walking them to school.

But even with added support, some families are still scared to return to school next week.

“I talked to a parent today who has been hiding in their apartment since there was a raid next to their building,” said an elementary school teacher who has been assisting with the emergency carpools. “They’ve not left their house since over a week ago. So they weren’t planning on sending their kids.”

The teacher, who requested anonymity because they were concerned about retaliation from the school district and ICE against their school, said they offered to arrange for someone else to take their child to and from school, which the parent is considering.

“A fear of being detained is kind of consistent across the board,” the teacher said. Some parents have even suggested that schools should offer remote learning, despite the evidence that it can bring worsening educational and mental health outcomes for children.

Both teachers who spoke to The Intercept said the District of Columbia Public Schools system, known as DCPS, has been slow to provide schools and teachers with guidance on how to protect their classrooms in the event of ICE activity and actively discouraged school staff from sharing information with families about their rights. “They’ve just been sitting on their hands,” said the elementary school teacher.

According to Hillary, the district is “almost acting like nothing has really changed, and that we do not have families who are in an increased amount of danger right now.”

In a statement to The Intercept, a DCPS spokesperson said, “Our leaders, educators, and staff care deeply about the safety of our students, and DCPS will continue to share safety guidance and reminders with students as they commute to and from their school campuses next week and beyond.”

Hillary added that the school district discouraged her and other teachers from providing families with information about their legal rights on school grounds. And the other elementary school teacher said that DCPS told principals “not to speak up” on the issue.

“We were doing a lot of that in May. Unfortunately, the district kind of let it be known that they were not super supportive of us doing that on school grounds,” she said. “It has had to kind of be in quieter ways that we’re getting that information out to parents, and it’s having to come a lot more through not official channels.”

The DCPS spokesperson did not comment on whether staff had been discouraged from organizing, but said the district “has not discouraged parents or caregivers from hosting information sessions or organizing carpools.”

“DCPS cooperates with law enforcement officers bearing lawful court orders,” the spokesperson said. “Our principals have been advised to alert the district’s legal team for immediate assistance and support.”

Hillary said she worried about the impact on children whose families ultimately felt they couldn’t risk sending their kids to school.

“We saw from Covid, even a couple weeks’ absence can have a really big effect on kids’ learning and on their mental health,” she said. “You’re not going to get a chance to build community with your classmates. And then we also know school is a place where a lot of kids get fed.”

Ukraine:

• Use of long-range weapons: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented today on a Wall Street Journal report that the Pentagon has for months been blocking the use of long-range US weapons to strike inside Russia. Zelensky said he hasn’t discussed the issue with the US recently. “This is news to me,” he told reporters.

• Some analysis: “I can understand why they would limit the use of certain long-range systems against Russia when they think that Russia might still be willing to make a deal. But that should be very clear not to be the case at this moment, and I hope that there will be a review of that policy,” former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus said today on ABC’s “This Week.” Petraeus voiced skepticism at the idea Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet with Zelensky soon, saying the Russian leader is “the clear obstacle to peace at this point in time.”

Iran:

• Stalled talks: Iran will never be “obedient” to the US, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a defiant address today, according to state media. Negotiations between Iran and the US on Tehran’s nuclear program have not resumed since both the US and Israel carried out airstrikes against Iran in June.

South Korea and Japan:

• Historic summit: Trump’s presence loomed large when South Korean President Lee Jae-myung traveled to Japan — the country’s former colonizer — and issued the first joint statement with a Japanese prime minister in 17 years. Read CNN’s analysis on how the warming relations could reflect a response to Trump’s unpredictable foreign policy.

President Donald Trump has heightened his feud with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.

In a series of social media posts, the president attacked Moore’s record on crime and tied reconstruction funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge to a political dispute over deploying the National Guard to major US cities.

The post came after Moore publicly challenged Trump to visit Baltimore in response to the president’s claims about rising crime in US cities.

Moore responded today in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” saying, “The president is spending all this time talking about me. I’m spending my time talking about the people I serve. I believe we have to be able to address the issue of crime.”

Trump has continued to group Democratic states and cities such as Baltimore with others he claims are in decline due to crime rates, though local officials have refuted some of his claims.

Bash presses Jeffries on whether New York will join redistricting war

02:03

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says Democrats are ready to ensure “Donald Trump cannot steal the midterm elections” on the back of GOP efforts to redraw congressional maps.

Pressed by CNN’s Dana Bash on the plan to redistrict in his state of New York, Jeffries said he’s spoken with Gov. Kathy Hochul about the issue, and there’s a plan to respond “in New York and in other parts of the country as the circumstances dictate.”

Jeffries also brushed off concerns that Republicans could redraw enough seats to ensure they successfully defend their House majority next year, pointing to Democrats’ sweeping pickups in the midterm elections during Trump’s first administration.

The big picture: There’s an expanding battle over partisan redistricting unfolding across the country, with President Donald Trump backing the GOP-led effort.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to soon sign into law new congressional maps that could help Republicans win as many as five more House seats in the midterms. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is leading an effort to redraw the state’s own congressional maps to offset the Republican gains.

What the administration is saying: Vice President JD Vance defended the Texas GOP’s move this morning, claiming in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that it was an effort to make elections “more fair” and a response to Democratic gerrymandering.

While both parties engage in the practice, Democrats have handed away their power to gerrymander in some states, including California, where a nonpartisan commission draws congressional maps. That’s why Newsom’s effort now requires a statewide referendum to succeed.

CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed reporting to this post.

Vice President JD Vance is projecting optimism on the prospect of ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, saying in a new interview that Russia has made “significant concessions” and the US will “keep on pushing for a diplomatic solution.”

The vice president’s comments come as Russia-Ukraine peace talks appear to have stalled after some momentum earlier this month.

President Donald Trump said last week that he could ultimately decide to walk away from negotiations, but Vance indicated the US will continue to be involved: “We’re going to eventually be successful, or we’ll hit a brick wall, and if we hit a brick wall, then we’re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage.”

Use of long-range weapons: Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented today on a Wall Street Journal report that the Pentagon has for months been blocking the use of long-range US weapons to strike inside Russia.

“To be frank, we have not discussed such issues with the US recently,” Zelensky said, when asked about the reports at a Ukrainian Independence Day event.

“There used to be, you remember, various signals regarding our strikes in response to their strikes on our energy sector. That was a long time ago. Today, we don’t even mention it. This is news to me,” he added.

CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.

The Trump administration has been dogged by weeks of controversy over its handling of the so-called Epstein files, and that scrutiny continues this weekend.

First, a quick recap: As promised, the Justice Department started providing the House Oversight Committee with thousands of pages of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case on Friday.

The committee has vowed to release them publicly, but only after lawmakers ensure they’ve made any further redactions needed to protect the victims. We don’t currently have a timetable for that release.

The DOJ also released transcripts and audio from its interview with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell last week — though she did not make any bombshell accusations or provide much revelatory information.

Now, Democrats sound unimpressed with the new files: Members of the party on the House Oversight Committee are decrying what they say is a lack of new records provided to the panel.

Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania also claimed the DOJ’s files are “largely thousands of pages of recycled content already made available to the public.”

We’ll bring you any further comment on the Epstein files from Trump administration officials and Democrats as they make the rounds this morning on Sunday political talk shows.

As we’ve been reporting, President Donald Trump says he plans to widen the law enforcement and National Guard crackdown in Washington, DC, to include other major US cities.

Trump singled out Chicago in the Oval Office on Friday, and it has since emerged that his administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to the city, according to two officials who spoke with CNN.

Here’s how some big city mayors are responding:

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Friday that he had not received any formal communication about the administration sending federal law enforcement or troops there, but that he takes the president’s statements “seriously.”

Federal intervention would threaten to undo local efforts that have already seen significant reductions in serious crimes, Johnson said.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Trump’s move to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the city in June during protests against the administration was a “test case” for further overreach, as was his DC crackdown.

“The president (can) say, ‘Well we can take over your city whenever we want and I am the commander in chief and I can use the troops whenever we want.’ I think that is an abuse of our troops, and I think it is an overreach of presidential powers,” Bass told CNN.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded last week to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who threatened to prosecute local officials whose cities did not comply with the White House’s immigration crackdown.

Elsewhere, there has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts — but little concrete progress — since US President Donald Trump’s recent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

We’ve rounded up the latest lines on the conflict for you, below:

• Trump’s letter: The US president sent a letter of support to Ukraine as the country marks the anniversary of declaring itself free of Soviet rule. Zelensky shared the letter on X and delivered his own message on the country’s 34th Independence Day: We will not lose. US envoy Keith Kellogg also attended a ceremony marking the occasion in Kyiv today.

• Zelensky on security guarantees: Zelensky said Saturday that a plan for US and European security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal “will be ready in the coming days,” following calls with several world leaders.

Security guarantees have become the focal point of recent talks, with Kyiv’s western allies pledging they would provide backup for Ukraine to deter any future attacks by Russia.

• Putin on restoring US relations: Putin said Friday that the US and Russia are discussing the possibility of joint projects in Alaska and that he views recent talks as a step toward “full-scale restoration” of the countries’ relationship.

In comments reported by Russia state media TASS, Putin described his meeting with Trump in Alaska as “very good” and said Russia sought an end to the fighting in Ukraine, but did not mention whether he would attend bilateral talks with Zelensky.

• Trump’s deadline extended — again: The US president said Friday he will give Putin “a couple of weeks,” further extending his deadline for potential consequences against Moscow after urging the Russian leader to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart.

Asked by CNN’s Alayna Treene if there’s a possibility he does nothing if Putin doesn’t come to the table, Trump said, “We’ll see. I’ll see whose fault it is.”

Welcome to our coverage of the latest developments on Donald Trump’s presidency.

The Trump administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to Chicago, two officials told CNN, as the president looks to expand his anti-crime agenda and crackdown on immigration in major cities across the United States.

It is not yet clear how many troops would be sent to Chicago, or when those deployments would start.

Trump seemed to preview those plans in the Oval Office on Friday, saying, “I think Chicago will be our next, and then we’ll help with New York.”

CNN has reached out to the White House and the Pentagon for comment. The Washington Post first reported on the plans.

The Trump administration might try to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda in the coming days, according to a notice sent by a Department of Homeland Security official to his lawyers Friday.

The notice, made public in a court filing in Abrego Garcia’s human smuggling criminal case in Tennessee, came minutes after he was released from criminal custody pending his trial on the federal charges.

“Let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” the notice read in part.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers accused the government of using the notice to try to “coerce” Abergo Garcia to accept a plea deal in his case.

The big picture: The case of Abrego Garcia, who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year before being returned to the US in June to face his charges, has become a flashpoint in President Donald Trump’s sweeping deportation push.

Critics have pointed to the wrongful deportation as a prime example of what they say is a chaotic and cruel immigration crackdown, while the Trump administration has doubled down on its claims Abrego Garcia is a criminal with no right to remain in the US.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2231525759.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-24 14:56:33.867051

Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they’ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.

Overall, its activities — and how it carries them out — have polarized many Americans in recent months.

After years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.

Last week, The Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency's top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.

It's surging hiring

ICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year's end.

The agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications — many from former officers.

New recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. That's a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers — not just ICE agents — from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.

Caleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he's been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they're assigned.

It's preparing for conflict

As Trump’s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.

Vitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency's data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.

Lyons said that after recent operations in Los Angeles turned violent, ICE is making gas masks and helmets standard issue for new agents. ""Right now we’re seeing and we’re having to adapt to all different scenarios that we were never trained for in the past,"" he said.

Lyons says the agency is also starting to send out security teams to accompany agents making arrests: “We’re not gonna allow people to throw rocks anymore, because we’re going to have our own agents and officers there to protect the ones that are actually out there making that arrest.""

It's beefing up specialized units for high-risk situations

About eight deportation officers dressed in military-style camouflage uniforms, helmets and carrying an assortment of weapons stand outside a house yelling “Police! We have a warrant!” before entering and clearing the house.

They are members of a Special Response Team taking part in a demonstration at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. These officers are like a SWAT team — deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations. They also accompany detainees the agency deems dangerous when they are deported.

“Everybody is trained to serve a warrant,"" Vitello said. “These guys are trained to serve high-risk warrants.”

There are roughly 450 deportation officers with the special training to serve on these teams, and Lyons says they have been deployed to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and Washington.

He said he'd like to have more such units but wouldn't put an exact number on how many. Vitello said they're also in the process of getting more of the specially armored vehicles.

It's teaching whom agents can arrest — and when

New recruits to ICE receive training on immigration law and the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unlawful searches. Longtime officers get regular refreshers on these topics.

In limited situations, ICE agents are allowed to enter someone's home. Generally when they're seeking someone they're trying to remove from the country, they have an administrative warrant as opposed to a criminal warrant. That administrative warrant doesn't allow them to enter the house without first getting permission.

Vitello says the new recruits are taught about the different warrants and how the rules differ. And they're taught how those who allowed ICE to enter their house can change their mind.

“If somebody says ‘Get out,’ and you don’t have your target, you have to leave,” he said.

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.

The Fourth Amendment doesn't extend to someone's vehicle, so Vitello said deportation officers do have the authority to arrest someone in a car or truck. Vitello said in the rare case where a target was in a motor home, officers would talk to the agency's lawyers first to figure out what protections apply.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/24/1600x900/ICE-Training-Facility-2_1756036837186_1756036874285.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 15:56:45.024101

They began gathering at Temple Beth Hatfiloh shortly before 6:30 p.m., then marched west on Eighth Avenue, continued north on Capitol Way, turned left onto Olympia Avenue and then stopped and gathered again at Percival Landing Park near the city’s waterfront.

The “walk for immigrant justice” as it was termed was organized by the Faith Network for Immigrant Support which includes a number of Olympia area faith groups, including Temple Beth Hatfiloh and St. John/San Juan Episcopal Church.

As they walked through dowtown, some held signs that said, “Stop ICE raids,” “Our communities deserve decency,” “No more deportations,” and “ICE is Inhumane.”

The reference to “ICE” refers to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement branch of the federal government, which under the Trump Administration has become controversial for its process of detaining and deporting immigrants. Some also say that sufficient due process is not being exercised in those incidents.

Before hundreds of people embarked on their march, Temple Beth Hatfiloh’s Rabbi Seth Goldstein addressed the crowd.

“I am here, as I know many of you are, because our spiritual teachings and our values compel us to be here because we know that the commandment to love your neighbor knows no borders, and the commandment to welcome a stranger is stronger than walls,” he said.

“So let us say loud and clear to those who are in fear, who feel targeted to those who feel othered, who are hidden by force or hiding for safety: We will not remain indifferent,” Goldstein said. “We see you. We are with you, and we will protect you, and we say to those who seek to do harm, who promote policies of xenophobia and hate and intimidation and to implement these policies and carry out these arrests, you will not succeed. You will not succeed.”

Resident Lori Doron was among the many who gathered outside the temple before the march began.

“Why do I want to be here? Well, because we’re all immigrants, and we need each other, and there’s certainly no reason to perpetuate this superstition of separation,” she said.

More immigrants detained

Some also held signs of support for Muhammud Zahid Chaudhry, an area resident and Army veteran detained by ICE on Thursday during a citizenship interview, according to several media reports, including King 5 News.

“ICE records show Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry, who emigrated from Pakistan and has lived in the United States for 25 years, was taken into custody at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma,” King 5 reported.

Chaudhry is a member of the Olympia chapter of Veterans for Peace, according to the report.

Olympia City Councilman Clark Gilman, who attended Saturday’s event, cited Chaudhry’s case as another reason to be there.

“For me, tonight’s walk for immigrant justice and prayer vigil is especially important as we have an active member of our own community detained the night before last at the detention center,” he said.

Janet Waggoner, lead pastor and evangelist at St. John/ San Juan Episcopal Church in Olympia, spoke in support of an area man named Fernando Rangel Saucedo, who she said has been in detention since early June.

“He’s somebody who’s been in this country, a faithful husband and father and lead construction worker for 20 years,” she said. “And so we are just hoping that he can continue to parent his daughter, who is a U.S. citizen.”

“It’s important for me to be here because we have a community of love and acceptance, a community that seeks freedom and justice for all, and I am here with many members of our congregation, not only Spanish-speaking and English-speaking, but also we have members who are descendants of folks from Africa and Asia, and so we stand together for love and peace,” Waggoner said.

Originally from El Salvador

Mabel Thackeray, who took part in the march, came to this country from El Salvador when she was 18. Today she is a licensed mental health professional who works for North Thurston Public Schools.

“I belong to many organizations, and my goal is to show and humanize who we are and what we contribute to society,” she said.

The new school year is about to begin, she added, and although students of color are excited to return to school, there’s also some fear, she said.

“Now more than ever we need to create that safe space for them,” Thackeray said.

Saturday’s walk ended at Percival Landing Park where more people spoke, including Kathy Baros Friedt, a member of the Hispanic Roundtable.

She, too, expressed her concern about Chaudhry’s detention.

“Many of you know him,” she said. “While being compliant with his (citizenship) hearing date, he was abducted and taken immediately to the detention center, with no notice to his wife and two children and supporters that were waiting for him.”

Friedt added: “You are not walking alone in this fight.”

In a classroom with desks cluttered with thick legal books about immigration law, recruits learn about how the Fourth Amendment governs their work. And on a firing range littered with shell casings, new recruits for Immigration and Customs Enforcement practice shooting their handguns.

“Instructors, give me a thumbs up when students are ready to go,” a voice over the loudspeaker said before a group of about 20 ICE recruits practiced drawing and firing their weapons.

The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, is the epicenter of training for almost all federal law enforcement officers, including the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are at the center of President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.

Now, with lots of money approved by Congress this summer starting to flow into ICE, the agency is in midst of a huge hiring effort as it aims to get thousands of new deportation officers into the field in the coming months.

On Thursday, The Associated Press and other news organizations got a rare look at the Basic Immigration Law Enforcement Training Program that new ICE recruits — specifically those in the Enforcement and Removal Operations unit responsible for finding, arresting and removing people from the country — go through and what they learn.

Ramping up hiring, training

ICE is getting $76.5 billion in new money from Congress to help it meet Trump's mass deportation goal. That's nearly 10 times the agency's current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion of that money is for new staff.

They're hiring across the agency, including investigators and lawyers, but the numbers they're hiring in those areas pale in comparison to how many deportation officers are coming on board. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, was at the training demonstration Thursday. He said the agency currently has about 6,500 deportation officers and is aiming to hire 10,000 more by the end of the year.

With that hiring surge has come concerns that vetting or training of new recruits will be shortchanged. The Border Patrol went through a similar hiring surge in the early 2000s when hiring and training standards were changed; arrests for employee misconduct rose.

Lyons pushed back on concerns that ICE might cut corners when it comes to training. although he said they have made changes designed to streamline the process.

“I wasn’t going to water down training,” said Lyons.

Caleb Vitello, the assistant director of ICE in charge of training, says new recruits will go through about eight weeks of training at the Georgia facility. But they also have training before and after they come here.

One key change, Vitello noted: ICE cut out five weeks of Spanish-language training because he said recruits were only getting to the point of being “moderately” competent in Spanish. He said language translation technology can help fill that void in the field.

What does the training look like?

During the six-days-a-week training, new recruits live on the grounds of the sprawling facility, which is covered with pine forests and sits near the Atlantic Ocean a little less than an hour's drive north of the Florida state line. Hundreds have gone through the training here in recent months.

During the course, new recruits train on firearms in a large indoor shooting range that looks as big as a football field. On Thursday, the floor was littered with spent shell casings as roughly 20 new recruits wearing blue shirts and blue pants practiced shooting from a bent-elbow position and transitional shooting — involving transferring their guns from one hand to another. Instructors in red shirts walked behind them, occasionally giving them instruction. Everyone wore eye protection and red, noise-reducing earmuffs with earplugs underneath.

Dean Wilson, who oversees the firearms training, compared some of the operations that ICE agents face to a haunted house where they don't know what might be coming at them.

""We do our very best to make sure that even though they’re in that environment, that they have the wherewithal to make the proper decision,"" said Wilson. “Nobody wants to be the one to make a bad shot, and nobody wants to be the one that doesn’t make it home.”

In a big field with various driving tracks and courses, they also train on driving techniques — how to recover from a skid on wet pavement or how to navigate a winding course similar to an urban environment where they have to come to a full stop or navigate blind corners.

The curriculum also includes de-escalation techniques designed to prevent the use of force in the first place, Lyons said.

“In any type of law enforcement situation,"" he said, “you’d rather de-escalate with words before you have to use any use of force.""

Learning the law and the Fourth Amendment

Not all of the training is in the field.

ICE agents like to point out that when it comes to complexity, immigration law is second only to the tax code.

At the training academy, they get about 12 hours of classroom instruction on things like the Fourth Amendment — the part of the Constitution that protects against unreasonable searches and seizures — and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which has evolved over the decades and governs all facets of immigration. Those legal lessons are also interspersed throughout the rest of the training.

On the desks in one classroom are training manuals and immigration law handbooks roughly two to three inches thick. Recruits learn about how to determine if someone is removable from the country, under what circumstances they can go into someone's house to search and when they have to leave.

ICE staff pushed back on accusations that they are indiscriminately pulling people over or setting up checkpoints in Washington, D.C., or elsewhere as part of immigration enforcement.

They said they have to have probable cause to go after someone, and they do targeted operations. They said they can't — and don't — do traffic stops but can work with local authorities who are.

“Once local law enforcement makes a stop, and then they contact ICE saying we have somebody that we possibly think might be an alien,“ said Greg Hornsby, an associate legal adviser at ICE. ”And that’s where we step in.""",https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/f682e98b-5fa6-44f7-825a-a638e03aa013/20250824T111934/f682e98b-5fa6-44f7-825a-a638e03aa013_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 12:57:10.906440

The Home Office was due to stop using Napier Barracks in Folkestone to accommodate migrants applying for asylum from September, but has since decided to extend its use until the end of the year.

The former military site in Folkestone has been used to accommodate asylum seekers since 2020, despite being described by a judge as ""squalid"" in 2021.

The decision to extend its use comes in the wake of a High Court judgement that barred the use of a hotel in Epping to house asylum seekers - and could pave the way for similar legal action over other hotels.

Napier Barracks started out as contingency accommodation for migrants seeking asylum at the start of the Covid pandemic.

But in 2021, following a fire and outbreak of the virus at the site, a High Court judgement found the accommodation it provided was inadequate.

Mr Justice Linden found that the barracks were overcrowded, run down with ""filthy"" facilities and contained ""detention-like"" settings for men.

The Home Office said the following year that it had made ""significant"" improvements to the site - but still faced calls from MPs for it to be closed.

Under Labour, it said in March this year that Napier Barracks would cease operating as housing for asylum seekers in September. That deadline has now been extended until December.

A Home Office spokesperson said it was continuing ""to fulfil our statutory obligations and deliver our commitments to reduce the cost of asylum accommodation, and end the use of asylum hotels by the end of this Parliament"".

The announcement comes hours after the home secretary announced an overhaul of the asylum system aimed at cutting the number of people being housed in temporary accomodation while awaiting an asylum ruling.

Yvette Cooper said a new body of independent adjudicators would fast-track decisions on appeals, which currently take just over a year on average to be heard.

During this time, asylum seekers whose applications have been unsuccessful are accommodated at the taxpayer's expense. There are currently 32,000 asylum seekers being housed in hotels.

“Our city depends on these federal grants in order to meet our housing demand, provide reliable transportation and improve our roads,” said Dyer.
The city is also relying on $100 million in federal grants for other airport improvements, including a new air traffic control tower.
Now, his wrongful thinking – along with his assault on anything DEI – is threatening federal funding intended to make airports safer.
Fresno City Council President Mike Karbassi stressed that Congress has approved the money.","President Donald Trump and his attempts to bully public agencies, including the City of Fresno, have gone too far.

In May, the city received a letter from the U.S. Department of Transportation threatening to take away federal funding if Fresno did not drop Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) language and cooperate with immigration enforcement.

Monday, Fresno received an email from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development directing the city to remove all references to “equity,” “environmental justice” and all transgender references from its Community Development Block Grant plan or risk losing federal funding. Fresno cannot use federal grant money to “promote gender ideology” as defined in the president’s January executive order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”

In the city’s Housing and Community Development 2025-29 plan, the word “equity” shows up in a sentence about attracting and retaining industries that meet or exceed criteria like family-sustaining wages, investment impact, equity and resiliency.

Another sentence in the 231-page plan outlines goals to “improve housing affordability and stability, reduce racial and economic isolation and support environmental justice and sustainability.”

Those are hardly examples of a city hellbent on stamping DEI all over its planning.

The response was correct: Fresno joined several cities and counties in a lawsuit against the Trump administration’s threats.

“We are asking the courts to restore fairness, predictability, and the rule of law to the federal grants system,” said City Attorney Andrew Janz, according to Fresno Bee reporter Thaddeus Miller. “This lawsuit is not about partisan politics – it is about protecting essential federal funding that Congress previously authorized and intended for local communities.”

Mayor Jerry Dyer was understandably not happy with the email.

“Our city depends on these federal grants in order to meet our housing demand, provide reliable transportation and improve our roads,” said Dyer. “When Washington suddenly rewrites the rules, it’s our families, seniors and small businesses who suffer most and the impact is felt throughout our nation.”

Fresno stands to lose $50 million in Federal Aviation Administration grants to finish capital improvement projects at Fresno Yosemite International Airport, according to the lawsuit. The city is also relying on $100 million in federal grants for other airport improvements, including a new air traffic control tower.

The lawsuit indicates Fresno depends on more than $100 million in federal transportation grants, $11.7 million annually for housing and $2.2 million in environmental safety grants. The plaintiffs argue that Trump’s executive orders can’t override funding approved by Congress.

Fresno was joined in the lawsuit by Eureka, South Lake Tahoe, Sacramento County, St. Paul (Minnesota), Monroe County (New York) and the Monroe County Airport Authority (New York).

Why strongarm Fresno and others?

“My Administration will defend women’s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male,” Trump said in his January 20 executive order. The problem is the president is oversimplifying the two sexes.

The Washington Post reported in February that sex can be difficult to assign for about 2% of the population.

“While there are some areas of active debate, scientists are in wide agreement that biological sex in humans as well as the rest of life on earth is much more complicated than a simple binary,” University of Iowa professor Maurine Neiman told The Post.

Trump’s efforts to reject science is dangerous not only to those who identify outside the male or female sex, but could cause harm to them. Now, his wrongful thinking – along with his assault on anything DEI – is threatening federal funding intended to make airports safer.

Fresno City Council President Mike Karbassi stressed that Congress has approved the money.

“Our responsibility is to make sure local services are never jeopardized by politics, and this lawsuit is one step in keeping that promise,” Karbassi said in a statement.",https://www.fresnobee.com/public/latest-news/4bmsdu/picture311814942/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_FRS_EPZFAT_SOUTHWEST_3_1_ECLRV3LC_L706306170.JPG,N,,2025-08-24 11:57:08.057223

“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states.","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, his defense attorneys told a court Saturday.

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail for the time being and then serve whatever sentence he would receive for pleading guilty, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

Later on Friday, “the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning — precisely when he must report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office — to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,” his defense attorneys wrote.

They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.

Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn’t face the possibility of detention.

Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin responded to the brief with a statement saying, “A federal grand jury has charged Abrego Garcia with serious federal crimes … underscoring the clear danger this defendant presents to the community. This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury. Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people.”

Abrego Garcia’s case became a flash point in President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

“Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego’s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda,” his attorneys wrote in their filing.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours’ notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.

“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s lead attorney in the Maryland lawsuit against the Trump administration, said in a statement Saturday that the government is trying to use the immigration system to punish his client by “attempting to send him halfway across the world, to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not even speak the language.”

The findings, released Sunday, reflected striking emotional reactions to immigration enforcement.
I don’t usually see that kind of extreme fervor on a poll response.” The poll found that 69% of respondents disapprove of the way immigration enforcement is being carried out in the state.
The question comes as immigration agents have carried out raids using face coverings, unmarked cars and while wearing casual clothing.
They also split on questions about due process, birthright citizenship and immigration enforcement in sensitive locations.","Most California voters strongly disapprove of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies and believe that raids in the state have unfairly targeted Latinos, according to a new poll.

The findings, released Sunday, reflected striking emotional reactions to immigration enforcement. When voters were asked to describe their feelings about news reports or videos of immigration raids, 64% chose rage or sadness “because what is happening is unfair.”

Among Democrats, 91% felt enraged or sad. Conversely, 65% of Republicans felt hopeful, “like justice is finally being served.”

Such divisions were consistent across 11 questions about the administration’s overall immigration strategy and specific aspects of the way enforcement is playing out in the state, with divisions along partisan lines. The UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll was conducted for the Los Angeles Times.

Democrats almost unanimously oppose President Trump’s tactics on immigration, the poll showed. Most Republicans support the president, though they are not as united as Democrats in their approval.

“It was essential to show the strength of feelings because Democrats are strongly on the negative side of each of these policies,” said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Berkeley IGS Poll. “That struck me. I don’t usually see that kind of extreme fervor on a poll response.”

The poll found that 69% of respondents disapprove of the way immigration enforcement is being carried out in the state.

Among Democrats, 95% disapprove, as well as 72% of voters with no party preference or others not affiliated with the two major parties, whereas 79% of Republicans approve.

The poll was completed online in English and Spanish from Aug. 11-17 by 4,950 registered voters in California.

A question that showed the least unified support among Republican voters asked respondents whether they agree or disagree that federal agents should be required to show clear identification when carrying out their work. The question comes as immigration agents have carried out raids using face coverings, unmarked cars and while wearing casual clothing.

Some 50% of Republicans agreed that agents should have to identify themselves, while 92% of Democrats agreed.

G. Cristina Mora, IGS co-director and a sociology professor at UC Berkeley who studies race and immigration, helped develop the poll questions. She said the poll shows that Republican voters are much more nuanced than Democrats. They also split on questions about due process, birthright citizenship and immigration enforcement in sensitive locations.

“Republicans are much more fractured in their thinking about immigration across the state,” Mora said.

Mora said she developed the question about agent identification in response to the recent bill led by Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) that would require immigration officers to display their agency and name or badge number during public-facing enforcement actions, similar to police and other local law enforcement.

Padilla also spearheaded a letter last month to Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons seeking information about the agency’s policies regarding the identification of agents while on duty. ICE has justified the tactics by stating that agents are at risk of doxxing and have faced increased assault on the job.

“The public has a right to know which officials are exercising police power, and anonymous enforcement undermines both constitutional norms and democratic oversight,” Padilla and 13 other Democrats wrote in the letter.

Another poll question that garnered mixed support of Republicans asked respondents to agree or disagree with the statement, “ICE agents should expand immigration enforcement into schools, hospitals, parks and other public locations.”

Among Republicans, 53% agreed with that statement, though fewer than 1 in 3 agree strongly. Meanwhile, 94% of Democrats disagreed.

Shortly after Trump took office, his administration rescinded a 2011 memo that restricted immigration agents from making arrests in sensitive locations, such as churches, schools and hospitals. Since then, agents have been filmed entering locations that were previously considered off limits, putting immigrant communities on edge.

Schools in Los Angeles reopened this month with “safe zones” in heavily Latino neighborhoods and changed bus routes with less exposure to immigration agents. An 18-year-old high school senior, Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, was walking his family’s dog in Van Nuys when he was taken into federal immigration custody.

Mora said the varied responses illustrate how California Republicans view the Trump administration’s immigration tactics with “degrees of acceptability.” They might feel strongly that immigrants with violent criminal histories should be deported, she said, but the takeover of MacArthur Park, when a convoy of immigration agents in armored vehicles descended there in a show of force, or the enforcement actions outside of public schools “might have been a step too far.”

Mike Madrid, a GOP political consultant who wrote a book about how Latinos have transformed democracy, said the split among Republicans is consistent with national polling. The trend is problematic for Trump, he said, because it means he is losing big swaths of his base.

“This is becoming viewed as overreach more than it is immigration control,” he said. “The idea sets a frame for it, but the actual implementation is widely unpopular.”

Republicans were largely united in response to other questions. Asked about the Trump administration’s proposal to do away with birthright citizenship — which confers citizenship to all children born in the U.S. regardless of their parent’s legal status — 67% of GOP respondents approved, and most of them strongly approved. By contrast, 92% of Democrats disapproved, and as did seven in 10 respondents overall.

Mora said she was surprised by the fact that Latinos didn’t stand out as substantially more opposed to Trump’s actions than voters of other racial and ethnic groups. For example, 69% of Latino voters said ICE raids have unfairly targeted Latinos, just five percentage points higher than the 64% of white non-Latino voters who agreed.

“You would imagine Latinos would be through the roof here, but they’re not,” Mora said. She said this reminded her of research around the tendency for Latinos to individualize their experiences instead of seeing them as racially unjust.

Broadly, 72% of Latinos disagree with the way the Trump administration is enforcing immigration laws in California, while 25% approve and 3% have no strong opinion.

Among Latino voter subgroups, older men and third-generation (or beyond) women are the more likely to support the way immigration enforcement is being handled in California, with 38% of Latino men over age 40 in agreement compared to 11% of Latinas ages 18-39, although among both groups majorities disapprove.

Madrid said that’s consistent with national polling showing a decrease in support for Republicans among Latinos after record gains in the last presidential election. The question, he said, is whether Trump’s approval ratings among Latinos could regress substantially enough to flip control of Congress in the midterms.

Census surprises for Arizona Arizona has experienced census fallout in the past two decennial counts.
In September and November, voters in Arizona, Texas and Virginia are choosing permanent replacements to Democratic representatives who died earlier this year in left-leaning districts.","President Donald Trump has proposed a mid-decade census excluding undocumented immigrants, potentially impacting congressional seat allocation.

Experts question the legality, logistics, and cost of such a census, citing constitutional and practical challenges.

Arizona could gain a congressional seat under this proposal, but the accuracy and impact on other states are uncertain.

Arizona could gain an extra congressional seat if President Donald Trump succeeds in implementing a mid-decade census, excluding illegal immigrants, but the cost, logistics and legality of the whole idea cast doubt it will happen.

The presidential proposal calls for an unprecedented effort to count only some U.S. residents, upending the practice of counting everyone and inviting an unsettling error rate that could yield results that might not deliver as many Republican seats as Trump presumably wants, experts say.

The results of a census that seeks to count immigrants — but not illegal ones — is untested, and recent history suggests Arizona, for one, could be blindsided by actual participation levels. Even so, an Arizona Republic analysis of various demographic scenarios suggests if the state would begin any undertaking, it is likely to pick up a 10th seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.

“I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,” Trump wrote in a social media post on Aug. 7. “People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.”

Apart from the mid-decade census proposal, the ongoing mid-decade redistricting playing out in Texas, California and perhaps other states is already giving the GOP a new edge in holding onto control of the House.

“The president I think is going through a political agenda with a lot of wishful thinking,” said Jeffrey Wice, a professor at the New York Law School and an expert on redistricting and census law.

It's an expensive idea

While mid-decade redistricting is permitted, though rare, an off-cycle census excluding people seems legally dubious to experts on the subject. Courts have affirmed counting everyone since the 14th Amendment that addressed citizenship and equal protection rights after the Civil War.

Sam Wang is a neuroscience professor at Princeton University who helped create the Princeton Gerrymandering Project that researches the outcomes of politically driven maps.

He called Trump’s proposal “a crackpot idea. First off, it’s unconstitutional to leave out people who are not citizens. Secondly, it’s logistically impossible. The Census Bureau takes a whole decade to get ready” for a decennial census.

“It would be a bridge to the 19th century,” Wang said.

Time and money pose other hurdles.

The 2020 census cost $14 billion and took a decade to plan, Wice said. Others noted the time it takes to design and execute a census, followed by apportionment — the process of reallocating House seats based on new population numbers — and concluding with a process of redrawing maps in all 50 states.

Kimball Brace was a member of the Census Bureau’s 2020 advisory panel and is president of the Virginia-based Election Data Services, which has provided technical assistance to Democrats for redistricting. He said states need granular data to redraw their maps that only a complete census, not an estimate, can provide.

“If he’s going to do something with estimates for the number of people in each county and try to claim that the way to look at this, well, you’ve got 3,000 counties and 435 districts. They’re not going to square up,” Brace said. “The way of generating estimates are real suspect, and in a short period of time, you’re not going to be doing a good job.”

Trump didn’t say whether the special census would be done ahead of the 2026 midterm elections or the 2028 presidential election, which would be just two years before the normally timed decennial census.

Congress approved the idea of a mid-decade census in the 1970s, said Margo Anderson, a history professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who has researched the census.

At the time, Congress recognized a need for more regular data than a decennial census could provide.

But the idea, which specifically ruled out using data for apportionment and required the count to be taken in years ending in five, never got funded. The mid-decade census idea eventually gave way to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which now provides extensive new demographic estimates every year.

Arizona stands apart from other states that could benefit from another population update in one key respect: It draws its political boundaries using an independent redistricting commission. In most cases, the states gaining seats use maps already drawn by Republicans.

The Republic considered Arizona’s relative standing using the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 state population estimates and subtracted the 2023 estimated illegal immigrant population as calculated by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.

The Republic also analyzed results using only U.S.-born citizens and another combining native-born citizens with naturalized citizens. Those scenarios illustrate how the results of any census could alter the results for congressional representation depending on demographic participation levels.

Red states likely would benefit from Trump idea

Trump’s preferred census is inherently speculative, in part because the illegal immigrant population is never precisely known or evenly distributed. Also, the Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigrants could discourage participation from legal immigrants or lead respondents to lie in their answers on citizenship.

Thomas Hoffeler, a now-dead Republican described by the New York Times as the “Michelangelo of gerrymandering,” urged the inclusion of a citizenship question in the census because he thought it would benefit the GOP. He urged the Trump administration to pursue it before his death in 2018.

Using the Census Bureau and Pew estimates, The Republic found that four Republican-leaning states would each gain a single seat: Arizona, Idaho, Ohio and Texas.

California would drop two seats and Illinois and New York would each lose one. All of them voted for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024.

Using the figures for natural-born citizens only and for naturalized citizens produced a wider range of possibilities.

Half the country — 25 states — could see their representation number changed by scenarios The Republic applied.

Florida, for example, would stand to lose two seats in a count using only U.S.-born citizens. It would gain a seat if everyone but unauthorized immigrants were counted, based on 2022 estimates. It wouldn’t gain or lose a seat using the 2023 estimate.

California could lose two, four or 10 seats depending on the criteria, easily making it the state with the most at stake.

In each case, Arizona’s estimated population was sufficient to gain an extra seat. Idaho is the only other state that would gain in each of those scenarios.

California, Illinois and New York would lose seats in every scenario.

Not just Texas: GOP controls more maps

The redistricting process that would follow any census also likely would benefit Republicans.

The states that could gain seats mostly use Republican-led redistricting processes.

Arizona, with nine House seats, is one of four states that use an independent redistricting commission. It is intended to create political maps that emphasize competitive political races as part of the considerations in drawing boundaries.

Idaho, which has two seats, uses a commission with partisan members.

Ohio and Texas use maps effectively drawn by GOP-led legislatures with Republican governors. They collectively have 53 House seats already.

By contrast, California uses an independent commission for its 52 House seats. Illinois and New York have maps drawn by Democratic-controlled governments and account for 43 House seats.

Even states that would not gain or lose a seat would likely have to reconsider their maps. Maps in Republican-drawn states outnumber the seats drawn by Democratic-led states.

An unprecedented mid-decade count

The Constitution calls for a census every 10 years to determine the number of seats in Congress. Its meaning then has shifted today, reflecting the end of slavery, the inclusion of all Native Americans and the 435-seat cap on the number of seats in the House since 1929.

The census is used to divide trillions in federal spending based on economic and demographic characteristics.

For congressional apportionment, every state gets one House member, and the remaining seats are divided using a complex formula that corresponds to population.

While a decennial census is mandatory, participation is always less than perfect, especially in the immigrant community, where language and cultural barriers can reduce participation.

A special census in line with Trump’s interests could be particularly fraught because of widespread anxiety about how immigrants are treated as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducts daily raids across the country.

It is unclear how the raids could skew participation in a census, even for those legally permitted in the country.

Arizona had an estimated 300,000 undocumented immigrants in 2023, according to the Pew Research Center. The state had 981,000 foreign-born residents in 2023, the Census Bureau estimates.

It suggests there are more than a half-million legal immigrants in Arizona whose participation could hinge on whether they trust an oddly timed census request in an era of abrupt removals.

Wang’s calculations suggest GOP-friendly states such as Texas and North Carolina could lose seats under Trump’s plan. In other scenarios, Texas could gain seats with districts made larger than currently used to include swaths of constituents who don’t count for apportionment purposes.

“It just doesn’t seem well thought out,” he said.

The same dynamic would play out in every state, but outreach would undoubtedly vary in politically red and blue states.

Census surprises for Arizona

Arizona has experienced census fallout in the past two decennial counts.

In 2010, the formal census count was tied to April 1, within days of passage of the polarizing Senate Bill 1070 immigration-enforcement law Arizona passed.

That law helped drive off countless immigrants, both legal and illegal. It also came as the state was still shaking off the housing bust.

Arizona’s final population count was lower than expected and varied from the Census Bureau’s estimate by the widest margin in the country. That impacted the expected allotment of federal grants for a decade.

Ten years later, amid a nationwide quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic, Arizona narrowly missed out on getting a 10th congressional seat from the 2020 census. Arizona did little to encourage participation; California spent millions trying to boost it.

Arizona’s eventual 64% response rate to the census was below the 67% national average. California’s response rate was nearly 70%.

In the end, both states missed their objectives in a count made far more difficult because of COVID.

Why do it at all?

Trump is looking at bolstering Republicans’ seven-seat majority in the House by other means as well.

He encouraged Texas to redraw that state’s Republican-controlled congressional map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections and years before the 10-year interval normally used. The Republican-controlled Texas Legislature passed a map Aug. 22 that is expected to net the GOP another five House seats next year.

Democratic-controlled California passed a redrawn map of its own that would offset the Texas changes, though that process requires voter approval in November.

Other states have weighed redrawing their maps.

Beyond that, four special elections later this year could cut into the Republican advantage in the House.

In September and November, voters in Arizona, Texas and Virginia are choosing permanent replacements to Democratic representatives who died earlier this year in left-leaning districts.

A vacant seat in a safely Republican district in Tennessee won’t be filled until after a December special election.

Trump’s real aim, Wice said, may be to soften the ground ahead of adding a citizenship question to the 2030 census, something the Supreme Court shot down in his first administration for the 2020 census.

“It would be almost impossible and unaffordable to try to replicate a full-scale decennial census,” Wice said, noting that planning for the 2030 census began in 2020. “This leads me to think … there is time now for the Census Bureau, if directed by the president or Congress, to add the citizenship question.”

Anderson said seeking the upper hand through redistricting is not new. Ohio, for example, redrew its maps six consecutive election cycles between 1878 and 1890 in a reflection of the political volatility of that era.

“It happened in periods of partisan stress and when the parties are very close, when elections are won by very tiny numbers,” she said.

Wice still thinks the idea of excluding anyone should be blocked by the legal history of the 14th Amendment.","https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/22/USAT/85770161007-20250821-t-221359-z-1943143473-rc-2-ybga-4-herk-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpcrime.JPG?crop=5440,3062,x0,y88&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-24 11:57:19.813649

Dana:

Hello, I'm Dana Taylor, and this is a special episode of USA TODAY's The Excerpt.

Law enforcement officers working in plain clothes or undercover is nothing new. What is new is that some officers are now hiding their faces behind masks and refusing to show identification. Following a surge in arrests by armed masked federal immigration agents in unmarked cars, some California Democrats are backing a new bill in Congress that would bar officials from covering their faces while conducting raids, unless the masks were required for their safety or their health. What's led to the rise of masked policing, and is this what law enforcement should look like in a democracy?

Here to dig into those questions and more is former FBI agent Mike German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. Thanks for joining me, Mike.

Mike:

Thanks for having me.

Dana:

In a recent social media post on X, the Department of Homeland Security took issue with proposed legislation in California, which would ban federal law enforcement from wearing masks. DHS claims that ICE agents are facing assaults and doxing. What are your thoughts on why some officers have made the decision to wear masks? Has there been any official guidance that says officers should be masking?

Mike:

I haven't seen official guidance going out, but I have seen DHS officials justifying the agents' use of masks, and basically giving a green light to that activity through their public rhetoric.

Dana:

And what are your thoughts on why some officers have made that decision for themselves?

Mike:

I think there are probably as many reasons as there are officers. I think one of the issues is that they have detailed federal agents from other agencies to do this kind of immigration work, and they're probably respected in their communities and want to maintain their reputation in the work that they do. So I think there's probably a little hesitation to be publicly linked to this kind of immigration enforcement actions that divert resources away from true, important law enforcement missions.

And I think part of it is to create terror in the community. I mean, masked law enforcement agents is a hallmark of police states, and particularly where you see masked agents not being clearly identified as law enforcement, not identifying the agency they work with, that actually creates a greater threat to law enforcement. These DHS officials are trying to justify it as an officer safety measure, but it's actually the opposite, that when the public or the person being arrested don't know and can't clearly identify you as a law enforcement agent, their inclination would be to resist, because you look like any other criminal that is trying to harm them.

And certainly for the public at large, when they see some altercation taking place, they may want to get involved to try to protect the person being attacked. And the threat to law enforcement goes up when agents aren't properly identified. That's why, as an FBI agent, when we went on a raid, we wore these jackets with bright yellow letters saying FBI, to make it very clear to everyone that we are law enforcement acting in official capacity. That's part of the protection that agents get.

Dana:

Are there risks with having officers from other agencies, as you said, being called to do work they may not have been trained to do?

Mike:

Significant risks, particularly because different agencies have different authorities, and the authorities that an FBI agent might have on a terrorism case will be different than the authorities ICE ERO agents have enforcing civil law. So putting a bunch of people together without very clear instructions, very clear guidance, and particularly guidance that's public so the public understands what's happening, is crucial. And a lot of this is about making sure there's still public confidence in law enforcement, because law enforcement can't operate where the public no longer trusts it to actually enforce the law, rather than to engage in some kind of misconduct or abuse.

Dana:

Is there danger here, especially in communities targeted by ICE, that there's no way of knowing whether the person behind the mask has a badge?

Mike:

Certainly, there's significant danger. It's dangerous for the person being targeted, because as we have seen, unfortunately, there are people who impersonate agents and try to use the natural deference that members of the public would give to somebody who is enforcing the law to exploit and victimize that person. So because that's actually a real thing now, it's natural for people to be afraid of somebody who's dressed up in militia gear, not properly identified as law enforcement, particularly when masked and not willing to show the badge, show the authority, either a warrant or some other legal authority to engage in the conduct. And we're also seeing a lot of very aggressive actions.

And what many studies, going back to the civil unrest during the 1960s and '70s, showed that when law enforcement engages in arbitrary or poorly targeted violence, that often creates more violence. In other words, if they attack a crowd indiscriminately, the crowd will become more violent. So it's a dangerous escalation that's occurring in a lot of these raids that aren't really following proper law enforcement protocols.

Dana:

What's the significance of some officers perhaps seeing the American public as a threat?

Mike:

That's a huge problem in a democracy. In a democracy, the officials who enforce the law are supposed to remain under democratic control. Their guidelines should be public, their activities should be closely overseen and capped by strong guidelines. But unfortunately, what we've seen, particularly since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, is a loosening of those kinds of guidelines, certainly in the federal system with the FBI where I used to work, but all across the country, with law enforcement taking on a greater role in federal law enforcement on task forces, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Forces, Safe Street Task Forces, the use of state and local law enforcement intelligence centers, called fusion centers, been a network of centers across the country, that this kind of activity is often done very secretively. And anything that's secret is threatening to a democracy. And because there's so little accountability, the public loses confidence in the police department, and loses confidence that they are actually working to protect public safety, rather than to engage in activities for improper purposes.

Dana:

There's no shortage of photos and videos of recent ICE raids. Social media allows for the proliferation of that and other police activity. Does this normalize masking? Is this something the public needs to see? What are your thoughts here?

Mike:

Unfortunately, masking does seem to be normalized, but I think it's less about the fact that there are cameras and more about law enforcement leaders okaying this kind of behavior. I used to be an FBI undercover agent. I know and respect that people working in particular roles need to protect their identity and their likeness. But they can make that choice and not participate. And that, again, is a leadership and a management position. If there's somebody who you don't want identified in public because of some important and dangerous undercover assignment, don't put that person on one of these task forces going out in public, engaging in activity that's likely to draw public attention.

Dana:

Mike, you previously worked undercover in white supremacist and militia groups. How might the current trend towards mass policing impact the work of real undercover agents?

Mike:

It's quite dangerous, and we saw this happening significantly during the 2020 protests, where these militia groups started dressing like soldiers, started dressing like police officers. Unfortunately, police officers were more and more also dressing like soldiers, with the bulletproof vests and the armor plates and fatigues and camouflage rather than normal police uniforms. The reason the militia groups were doing it was to identify with the police officers. They often claim to support Blue Lives Matter, and otherwise were pro-law enforcement. Now, that was never actually true, and certainly on January 6th, when a lot of the members of these militant groups went to the Capitol and attacked police officers, injuring more than 100 of them, their love for law enforcement was not genuine. So they're trying to act as if they are also bestowed with some sort of official authority to act against their political enemies, and that creates a very dangerous situation. Of course, there have been many cases of law enforcement officials associating with those groups, so not having clearly identified law enforcement creates the danger that the public will not know whether this person is acting in a legal or illegal capacity.

Dana:

What recourse do communities have to demand both transparency and accountability when federal officers conduct operations while masked and unidentified?

Mike:

Well, it's very important for our democratic processes to work, and make sure that not just your federal representatives, but your state and local representatives as well, understand that this is something that creates community harm. It creates dangers that otherwise wouldn't exist. The last thing law enforcement should be doing is engaging in actions that create a more lawless society. So it's up to these state and local leaders to make sure their police departments know what the expectation is, that it's up to the state and local police departments to make sure that, when the federal government and federal agents are operating in their territory, that they're doing it in an accountable manner.

Dana:

Are there any reforms you would prioritize right now to restore accountability in federal and local policing?

Mike:

Certainly having properly identified agents when they're going out in public, in situations where they might be making arrests or engaging in force, is critical. Now, again, there are plenty of studies about crowd control that go back to the 1960s and '70s that demonstrate safer ways to engage the public that is engaged in protest activity. So these are things that law enforcement knew in the 1990s when I was FBI agent. Somehow they seem to have forgotten that or are ignoring all that advice. But they have to seek public opinion about what it is they're doing, so that they understand why this activity is so harmful to our society.

As of mid-August 2025, the state had filed 36 suits against the administration, with a 37th added shortly thereafter, according to reporting from the Oregon Capital Chronicle. This pace—averaging five lawsuits per month since Trump’s January inauguration—dwarfs the six filed in the first year of his initial presidency, reflecting a more aggressive stance honed by years of partisan legal battles.

Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat who took office in 2023, has positioned his office as a bulwark against policies perceived to infringe on state rights and federal laws. In interviews, Rayfield has emphasized that decisions to sue hinge on whether administration actions harm Oregonians or violate statutes, as detailed in a July 31, 2025, Zoom briefing where he outlined criteria for litigation. This approach has seen Oregon join multistate coalitions, often led by Democratic attorneys general, targeting executive orders on immigration, environmental regulations, and voting rights.

Escalating Legal Confrontations and Multistate Alliances

One notable case, filed in April alongside Washington state, challenges a Trump executive order on election integrity, which critics argue undermines voting access and erodes public confidence in elections. The suit, announced by the Oregon Department of Justice, contends the order violates the Constitution and federal laws like the National Voter Registration Act. Legal experts, speaking to the Portland Tribune, describe this as part of a “new era” where states proactively combat perceived federal overreach, drawing on precedents from Trump’s first term.

The 37th lawsuit, lodged on August 18, targets the administration’s threat to withhold federal crime victim funds from states not cooperating with immigration enforcement. This action, as covered by oregonlive.com, highlights Oregon’s sanctuary state policies clashing with Trump’s immigration agenda, potentially affecting millions in funding for victim services. Rayfield’s team, including special counsel Dustin Buehler, has vowed continued action, stating in the Portland Tribune that if the administration “keeps skirting the law, we are going to keep suing them.”

Historical Context and Strategic Shifts

Comparing the two Trump presidencies reveals strategic evolution. During 2017, Oregon’s suits were reactive, often responding to travel bans and environmental rollbacks. Now, with a conservative Supreme Court and lessons from past wins—like blocking aspects of the 2017 Muslim ban—states are filing preemptively. Data from the Jefferson Public Radio shows Oregon partnering with over a dozen Democratic-led states in most cases, amplifying their leverage in federal courts.

This litigious fervor isn’t without costs. Experts estimate each suit drains state resources, potentially in the hundreds of thousands per case, though proponents argue the long-term protections for rights and environment justify it. Posts on X from users like legal analyst Laurence Tribe echo sentiments from past cycles, praising such actions as essential resistance, while conservative voices decry them as partisan lawfare.

Potential Outcomes and Broader Implications

Many of these cases could drag on for years, possibly reaching the Supreme Court, where Trump’s appointees hold sway. For instance, environmental suits challenge rollbacks on clean air standards, as noted in the Bend Bulletin, affecting Oregon’s timber and tech industries. Wins could set precedents limiting executive power, while losses might embolden further federal actions.

Industry insiders in legal and policy circles see Oregon’s strategy as a model for blue states, potentially reshaping federal-state dynamics. As Rayfield told reporters, per the Oregon Capital Chronicle, the focus remains on safeguarding Oregonians’ rights amid ongoing policy clashes. With more suits anticipated—on topics from reproductive rights to climate initiatives—the legal front lines of American federalism are set to intensify, testing the resilience of both state attorneys and the administration’s agenda.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-793d6bc1-4e4a-48d2-8561-47fbe6359c13.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 13:56:30.577397

Uganda’s latest deportation agreement under scrutiny

The Trump administration has deepened its migrant relocation deals with several African governments, and Uganda has emerged as a key partner.

ADVERTISEMENT

In a temporary agreement reached this August, Uganda agreed to accept third-country nationals deported from the U.S., specifically those denied asylum or unwilling to return to their home countries.

The deal excludes individuals with criminal records or unaccompanied minors, and Uganda favors deportees of African origin. The details of numbers and implementation timelines are still being worked out.

Officials in both capitals have presented the deal as a humanitarian measure, but critics say it exposes Uganda to dangerous security risks it may not be equipped to handle.

The Uganda arrangement follows on the heels of a similar pact with Eswatini, which drew global backlash after reports confirmed that individuals with serious criminal records, including violent offenders, had been deported there.

Human rights groups caution that the U.S. is exploiting smaller African nations with limited policing capacity, using them as dumping grounds for offenders it seeks to remove.

Melusi Simelane of the Southern Africa Litigation Centre (SALC) told Al Jazeera that Washington is deliberately targeting countries with weaker human rights safeguards, warning: “The US’s actions are exploitative and tantamount to treating the continent as a ‘dumping ground.’”

Rising concerns at home

Ugandan civil society activists have raised alarm over the implications of the deportation deal, warning that it could overwhelm fragile security systems and deepen public mistrust of the government.

The Associated Press reports that human rights lawyer, Nicholas Opio compared the arrangement to human trafficking, questioning the legal status of those being sent to Uganda. “Are they refugees or prisoners?” he asked.

“The proposed deal runs afoul of international law. We are sacrificing human beings for political expediency; in this case because Uganda wants to be in the good books of the United States,” Opio said.

“That I can keep your prisoners if you pay me—how is that different from human trafficking?” He added.

Activists caution that accepting suspected members of violent transnational groups such as MS-13 could destabilize local communities and create new security risks. “This is not simply about migration—it is about national security,” one Kampala-based activist warned.

Analysts add that the U.S. approach risks fueling resentment across Africa, where many governments already see such deportation deals as unequal arrangements that prioritize Washington’s interests over local safety.",https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/UMxktkpTURBXy9jNTFhZDEyODk1ZWQ1ZTRlNjc3NjQxZjM3NDFkMWNhNS5wbmeSlQMFAM0Ft80DN5MFzQSwzQJ2,N,,2025-08-24 08:56:24.535332

FORT MYERS, Fla. — Immigrants’ rights advocates filed a sweeping federal lawsuit Friday evening challenging Florida’s authority to detain people at the controversial “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, a sprawling and hastily constructed encampment in the Everglades. The case, M.A. v. Guthrie, seeks a writ of habeas corpus ordering the release of hundreds of people being held there and asks the court to declare Florida’s operations unlawful.

The facility, formally located inside Big Cypress National Preserve, has been described in court documents as a makeshift camp of tents and cages surrounded by alligators, snakes, and mosquitos, vulnerable to flooding and extreme heat. Florida officials have referred to it as “Alligator Alcatraz,” boasting that the harsh conditions would pressure people into abandoning their immigration claims. Governor Ron DeSantis said in July, “You’ll have a lot of people that will deport on their own because they don’t want to end up in Alligator Alcatraz”.

The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Florida, Community Justice Project, and the National Immigrant Justice Center. It argues that Florida is violating federal law by attempting to run its own immigration detention system under the guise of 287(g) agreements — a federal program that allows local law enforcement officers, after extensive training and certification, to assist ICE with narrow immigration enforcement functions. Attorneys contend the statute does not authorize state agencies to operate independent detention centers or to delegate immigration powers to private contractors.

“This facility has already become a disaster in the first few weeks of its operations, with mounting reports of disease, wrongful removals, and people being denied all kinds of basic rights,” said Spencer Amdur, staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead counsel. “The government needs to follow the law when people’s lives and liberties are at stake. It’s time for this failed experiment to end.”

According to the complaint, detainees at Alligator Alcatraz are being held without charges for weeks, are excluded from ICE’s online detainee locator system, and are often denied custody or bond determinations. Some people have disappeared from federal tracking altogether, leaving their families and attorneys unable to locate them. In many cases, detainees have been prevented from filing petitions with immigration courts, while others report being pressured to sign “voluntary” removal orders without legal counsel.

The lawsuit describes conditions at the camp as unsafe, unsanitary, and intentionally punitive. It says detainees are housed in tents that flood during summer rains and suffer constant mosquito infestations, sewage leaks, and extreme restrictions on access to clean water. Many report being allowed to shower only once every several days and denied drinking water except at mealtimes. Respiratory illnesses have spread throughout the camp, and detainees have been hospitalized for emergency medical issues. Some have been punished by being restrained outdoors for hours in the sun, exposed to swarms of insects.

One of the named plaintiffs, identified as M.A., has lived in the United States since 2018, is married to a U.S. citizen, and has five U.S.-citizen stepchildren. He entered the country on a visa and applied for asylum, receiving a work permit, Social Security card, and driver’s license. He was arrested outside his home in July and pressured to sign an English-only form he could not read, later told it was a voluntary removal order. Since being detained at the facility, he has been hospitalized twice and is now in a wheelchair. He has never appeared in ICE’s detainee locator system.

Amy Godshall, legal fellow and immigrants’ rights attorney with the ACLU of Florida, said Florida’s actions have created a crisis. “Florida has wasted hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to unlawfully detain people in this abusive immigration detention center. Not only have the conditions been abhorrent, but the detention itself is unlawful. People are being held without charge, cut off from their attorneys, and made invisible in the immigration system. Families cannot even find out where their loved ones are. This is a crisis created entirely by the state’s reckless decision to ignore federal law and invent its own immigration jail in the middle of the Everglades.”

Miriam Haskell, senior attorney and director of litigation at Community Justice Project, emphasized that immigrant communities are directly impacted. “Our immigrant communities have always been right about this: We are Floridians, too, and deserve the same respect, compassion and due process as anyone else in this state. Florida’s authoritarian experiment cannot continue unchecked, and we are confident the court will see that there is no lawful authority for Florida to operate this immigration facility.”

Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, called Florida’s effort unprecedented. “It is truly unprecedented for a state to claim authority to operate its own, independent immigration detention system. The lack of accountability and resulting deprivation at this remote and inhumane detention camp in the Florida Everglades is exactly why Congress has made it unlawful and directed only the federal government to have custody over noncitizens as they go through the immigration system.”

The lawsuit names a wide range of defendants, including the heads of the Florida Department of Corrections, Florida Highway Patrol, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida National Guard, Florida State Guard, and other state agencies. It also names Matthew Mordant, a private contractor employed by Critical Response Strategies who serves as the warden of Alligator Alcatraz. Florida has argued in other litigation that these officials “have legal custody over people detained at Alligator Alcatraz” and are responsible for its operations.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs are seeking a class action on behalf of all current and future detainees at the facility, which has a capacity of 3,000 people. The complaint asks the court to issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring Florida from detaining anyone at Alligator Alcatraz, followed by a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment that the state lacks legal authority to operate the detention center.

If successful, the lawsuit could shut down what critics describe as an unlawful and dangerous experiment in state-run immigration detention, one that advocates say has already inflicted irreparable harm on hundreds of people in its first weeks of operation.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, his defense attorneys told a court Saturday.

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail for the time being and then serve whatever sentence he would receive for pleading guilty, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

Later on Friday, “the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning — precisely when he must report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office — to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,” his defense attorneys wrote.

They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.

Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face the possibility of detention.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, free for now from jail, could be deported to Uganda. Here's what to know

The Trump administration plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined a plea deal involving deportation to Costa Rica, his defense attorneys told a court Saturday.

He was released from a Tennessee jail on Friday after his case attracted significant attention amid President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown when he was mistakenly deported in March.

Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

Abrego Garcia's attorney's court filings show the administration requested he appear at an immigration facility in Baltimore on Monday and could be deported again.

As his story takes yet another turn, here’s what to know:

Doctors in Gaza say patients' protruding ribs and bony limbs offer evidence of malnutrition

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Not long after Texas surgeon Mohammed Adeel Khaleel arrived at a Gaza City hospital in early August, a 17-year-old was brought in with gunshot wounds to both legs and one hand, sustained when he went to collect food at an aid site.

In the emergency room, Khaleel said he noted the ribs protruding from the teen's emaciated torso, an indication of severe malnutrition. When doctors at Al-Ahli Hospital stabilized the patient, he raised his heavily bandaged hand and pointed to his empty mouth, Khaleel said.

“The level of hunger is really what’s heartbreaking. You know, we saw malnutrition before, back in November, already starting to happen. But now the level is just, it’s beyond imagination,” Khaleel, a spinal surgeon on his third volunteer stint in Gaza, said in an interview.

On Friday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, the leading authority on global hunger crises, said for the first time that parts of Gaza are in famine and warned that it is spreading. For months, U.N. agencies, aid groups and experts had warned that Israel's blockade and ongoing offensive were pushing the territory to the brink.

In the 24 hours following the famine announcement, eight people in Gaza died of malnutrition-related causes, bringing the overall toll of such deaths during the war to 281, according Gaza's Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. A U.S. medical nonprofit working in Gaza says one in six children under 5 is affected by acute malnutrition.

Israeli strikes and gunfire kill 33 as Gaza City becomes focus of famine and a military offensive

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 33 Palestinians in Gaza on Saturday, including people sheltering in tents or seeking scarce food, local hospitals said as a famine in Gaza’s largest city puts new pressure on Israel over its 22-month offensive.

Israel's defense minister has warned that Gaza City could be destroyed in a new military operation perhaps just days away, even as famine spreads there.

Aid groups have long warned that the war, sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, and months of Israeli restrictions on food and medical supplies entering Gaza are causing starvation.

Israel has rejected the data-based famine declaration as “an outright lie."" Ceasefire efforts are on hold as mediators await Israel’s next steps.

Israeli strikes killed at least 17 people in southern Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to morgue records and health officials at Nasser Hospital. The officials said the strikes targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis.

Trump ran on a promise of revenge. He's making good on it

Donald Trump ran on a promise to use the powers of the government for revenge against those he believed wronged him. He now appears to be fulfilling that campaign promise while threatening to expand his powers well beyond Washington.

On Friday, the FBI searched the home of John Bolton, Trump’s first-term national security adviser-turned-critic, who last week in an interview called the administration “the retribution presidency.”

Trump's team has opened investigations of Democrat Letitia James, the New York attorney general who sued Trump’s company over alleged fraud for falsifying records, and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who as a congressman led Trump's first impeachment. The Republican administration has charged Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., over her actions at an immigration protest in Newark, New Jersey, after arresting Mayor Ras Baraka, also a Democrat. Under investigation, too, is former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a candidate for New York City mayor.

Trump has directed prosecutors to investigate two other members of his first administration: Miles Taylor, who wrote a book warning of what he said were Trump’s authoritarian tendencies, and Chris Krebs, who earned the president’s wrath for assuring voters that the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden, was secure.

The actions look like the payback Trump said he would pursue after being hit with four separate sets of criminal charges during his four years out of office. Those included an indictment for his effort to overturn the 2020 election that was gutted by the U.S. Supreme Court, which said presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts while in office.

Texas redistricting fight shakes up battle lines for both parties in key US Senate race

HOUSTON (AP) — Just as Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Colin Allred was holding a town hall near the Mexican border as part of an “unrig Texas” campaign tour, the state’s Democratic fundraising powerhouse Beto O’Rourke rallied support in Austin for lawmakers who left the state to delay a redistricting plan led by President Donald Trump. The next morning, one of those wayward lawmakers, James Talarico, stood in the pulpit at former President Barack Obama’s old church in Chicago to say he and his fellow legislators had simply taken a leap of faith.

All three Democrats are either declared or potential contenders for the Senate seat on the ballot in next year's midterm elections. In what would typically be a quiet period in Texas politics, Republicans have roiled the state's 2026 Senate campaign with their rush to redraw congressional maps to give Trump more allies in Congress. The turmoil impacts contenders in both parties and gives Democrats fresh hope that they can capture a long-elusive seat, where an upset would dramatically improve their chances of regaining Senate control in Washington.

For Democrats, the GOP power play offers a new way to stand out as fighters against Trump and his Make America Great Again movement.

For Republicans, including incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, it’s a Trump loyalty test. Cornyn publicly called for involving the FBI in rounding up the defiant Democrats. His main primary challenger, state Attorney General Ken Paxton, used his current office to ask state courts to remove departed lawmakers from office and to jail O’Rourke for raising funds to support the Democratic legislators. The clash has also been a welcome distraction from recent questions about Paxton's private life.

Trump, meanwhile, had his eyes on the U.S. House when he openly prodded Texas Republicans this summer to give him five more GOP seats in a state he won handily last year. He hoped to avoid losing a slim House majority, as he did during his first term in 2018.

Fed Chair Powell faces fresh challenges to Fed independence amid potential rate cuts

WASHINGTON (AP) — Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House's demands.

For months, Powell has largely ignored President Donald Trump's constant hectoring that he reduce borrowing costs. Yet on Friday, in a highly-anticipated speech, Powell suggested that the Fed could take such a step as soon as its next meeting in September.

It will be a fraught decision for the Fed, which must weigh it against persistent inflation and an economy that could also improve in the second half of this year. Both trends, if they occur, could make a cut look premature.

Trump has urged Powell to slash rates, arguing there is “no inflation” and saying that a cut would lower the government’s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.

Powell, on the other hand, has suggested that a rate cut is likely for reasons quite different than Trump's: He is worried that the economy is weakening. His remarks on Friday at an economic symposium in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming also indicated that the Fed will move carefully and cut rates at a much slower pace than Trump wants.

Pope affirms right of people to return home after unjust exile in meeting with Chagos refugees

ROME (AP) — Pope Leo XIV strongly affirmed the right of people to return to their homes after an unjust exile, issuing the message during an audience Saturday with refugees from Chagos, the Indian Ocean archipelago that is home to the strategic U.S.-U.K. military base.

“No one can force them into exile,” history's first American pope said.

Leo met with a delegation of about 15 refugees from Chagos, some 2,000 of whom who were evicted from their homes by Britain in the 1960s and 1970s so the United States could build a naval and bomber base on the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia.

Displaced islanders fought for years in U.K. courts for the right to go home. In May, Britain and Mauritius signed a treaty to hand sovereignty over the islands to Mauritius that allows resettlement, while still ensuring the future of the base.

Leo told the refugees he was “delighted” the treaty had been reached, saying it represented a “significant victory” in their long battle to “repair a grave injustice. He praised in particular the role of the Chagossian women in peacefully asserting their rights to go home.

Texas Gov. Abbott says he'll swiftly sign new maps on his desk that will boost GOP in 2026

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday promised to quickly sign off on a new, Republican-leaning congressional voting map gerrymandered to help the GOP maintain its slim majority in Congress.

“One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate and is on its way to my desk, where it will be swiftly signed into law,” Abbott said in a statement.

Texas lawmakers approved the final plans just hours before, inflaming an already tense battle unfolding among states as governors from both parties pledge to redraw maps with the goal of giving their political candidates a leg up in the 2026 midterm elections.

In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has approved a special election to take place in November for residents to vote on a redrawn congressional map designed to help Democrats win five more House seats next year.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has pushed other Republican-controlled states, including Indiana and Missouri, to also revise their maps to add more winnable GOP seats. Ohio Republicans were also already scheduled to revise their maps to make them more partisan.

Texas lawmakers give final approval to redrawn congressional map favoring GOP, send to governor

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Senate gave final approval to a new, Republican-leaning congressional voting map early Saturday, sending it to Gov. Greg Abbott for his signature.

President Donald Trump has pushed for the map to help the GOP maintain its slim majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. It has five new districts that would favor Republicans.

Abbott, a Republican, is expected to quickly sign it into law, though Democrats have vowed to challenge it in court.

The effort by Trump and Texas’ Republican-majority Legislature prompted state Democrats to hold a two-week walkout and kicked off a wave of redistricting efforts across the country.

BBC News, Bristol

A group of anti-immigration protesters have been outnumbered by counter protesters as they demonstrated against hotels housing asylum seekers.

About 50 people planned to meet in Castle Park in Bristol to oppose the government scheme and march through the city, but they were met by about 250 counter protesters.

Avon and Somerset Police said there were ""moments of disturbance"" but that the protests went without ""significant incident"".

One woman was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker, and officers detained other individuals at points, but they have all been de-arrested.

The main police operation has been stood down, but there will be a presence in the city centre until 07:00 BST on Sunday and a dispersal zone, which allows officers to move on groups or individuals causing, or likely to cause, harassment, alarm, or distress to others.

Mounted police held the two sides back from each other for almost two hours near The Galleries car park, blocking the road during confrontational scenes.

None of the officers suffered serious physical injury or needed hospital treatment, but the force said there will be enquiries after reports of assaults on them.

Chief Insp Keith Smith said: ""Our priority today has been to enable lawful peaceful protest for both groups.

""Our officers have dealt admirably with a really challenging situation, and I'd like to take the opportunity to thank them for their professionalism.

""While there were moments of disturbance, we're pleased to say the two protests have passed without significant incident.""

He explained the force had worked with the city council to try and minimise disruption to the public and thanked people for their patience. There was a road closure, but that has been lifted.

Bristol City Council said it has no plans to challenge the government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers in the city.

Councillor Tony Dyer, leader of Bristol City Council, said: ""Bristol is a long-established place of sanctuary. We are a diverse city and are proud to welcome and provide safety for people seeking sanctuary from a wide range of backgrounds.

""As a City of Sanctuary, we will continue to support and show compassion to people when they need it most.""

He added: ""Our focus is on working collaboratively to improve conditions for people seeking sanctuary and fostering compassionate and resilient communities in Bristol.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/990b/live/c1260e00-8024-11f0-b1b6-55b80ab19c47.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 08:56:36.357694

Wired magazine has interesting coverage on the uptick of cellphone searches at the U.S. border.

Apparently CBP searched 14,899 devices between April and June, which would be nearly 5K a month! The previous record was 12,766 devices searched January through March in 2022. (Thanks, Biden.)

Most of the recent searches have been ""basic"" as opposed to ""advanced."" Here's Wired's explanation:

Basic searches can involve a border agent manually scrolling through someone’s phone and inspecting its contents. This means an agent may be able to find some information on a device but may not have the time or ability to conduct a deep inspection of what is included in messages or buried in photo reels. Meanwhile, advanced searches involve a much more intrusive approach: connecting forensics tools to the device to extract huge reams of data.

CBP claims unrestricted authority to search electronic devices--whether they belong to citizens or noncitizens. As the ACLU advises, it's best to travel across borders with ""as little data and as few devices as possible.""

He expressed his gratitude to the people who had not abandoned him.

“Thank you for everything,” Mr. Abrego Garcia told his older brother, Cesar, as he wept in his arms.

But the celebration of his homecoming has been muted. For Mr. Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old immigrant who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and returned to the United States in June, the odyssey is not over: The federal government has threatened to deport him to Uganda, his lawyers said. So for now, he and his family are keeping a low profile, with Mr. Abrego Garcia required to use an ankle monitor and largely staying out of the limelight.

Mr. Abrego Garcia, who was in the United States without permission, became a defining face of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration when he was deported, prompting outrage from immigrant rights advocates and heightening fear and anxiety among other immigrants in the country.

A sheet metal worker, Mr. Abrego Garcia had been living for years in Prince George’s County in Maryland when he was sent to El Salvador, alongside more than 260 detainees, with no due process. He was sent back in June to face human smuggling charges in Tennessee, where he was held in jail until Friday. His lawyers said the Trump administration’s threat to deport him to Uganda was an attempt to “coerce” him into a guilty plea in the smuggling case.

It was not immediately clear exactly why the Trump administration chose Uganda as the place to potentially send Mr. Abrego Garcia. Initially, federal prosecutors had said that if Mr. Abrego Garcia pleaded guilty to his charges and agreed to stay in custody until Monday, they would send him to Costa Rica, where they said he could live safely, after whatever sentence he is given in that case. But after his lawyers did not agree to keeping him in jail beyond Friday, the administration said if he does not accept their plea deal by Monday, they would start the process to deport him to Uganda.

The property at 310 E. Knapp St. is owned by the Milwaukee School of Engineering but will remain in use by the federal government through at least April 2026, with options to extend through 2028, said JoEllen Burdue, the college’s senior communications director.

“We do not have immediate plans for the building and will reevaluate next year when we know whether or not the government wants to extend the lease,” Burdue said.

The lease was originally scheduled to expire in April 2025.

With a new ICE facility under construction on the city’s Northwest Side, the downtown lease extension raises the possibility that the federal government is expanding local immigration infrastructure or enforcement. This would be consistent with other forms of expansion in immigration enforcement, statewide and nationally.

“I’m upset and concerned about what this means for my immigrant constituency. For my constituents, period,” said Ald. JoCasta Zamarripa, who represents the 8th District on the South Side.

Immigration infrastructure

The Knapp Street property is used by ICE as a field office for its Enforcement and Removal Operations, according to ICE.

This includes serving as a check‑in location for individuals under ICE supervision who aren’t in custody and a processing center for individuals with pending immigration cases or removal proceedings.

According to a Vera Institute of Justice analysis, the number of people held at the Knapp Street location has been increasing.

The Vera Institute is a national nonpartisan nonprofit that does research and advocates for policy concerning incarceration and public safety.

The most people held by ICE at a given time at that Knapp Street location during the Biden administration was six. On June 3, 22 people were held there – also exceeding the high of 17 during President Donald Trump’s first administration, according to data from Vera Institute.

The office generally does not detain people overnight but can facilitate transfer to detention centers that do.

The functions carried out at the Knapp Street office mirror those planned for the Northwest Side facility.

City records show the West Lake Park Drive property will be used to process non-detained people as well as detainees for transport to detention centers.

The records also state that the property will serve as the main southeastern Wisconsin office for immigration officers and staff.

The U.S. General Services Administration, the federal government’s real estate arm, initially projected the new site would open in October. However, a spokesperson said there was no update and did not confirm whether that timeline still stands.

Neither ICE nor the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, responded to NNS’ requests for comment.

Rise in immigration enforcement

As local immigration enforcement grows, so does enforcement throughout the state and the rest of the country.

Nationally, the number of immigrants booked into ICE detention facilities increased in less than a year – from 24,696 in August 2024 to 36,713 in June 2025, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse is a nonprofit at Syracuse University that conducts nonpartisan research.

Not only are more people being detained, but they are being detained for longer, said Jennifer Chacón, the Bruce Tyson Mitchell professor of law at Stanford Law School.

A July 8 internal memo from ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons instructs agents to detain immigrants for the duration of their removal proceedings, effectively eliminating access to bond hearings.

Eighty-four of 181 detention facilities exceeded their contractual capacity on at least one day from October 2024 to mid-April 2025, according to a July report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The Dodge County Jail, which ICE uses to detain people apprehended in Milwaukee, is one of the facilities that exceeded its contractual capacity. On its busiest day, it held 139 individuals – four more than its 135-bed limit.

In addition to Dodge County, Brown and Sauk county jails have also entered into agreements with ICE to house detained immigrants, according to records obtained by the ACLU of Wisconsin.

ICE’s unprecedented budget

Noelle Smart, a principal research associate at the Vera Institute, notes that it remains unclear whether increased immigration enforcement drives the need for more detention infrastructure or expands to catch up with more infrastructure.

But, Smart said, with ICE’s unprecedented new budget, the question of which one drives the other becomes less relevant.

Trump’s proposed ICE budget in 2025 was $9.7 billion – a billion more than ICE’s 2024 budget. An additional $29.85 billion was made available through 2029 for enforcement and removal as part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“We know this administration intends to vastly increase the number of people subject to arrests and detention, and we expect to see increases in both given this budget,” Smart said.

“The United States must not turn a blind eye to refugees who have suffered political, religious and other persecution,” said Eleanor Acer, Senior Director for Global Humanitarian Protection at Human Rights First. “The freeze on refugee admissions and the misuse of refugee resettlement for white Afrikaner migration have left thousands stranded in danger—facing violence, family separation, and prolonged uncertainty. Afghan refugees left stranded in Pakistan and other places face escalating risks of return to Taliban persecution. Refugee resettlement is not only a lifeline—it is essential to U.S. national interests, easing pressures on frontline host countries, and promoting stability. The Trump administration should honor U.S. commitments and save lives by prioritizing resettlement of refugees who face real dangers of persecution, including those in the U.S. resettlement pipeline who have been left stranded at risk for many months now. The last thing the administration should do is play politics with a program that is needed to save the lives of people who worked with and trusted the United States.”

Human Rights First urges the United States to relaunch a strong resettlement initiative for refugee populations including:

Afghan refugees in danger of Taliban persecution including family members of U.S. servicemembers, refugees with ties to the U.S. military or mission, journalists, women and girls, refugees at risk of religious persecution, and human rights advocates.

Nicaraguans targeted due to their political dissent or religious views, often unsafe even after escaping to countries nearby.

LGBTQI+ refugees who fled their country yet remain trapped facing persecution, violence and other harms due to their sexual or gender identity in the country to which they fled.

In the letter, Pettersen requests information from DHS and ICE about recent enforcement actions, including where they occurred, who was targeted or detained, how operations were conducted, and whether agents followed established guidelines to protect families and sensitive community spaces.

According to Pettersen’s message, Chaffee is one of several communities across the country that have reported ICE activity involving masked agents, driving unmarked vehicles. They simply show up in communities with no warning to anyone, including county leadership or law enforcement.

Serious concerns have been raised by community members, local officials, and advocates, including the lack of transparency and government oversight of these operations.

In keeping with her long-standing focus on families, Pettersen added the impacts on families, including being afraid to go to school, work, or even seek medical care. She cited what occurred in aan ICE raid in 2019 in Mississippi, when children returned home to empty homes with no one to care for them.

“Across the country, ICE is terrorizing immigrant communities, conducting raids in secret, and pulling people off the streets into unmarked cars,” said Pettersen. “Unfortunately, now Chaffee County has confirmed multiple detentions, leaving our community paralyzed with fear and unanswered questions. If ICE is going to carry out their operations in our communities, then we deserve full transparency and accountability for what happened in Chaffee County – and we need it now. I’ll continue to exercise my Congressional oversight authority to get the answers we are owed.”

The full text of Pettersen’s letter, in which she asks several important questions, is below:

Dear Secretary Noem and Acting Director Lyons:

I write to express my deep concern about the immigration raids that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted in Chaffee County, Colorado. These raids have created widespread terror in immigrant communities.

While local law enforcement did not assist ICE in the immigration enforcement activity in Chaffee County, we know that immigration enforcement actions wreak havoc on communities and make it more difficult for state and local law enforcement to build and maintain trust with the communities they serve. According to a 2024 study by the CATO Institute, policies that increase information sharing between immigration enforcement and state and local law enforcement increased the targeting of Hispanic people for crime by 16 percent. In other words, these policies resulted in an additional 1.3 million crimes against Hispanic people over a two-year period. There is longstanding evidence that undocumented immigrants are less likely to contact the police if they have been the victim of a crime out of fear the interaction will result in immigration enforcement actions. It is for this very reason that many police chiefs and

There are an estimated 6.1 million U.S. citizen children who live in households with an undocumented family member. These children suffer tremendously when their parents or their friends’ parents are taken away. The fear of potential enforcement actions causes anxiety among children, hurting their ability to succeed in the classroom. In addition, the detention and deportation of a parent, has a profound effect on a child’s health. Children whose parents are detained and/or deported are likely to suffer from mental health issues including post-traumatic distress disorder, exhibit behavioral problems such as anxiety and withdrawal, and experience higher rates of poverty and diminished access to food.

Further, previous raids have resulted in serious harm to communities. Following raids in August 2019 in Mississippi, reports emerged of young children returning to empty homes. Sheriff’s deputies had to go door-to-door looking for kids who had no one to care for them. At the time, the local Sheriff said his agency would cooperate with the federal government if required to carry out mass deportations, but that these actions “would severely hurt this area of Mississippi” by diminishing trust between the Sheriff’s department and the community. Small businesses also reported a sharp decrease in sales.

In the interest of exercising proper Congressional oversight of DHS and ICE, I request that you immediately provide the following information:",https://arkvalleyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-07-at-11-30-08-U.S.-Representative-Brittany-Pettersen.png,N,,2025-08-24 05:57:22.389516

ET: This article has been updated with comment from an ICE spokesperson.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are not expected to be at schools in the nation's capital when classes kick off on Monday, acting director Todd Lyons recently told NBC News.

An ICE spokesperson told Newsweek in a statement Saturday that ""ICE is not conducting enforcement operations at or 'raiding' schools. ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children.""

The statement continued: ""If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened.""

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump has pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. The initiative has seen an intensification of ICE raids across the country, with thousands of people having been swept up, arrested, and detained. Shortly after taking office, Trump threw out Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policies to limit where ICE arrests can take place, granting it the right to conduct raids in places of worship, schools, and hospitals.

The nation's capital has been in the limelight over the past few weeks after Trump said on August 11 that the city had been ""overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people."" He has deployed federal troops, officers and agents to Washington, D.C., as part of a crackdown on crime and homelessness.

What To Know

As the school year is kicking off across the U.S., the first day of class for D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) is on Monday, August 25. Lyons told NBC News in an interview earlier this week that ""day one, you're not going to see us,"" but noted that there might be circumstances when ICE officers may need to come to schools in the future.

Lyons said one of those circumstances might be to conduct safety and wellness checks on students, stating, ""We want to use our special agents and our officers to go ahead and locate these individuals. And if [there are] some we haven't, and the last known address was at a school, we just want to make sure that child is safe. If we have the opportunity to reunite that parent with that child, that's what we want to do.""

Lyons noted that under ""exigent"" circumstances would officers arrive at school, including ""something violent going on."" Nationwide, there have been several ICE arrests of parents at school property, including one at an Oregon preschool. In addition, some students, including a teenage boy in Los Angeles, have also been detained.

An ICE spokesperson told Newsweek in a statement Saturday: ""In many situations, the only last known address ICE has for a child is the last school they attended. In cases where a special agent visits a school, it would be for a wellness check on the child, not to make an arrest. These visits are designed to assess whether children are receiving appropriate care and ensure they are not being trafficked, exploited or abused.""

A Stanford University researcher reported in June that ICE ""raids increased student absences from schools because parents fear being separated from their children,"" finding ""recent raids coincided with a 22 percent increase in daily student absences with particularly large increases among the youngest student.""

ICE has repeatedly maintained that it's targeting people without proper documentation and criminal histories, and is working to expand its force with an addition 10,000 agents. The agency received billions in funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill.

What People Are Saying

An ICE spokesperson told Newsweek: ""ICE Homeland Security Investigations is dedicated to locating the more than 300,000 unaccompanied children that came in through the border under the last administration. Sadly, during those four years, many of these children who came across the border unaccompanied were placed with unvetted sponsors who were actually smugglers and sex traffickers.""

Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel said at a press conference this week: ""I think people who have that concern for themselves personally and for all of us who are concerned for them and their safety are making adjustments.""

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a previous statement shared with Newsweek: ""Under Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe. Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history.""

What Happens Next?

ICE is looking to significantly increase its force, offering signing bonuses up to $50,000, student loan payments, tuition reimbursement and starting salaries that can approach $90,000.

Reith said that immigrant rights activists have not seen many large-scale ICE raids in Arkansas so far.
Immigrants do seem to be targeted for traffic or other minor violations, and then are questioned about their legal status, Reith said.","Immigrant advocates are expressing concern after a video began circulating on social media earlier this week that showed federal agents questioning and detaining a family at a popular swimming spot in Pope County.

In the video, officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement and the U.S. Forest Service can be seen approaching the family at Long Pool Recreation Area, a park on Big Piney Creek that is managed by the Forest Service. The video shows the agents checking people’s IDs, asking about one man’s green card, and detaining at least two men and forcing them into a white van.

AIRE Arkansas, an immigrant rights activist organization, wrote in a social media post that everyone in the video had legal status and the people detained were eventually released.

A woman in the video tells ICE agents that one man being questioned has a work permit. An ICE agent responds by claiming that having a work permit does not mean that one has legal status in the U.S.

According to KATV Channel 7, a person familiar with the incident said agents came to Long Pool in response to a littering complaint, though it’s not clear why ICE would investigate supposed littering. Organizers with AIRE speculate that someone called the police on the family simply over the color of their skin and their speaking Spanish.

In the video, one woman asks why police are questioning them and not the other people in the park. A forest service officer says that the family was the closest in proximity to the parking lot, so officers approached them first. One officer says they were going to question others in the park as well, though the video does not show them doing so.

The video shows family members, including children, visibly distressed and upset over the situation, and it shows marks and cuts on the detained men’s wrists from the handcuffs after they were let go.

In a phone call Friday afternoon, Mireya Reith, executive director of the immigrant rights group Arkansas United, said the climate in the state and around the U.S. has grown more difficult due to President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. In this atmosphere, people might hear others speaking Spanish and call ICE on them.

Reith said that, unfortunately, it is legal to call immigration authorities on people. But, she added, it is still illegal for law enforcement to racially profile people. And it is legal for people to document interactions with ICE and other law enforcement — including by taking videos — especially if they think they were racially profiled.

Reith said that immigrant rights activists have not seen many large-scale ICE raids in Arkansas so far. Rather, the efforts seem more individually targeted and coordinated with state and local. Immigrants do seem to be targeted for traffic or other minor violations, and then are questioned about their legal status, Reith said.",https://arktimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-23-at-11.15.36-AM.png,N,,2025-08-24 05:57:25.845518

Well, I'm still talking. You can't keep us quiet and you can't take away our first amendment rights,” said Herzberg.

Herzberg's legal team writes that he suffered $150,000 in personal injuries.

“This case is about accountability. We hope to let these officers know that there will be a trial at the end of the road. It might be a bench trial, not a jury trial, but it will take place. They will be held accountable. And they will be asked to explain why they did what they did,” said Nate Haberman, an attorney for Underdog Law, who is representing Herzberg.

Haberman says they intend to sue, but that the letter is a requisite step before they can do so.

""Today is such a special day because, after 160 days, I am able to see my family again,"" Abrego Garcia said Friday through an interpreter.

However, the joy was short-lived as immigration officials informed his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda shortly after his release from a Putnam County, Tennessee, jail.

Abrego Garcia had previously turned down an offer to be deported to Costa Rica, where he would be accepted as a legal immigrant, in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges and staying in jail.

""The issue here is that Kilmar deserves full liberation,"" said Jossie Sapunar, the national communications director with CASA, an advocacy organization that has been supporting Abrego Garcia and his family. ""Kilmar deserves access to his rights, and nothing should get in the way of that.""

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to CECOT, a mega prison in El Salvador, in March. A Supreme Court order in April forced the Trump administration to bring him back to the U.S. in June.

That's when he was federally charged in Tennessee with human smuggling, to which, he pleaded not guilty and asked a judge to dismiss the case, saying it was a punishment for challenging his deportation to El Salvador.

The human smuggling charge stems from a 2022 traffic stop, when a Tennessee highway patrolman stopped the car Abrego Garcia was driving for speeding and suspected human trafficking. Abrego Garcia was not charged at that time.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue that the latest threat to deport him to Uganda is further proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

(AP) — Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, according to a Saturday court filing.

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday, after it was clear that the Salvadoran national would likely be released from a Tennessee jail the following day. Abrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family. Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

Abrego Garcia’s case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He has pleaded not guilty and has asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

“The government immediately responded to Mr. Abrego’s release with outrage,” the filing reads. “Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego’s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning.”

Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. Those fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland, which requires immigration officials to allow Abrego Garcia time to mount a defense.",https://foxsanantonio.com/resources/media2/16x9/1024/986/0x54/90/dd16ee44-5abd-4a58-8218-89707ee077f4-AP25234691293535.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 11:57:30.943136

In a filing, the lawyers asked courts to dismiss the case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia on grounds that it is a vindictive attempt to punish him for challenging his initial deportation to El Salvador.

The attempt to deport Garcia to far-flung Uganda in East Africa adds a dramatic new twist to a saga that become a test case for Mr Trump’s harsh crackdown on illegal immigration – and, critics say, his trampling of the law.

His lawyers’ filing was an addition to an earlier one asking judges to dismiss the case.

Word of the new press to deport him came a day after he was freed and allowed to go home to Maryland pending trial on human smuggling charges.

This followed a tortuous saga in which he was mistakenly deported to a notoriously rough prison in El Salvador, then returned to US soil only to be detained again.

A judge ordered his release on Aug 22 but the latest news means he might again be expelled, this time to Uganda under a new, harsh Trump administration scheme of sending undocumented migrants to distant, even war-torn countries where they know no one.

Abrego Garcia denies any wrongdoing, while the administration says he is a violent MS-13 gang member who smuggled other immigrants.

On Aug 21, when it became clear Abrego Garcia would be released the following day, government officials made him a plea offer: remain in custody, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, his lawyers said in the filing.

He declined the offer.

“The government immediately responded to Mr Abrego’s release with outrage,” the filing states.

“Despite... assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) representative informed Mr Abrego’s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning,” it added.

The case has been a messy tug of war.

The government admitted it had mistakenly sent him

to El Salvador’s notorious maximum security prison in March.

The US Supreme Court later ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia.

He was returned in June, and then quickly arrested and charged with trafficking undocumented migrants.

On Aug 22, he was released from prison in Tennessee on a judge’s order.

At that point he had not seen his family in more than 160 days.

The case has become emblematic of Mr Trump’s rough crackdown on illegal migration.

Right-wing supporters praise the Republican president’s toughness, but legal scholars and human rights advocates have blasted what they say is a haphazard rush to deport people without even a court hearing, in violation of basic US law.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not notify the sheriff's office nor the man's public defender before the arrest, sparking concerns over safety and a potential for ""blue on blue"" incidents

ASHEVILLE – As a Buncombe County man walked from the county courthouse to his car in the late morning Aug. 21, armed officers working with ICE pulled up in an unmarked SUV and grabbed him in the middle of a crosswalk, multiple officials confirmed to the Citizen Times.

The sudden arrest created safety and transparency concerns, said Buncombe County Sheriff Quentin Miller and attorneys familiar with the incident. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not notify the sheriff’s office nor the man’s public defender, Timothy Henderson, before the arrest, they said.

The arrest comes amid a sharp rise in ICE activity across the country and in North Carolina since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, with similar uncoordinated arrests outside the Mecklenburg County courthouse, according to reporting by the Charlotte Observer.

James Mills, an Asheville private defense attorney, was standing outside the courthouse on College Street, around 11 a.m. when an unmarked, gray Ford Exhibition — with 30-day tags — stopped at the median in the westbound lane, he told the Citizen Times.

Mills estimated it took “less than 3 seconds” for three officers “decked out in tactical gear” to jump out of the car and reach the man, identified by his public defender as Jediael Amaya Sanchez, 46.

At least one officer carried a ""tactical AR-15"" and two wore bulletproof vests, according to Mills. One vest displayed “U.S. Marshals” and another said some form of “police."" A photo of the interaction shows two officers in ballcaps and holstered handguns.

Standing about 20 feet away, Mills said he was not close enough to see whether the officers showed any other identification.

“It was tactical law enforcement coming after people,” Mills said. Within 4 minutes, the officers drove off with Amaya Sanchez in the unmarked SUV, he estimated.

Sheriff: could have escalated to 'blue on blue' incident

Amaya Sanchez appeared in court Aug. 21 for a hearing on a civil complaint filed Aug. 11, from someone who requested a no-contact order be entered against him, court records show.

A bailiff was asked to escort Amaya Sanchez to his car, after he expressed concern that the person who filed the complaint would find or harass him at the parking garage as she had done before, according to Henderson.

Mills said the bailiff appeared confused when the officers jumped out of the SUV, but backed away as the officers took Amaya-Sanchez.

Sheriff Miller, through his attorney, Jorge Redmond, said Aug. 22 that he was concerned about a possible “blue on blue” incident that can result from misidentification and poor communication.

A person with federal credentials had entered the courthouse and asked about courtroom locations but never notified local law enforcement before the arrest outside, Redmond said via email Aug. 22.

“As Sheriff of Buncombe County, ‘We are a community of We’ and it’s the responsibility of the Sheriff’s Office to make certain that all law enforcement actions conducted on or near the courthouse are done safely, transparently, and in coordination with our office for the safety of the community,” Miller told the Citizen Times via email.

A regional ICE spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Aug. 21 and 22.

Increase in ICE activity state- and countrywide

As the Trump administration works toward its goal to deport 1 million immigrants annually, ICE arrested 1,822 people in the North Carolina from Jan. 20 to June 26. That’s a 170% increase from the same time period in 2024, according to federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by North Carolina Public Radio.

ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons and Deputy Director Madison D. Sheahan have said the agency is targeting removal of violent criminals and the “worst of the worst.”

But in North Carolina, ICE is arresting fewer convicted criminals. In the first six months of 2024, under the Biden administration, 67% of people arrested had criminal convictions. In 2025, that percentage dropped to 46%. About 34% of those arrested this year had no criminal convictions.

Protests against the increased ICE actions have been taking places across the country the past year, including ""No Kings"" protests that drew large turn outs in Asheville and Hendersonville.

‘I don’t know where he is’

Alexa Velen Amaya received a rushed call on Aug. 21 from her father’s number.

“Agents came for me. I’m not sure how or why. They told me they are immigration. I don’t know where I’m being sent. I don’t know what their contact number is,” Velen Amaya told the Citizen Times Aug. 21 from her home in Texas.

She said all he could share is his nine-digit identification number. Since then, all her calls and texts to her father have been left unreturned.

“I’m frustrated. I’m not OK with this,” she told the CItizen Times by phone, her voice breaking with emotion.

Velen Amaya, 22, described her father as a generous man and a meticulous mechanic. He owns a car shop in Asheville, where he’s lived for over 20 years, after leaving Mexico in search of better living conditions. She said her dad is the type of person to offer his car, his clothes, his food, even his own mobile home, to anyone who needs it.

“My dad is always trying to do the right thing, according to his community. People like that are not the type of people you need to get out of this country,” said Velen Amaya, who lived in Asheville for 10 years.

Her biggest fear is that her father will get lost in the detention system. For the 24 hours after his arrest, Velen Amaya had no idea where her father was. An ICE database shows he was moved to a detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia, as of Aug. 22. Velen Amaya said she was not informed.

“He’s not the first case and he’s not going to be the last case, but I just want him to have justice,” she said.

Two weeks before ICE detained him, Amaya Sanchez was found not guilty in a Buncombe County jury trial. A man claimed that Amaya Sanchez had broken into his mobile home and assaulted him, according to his arrest warrant. A different person pleaded guilty to the crime in 2024.

After a five-day trial, a jury agreed Amaya Sanchez was innocent, records show. His only prior convictions were three traffic related charges and infractions, according to court records.

“We got a good result for a great guy. That should have been the end of the story,” Henderson told the Citizen Times Aug. 21.

The day the verdict was read Aug. 8, the man’s wife in the jury trial claimed Amaya Sanchez tried to run her over with his car in the parking deck outside the courthouse, records show. Two days later, she filed a no-contact order and a magistrate warrant, leading to Amaya Sanchez’s pending charges of assault with a deadly weapon and communicating threats.

In North Carolina, any citizen can initiate criminal charges through a magistrate. Henderson said he believes the accusation to be baseless. For Henderson, it represents a regular “abuse” of no-contact orders that drag “what are essentially neighbor disputes into a public forum.”

“He came to the courthouse seeking justice. He came to this courthouse to clear his name and that’s not enough,” Henderson said.

An additional benefit of the offer would be that Costa Rica is a Spanish-speaking country, like Abrego Garcia's native El Salvador.
He would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the brief.
However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.
""Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),"" it states.","U.S. immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, his defence lawyers told a court on Saturday.

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) notified his lawyers that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

Later on Friday, ""the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning — precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office — to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,"" his lawyers wrote.

They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.

Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face the possibility of detention. An additional benefit of the offer would be that Costa Rica is a Spanish-speaking country, like Abrego Garcia's native El Salvador. He would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the brief.

Abrego Garcia's case became a flashpoint in U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He has pleaded not guilty and has asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

""Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego's counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office Monday morning,"" the brief says.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

A Department of Homeland Security agent testified he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.

Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his lawyers, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours' notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defence. An email from ICE sent to lawyers at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.

""Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),"" it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7616325.1755952788!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/aptopix-deportation-error-abrego-garcia.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-23 22:57:03.208940

Up to 1,700 National Guardsmen are set to mobilize in 19 states in the coming weeks to assist the Department of Homeland Security with the administration’s nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration.

That operation was initially announced last month and is not linked to potential federal intervention in crime-plagued cities, a White House official told Fox News.

""This isn’t new nor is it tied to the President’s efforts to address violent crime in DC,"" the official said late Friday.

""DoD announced last month that National Guard troops would assist DHS with clerical support and other logistical tasks for processing illegal aliens at ICE facilities. It is separate from the federal interagency crime crackdown.""

Trump activated the National Guard in Washington, D.C., earlier this month as part of an effort to slash violent crime in the nation’s capital.

Touting the operation’s success — at least 465 arrests have been made — Trump has signaled he intends to broaden the D.C. mission to other cities. ""We’re going to make it safe, and we’re going to then go on to other places,"" he told federal agents and Guard troops Thursday at a D.C. patrol center.

On Friday, Trump added, ""I think Chicago will be our next. And then we’ll help with New York.""

The White House insisted that the operations are separate.

""The National Guard mobilizing to assist ICE processing with clerical and logistical tasks in several states is not the same as the President’s actions to stop crime in DC,"" the official said.

The deployment of 1,700 National Guardsmen was first announced on July 25 in a Pentagon press release. Their roles include collecting personal data, fingerprinting, DNA swabbing and photographing detainees so ICE agents can focus on enforcement.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASSIGNS MILITARY ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE DC CRIMES AMID FEDERAL CRACKDOWN

Under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, the use of federal armed forces for civilian law enforcement is generally prohibited. But the National Guard will operate under Title 32 Section 502F authority, which does not apply to Posse Comitatus.

At the request of DHS, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in July approved hundreds of additional forces for ICE support and switched existing approvals from Title 10 to Title 32 status.

""We understood ICE’s needs at that time to be more administrative in nature… as planning continued, working with our partners, it became clear more that ICE needed something different,"" a U.S. defense official told Fox News.

Meanwhile, 2,279 National Guard soldiers and airmen from Washington, D.C., and six states are already mobilized in the capital, having completed training, according to a Joint Task Force spokesperson.

The spokesperson described the figures as an ""estimate"" but said they are the most accurate available.

Under direct presidential authority, Guard members have been posted to monuments, checkpoints and traffic stops across all eight wards, with a mission of deterring crime and maintaining a visible security presence.

At Hegseth’s authorization, those Guard members can now carry weapons if needed. But unlike the states, where Guard forces fall under governors’ command, in D.C. they operate under direct presidential authority.

Although the Pentagon framed the mobilizations differently, as ""a support pillar to a nationwide crackdown on crime and illegal immigration,"" the White House argued that planning for National Guard activations in 19 states for DHS logistical support preceded Trump’s comments within the last 48 hours about replicating enforcement efforts seen in Washington, D.C., in other parts of the country.

""This isn’t new, nor is it tied to the President’s efforts to address violent crime in D.C.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29 and originally from El Salvador, has been charged in an indictment filed in federal court in Tennessee with conspiring to transport illegal immigrants into the US.

He was released from federal detention on Friday after being held since March, when he was arrested and then deported back to his home country by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials.

In a new filing to the Tennessee court on Saturday, Mr Garcia's defence lawyers said that immigration officials threatened the 29-year-old with deportation to Uganda earlier in the week.

According to the filing, while he was held in Putnam County Jail on Thursday, Mr Garcia declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges and remaining in prison.

After he left jail on Friday, ICE notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

That same day, the Trump administration ""informed Mr Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning - precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office - to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever"".

Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Mr Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face the possibility of detention.

Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin responded in a statement and said: ""A federal grand jury has charged Abrego Garcia with serious federal crimes... underscoring the clear danger this defendant presents to the community.

""This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury. Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people.""

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Mr Garcia's attorneys, said he would ""fight tooth and nail against any form of deportation to Uganda"" or nearby countries in Africa.

""It is preposterous that they would send him to Africa, to a country where he doesn't even speak the language, a country with documented human rights violations, when there are so many other options,"" he said. ""This family has suffered enough.""

However, Mr Sandoval-Moshenberg appeared to suggest that deportation to Costa Rica might be favourable for his client, saying: ""That's a pretty reasonable option, right? I mean, Costa Rica makes sense.

""It's a Spanish-speaking country. It's proximate to the United States. His family can visit him there easily.""

Mr Garcia, who lived in Maryland with his American wife and son, was deported to El Salvador under a controversial 18th-century law. He was then imprisoned in its notorious maximum security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).

This was despite an immigration judge's 2019 order granting him protection from deportation after finding he was likely to be persecuted by local gangs if he was returned to his native country.

Democrat senator Chris Van Hollen, who met Mr Garcia in CECOT, said the 29-year-old was ""traumatised"" by the experience.

The Trump administration admitted that deporting Mr Garcia was an ""administrative error"", but said at the time they could not bring him back as they do not have jurisdiction over El Salvador.

After eventually returning him to the US in June, the Trump administration detained Mr Garcia on criminal charges that were filed in May.

The criminal indictment alleges Mr Garcia worked with at least five co-conspirators to bring immigrants to the US illegally and transport them from the border to other destinations in the country.

Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, US President Donald Trump, vice president JD Vance and other officials claim Mr Garcia was a member of MS-13 - an international criminal gang formed by immigrants who had fled El Salvador's civil war to protect Salvadoran immigrants from rival gangs.

Abrego Garcia plans to return to Maryland, where he lived with his family prior to his March deportation.","The Trump administration may try to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda following his release from criminal custody, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official and a notice sent by government officials obtained by CBS News.

Hours after Abrego Garcia — who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year — was released from pre-trial detention in Tennessee on Friday, his attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda, the official said.

The notice said he may be deported to the East African country ""no earlier than 72 hours from now,"" not including weekends.

Earlier in the week, CBS News was first to report that Uganda had agreed to a U.S. request to accept deportees who are not its citizens, becoming the latest ""third country"" to strike a deportation agreement with the second Trump administration.

A native of El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months, before being returned to the U.S. and jailed while awaiting trial on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.

In a legal filing Saturday, Abrego Garcia's lawyers revealed that the Trump administration had offered their client a ""last-ditch"" plea deal that would see him sent to Costa Rica after the completion of his criminal sentence. They submitted in federal court a letter from a Costa Rican government official that said the Central American country had agreed to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and provide him legal status there.

But after Abrego Garcia declined that deal and was released from pre-trial detention, his lawyers confirmed they were notified by the Trump administration that he could face deportation to Uganda instead. Abrego Garcia was also directed to show up to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore on Monday morning. His lawyers said he has been told he has until then to accept the Costa Rica deal, or it will no longer be on the table.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers said the Uganda deportation threat bolsters their argument that the Trump administration's prosecution of their client is vindictive.

""There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,"" they wrote in the filing Saturday.

The Trump administration has indicated for months that if Abrego Garcia is let out of jail, ICE could detain him and seek his removal from the U.S. yet again.

In 2019, an immigration judge ruled that Abrego Garcia cannot be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country. The Trump administration said he was deported there anyway due to an ""administrative error.""

Still, the government could legally seek Abrego Garcia's deportation to Uganda or another ""third country"" other than El Salvador — a practice the Trump administration has increasingly used for undocumented immigrants in recent months.

Abrego Garcia plans to return to Maryland, where he lived with his family prior to his March deportation. Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled last month that the government must give him 72 hours' notice if it plans to initiate deportation proceedings. But she didn't prohibit the government from seeking his removal, writing that immigration agents ""may take whatever action is available to them under the law.""

""We understand how unsettling this report is and we stand with our community in our desire for ALL our students to be in a safe learning environment,"" Jurado wrote. ""Our teachers and staff remain ready to support our students and ensure a day of calm and learning.

""We encourage our parents and community to take care of one another and support one another during times of uncertainty like this. School communities should be sacred spaces where all students deserve to obtain a high quality education, and all families feel welcomed.""

Jurado reminded parents that ICE agents were not allowed on campus without a signed warrant. The San Diego Unified School District has a dedicated webpage to explain rights, regardless of immigration status: www.sdusdequity.com/protecting-students.

""At this time, there is no indication of any enforcement activity on our campus, and all students and staff are safe,"" Jurado wrote.

Patrick Divver, field officer director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in San Diego, said while the vehicles in the video were operated by ICE agents, they were not there for any operation at the school.

""At no time did ICE conduct enforcement activity on school grounds, nor did any officer exit their vehicle while briefly in the parking lot. Any suggestion otherwise is completely false,"" he told City News Service. ""ICE San Diego officers were conducting a targeted enforcement operation in the City Heights area when activists began harassing our officers. As a result, the officers pulled into the first available parking lot.

""The interference of activists in law enforcement operations creates unnecessary risks to themselves, the community, and our officers. These actions hinder our ability to remove individuals who pose a threat to public safety and contribute to misinformation that endangers everyone involved.""

Members of the San Diego Self-Defense Coalition, Union del Barrio and Association of Raza Educators, who responded to reports of the vehicles around 6:40 a.m. on Friday, shouting warnings to nearby communities members about an immigration action were planning to host a news conference outside the school at 4 p.m. to condemn ICE actions at schools.

""Immigration and Customs Enforcement has continuously said they are not conducting immigration enforcement actions on school properties, and today's actions contradict their statements,"" the activist groups wrote in a joint statement. ""We condemn the campaign of terror that has been unleashed in migrant working-class communities and the targeting of families with school aged children in and around school facilities.""

Earlier this week, ICE arrested a man near Park Dale Lane Elementary School in Encinitas while on his way to work.

Encinitas Union School District officials confirmed the man's daughter is a student in the district.

""We are alarmed and disturbed by this event and its impact on children and families,"" a letter from the district to families said.

The immigration agencies sent KPBS a statement Wednesday night confirming the arrest and said the man was undocumented and from Guatemala. ICE said in the statement the man was alone in the car when he was stopped and that the woman and child seen in the video arrived at the scene as the arrest was taking place.

""ICE San Diego finds it unfortunate that an individual chose to insert a child into an active law enforcement situation,"" the statement read, before criticizing statements released by public officials such as ""before the facts of this case were fully known.""

Earlier this month, ICE agents arrested a parent outside Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista during the morning drop-off period. Cell phone footage captured by bystanders and posted online showed federal agents approaching a vehicle on the street.

Divver said in a statement that a woman who had been ordered deported in absentia by a San Diego immigration judge in 2022 was arrested.

""The arrest was part of ICE's ongoing enforcement efforts and was resolved promptly, safely and not on the school grounds. The school was not involved in the incident, and there was no impact on students, staff or the school premises,"" Divver said.

The arrest prompted Chula Vista Elementary School District Superintendent Eduardo Reyes to inform families and staff in a letter that protocols were in place preventing unauthorized access to schools and limiting law enforcement officials from interacting with students unless there's an active emergency or warrant.

""We understand this may cause concern, and we want to reassure you that our schools remain safe spaces for all students,"" Reyes wrote.

Reyes recommended that families create a plan for the district to care for their children ""in the event that you are unable to pick them up or drop them off due to unforeseen circumstances.""",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9b76b83/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F13%2F4a%2F14ff509e45cfa39bf3825e7b1d25%2Fap25027710663013.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 22:57:52.213476

Since June 23, the majority of flights operated by the Coast Guard C-27J Spartan fleet — at least 263 flights — are likely to have been for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), transferring immigrants to and from ICE’s nexus of detention centers in Alexandria, La., Harlingen, Texas, and the Florida Everglades camp known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” according to an analysis of public flight data.

On August 13 and August 22, Rolling Stone watched as federal agents loaded shackled immigrants onto Coast Guard aircraft in Baltimore.

The Coast Guard’s larger propeller aircraft, the HC-130H Hercules and HC-130J Super Hercules, also appear to be operating ICE flights, though to a lesser degree. Flight data for the C-130 fleet show at least eight flights to and from Alexandria or Harlingen since late June.

Like federal emergency funds being used for immigrant detention centers, and agents across the federal government being directed to snatch up delivery drivers in their militarized takeover of Washington D.C., the Coast Guard flights are yet another example of the Trump administration funneling vast federal resources toward its mass deportation machine.

“A Coast Guard C-27 conducted a mission today at the request of ICE and landed at BWI airport,” a Coast Guard spokesperson says, explaining: “The Coast Guard continues to surge assets and leverage its unique capabilities to protect America’s borders, territorial integrity and sovereignty by assisting with the national transport of aliens to designated locations where the Department of Defense will transport the aliens internationally.”

The spokesperson adds that “three USCG aircraft are currently being used” for ICE, which is consistent with the flight data for August 22. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment. ICE deferred to DHS.

“It seems like a misuse of Coast Guard assets to me,” says Tom Cartwright, the retired JPMorgan executive who has been tracking ICE flights since 2020. “And you have to wonder why it’s been kept so quiet.”

The Coast Guard, which is part of DHS, has a wide-ranging purview protecting U.S. maritime interests, which includes search-and-rescue missions, disaster response, and enforcing fishing laws. It also does drug and migrant interdiction, which generally means surveilling and intercepting suspected smuggling vessels in the water.

Coast Guard aircraft have been used for a handful of ICE flights in the past, but hauling prisoners across the country is far afield from its normal duties — particularly for the C-27, which until recently was primarily used for search and rescue.

The C-27 missions follow a similar pattern, leaving their stations in Clearwater, Fla., or Sacramento, Calif., flying to the ICE hubs of Alexandria or Harlingen, and spending the next week flying out-and-back trips to midsize cities like Baltimore, Cincinnati, Jacksonville, Kansas City, and Tampa — “NFL cities,” as one activist, “JJ in DC,” describes them — where ICE has been active. Of eight Coast Guard C-27s that have operated since mid-June, all but one appears to have been dedicated to ICE flights. They have landed at the tent camp in the Everglades nine times beginning on July 23 and as recently as Thursday.

The trips have become so regular that JJ in DC was able to figure out their schedule and predict their next moves.

Rolling Stone went to a public parking lot next to a loading area at the back of Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on August 13 to observe an incoming C-27.

Once it landed and taxied to the loading area, the aircraft’s back ramp opened and three vehicles pulled up toward it — an unmarked van, an unmarked SUV, and an SUV with a DHS seal. Federal agents and guards removed a shackled man from the aircraft and put him into the DHS SUV. Agents spent about an hour signing paperwork, chatting, and loading plastic bags holding immigrants’ belongings into the aircraft, while a Coast Guard pilot did a walk-around safety check for the next flight.

An agent carried an armful of chains to the van, and a short time later, seven people shackled at the hands and ankles were led from the van to the aircraft’s ramp, where they were patted down. All of them appeared to be men, ranging in age from late teens to forties. All appeared to be brown or Latino.

Once they were loaded onto the aircraft, the shackled man in the marked SUV was moved again to the unmarked van. Soon afterward, the agents appeared to notice they were being filmed from the public parking lot and put on hoodies and balaclavas. Two marched toward the fence dividing the loading area from the lot and filmed a random guy who had just parked there.

The man removed from the C-27 and one of the men loaded onto it were wearing gray sweatsuits often issued to immigrants in detention centers, while the other men were wearing their own clothes, suggesting ICE was transporting a mix of people who had been in their custody for some time and some who had been recently arrested.

On August 22, the C-27 parked in an area farther away from the public parking lot. About nine people in unidentified uniforms got off the aircraft from the boarding door and walked to a nearby charter jet. Federal agents then loaded several shackled people, at least one in a gray sweatsuit, up the back ramp. The charter jet flew to Charlotte, N.C.; the C-27 returned to Alexandria.

In addition to the midsize cities, Coast Guard has apparently operated ICE flights to these cities since late June: Biloxi, Mississippi; Columbus, Georgia; Dallas; Hot Springs, Arkansas; Indianapolis; Knoxville, Tennessee; San Antonio; Springfield, Missouri; and Tallahassee. All are near ICE detention facilities.

Immigrants have long reported harsh conditions, safety problems and physical, verbal, and sexual abuse by guards onboard ICE flights. Like the men in Baltimore, all adult passengers on ICE flights are shackled at the wrists and ankles. (This may be the case for some immigrant children, too.)

Flight attendants for GlobalX, which currently operates the majority of ICE flights, told ProPublica in April that when they raised concerns about how shackled passengers could safely evacuate in the event of an emergency, they were told to “just get up and leave.” In July, activists watching a Seattle airport livestream spotted ICE-contracted guards push to the ground a shackled immigrant with a hood over his head while boarding an ICE flight on Avelo Airlines.

Which detention centers people in ICE custody are transferred to is based largely on capacity, according to the agency, which often results in people being moved multiple times and hundreds or thousands of miles away from their homes. Advocacy groups say this cuts off immigrants from their families and legal assistance, and that frequent and capricious transfers can be used to punish people in ICE custody.

“We’re told that it is a question of logistics, sometimes it often appears that these transfers may be retaliatory in nature, because people are trying to access counsel,” says Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project. “There is also a suspicion that authorities may be transferring people for more favorable case law in different areas of the country.”

For example, when Georgetown professor Badar Khan Suri was detained in March on specious allegations of ties to Hamas, he was sent on a week-long journey to five different facilities, each farther away from his home in Arlington, Virginia, according to court documents. He ended up in a dirty, overcrowded facility in Alvarado, Texas, despite there being plenty of room at two of the facilities in Virginia where he was briefly held. (Suri was released in May and settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration earlier this month.)

In another case first reported by Capital B News, Haitian national Rony Dieujuste was moved from Palm Beach County to Miami, then to Texas, Arizona, and California. At one facility, he and other detainees had unexplained nosebleeds; at another he slept on a bare metal platform. His American partner struggled to keep tabs on him using ICE’s detainee locator system and would only find out he’d been moved when he called her from a new facility, often in the middle of the night.

“I told him to remain strong. But he is breaking,” she told Capital B in June.

“It takes a huge toll on families, especially when they’re so far away,” Cho says. “It’s as if somebody has died or has disappeared.”

It is unclear how many times on average immigrants in ICE detention are transferred before their cases are resolved, because ICE does not release this data. Nor does it release data about its massive — and growing — air operation.

It’s that lack of transparency that compelled Cartwright, the former JPMorgan exec, to start tracking ICE flights nearly six years ago. He releases meticulous monthly reports frequently cited by the media.

“I just believe the public has a right to know what the scale of this operation is,” he says. “When things are opaque like this and basically totally dark, no one thinks about the people on the planes.”

Cartwright began noticing the Coast Guard’s presence in Alexandria and Harlingen in July, but did not include those flights in his statistics for the month because he wasn’t yet sure they were ICE flights. Now he is certain, he says, and he and Human Rights First — the nonprofit he recently announced is taking over his flight-tracking operation — are working to amend the June and July reports to include them. Even before the additions, Cartwright recorded more ICE flights in July than ever before — 727 domestic transfer flights and 207 deportation and third-country removal flights — on ICE’s network of charter airlines, private jets, and a growing number of military aircraft.

Cartwright also noted that when the Coast Guard assisted ICE in the past, it released public statements about that assistance. This time, the Coast Guard appears to have adopted ICE’s stance of saying little.

On Wednesday, NBC News reported that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wanted to use billions in funding from Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” for ICE to buy and operate its own fleet of 30 or more aircraft. That same day, Air Force members received an email, obtained by journalist Marisa Kabas, inviting them to take part in a program “supporting border operations.”

Noem has been living rent-free in a spacious home designated for the Coast Guard commandant, The Washington Post reported last week. Trump fired the previous commandant, Admiral Linda Fagan, on the second day of his second term, accusing her of an “excessive focus” on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
