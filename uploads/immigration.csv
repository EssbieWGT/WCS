Since Time Magazine launched the TIME100 Next list six years ago, an extension of its annual 100 Most Influential People list, it has served as a pedestal for individuals who are on the come-up in their respective fields.

“While we’ve made it our mission to cover people who have reached the pinnacle of their fields, the TIME100 Next is an opportunity to recognize those still on the rise,” Time Editor in Chief Sam Jacobs wrote in an editorial accompanying this year’s list.

Published on Sept. 30, the 2025 iteration of the TIME100 Next list features short pieces about each member of this year’s class.

The list, which Time magazine described as “The World’s Most Influential Rising Stars,” is divided into sections including “Innovators,” “Phenoms,” “Artists,” “Leaders,” and “Advocates.” It includes actors, authors, musicians, business owners, athletes, CEOs and philanthropists from around the world who the magazine deems worthy of recognition.

Included among those influential individuals on the list is a Valley attorney who has devoted his career to immigrant and human rights.

Efrén Olivares, who practices law in McAllen, made the 2025 TIME100 Next list — a recognition that he said came as a surprise.

“I didn’t apply,” he said. “It’s not something that one applies to. They just select people.”

He said that he first became aware that he was being considered when representatives from the magazine reached out to his colleagues at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization where he currently serves as vice president of Litigation and Legal Strategy.

It was in September that the magazine contacted his colleagues to inform them that he had been selected.

“I thought just being considered for it was already itself an honor, but when once I found out that I had gotten it, I was just very excited, both for myself and also for the issues that I work on,” Olivares said. “It’s a recognition that the work for immigrants rights and defending the rights of immigrants, especially in this moment, was being looked at and recognized by the magazine. I was very excited about that.”

Olivares was recognized in the “Advocates” section with a brief essay written by Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and president of the RFK Human Rights nonprofit advocacy organization.

“For years, Efrén has championed human dignity. He’s defended families cruelly separated at the U.S.-Mexico border,” Kennedy wrote. “Through his work at the National Immigration Law Center, he’s stopped the midnight deportation of unaccompanied children denied fair court hearings. And as our co-counsel, he’s battling a federal plan to force immigrants to report for registration as a prelude to detention and deportation.

“He isn’t just a brilliant lawyer. He’s an example of the principles we’re fighting to protect.”

Olivares was born in Allende, a town located about three hours southwest from the Rio Grande Valley in the Mexican state of Nuevo León. He said that he’d spent most of his childhood in Allende with the rest of his family.

It wasn’t until he was about 9 years old that circumstances led to his family having to seek opportunities elsewhere.

“I was living in Mexico, and most of my family was in Mexico, and I was planning to live my life in Mexico,” he recalled. “When I was nine, my dad just ran out of work. He couldn’t find work anymore. Like so many adults in Mexico in the 90s, after NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) was enacted, he ran out of work. He had been a truck driver for most of his life, so he came to the U.S. looking for work, and he found a job as a school bus driver at Valley View in Pharr.”

Olivares said that his father had a visa allowing him to move to the country because his grandfather had been born in the United States. While his father lived and worked in the U.S., eventually earning his citizenship, Olivares had to stay behind in Mexico with his mother and his siblings.

It would be four years before they too were able to join his father and move to the United States.

“I came in when I was 13,” he recalled. “I was supposed to go into eighth grade, but I didn’t speak English, so they kept me down a year. I went into seventh grade at Valley View. That’s where I graduated from high school.”

After graduating from Valley View High School in 2001, Olivares became the first member of his family to attend college.

He attended the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, an experience that he described as a culture shock.

“When I moved to the Valley, most people spoke Spanish. The food was not that different. The music was not that different,” Olivares said. “Then I got to Philly, and I was like, ‘Whoa, this is the rest of the U.S.’”

Olivares graduated in 2005 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics. He then attended Yale Law School, where he graduated in 2008.

“When I went to law school, I wanted to be involved in human rights work,” Olivares said. “I thought I wanted to specialize in Indigenous people’s rights. And in fact, the first human rights job that I got was exactly about that. It involved the rights of Indigenous peoples in the Americas, in Guatemala and Peru, Colombia, Brazil. That was the work that I was doing.”

After a few years, Olivares returned to the Valley where he began working with the Texas Civil Rights Project in December 2013.

A few months after returning to his home in South Texas, Olivares found himself at the center of a human rights crisis as the first influx of unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador began arriving in the Rio Grande Valley.

Many local entities scrambled to provide support for the large volume of children arriving in the area by providing food and shelter. It was then that Olivares decided to offer his services as well by focusing his attention on immigration and border-related issues.

“I went to law school driven by this conviction to provide the best possible legal representation to those who can least afford it,” Olivares said. “I am a firm believer that the outcome of a case or an issue should not depend on how much you are able to pay your lawyer. It should depend on the merits of the issue and the injustice that has been perpetrated. That’s what I’ve been trying to do my entire career — be the best possible lawyer I can be for folks who cannot afford to pay anything.”

As the issues surrounding the border evolved over time, so has Olivares’s career. Through his law practice, he has found himself navigating the constantly evolving border issues, from border wall issues to family separation issues.

Many of his experiences were captured in his 2022 book, “My Boy Will Die of Sorrow: A Memoir of Immigration From the Front Lines.”

His book details Olivares’s first-hand accounts representing hundreds of immigrant families, parents who were separated from their children as a result of zero tolerance during the summer of 2018. Those stories are told alongside his own experience of being separated from his father while he worked in the United States.

The 302 page memoir earned Olivares the 2023 International Latino Book Award in the Raul Yzaguirre Best Political/Current Affairs Book category.

Despite the eye-opening accounts captured in Olivares’s book, it is only one chapter in a book that is constantly being rewritten as immigration and border-related issues continue to evolve. And through it all, Olivares remains in the eye of the storm.

When asked why those issues continue to be at the forefront of many political agendas, his answer was simple, “bigotry.”

“Politicians look for a scapegoat. They look for somebody to blame in the face of problems; the economy is not doing well, or you’ve got COVID, or rising prices, lack of jobs, any issues that all countries face for different reasons,” Olivares said. “They just point the finger, and they happen to point the finger at the most vulnerable people in our communities who happen to be, by and large, Black or brown. I think that is what’s driving this sentiment.”

With the work never ceasing, Olivares was still able to take a moment to reflect on his recognition in the magazine — an accolade that he described as surreal.

“It’s honestly hard to believe that,” he said. “Here I am, this kid from Allende who went to public school in Mexico, and just kind of had to migrate to another country. I’m just doing my work and trying my best at it.”",https://myrgv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112625.EFREN_OLIVARES.jm_.001.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 19:56:54.318938

In a statement, the Homeland Security Department announced the Haitian TPS cancellation — which is a tacit assertion on the Trump administration's part that conditions inside Haiti have improved sufficiently for Haitians to return there.

""After consulting with interagency partners, Secretary (Kristi) Noem concluded that Haiti no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS.

""This decision was based on a review conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, input from relevant U.S. government agencies, and an analysis indicating that allowing Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is inconsistent with U.S. national interests.”

The Haitian TPS termination takes effect on Feb. 3, 2026.

But the move — which affects about 500,000 Haitians in the U.S. — contradicts numerous assessments about gang control and violence in Haiti.

That plague — which last year resulted in more than 5,600 people murdered and has turned more than 1 million Haitians into homeless refugees in this decade — has not improved but has in fact worsened, they say.

A big fear is that Haitians who lose TPS and are deported back to Haiti will only end up adding to those throngs of displaced people in the country.

Haiti's gangs, including the large confederation known as Viv Ansanm, already control 90% of the capital, Port-au-Prince amid the country's government vacuum.

(A nine-member Temporary Presidential Council is currently trying, with little success, to arrange desperately needed new elections there.)

This month the U.N. issued a new report that warns how the gang takeovers and terror are now expanding beyond Port-au-Prince throughout the country's interior. Gang killings are track to exceed 6,000 this year.

TPS, which was created by Congress and is renewable every 18 months, allows migrants from countries torn by disasters or political violence to remain in the U.S. until it is deemed OK for them to go back.

TPS for Haitians was created in the wake of Haiti's catastrophic 2010 earthquake, which killed at least 200,000 people.

READ MORE: Port-au-Prince is about to fall to gangs. So is it 'crazy' to send Haitians back to Haiti?

Since President Trump took office again last January, he has pushed a campaign to cancel TPS renewal, not only for Haitians but Venezuelans and several other migrant nationalities, as part of his anti-immigration America First agenda.

Federal judges this year have blocked the administration from revoking Haitians' TPS before it was legally scheduled to end. But it's uncertain if the courts can stop its cancellation when the February renewal expires.

As a result, say Haitian-American immigration attorneys like Frandley Julien of North Miami, the Haitian community here had been bracing for Wednesday's decision.

""They know exactly what's happening here,"" Julien told WLRN.

""They just have to separate the administration's lie [about conditions in Haiti] from the reality that they know too well — how bad it is back home.

""Even so, this news of the TPS termination is devastating for them — especially since, true to form, the administration announced it on the eve Thanksgiving, as if to inflict as much emotional damage as possible to the community.""

Trump was also accused of anti-Haitian racism during last year's presidential campaign, when he publicly pushed the lie that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating residents' pets.

Either way, the DHS announcement warned that if ""you are an alien who is currently a beneficiary of TPS for Haiti, you should prepare to depart if you have no other lawful basis for remaining in the United States.""

It also advised those Haitians that they can use DHS's CPB Home mobile application to facilitate their ""self-deportation,"" and that they are eligible for free airfare and a $1,000 exit bonus.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2aaf59f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+8/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2F3c%2Ff10f2bc3452a88e05a08e9c8359f%2Fap24266804069230.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 18:57:10.845465

New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the coalition of other Democratic attorneys general, said in a statement Wednesday that the Trump administration is illegally cutting off benefits for tens of thousands of lawful permanent residents.

The USDA provided the new guidance to states narrowing SNAP eligibility last month, aligning with rollbacks of the program outlined in President Donald Trump’s domestic policy law that passed earlier this year.

The attorneys general argue in the lawsuit that the memo goes beyond what the law prescribes since it would make anyone who entered the country through humanitarian protection programs permanently ineligible for SNAP benefits — also known as food stamps — even if they become legal residents.

The group of attorneys general warn that the USDA’s guidance, which prompts a swift overhaul of eligibility systems, “threatens to destabilize SNAP nationwide,” and could put significant financial strain on states that would have to shoulder the cost of fines.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge in Oregon to vacate and block the implementation of the USDA’s guidance.

The filing comes just days after a federal judge in Virginia dismissed an indictment against James, whom President Donald Trump has viewed as a political opponent.

Bruna Caroline Ferreira, the mother of Leavitt’s nephew and the former fiancée of her brother Michael Leavitt, was taken into custody in Revere, Mass., on Nov. 12, her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, said.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told NBC News that Ferreira is a “criminal illegal alien from Brazil” who had remained in the U.S. on a tourist visa, which expired in June 1999.

Ferreira has an arrest record for battery, the spokesperson added, without providing further details.

Pomerleau contradicted the DHS spokesperson and told local CNN affiliate, WMUR, that Ferreira “has no criminal record whatsoever” and is not in the country illegally.

“I don’t know where that is coming from. Show us the proof. There’s no charges out there. She’s not a criminal, illegal alien, we’re hearing that said about anyone who’s not a U.S. citizen,” he said.

Ferreira has never lived with her son, who, according to sources, lives full-time with his dad and stepmother in New Hampshire. Ferreira and Leavitt have not been in contact for years, reports CNN.

Ferreira’s lawyer told the outlet that she was a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which temporarily protects those brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts during his first term to end the program meant Ferreira was unable to renew her status. She is currently in the midst of a “lawful immigration process” for U.S. citizenship, Pomerleau said, adding that she is a good mother and that he was “fighting” to get her released from custody.

“She should not be sitting in a jail hours away from her family and from her child’s life. She’s a great mom, and from what I heard, I think he’s been a pretty good dad,” he told WMUR.

Ferreira was detained while driving to pick up her son, according to Pomerleau.

Ferreira’s sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, told the Boston Globe she was “suddenly swarmed” by immigration agents who demanded her name and driver’s licence, but Ferreira did not have any ID.

“They were not the most gentle with her,” she said, describing her sister as “more American than anything else.”

Michael Leavitt told WMUR on Tuesday that his primary concern was the safety and well-being of their son, who he said has not spoken to his mother since she was taken into custody a few weeks ago.

His mother is currently detained at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Ferreira’s sister created a GoFundMe page to cover legal fees and expenses accrued as a result of her arrest. As of Wednesday morning, it had raised over $18,000.

“My family is going through one of the most difficult moments of our lives, and we’re reaching out with a humble plea for help. My sister, Bruna, was recently detained by immigration and is now fighting to stay in the country she has called home for nearly her entire life,” the fundraising description reads.

Ferreira was brought to the U.S. by their parents in 1998 and has always maintained her legal status through DACA, her sister wrote, before describing her as a “hardworking” and “kind” person who puts others before herself.

On Wednesday, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency (USCIS) issued a notice in the Federal Register revealing its intent to sever Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for Haitians on February 3.

Some 352,959 Haitian nationals and stateless people of Haitian origin are expected to be affected, according to government estimates.

The notice, currently in draft form, will become official on Friday.

In explaining its decision, the Department of Homeland Security sought to walk a fine line. On one hand, it argued that violent gang activity and instability in Haiti were national security threats to the US.

On the other, it maintained that conditions in Haiti were safe enough to merit the return of the Haitians currently shielded by TPS.

Nixing the programme for Haitian nationals, the department said, would be akin to giving a vote of confidence to Haiti’s future.

“Ending Temporary Protected Status for Haiti reflects a necessary and strategic vote of confidence in the new chapter Haiti is turning,” the notice said.

“The United States cannot call for bold change on the ground while signaling doubt from afar.”

Temporary Protected Status is a short-term protection granted to foreign applicants who are already in the US but find that conditions in their home country have become unsafe due to conflict, disaster or other emergency circumstances.

The programme allows recipients to remain in the country legally and receive authorisation to work.

At the start of the year, citizens of 17 countries were protected by different TPS programmes, including Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen.

But the Trump administration has sought to eliminate many of the TPS designations, arguing that they run contrary to US national interests.

The rollback is part of a larger trend to curtail immigration into the US and implement what Trump has promised will be the “largest deportation in the history of our country”.

But critics warn that revoking TPS and refusing to extend protections will send some foreign nationals back into dangerous situations, where their lives could be in peril.

A humanitarian crisis

The TPS programme for Haitian citizens was originally opened on January 21, 2010, shortly after a catastrophic, 7.0-magnitude earthquake shook the island country.

Nearly 222,570 people were killed, and more than 1.3 million were displaced from their homes, according to US government statistics.

That same year, Haiti experienced its first outbreak of cholera in nearly a century. An estimated 10,000 deaths were linked to the disease’s spread at the time, and a new resurgence since 2022 has killed thousands more.

Haiti is considered the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere, and it has long struggled with inadequate housing, food scarcity and insufficient health services.

Those problems have been compounded by corruption and upheaval in the Haitian government as well as the spread of gang violence.

In 2019, national elections were indefinitely postponed, and in 2021, then-President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home in Petionville. No president has replaced him since, and a round of national elections was again postponed from this year to late 2026.

The last democratically elected officials in the Haitian National Assembly saw their terms expire in 2023.

A nine-member transitional presidential council currently holds governing power, but its mandate is slated to expire in February.

In the absence of government leadership, gangs and other criminal organisations have spread in Haiti, taking control of as much as 90 percent of the capital, Port-au-Prince.

Human rights abuses have proliferated as the gangs expanded their reach. Just this year, from April to June, at least 1,617 people were killed in the violence. In 2024, the death toll was 5,600, an increase over 2023.

At least 1.4 million people are currently displaced from their homes as a result of the fighting.

Court challenges

But Trump officials have argued that the previous administration, under President Joe Biden, exceeded its authority in approving repeated TPS extensions for Haitians and other foreign groups.

Trump has accused Biden of allowing unfettered immigration into the US and has sought to reverse some of his predecessor’s efforts.

In July 2024, the Biden administration approved the most recent TPS extension for Haitians, allowing the protections to continue for an additional 18 months.

But in February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, under Trump’s authority, announced she would “partially vacate” the extension, cutting it from 18 months to 12.

That would have forced Haitians with TPS to leave the country or find alternative immigration pathways no later than September 2.

The US State Department currently lists Haiti under a category-four travel advisory, indicating the highest level of danger. It cites the current state of emergency in the country and notes that there are threats from “kidnapping, crime, terrorist activity, civil unrest and limited health care”.

“Do not travel to Haiti for any reason,” the State Department advises on its website.

Plaintiffs have pointed to that fact to argue that curtailing the extension is not only illegal but also irresponsible.

“Revoking Haitians’ legal immigration status that has kept them safe with their families in the US is cruel and dangerous,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement earlier this year, as she and 18 other state prosecutors filed an amicus brief to stop the TPS revocation.

“Haitian immigrants have contributed immensely to our communities, neighborhoods and local economies, and without them, New York and this nation would not be the same.”

Some of the legal challenges to the Trump administration’s decision have raised the question of racial animus.

While campaigning for re-election in 2024, for instance, Trump spread unfounded and racist claims about Haitian immigrants in the US, including that they eat neighbourhood pets.

In July, a federal court in New York heard one of the cases against shortening the TPS extension, known as Haitian Evangelical Clergy Association v Trump.

Judge Brian Coban ruled that shortening the timeline was “arbitrary and capricious” and “violated plaintiffs’ due process rights”.

His ruling, however, left open the possibility that the Trump administration could simply let the existing extension period expire, as it does in Wednesday’s notice.

Arguing for expiration

The notice announcing the end of the TPS protections makes several arguments for why an end to the programme is necessary, at least according to Noem.

“The Secretary has determined that while the current situation in Haiti is concerning, the United States must prioritize its national interests,” the notice said. “Permitting Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the U.S. national interest.”

It also described Judge Coban’s decision in July as “interference” in the work of the executive branch.

The notice asserts Noem has “determined that there are no extraordinary and temporary conditions in Haiti” that should prevent TPS recipients from “returning in safety”.

But “even if the Department found that there existed conditions that were extraordinary”, it maintained that national security concerns prevented the government from extending the TPS programme.

Undocumented immigrants from Haiti continue to arrive in high numbers to the US, the notice said.

It also pointed to the threat of Haitian gangs and organised crime. Earlier this year, the Trump administration labelled two Haitian groups, Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif, as “foreign terrorist organisations”, as part of a larger crackdown against Latin American criminal networks.

The notice also highlighted the absence of a central government in Haiti. “This lack of government control has not only destabilized Haiti internally but has also had direct consequences for US public safety,” it said.

Still, it underscored Noem’s belief that there have been “positive developments” in Haiti.

In October, for example, the United Nations Security Council approved the creation of a Gang Suppression Force to help bolster Haiti’s police.

That initiative would replace a Kenya-led, UN-endorsed multinational mission that has struggled to make a dent in Haiti’s gang violence.

The notice argued that offering TPS protections would undermine goals for Haiti’s recovery.

“Our immigration policy must align with our foreign policy vision of a secure, sovereign, and self-reliant Haiti,” the notice said.

Nonetheless, its assessment of Haiti’s safety was measured. Only “parts of the country are suitable to return to,” it said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25181641413209-1764182394.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-26 15:57:21.129211

FIRST ON FOX: Top brass at the Department of Homeland Security told Fox News Digital the agency’s Investigations unit is now on the case of a Virginia educator and his brother accused of plotting to attack ICE, potentially with explosive rounds.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Wednesday that Kempsville High School assistant principal John Wilson Bennett and his older brother Mark Booth Bennett were overheard at a Vietnamese restaurant in Virginia Beach allegedly conspiring to go to Nevada and plan attacks on ICE agents in retribution for what they claimed to be ""kidnapping[s]"" of civilians during recent immigration enforcement operations.

""It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers—offering such specifics as to getting a high-caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,"" McLaughlin said, after Fox News Digital originally reported on the adult brothers’ arrest days ago.

""Thanks to Homeland Security Investigations and our partners, these men are behind bars.""

FLORIDA MAN NABBED BY HOMELAND SECURITY FOR ALLEGEDLY MAKING ONLINE DEATH THREATS AGAINST ICE 'GESTAPO'

John Bennett has been faculty at the school, located in the inland part of Virginia Beach, since 2009. The school told local press that he is currently on leave.

McLaughlin said DHS worked with law enforcement at all levels after an off-duty Norfolk police officer overheard the men at a Vietnamese restaurant in Virginia Beach on Nov. 17 discussing plans to ""kill police officers and ICE agents,"" with Mark Bennett allegedly saying he was planning to meet like-minded people in Las Vegas, where he would also purchase firearms with explosive rounds.

Two days later, Mark Bennett was arrested at Norfolk International Airport en route to Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, to connect to Las Vegas. John Bennett was also arrested that day.

FBI DIRECTOR KASH PATEL VOWS JUSTICE AFTER DHS AGENT'S VEHICLE RAMMED IN CHICAGO

McLaughlin said the case is indicative of the more-than 1,150% increase in assaults against ICE agents and 8,000-fold spike in death threats as they go about their daily work defending the homeland.

""They risk their lives every single day to remove the worst of the worst, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, terrorists, and gang members. From bounties placed on their heads for their murders, threats to their families, stalking, and doxxing online, our officers are experiencing an unprecedented level of violence and threats against them and their families,"" McLaughlin said.

Happy O’Brien, Mark Bennett’s attorney, disputed the recounting of events, reportedly saying his client was instead flying to Nevada for a F1 (Formula One) motorsports event with his child, according to the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot.

O’Brien reportedly compared the restaurant conversation to something out of the NBC sitcom ""Seinfeld"" – where Jerry Seinfeld’s and Jason Alexander’s characters would often have varying degrees of existential conversations while having coffee at ""Monk’s.""

Over 800,000 Bangladeshis have Malaysian work permits, making them the largest group of documented foreign workers in the country. According to information received by the UN, thousands of workers are stranded in Bangladesh or face exploitation in Malaysia after some paid recruitment fees five times higher than the official rate.

Other abuses, including confiscation of passports by Malaysian employers, false job promises, discrepancies between contracts and promised employment packages, and a lack of support from responsible government agencies, are common in Malaysia.

Workers without proper documentation are at risk of arrest, detention, ill-treatment, and deportation under Malaysia’s draconian immigration act, which criminalizes irregular entry, and other anti-migrant policies. Malaysian authorities conduct frequent immigration raids and hold an estimated 18,000 migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in immigration detention centers.

The United States has previously issued import restrictions against Malaysian factories. Meanwhile the European Union’s Forced Labour Regulation, taking effect in 2027, introduces curbs on the trade of goods produced with forced labor. Debt bondage and deception of workers could lead to prohibitions on the sale of sanctioned goods under the new regulation.

The Bangladeshi and Malaysian governments, as well as those of other labor-sending or receiving countries and those where buying companies are headquartered such as the US, EU members, and the United Kingdom, have obligations to ensure labor migration is conducted in a way that protects workers’ rights. Malaysia and labor-sending governments like Bangladesh should implement the UN experts’ call to promptly investigate reported abuses and provide effective remedies. The experts emphasized that “involuntary repatriations and any form of reprisals” against migrant workers violate international human rights obligations.

International buyers sourcing from Malaysia should use the Fair Labor Association’s Guidance for Responsible Recruitment for companies as a model. The guidance urges buyers to “include costs of responsible recruitment in their purchasing metrics” and ensure that their suppliers include those costs in their invoicing. Buyers should also support migrant workers’ access to legal aid.

Since May, for instance, dozens of officials from multiple federal agencies have been meeting as part of a task force formed to advance Trump’s retribution drive against perceived enemies, Reuters previously reported.

Trump’s retribution campaign is hurting CIA morale and wrecking the bipartisan trust that allows Washington to function, Panetta said.
Nine media organizations have faced federal investigations, lawsuits, threats to revoke their broadcast licenses and limits on access to White House events.","The second form was threats. Trump and his administration targeted at least 46 individuals, businesses and other entities with threats of investigations or penalties, including freezing federal funds for Democratic-led cities such as New York and Chicago.

Trump openly discussed firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for resisting interest rate cuts, for instance. Last week, he threatened to have six Democratic members of Congress tried for sedition – a crime he said is “punishable by DEATH” – after the lawmakers reminded military personnel they can refuse “illegal orders.” This week, the Defense Department threatened to court-martial one of them, U.S. Senator Mark Kelly, a former Naval officer.

The third form was coercion. In at least a dozen cases, organizations such as law firms and universities signed agreements with the government to roll back diversity initiatives or other policies after facing administration threats of punishment, such as security clearance revocations and loss of federal funding and contracts.

It’s a campaign led from the top: Trump’s White House has issued at least 36 orders, decrees and directives, targeting at least 100 individuals and entities with punitive actions, according to the Reuters analysis.

Trump openly campaigned on a platform of revenge in his latest run for the presidency, promising to punish enemies of his Make America Great Again movement. ""For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,"" he said in a March 2023 speech. Weeks later, while campaigning in Texas, he repeated the theme. “I am your justice,” he said.

Today, the White House disputes the idea that the administration is out for revenge. It describes recent investigations and indictments of political adversaries as valid course corrections on policy, necessary probes of wrongdoing and legitimate policy initiatives.

“This entire article is based on the flawed premise that enforcing an electoral mandate is somehow ‘retribution.’ It’s not,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. There is no place in government for civil servants or public officials “who actively seek to undermine the agenda that the American people elected the president to enact,” she added. Trump is abiding by campaign promises to restore a justice system that was “weaponized” by the Biden administration, Jackson said, and “ensure taxpayer funding is not going to partisan causes.”

Trump’s actions have been cheered by his staunchest backers. Right-wing commentator and former Trump advisor Steve Bannon told Reuters the use of government power to punish Trump’s enemies is “not revenge at all” but an attempt to “hold people accountable” for what he said were unfair investigations targeting Trump. More is on the way, he said.

“The people that tried to take away President Trump's first term, that accused him of being a Russian asset and damaged this republic, and then stole the 2020 election – they're going to be held accountable and they're going to be adjudicated in courts of law,” he said in an interview. “That's coming. There's no doubt.” There’s no evidence the 2020 election was stolen.

“For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”

Trump’s allies point to actions former President Joe Biden took upon taking office. After Trump’s supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his election loss, Biden revoked Trump’s access to classified information, a first for any former president. Biden also won a court battle to dismiss Senate-confirmed directors of independent agencies serving fixed terms, such as the Federal Housing Finance Authority, and removed scores of Trump-era appointees from unpaid advisory boards.

Yet the scale and systematic nature of Trump’s effort to punish perceived enemies marks a sharp break from long-standing norms in U.S. governance, according to 13 political scientists and legal scholars interviewed by Reuters. Some historians say the closest modern parallel, though inexact, is the late President Richard Nixon’s quest for vengeance against political enemies. Since May, for instance, dozens of officials from multiple federal agencies have been meeting as part of a task force formed to advance Trump’s retribution drive against perceived enemies, Reuters previously reported.

“The main aim is concentration of power and destruction of all checks against power,” said Daron Acemoglu, Nobel laureate in economics and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which faces an ongoing federal investigation for embracing diversity and equity programs. “Retribution is just one of the tools.”

Dozens of Trump’s targets have challenged their punishments as illegal. Fired and suspended civil servants have filed administrative appeals or legal challenges claiming wrongful termination. Some law firms have gone to court claiming the administration exceeded its legal authority by restricting their ability to work on classified contracts or interact with federal agencies. Most of those challenges remain unresolved.

Investigating foes of Trump

The administration has moved aggressively against officials in the government’s legal and national security agencies, institutions central to investigations of Trump’s alleged misconduct during and after his first term.

At least 69 current and former officials were targeted for investigating or sounding alarms about Russian interference in U.S. elections. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded soon after the 2016 election that Moscow sought to tilt the race toward Trump, a finding later affirmed by a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report in August 2020. Acts of retribution tied to the Russia probe include the September 25 indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, a break from Justice Department norms meant to shield prosecutions from political influence.

Comey, who led the FBI’s investigation into Trump’s 2016 campaign, was charged after Trump demanded his prosecution. The Justice Department has cast the case as a corruption crackdown. Comey and his lawyers said in court documents that the case was “vindictive” and motivated by “personal animus.” Comey, who pleaded not guilty, declined to comment. A federal judge dismissed the case on Monday, ruling that Trump’s handpicked prosecutor had been unlawfully appointed.

At least 58 acts of retribution have targeted people Trump viewed as saboteurs of his election campaigns, including Chris Krebs, the top cybersecurity official during his first term. Trump fired him in 2020 for disputing claims that the election was rigged. In April, Trump stripped Krebs’ security clearance and ordered a federal investigation into his tenure. Krebs, still asserting that Trump’s defeat was valid, has vowed to fight the probe. He did not respond for this story.

“This kind of political retribution leads to a loss of trust, which ultimately leads to a failure of governing.”

Reuters documented 112 security clearances revoked from current and former U.S. officials, law firms and state leaders – credentials needed for work that involves classified information. In August, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced she was revoking 37 clearances.

In a response to Reuters posted on X, an agency spokesperson said Gabbard and Trump are working “to ensure the government is never again wielded against the American people it is meant to serve.” She added: “President Trump said it best, ‘Our ultimate retribution is success.’”

Leon Panetta, CIA director and defense secretary under former President Barack Obama, had his security clearance revoked in January along with others who signed an October 2020 letter suggesting Russia may have been behind reports about emails on Hunter Biden’s laptop. At the time, Joe Biden – Hunter’s father – was Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2020 election. An executive order Trump signed in January claimed: ""The signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions."" Panetta has said he stands by signing the letter.

Panetta told Reuters he had already surrendered his clearance after leaving government nearly a decade ago. Trump’s retribution campaign is hurting CIA morale and wrecking the bipartisan trust that allows Washington to function, Panetta said. “What I worry about is that our adversaries will look at what’s happening and sense weakness,” he said. “This kind of political retribution leads to a loss of trust, which ultimately leads to a failure of governing.” The CIA did not respond to a request for comment.

The revenge effort also reaches deep into the civil service, punishing employees who speak out against Trump’s policies and turning forms of dissent that were tolerated by past administrations into grounds for discipline.

This summer, hundreds of Environmental Protection Agency staffers wrote an open letter protesting deep cuts to pollution control and cleanup programs. The fallout was swift. More than 100 signers who attached their names were placed on paid leave. At least 15 senior officials and probationary employees were told they would be fired. The rest were informed they were under investigation for misconduct, leading to at least 69 suspensions without pay. Many remained out of work for weeks.

“They followed all the rules” of conduct for civil servants, said Nicole Cantello, one of the signers and an officer with the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents many affected workers. She called the punishments an attempt to “quell dissent,” stifle free speech and “scare the employees.” In a statement, the EPA said it has “a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage, and undercut” administration policy.

At the Federal Emergency Management Agency, about 20 staffers were put on leave and now face misconduct investigations after signing a letter criticizing the agency’s decision to scrap bipartisan reforms adopted years ago to speed disaster relief. Cameron Hamilton, a Republican who served briefly as acting head of FEMA, was fired in May, a day after telling Congress he didn’t believe the agency should be shut down, contradicting the administration.

Hamilton told Reuters he still supports Trump. But he said too many senior officials are firing people in the name of retribution, trying to impress the White House. “They want to find ways to really launch themselves to prominence and be movers and shakers, to kick ass and take names,” said Hamilton. “They’re trying to show the president ‘look at what I am doing for you.’”

In a statement to Reuters, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes FEMA, said it is building a “new FEMA” to fix “inefficiency and outdated processes.” Employees “resisting change” are “not a good fit,” the statement said.

Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, former head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, sees her firing in October – three weeks after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging politicization of research and vaccine policy – as a warning shot. She told Reuters the administration’s purge of dissenting health officials is breeding “anticipatory obedience” – a reflex to comply before being asked. “People know if they push back … this is what happens,” she said. The effect, she says, is an ecosystem of fear: those who stay in government self-censor; those who speak out are branded “radioactive, too hot to handle.”

The Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that oversees NIAID, did not respond to a request for comment.

Federal agency leaders have dismissed a wide array of officials they deemed out of step with Trump’s MAGA agenda, including employees involved in diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and those working on transgender issues.

David Maltinsky, a Federal Bureau of Investigation employee, says he was fired by Director Kash Patel for displaying a Pride flag at work – one of at least 50 bureau personnel dismissed on Patel’s watch. Maltinsky sued the FBI and Justice Department, alleging violations of his constitutional rights and seeking reinstatement. The Justice Department has yet to file a formal response.

In his 2023 book, “Government Gangsters,” Patel named 60 people that he said were members of an “Executive Branch deep state” that opposed Trump, including former Democratic government officials and Republicans who served in Trump’s first administration but eventually broke with him. He called for firings and said that anybody who abused their authority should face prosecution. In his 2025 confirmation hearing before Congress, Patel denied that it was an “enemies list.”

Reuters found that at least 17 of the 60 people on Patel’s list have faced some sort of retribution, including firings and stripping of security clearances. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

Against perceived foes in the private sector, the administration has wielded financial penalties as leverage. At least two dozen law firms faced inquiries, investigations or restrictions on federal contracting, often for employing or representing people tied to past cases against Trump. Eight struck deals to avoid further action.

Nine media organizations have faced federal investigations, lawsuits, threats to revoke their broadcast licenses and limits on access to White House events. Trump has also suggested revoking broadcast licenses for networks whose coverage he dislikes.

Records show Murray had signed a purchase agreement for Weingart Center to buy the Torrance hotel for $30 million in taxpayer funds.","Hours after the Trump administration sued California last week, threatening to end key benefits for students without legal status, Michelle was scrolling social media when she saw a video that made her panic.

The Trump administration is challenging California’s policy of providing in-state tuition, scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants without legal status — including Michelle, an immigrant who is a community college student in San Mateo County. CalMatters has agreed to withhold her full name because she fears drawing attention to her legal status.

On TikTok, rumors swirled. Michelle saw a video of a young man, around her age, asking if the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is gone. In reality, FAFSA is still around, and while the new lawsuit could affect some students' financial aid, some top legal experts say the Trump administration is unlikely to win. Regardless, the court process may take weeks or much longer to resolve the government’s claims against California.

In the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges that California’s policy of granting in-state tuition and financial aid for some students without legal status is unconstitutional. Federal lawyers also argue that California’s policies violate a 1996 federal law, which bars states from providing benefits to residents without legal status that aren’t also available to U.S. citizens who live anywhere in the U.S. The Justice Department is arguing that California either needs to drop the policy or let all U.S. citizens, including those who are out-of-state, pay the same rate.

In California, over 100,000 college students lack legal status, according to one estimate by an alliance of university leaders who advocate for immigrants. Federal assistance, such as Pell grants and federal student loans, are off-limits to anyone who isn’t a U.S. citizen or does not have permanent legal status. California has its own money for college financial aid, which it distributes according to state law.

As long as individuals meet certain requirements, such as attending three years of high school in California, they’re eligible for in-state tuition, saving as much as $39,000 of dollars each year compared to their out-of-state peers. Once they meet those requirements, students without legal status can also qualify for the state’s cornerstone financial aid program, known as Cal Grant, though only a small fraction of these students actually apply for and receive it.

To Kevin Johnson, a law professor at UC Davis, Trump’s actions may be more about political wins than legal ones. “The Trump administration is engaged in a full-court press on undocumented immigrants and so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, and California and Governor Newsom in particular,” Johnson said. That the U.S. Department of Justice named the suit “United States of America v. Newsom” is another indication that this is political, he added.

Others noted that states have already invested in students without legal status and denying them an affordable path toward a college education is a waste of resources. Economists have pointed out that immigrants without status also are integral to the U.S. workforce and aren’t easily replaceable.

‘We didn’t expect them to go this low’

Even weak lawsuits or outright misinformation can make students nervous during November, when college and financial aid application season is in full swing.

On TikTok, videos of students panicking about the financial aid system surfaced last winter, after the Biden administration delayed and botched the rollout of the new FAFSA. Among its many glitches, the new form prevented students whose parents lacked a Social Security number from submitting their information.

After Trump was elected last November, fears about the total demise of federal financial aid swirled again on TikTok. Over the course of this year, as his administration targets universities and continues to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, those fears have persisted.

In California, Trump seeks to impose a $1 billion penalty on UCLA for alleged civil rights abuses, though a federal judge recently handed the White House a temporary loss on that front. His administration is also suing California colleges and universities for alleged antisemitism violations and has sought to freeze or curtail billions of dollars in federal research funding.

Much of those freezes have been blocked or reversed by federal judges, but hundreds of millions of dollars still remain cut off to campuses. Much, if not all, of those friction points between California and Trump could be resolved through settlements and negotiations, which are political in nature, said UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura in an interview.

Before Trump was elected, state leaders, including Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat, pushed for California to offer additional benefits to students without legal status, such as the opportunity to work campus jobs.

Now, with access to financial aid programs at risk for these students, Alvarez said the focus is shifting. “We didn’t expect it would go this low as to go after students that the president had previously said should be welcomed here.” In 2024, Trump told a podcast host that students should “automatically” receive “a Green Card,” otherwise known as permanent residency, when they get their college diploma.

Legal scholars doubt Trump’s lawsuit will win

The lawsuit against California is the Trump administration’s sixth against states with policies allowing in-state tuition for students without legal status. The White House went after Texas first, in June. Underscoring how much of a bipartisan issue in-state tuition is, Texan lawmakers were the first in the U.S. to enshrine the policy in 2001. In all, more than 20 states passed some in-state tuition policy benefiting some residents without legal status.

Trump’s legal attacks on the policy this year prompted leaders in Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas to side with the White House to terminate the benefit in those respective states. Some legal groups that want to continue in-state tuition for students lacking legal status are challenging those states’ moves.

Trump has also sued Minnesota and Illinois, states with Democrats as governors and attorneys general who are challenging Trump’s lawsuits.

The U.S. Department of Justice says that the federal law in question bars students without legal status from receiving in-state tuition and financial aid benefits based on their living in the state. This, the federal lawyers argue, violates federal law since public campuses in California require U.S. citizens from other states to pay higher tuition rates.

However, California’s law, Assembly Bill 540, doesn’t extend in-state tuition based on where students live, scholars and a previous court ruling say. Instead, students generally need to prove that they attended three years of high school or community college in California; they also need to earn in California a high school diploma or obtain enough community college credits to be eligible for transfer into a public university.

The Department of Justice says those three-year high school or community college requirements are tantamount to an in-state residency criteria and therefore violate the 1996 federal law.

But the California Supreme Court in 2010 already struck down that interpretation. The high court observed that some students living in areas bordering California are permitted to study at California high schools. High school students from out of state enrolled in private boarding schools also satisfy the requirement; they don’t count as residents of California either. And students who were residents of California during high school but moved to a different state could still enroll in California colleges or universities paying in-state tuition.

All of these scenarios require a student to complete the same AB 540 application as students who lack legal status. The only difference is that students without status must also complete an affidavit that they’ll pursue legal residency as soon as they can.

In fact, the University of California enrolled more students under AB 540 who were legal U.S. residents than those who weren’t, the state high court said then.

“If Congress had intended to prohibit states entirely from making unlawful aliens eligible for in-state tuition, it could easily have done so,” the state Supreme Court wrote in 2010. But Congress didn’t do that, the court noted.

Lawmakers in California who passed AB 540 in 2001 knew what the federal law restricted, said Motomura, and they crafted a state law that wouldn’t contravene what Congress intended. “It was drafted to avoid the residency test, and it was drafted to avoid the exclusion of U.S. citizens,” he said.

What’s likely next

California has already signaled that it will fight the lawsuit. “The Trump Administration has once again missed the mark with its latest attack on California, and we look forward to proving it in court,” wrote Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice.

Both the UC and the community college system said their tuition and financial aid policies have always been legally compliant. The Cal State University system did not respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration may also seek a preliminary injunction to halt California’s in-state tuition law for nonresidents, which would again expose Californians to a seesaw of temporary court orders, sometimes contradictory in nature, while the full legal merits of the case play out slowly in court.

Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, thinks the U.S. Supreme Court will likely side with California despite its conservative orientation if the case goes that far.

A major legal question underscoring the case against California is when and how federal rules preempt or supersede state laws. The Trump White House is arguing California’s in-state policies are preempted by federal law. But the legal concept of preemption is a pillar in jurisprudence. Liberal and conservative interests benefit similarly from a consistent application of preemption as a legal concept, Saenz said. For example, businesses rely on preemption rules in situations where a state law is more progressive or consumer-friendly than a federal rule and want courts to defend them from following the more demanding state rules.

The U.S. Supreme Court is “going to be very wary of making bad law in the realm of preemption, because it could then come back to bite the right wing in protecting businesses,” Saenz said.

For Michelle and other students without legal status navigating their own financial aid applications — and the misinformation online — a series of temporary court orders could create more panic. Financial aid is top of mind, said Michelle, but she doesn’t have time to track the legal back-and-forth of her eligibility.

In addition to being a full-time student, Michelle works four days a week at a restaurant, saving up money not only to support herself but also her family. She’s the oldest of four kids and said she sends $500 to her parents each month.

College is “an opportunity for me to be someone in life, to make my parents proud,” she said. Asked about the lawsuit at the cafeteria of her college, Michelle made a choking gesture with her hand, as though the threat of losing financial aid next year could kill her. “Trump is taking that opportunity away because he doesn’t like immigrants.”

The deadline to submit financial aid applications for community college is Sept. 2, but Michelle is already working on her application, just in case.

Adventist Health White Memorial says it is taking steps to reaffirm its commitment to patient privacy in the face of ICE raids — including posting signs clarifying how law enforcement officers and immigration agents interact with patients.

The announcement comes after reports that hospital administrators allowed federal immigration agents to interfere in medical decisions and block doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care.

The reporting alarmed many in the community, who are calling for hospital administrators to uphold patient privacy and ensure staff can advocate for patients without retaliation. An ICE Out of White Memorial petition has garnered hundreds of signatures, organizers said.

In a Nov. 21 news release, Adventist Health released a six-point statement outlining policies to protect patients and support staff. The measures state that staff can speak up if patient rights are violated, and that they will not face retaliation for “requesting ICE agents to step away.” Staff are encouraged to report any violations of patient rights, according to the release.

The statement also said nursing and clinical care teams “routinely ask ICE agents to leave the room during care so patients can maintain privacy and feel safe when receiving medical care.”

“We support our staff when they speak up for patients’ needs,” it said, adding that the hospital does not prohibit contact with patient families. “We have case management and escalation processes for our physicians and staff to be able to contact families and coordinate care,” according to the news release.

The statement follows reporting by LAist that found that doctors believe hospital administrators were allowing ICE to call the shots and were blocking doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care. The hospital, which is part of a network of private, nonprofit hospitals affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, has operated in Boyle Heights for more than 100 years.

LAist’s reporting found that White Memorial staff who stand up to immigration agents – either by asking them to identify themselves or to step out of the room during a patient examination – do so at their own peril and are unsure that the hospital has their back if a conflict arises. Doctors also said they have been barred from reaching out to family members, either to collect necessary medical information, or simply to let family members know about a loved one.

The new statement was released on Friday, but doctors told Boyle Heights Beat that ICE is still interfering with patient care — in seeming contradiction to Adventist Health’s Nov. 21 news release. Physicians say they have been told they must go through the hospital’s case management system to speak with a patient’s family members. The case management system then contacts ICE for permission, doctors said. ICE can say no, they said.

Community advocates have voiced concern about the hospital’s approach and say this recent statement, while welcomed, doesn’t go far enough.

Raquel Roman, executive director of Proyecto Pastoral, which operates the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network, said that while the organization recognizes White Memorial’s efforts, they want the hospital to “set clear rules prohibiting agents from entering patient care areas.”

“At a time when moral clarity is needed, leaving these decisions to individual care teams creates grave ambiguity. Hospitals need to be havens of healing,” Roman said.

“When people are scared to seek life-saving care, there is no impartial position. We cherish our collaboration with White Memorial. But we can’t stand by and watch while our neighbors have to decide between their safety and health,” she added.

The news release also underscores the community’s clout following outrage over the doctors’ complaints.

Since the story was published, community stakeholders who are part of the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network presented demands at a Nov. 5 meeting with hospital leaders, including Kerry Heinrich, the president and chief executive officer of Adventist Health System, and John Raffoul, president of Adventist Health White Memorial.

As part of those demands, the network — which is made up of residents and community leaders from organizations like Legacy LA, InnerCity Struggle and Centro CSO — wants immigration agents out of patient rooms during medical consultations and procedures.

In response, White Memorial, in a Nov. 12 memo, thanked community leaders for sharing their concerns and outlined five key points, which noted that every patient’s privacy is protected, that doctors and nurses make care decisions together with patients, that law enforcement officers can’t interfere with medical care, and that when there is a medical reason to contact a family, “our team can do that through the right process.”

Members of the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network said the memo fell short. While a “good first attempt,” they said it contained “a lot of gray area” and was doing the “bare minimum.” As a hospital, “they already should be protecting patients’ privacy,” said Henry Perez, executive director of InnerCity Struggle.

Adventist Health said the statement combines existing practices with recent changes made in response to community concerns. The updated signage referenced in the news release will be printed and posted by Monday evening, they said.

“We have and will continue to review our policies and practices – including those guiding detainee and patient privacy – so that every patient, family member, and staff member at White Memorial feels safe and respected in our hospital,” according to the press release.

One of L.A.’s biggest homeless service providers has been awarded over $100 million in taxpayer funds while failing to comply with federal audit mandates, according to an LAist review of federal government records.

The downtown L.A.-based nonprofit Weingart Center is at the heart of a controversial property purchase under federal investigation and discussed in a recent criminal indictment of the developer who sold the property.

LAist found Weingart Center also has been continuously out of compliance with federal deadlines to turn in audits — known as “single audits” — since early 2022, based on a review of records in the federal database where they have to be uploaded.

The audits for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 were each finished a year and a half after the federal deadlines, according to the dates on those reviews. The audits show multiple failures by Weingart Center to properly account for taxpayer money that were not remedied from one year to the next.

The group still has not filed an audit that was due nine months ago for its fiscal year ending in April 2024, according to the federal database and L.A.’s regional homeless services agency.

Consequences for failing to turn in a single audit by the deadline can be significant. Federal agencies can cut off any further funds to groups that are overdue, and L.A.’s homeless services agency can do the same, according to a contract with Weingart Center.

Weingart Center has received over $100 million in taxpayer funds while it’s been out of compliance with turning in the audits, according to its latest public tax filing and an LAist review of the audits.

Among the funds the group received while out of compliance is a $9 million no-bid contract L.A. Mayor Karen Bass’ office directed officials to award Weingart Center in 2023 to run the largest shelter site in her signature homelessness program.

A Weingart Center audit also was overdue when the mayor and state officials greenlit the group’s taxpayer-funded purchase of a senior living facility in Cheviot Hills. Federal prosecutors earlier this month announced charges against the man who sold the property to Weingart Center.

Former state Sen. Kevin Murray, who has been Weingart Center’s president and CEO since 2011, has not returned LAist’s messages seeking comment.

Murray and Weingart Center’s chief of real estate development, Ben Rosen, have been placed on leave, according to the L.A. Times. Rosen also has not responded to LAist’s request for comment.

The nonprofit’s board has commissioned an outside investigation into the valuation of housing projects, Weingart Center spokesperson Stefan Friedman told LAist. He did not respond to questions about the audit failures.

Murray previously served in the state Legislature with Bass, who has not responded to a request for comment for this story.

Murray is an attorney and a licensed real estate broker. In addition to leading Weingart Center, he also has a local government role overseeing homelessness spending in the region.

Bass appointed him to the board that oversees hundreds of millions a year in government spending on housing and other programs from the Measure A tax approved by L.A. County voters last year.

The spending panel — known as LACAHSA — oversees just over a third of the roughly $1 billion expected to be generated each year from Measure A. Its job is to create new affordable homes, preserve existing lower-rent housing and prevent people from losing the housing they already have.

This September, Bass also nominated Rosen — the Weignart Center real estate chief — to the spending board as an alternative city appointee to step in when Murray can’t attend. She withdrew that nomination a few days after federal authorities announced their investigation into the property flip.

‘Disappointed’ it wasn’t caught sooner

A large share of the federal money Weingart Center received was distributed by the L.A. Homeless Services Authority, a joint city-county agency known as LAHSA.

LAHSA’s contract requirements say its vendors, like Weingart Center, have to comply with the single audit requirements in federal law. Those requirements say organizations that receive a certain amount of federal money — such as Weingart Center — have to submit the audits within nine months after their fiscal year ends.

Single audits are “the single most important way” to assess an organization’s ability to manage federal dollars, federal officials say.

Among other things, they check whether a group has an accounting system to accurately document the spending.

Weingart Center was long overdue turning in two annual audits for 2023 and 2024 to LAHSA when LAist contacted LAHSA on Oct. 23.

Weingart Center has since submitted its 2023 audit to LAHSA, but the 2024 audit remains overdue.

“We are currently evaluating options regarding next steps,” LAHSA spokesperson Ahmad Chapman told LAist on Nov. 20.

LAHSA’s new interim CEO, Gita O’Neill, told LAist she’s “disappointed” the homeless services authority didn’t catch Weingart Center’s late audits earlier and that she’s been working to beef up oversight of contractors.

O’Neill said LAHSA sent a notice of non-compliance to Weingart Center about the overdue audit and is reviewing the late-submitted audits to see “if additional action is needed.”

At the October meeting of LAHSA’s governing commission, O’Neill shared a plan to improve the agency’s oversight of contracts, which she told LAist will strengthen oversight over issues like single audits. O’Neill, who started at LAHSA in late August, said the reorganization plan would roll out publicly in a few weeks later.

“Every member of this reorganized team will receive training for their new role so we can more effectively hold our [service] providers to the standards we set for them,” O’Neill said. “This is an important step toward holding ourselves and our providers more accountable.”

What state officials say

Aside from LAHSA, the other major agency awarding federal dollars to Weingart Center is the state’s Department of Housing & Community Development, or HCD.

Records show HCD awarded tens of millions of dollars in federally funded grants to Weingart Center under the state’s Homekey program while the group has been out of compliance with turning in the audits.

In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for HCD said Weingart Center was not out of compliance with its award-granting process, which the agency called “very thorough.”

HCD’s agreement with Weingart Center for a 2024 grant says the nonprofit is responsible for complying with the single audit requirements.

The HCD spokesperson said the state housing agency is not responsible for reviewing the federal audits. Instead, the spokesperson said the audits are received and reviewed by the state controller’s office, which then identifies issues and discusses them with HCD.

The controller’s office told LAist it did not receive single audits from Weingart Center or any other nonprofit.

Problems found in latest available audit

The most recent available single audit of Weingart Center, covering fiscal year 2023, was not completed until July 2025, a year and a half after it was due.

That audit report, which LAist obtained from LAHSA, said Weingart Center followed the most important requirements for nonprofits receiving federal funds but also found a range of accounting failures.

The problems identified by auditors included:

Weingart Center did not include over $50 million in federally funded grants, via HCD’s Homekey program, on the list of federal dollars it handled. The review also found Weingart Center failed to have its financial records checked for accuracy by someone who didn’t prepare them, auditors wrote.

Weingart Center did not have an accounting team with enough experience or size to handle housing developments, the review found — despite the problem being flagged in the prior year’s audit. This was one of six problems identified in the previous year's audit that the 2023 audit showed as ongoing.

Other repeat issues flagged by the audit include Weingart Center failing to properly document money coming into the organization, management failing to catch errors in how it was accounting for money and failing to document how it picked vendors — including the general contractor for a Homekey housing project.

The Weingart Shelby purchase

Weingart Center has been the focus of recent controversy over its use of $27 million in taxpayer funds to buy a senior housing complex from an investor who had just purchased it for less than half that price.

As Weingart Center’s leader, Murray signed key documents in the purchase of the property on Shelby Drive in Cheviot Hills, according to contract records produced by the city in response to LAist public records requests. The documents he signed include a purchase agreement in which he agreed to have Weingart Center keep the seller’s name confidential forever from the news media and general public, with narrow exceptions.

That purchase now is the focus of a federal investigation and was referenced in an October indictment of the man who sold the property to Weingart Center. It was funded by the state’s Homekey program and the city of L.A.

Murray previously told the L.A. Times he had “no prior relationship with the seller and no continuing relationship” and that taxpayers paid fair market price. He has not returned LAist’s messages seeking comment on the property deal.

LAist also has been investigating the sale of the Shelby property and found numerous discrepancies. They include an appraisal report Murray commissioned and submitted for taxpayer funding that showed false information about the purchase deal and the property’s ownership.

Price concerns about another Murray-led project under same state grant program

The Shelby purchase is not the only Weingart Center property deal that has faced scrutiny.

This summer, city leaders in Torrance publicly alleged the group may have been massively overpaying for a hotel property under a new round of taxpayer-funded Homekey grants. For that site, Weingart Center had teamed up with L.A. County to apply for the grant.

It was one of several criticisms Torrance officials cited in urging the county not to proceed. Ultimately, the project was canceled.

Records show Murray had signed a purchase agreement for Weingart Center to buy the Torrance hotel for $30 million in taxpayer funds. An appraisal he later commissioned found its fair market value was close to the amount he agreed to.

But an appraisal commissioned by Torrance estimated it was worth just $10 million — a third of what Weingart had agreed to pay with taxpayer dollars.

Property valuations are being reviewed by the outside law firm hired by Weingart Center’s board, according to the nonprofit’s spokesperson.

Officials at the county government’s housing agency, known as LACDA, say the appraisal Weingart Center submitted for the Torrance purchase “was conducted by a reputable appraisal company and did not raise concerns.”

Torrance officials, meanwhile, said they had “serious concerns” about how much taxpayers would be paying.

City leaders sent a letter urging the state to reject the grant application.

“SNAP benefits ensure Washingtonians, including seniors, children, and people living with disabilities, have enough to eat every day,” Brown said.
The attorneys general argue that USDA’s memo illegally rewrites those rules and threatens to cut off food assistance for people who are fully eligible under the law.
The attorneys general argue that USDA’s guidance also misapplies the agency’s own regulations.
The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate the unlawful guidance and block its implementation to ensure that families do not lose critical food assistance.","Washington Attorney General Nick Brown today joined 21 other attorneys general in filing a lawsuit to stop the federal government from unlawfully cutting off Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for thousands of lawful permanent residents. Brown and the coalition are seeking to block new guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that wrongly treats several groups of legal immigrants as ineligible for food assistance, including permanent residents who were granted asylum or admitted as refugees. The attorneys general argue that the guidance contradicts federal law and could impose massive financial penalties on states, and are asking the court to declare the guidance unlawful.

“SNAP benefits ensure Washingtonians, including seniors, children, and people living with disabilities, have enough to eat every day,” Brown said. “Now, without any warning or legal basis, USDA is trying to rip these benefits away from green card holders in our communities. We will fight this illegal move and protect SNAP for Washingtonians.”

On October 31, USDA issued new guidance to state SNAP agencies describing changes to program eligibility under H.R. 1 or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which narrowed eligibility for certain non-citizen groups, including refugees, asylum recipients, and others admitted under humanitarian protection programs. The USDA memo, however, incorrectly asserted that all individuals who entered the country through these humanitarian pathways would remain permanently ineligible for SNAP, even after obtaining green cards and becoming lawful permanent residents.

Federal statutes make clear that refugees, asylees, humanitarian parolees, individuals whose deportation has been withheld, and other vulnerable legal immigrants become eligible for SNAP once they obtain their green cards and meet standard program requirements. The attorneys general argue that USDA’s memo illegally rewrites those rules and threatens to cut off food assistance for people who are fully eligible under the law.

The attorneys general argue that USDA’s guidance also misapplies the agency’s own regulations. Federal rules give states a 120-day grace period after new guidance is issued to adjust their systems without facing severe financial penalties. USDA is now claiming that this period expired on November 1, just one day after the guidance was released and before states even had a single business day to review it. The coalition argues that this interpretation is impossible under USDA’s own regulations, which state that the 120-day period cannot begin until new guidance is actually issued. And because the statute also imposes a cost-shifting framework on the SNAP program for states that USDA determines have unacceptable error rates in administering the program, by disregarding its own rules, USDA is exposing states to major financial penalties for errors caused by the agency’s late and inaccurate memo.

States have already begun implementing the statutory changes enacted earlier this year, but USDA’s abrupt and incorrect guidance now forces them to overhaul eligibility systems overnight. The attorneys general warn that this will create widespread confusion for families, increase the risk of wrongful benefit terminations, erode public trust, and place states in an untenable situation where they must either violate federal law or accept severe financial liability. The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate the unlawful guidance and block its implementation to ensure that families do not lose critical food assistance.

Joining Brown in this lawsuit, which was led by the attorneys general of New York and Oregon, are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

The president filed suit against Clinton, the DNC, Comey and 25 others more than three years ago, alleging they conspired to undermine his 2016 presidential campaign by accusing it of colluding with Russia.

The amended complaint alleged that Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, and her allies attempted to “discredit, delegitimize and defame” Trump by producing false or misleading documents alleging his campaign coordinated with Russia.

However, District Judge Donald Middlebrooks, an appointee of former President Clinton, ruled in January 2023 that Trump’s case “should never have been brought” and ordered the president and Habba, then his personal attorney, to pay nearly $1 million in legal fees to the defendants.

Pryor, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, wrote Wednesday that the president and Habba “give us no reason to reverse the district court’s ruling that these claims were frivolous.” Pryor’s ruling was co-signed by Circuit Judges Andrew Brasher, a Trump appointee, and Embry Kidd, an appointee of former President Biden.

Bruna Caroline Ferreira, who arrived from Brazil as a young child in 1998 with her parents, was taken into custody in Revere, Mass., and is accused by the Department of Homeland Security of overstaying her tourist visa.

Ferreira, 33, shares an 11-year-old son with Leavitt’s older brother, Michael, and the two share joint custody of the child, Ferreira’s attorney, Todd Pomerleau told USA TODAY. The couple was engaged about 12 years ago -and eventually broke up.

A DHS spokesperson described Ferreira as a ""criminal illegal alien"" with a ""previous arrest for battery"" without providing details.

Pomerleau said Ferreira, who is being held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Louisiana, was in the final stages of getting her green card, with the last interview scheduled for the spring.

“She didn't commit a crime. She wasn't breaking the law. She was following the laws Congress created for her to get a green card, and she got detained with no justification,” said Pomerleau. “That's illegal.”

Ferriera, whom Pomerleau described as a highly involved mother who spent multiple days with her son every week, said she was on her way in the afternoon to pick her son up from school in southern New Hampshire, which is about 35 minutes from where she lives.

“She drove away from her home, and then she was pulled over, and she thought it was a traffic stop. She was apparently asked who she was and then she was arrested,” said Pomerleau. “I'm just worried about her getting out in time for Thanksgiving, which I don't think is happening unless she gets a Thanksgiving surprise.”

Pomerleau said Leavitt is “hopefully able to convince the president” to let her brother’s ex-fiancé “out of jail.”

Leavitt did not provide comments to USA TODAY but a source familiar with the dynamics between the two women said they haven't spoken to each other in years.

The source also said the that child has lived full time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born, and that he had never resided with his mother.

Meanwhile, Ferreira’s sister Graziela DosSantos Rodrigues, has started a GoFundMe page to raise money for her sister's legal bills. The effort had raised more than $17,000 as of Nov. 26 at 10 a.m.

“Bruna’s absence has been especially painful for her 11-year-old son, Michael Leavitt Junior, who needs his mother and hopes every single day that she’ll be home in time for the holidays,"" says Rodrigues on the GoFundMe page.

The Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration has led to a record number of arrests. In less than a year, the number of people detained in ICE facilities is up by 50%, according to the American Immigration Council.

Currently, the Department of Homeland Security has jailed close to 60,000 people and ""the administration’s push for mass detentions and deportations has led to overcrowding as most facilities now exceed their contractualcapacity,"" according to the AIC.

Ferriera was a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program recipient under the Obama administration, which allowed young, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to live and work legally. After the first Trump administration sought to terminate it, legal challenges have made the process long-winding.

So Ferriera, who owns and operates a cleaning service business and online clothing, decided to pursue the green card path, her lawyer said.

“She has done everything in her power to build a stable, honest life here,"" wrote Rodrigues, her sister, on her GoFundMe page. ""She has maintained her legal status through DACA, followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing. There's no rhyme or reason to what's happening here.""

“Across the country, poor and working-class migrant families are facing a wave of state-sponsored abductions, violence, and political policing under the fascist Trump administration.
Corporations that choose to partner with, advertise on, bankroll, or provide critical infrastructure to ICE are not neutral; they are complicit.”","A Gen Z-led advocacy group fighting for working-class priorities on Tuesday announced a boycott campaign targeting major corporations “that enable, profit from, or directly collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the broader racist policies of the Trump administration.”

Beyond the Ballot launched “Not With My Dollars: ICE Out of My Wallet” as President Donald Trump’s violent crackdown on immigrants in diverse communities across the United States continues and just days before Black Friday kicks off the winter holiday shopping season.

“We cannot out-organize a fascist administration while simultaneously bankrolling the companies profiting from its cruelty,” said Victor Rivera, the organization’s executive director, in a statement. “Every dollar spent at a complicit corporation is a dollar funding the abduction and disappearance of our neighbors. It’s time to make corporate complicity unprofitable, for good.”

The group is taking aim at e-commerce behemoth Amazon and its grocery subsidiary, Whole Foods; tech giants Dell and Microsoft; Home Depot; streaming platform Spotify; and retail chain Target. The boycott webpage explains the reason each is listed, actions shoppers should take, and the campaign’s demands. In some cases, it also offers alternative companies.

Target is under fire for its “broad range of cooperation with the Trump administration’s racist policies.” The campaign is calling on the company to not only publicly commit to refusing collaboration with ICE but also immediately reinstate its scrapped diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.

Spotify is on the list for airing ICE recruitment ads — a decision that also recently prompted a boycott call from the group Indivisible.

The campaign site calls out Home Depot because it has “repeatedly allowed ICE agents to patrol and detain workers and customers in its parking lots and stores, usually without presenting judicial warrants or establishing probable cause,” and demands an end to those practices.

The group is urging Microsoft to end its “$19.4 million contract with ICE to provide artificial intelligence capabilities and processing data.” The Dell section highlights that it has provided $18.8 million to “support the office of ICE’s chief information officer through the purchase of Microsoft enterprise software licenses,” and similarly calls for terminating that contract with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Amazon section states:

REASON: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the digital backbone of ICE’s machinery, selling the cloud power that helps track, target, and tear families apart.

ACTION: Stop shopping on Amazon where possible; cancel Prime subscriptions if feasible; push universities, unions, nonprofits, and campaigns to move off AWS when and where feasible, and to issue statements condemning Amazon’s role in corporate-sponsored mass deportations.

DEMAND: End all ICE/DHS immigration enforcement contracts and data hosting that enable deportations; adopt a binding human-rights policy banning support for immigration policing.

ALTERNATIVES: Bookshop.org and local bookstores; direct-from-brand purchasing; cooperatives; independent retailers.

The site also stresses that “every dollar spent at Whole Foods directly strengthens Amazon, whose AWS platform is the digital backbone of ICE’s machinery, powering the tools used to track, target, and tear families apart.”

While the campaign is beginning just before Black Friday, boycott organizers aim to ensure it will “not disappear” after this week.

“Unlike other consumer boycotts, Not With My Dollars is designed for long-term pressure and escalation,” Beyond the Ballot said. “To be removed from the boycott list, each targeted corporation must fulfill the specific demands outlined for its company. Anything less is not accountability, just more corporate PR.”

“If you bankroll a violent, unaccountable agency that terrorizes our communities, you will not do it with our money,” the group added. “Across the country, poor and working-class migrant families are facing a wave of state-sponsored abductions, violence, and political policing under the fascist Trump administration. Corporations that choose to partner with, advertise on, bankroll, or provide critical infrastructure to ICE are not neutral; they are complicit.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1168248878-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 14:56:40.457479

While a sizable part of the People’s House was reduced to rubble, the Trump administration also took a wrecking ball to another fundamental part of our democracy: the people’s ownership of governance.

In a dry, technical memo, an obscure agency, deep in the seat of federal power, declared the end of public input into the most disputed, controversial and consequential federal rules.

Our right to breathe clean air, to be treated fairly and transparently when we buy a home or take out a car loan, and to be free from discrimination at school or in the workplace is now based entirely on the caprice of a deep-state bureaucrat.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) — which acts as the president’s drum major across the federal government, setting standards and enforcing discipline — issued this blueprint for the destruction of protections, rights and freedoms.

OMB told agencies that so long as they could make a case that the rule was illegal, whether or not a court had weighed in, they could roll back any rule. It told agencies to cut the public out, to not consult with state or local governments and to downplay the costs of a rule’s rollback.

For an administration that claims to be the people’s champion against an out-of-control deep state bureaucracy, this was deeply cynical.

Federal rules touch nearly everything: whether your child’s school is accessible, whether your doctor’s office has the right equipment, whether your information stays private online.

For decades, agencies have, as required by law, given the public, individuals and businesses, states, tribes and local governments, a chance to comment on and meet with the agency to discuss proposed rules. Only after the agency has reviewed all that information and considered the impact of the proposed rule can it go into effect.

Now, by administrative fiat, OMB has told agencies to dispense with gathering information altogether. The new directive largely permits agencies to demolish any rule without a public process.

We have spent much of our careers making sure that federal rules take into account the perspectives and experiences of ordinary people.

When a team working under one of us developed major rules at the Department of Justice — like the ones making websites accessible or ensuring that diagnostic equipment works for all bodies — they didn’t do it alone. They considered comments from people who knew what it was like to be locked out of a website or to not be weighed when they went to the doctor.

When the other helped shape rules governing the mortgage market at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, people who had lost their home to foreclosure as well as bankers, investors and lawyers were heard during the process.

Good rulemaking is done out in the open. It requires a conversation between the governed and the governing, subject to scrutiny and oversight.

An open rulemaking process isn’t symbolic. It forces agencies to consider opposing views. It limits agency overreach. And it invites scrutiny from courts, watchdogs and the public. Without public engagement, we risk regulating without rigor, repealing without reason and governing without accountability.

Both of the pending redistricting cases in Wisconsin argue that the state’s congressional maps, first adopted in 2011, are an unconstitutional gerrymander favoring Republicans.

“Hand picking circuit court judges to perform political maneuvering is unimaginable,” Justice Annette Ziegler wrote.
The U.S. Supreme Court in March 2022 declined to block them from taking effect.","MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Nov. 25 ordered a pair of three-judge panels to hear two lawsuits that argue the battleground state’s congressional maps must be redrawn because they unconstitutionally favor Republicans.

The court’s minority conservative justices blasted the creation of the three-judge panels as unimaginable political maneuvering designed to benefit Democrats. It’s unclear whether new districts could be ordered in time for the 2026 midterms as some Democrats want.

The court battle in Wisconsin is playing out amid a national redistricting battle as President Donald Trump is trying to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in the 2026 elections.

Both of the pending redistricting cases in Wisconsin argue that the state’s congressional maps, first adopted in 2011, are an unconstitutional gerrymander favoring Republicans. Six of the state’s eight districts are currently held by Republicans.

Law firms that brought the pending cases in Wisconsin had argued over objections from Republicans that the cases should be heard by three-judge panels as required under a 2011 law passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by then-Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican. Any decisions of those panels can be appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.

The court’s rulings to proceed with the three-judge panels were 5-2, with conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn agreeing with liberal justices that the panels were appropriate. But Hagedorn objected to the court assigning the judges to hear the cases, saying a more neutral process should have been used.

“I am not suggesting the judicial panel will fail to do its job with integrity and impartiality,” Hagedorn wrote. “But this approach is an odd choice in the face of a statute so clearly designed to deter litigants from selecting their preferred venue and judge.”

One case will be heard by judges from Dane, Portage and Marathon counties. All three of the judges endorsed Justice Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race, and two of them were appointed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.

The other case will be heard by judges from Dane, Milwaukee and Outagamie counties. Two of the judges endorsed the liberal Crawford in 2025 and the third was appointed by Evers.

The two dissenting conservative justices blasted the court’s ruling creating the panels.

“Hand picking circuit court judges to perform political maneuvering is unimaginable,” Justice Annette Ziegler wrote. “Yet, my colleagues persist and appear to do this, all in furtherance of delivering partisan, political advantage to the Democratic Party.”

The Supreme Court did not address the underlying arguments of the lawsuit, only the procedural question of whether the cases should first be heard by three-judge panels.

The lawsuits argue that the state’s current congressional district boundary lines are unconstitutional and need to be redrawn. One case was brought by a bipartisan coalition of business leaders and the other was filed on behalf of voters by the liberal Elias Law Group.

Abha Khanna, a partner with Elias Law Group, said the ruling was a “positive development” in the fight for new maps before the 2026 midterms.

Doug Poland, an attorney with Law Forward which represents the business group, said he looked forward to “delivering competitive congressional maps for the voters of Wisconsin,” but didn’t give a timeframe.

Wisconsin’s six Republican members of Congress also argued that two of the four liberal Wisconsin Supreme Court justices who accepted millions of dollars in campaign donations from the state Democratic Party should not participate in the cases. But both Crawford and Justice Janet Protasiewicz declined to step aside.

Republicans hold six of the state’s eight U.S. House seats, but only two of those districts are considered competitive. In 2010, the year before Republicans redrew the congressional maps, Democrats held five seats compared with three for Republicans.

The current congressional maps, which were based on the previous ones, were approved by the state Supreme Court when it was controlled by conservative judges. The U.S. Supreme Court in March 2022 declined to block them from taking effect.

Democrats are pushing to have the current maps redrawn in ways that would put two of the six seats currently held by Republicans into play. One they hope to flip is the western Wisconsin seat of Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who won in 2022 after longtime Democratic Rep. Ron Kind retired. Van Orden won reelection in the 3rd District in 2024.

The other seat they are eyeing is southeastern Wisconsin’s 1st District, held by Republican Rep. Bryan Steil since 2019. The latest maps made that district more competitive while still favoring Republicans.",https://wisconsinpublictv.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/courts-scowi-elections-redistricting-panels-20220711.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 11:58:30.426855

The operative ingredients are now in place for President DONALD TRUMP, should he choose, to strike land targets in Venezuela. But that window of opportunity — or at least the best chance of a strike pushing Venezuelan leader NICOLÁS MADURO to step down — may not last.

The administration’s decision to designate Cartel de los Soles a foreign terrorist group on Monday offers some semblance of legal justification for the military to conduct land-based strikes. (The U.S. accuses Maduro of leading the criminal network tied to Venezuelan elites.) There are also plenty of military assets — from ships to jets to U.S. servicemembers — now nearby to carry out strikes and rattle the Venezuelan powerbrokers surrounding Maduro.

It also doesn’t hurt that it’s a crescent moon for the next few days, enhancing the stealth capabilities of U.S. forces. Lower light works in the favor of nighttime attacks and the moon’s expansion may scramble plans.

Per JAMES STORY, who served as U.S. ambassador to Venezuela and head of the Venezuelan Affairs Unit at the U.S. embassy in Colombia during the first Trump and Biden administrations, said opting not to strike would at this point boost Maduro’s standing and make it much harder to dislodge him in the future.

“It certainly will strengthen his hand,” Story told NatSec Daily. “He will have been seen as staring down the U.S. government and winning.” Maduro is likely to be emboldened while the opposition will be demoralized and fractured, he added.

That said, it’s not clear the U.S. president wants to use military force against Venezuela at this moment. Axios reported Monday night that Trump wants to speak directly with Maduro, prompting some analysts to speculate Trump may ultimately cut a deal with Venezuela. (Story and others see it as a potential opportunity for Trump to issue an ultimatum to Maduro instead.)

And there’s plenty of reason for the president not to strike. Striking Venezuela would represent a major break in how the U.S. typically deals with hostile nations, especially those that haven’t previously directly attacked the U.S. or its servicemembers. It’s also far from guaranteed that strikes will result in Maduro ceding power — regardless of whether they come sooner or later. And it’s unclear what the day after would look like.

And successive polls show that Americans, broadly speaking, oppose U.S. strikes on Venezuela and any effort by the U.S. to directly provoke regime change in the South American petrostate. That includes plenty of people in the MAGA movement, who are skeptical of U.S. military adventurism around the world in the wake of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

Nevertheless, a sense of anticipation is growing among Cuban and Venezuelan exiles in south Florida, where your host finds himself spending the holiday with family. Popular livestreams in Miami and Doral are tracking the movements of U.S. military jets in the region. Many Cubans and Venezuelans who have backed Secretary of State MARCO RUBIO throughout his political career are expressing their optimism that Trump and the nation’s top diplomat will oust a leader they decry as an autocrat.

“Maduro is not a brave boy,” said Rep. MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR (R-Fla.), who represents Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood in Congress, in a Fox Business interview. “He’s understanding we’re about to go in.”

The Inbox

PEACE, NO MATTER WHAT: While Ukrainian officials and European allies scrambled to navigate the chaotic negotiations over the U.S.-backed peace plan that unfolded over the past week, Trump had only one goal in mind: end the war, no matter the details.

Ukrainians and Europeans had balked at the original 28-point peace plan, arguing that the proposal, which would have handed Russia swathes of Ukrainian territory, outlined a better deal for Moscow than Kyiv. But Trump has no such red lines, White House officials told our own Diana Nerozzi in a story out today.

“The ultimate goal is peace. That’s the most important thing that can be achieved here. Stop the fighting, stop the killing. Those are the main things he wants out of this,” a senior White House official told Diana. That underlying drive explains the administration’s oftentimes haphazard approach to negotiations — which one day appeared to be led by Army Secretary DAN DRISCOLL, and the next by Rubio.

Driscoll is back at the helm today, leading negotiations with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi on a revised peace proposal that emerged from the weekend’s haggling between U.S. and Ukrainian delegations in Geneva, our own Paul McLeary reports. The new plan omits any reference to territorial issues, leaving those up for discussion at the presidential level somewhere down the line.

Meanwhile, Trump said in a social media post today that he’d directed special envoy STEVE WITKOFF to meet with Russian leader VLADIMIR PUTIN in Moscow “in the hopes of finalizing this peace plan.”

DARING DRONES: Drone incursions into NATO are getting deeper — and bolder.

Romanian officials said NATO scrambled fighter jets today in response to the deepest drone incursion in Romanian airspace yet, and the first breach that took place in broad daylight rather than the cover of night, Reuters reports. Today’s incursion was the 13th such violation Romania has reported since Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022.

German jets initially took off to track an aircraft that had crossed into the country’s southeastern county of Tulcea before eventually heading back into Ukraine, according to the Romanian defense ministry. Later, the Romanian army scrambled two of its F-16 fighter jets and an additional two Eurofighters to track a drone in the neighboring county of Galati.

Romanian Defense Minister IONUT MOSTEANU called the breach a “Russian provocation,” adding that he believed the NATO pilots decided not to shoot down the latter drone over concerns that it might cause damage on the ground. The drone ultimately appeared to have crashed on its own, Mosteanu said.

Gen. CHRISTOPHER DONAHUE, commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa, said during a visit to U.S. troops at Romania’s MIHAIL KOGALNICEANU air base today that a new capability to shoot down drones had been tested and was in the “final stages of being employed” in the country.

TRUMP-TAKAICHI CALL MYSTERY: Trump spoke today with Japanese Prime Minister SANAE TAKAICHI. Tokyo’s readout of the call suggested that China — whose leader XI JINPING Trump spoke with Monday — was a key topic. Trump briefed Takaichi “on the latest situation of U.S.-China relations,” according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.

The White House hasn’t published a summary of the call and didn’t respond to NatSec Daily’s requests for a readout of the two leaders’ discussion.

Beijing has been on an aggressive campaign against Takaichi, including economic reprisals, for saying earlier this month that Chinese aggression against Taiwan would likely spark a Japanese military response. U.S. Ambassador to Japan GEORGE GLASS has sparred with Chinese propagandists seeking to demonize Takaichi.

“Coercion is a hard habit to break for Beijing. But just as the United States stood by Japan during China’s last unwarranted ban on Japanese seafood, we will be there for our ally again this time,” Glass posted on X last week.

But Trump himself has been silent on Beijing’s attacks on Takaichi, puzzling Japan watchers.

“The Japanese view is that this is not good enough — with their leader’s reputation and political standing on the line, they would like a leader-level statement for a leader-level problem,” said KURT TONG, deputy chief of mission and chargé d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo from 2011 to 2014.

NatSec Daily asked the White House why Trump hasn’t spoken on the issue, but didn’t hear back.

Democrats sense political capital in the absence of White House pushback against Beijing’s anti-Takaichi rhetoric. “President Trump has refused to push back against Chinese intimidation,” said Rep. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-Texas), co-chair of the U.S.-Japan Congressional Caucus. “The president is desperately seeking a meeting with Xi Jinping and abandoning Japan, our closest ally in Asia.”

Keystrokes

PLANKEY POPULARITY: A collection of powerful technology and cybersecurity trade groups is pushing for the Senate to confirm Trump’s pick to direct the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as his nomination faces resistance in the upper chamber.

The Information Technology Industry Council, Alliance for Digital Innovation, Center for Procurement Advocacy and the Cybersecurity Coalition penned a letter to Senate leadership, shared exclusively with our own Dana Nickel in today’s Morning Cybersecurity (for Pros!). In the missive, the groups write that SEAN PLANKEY’s confirmation must go through to restore “needed leadership” at CISA.

Not only is Plankey “prepared to meet [the] challenge” of heading up the cyber agency, but continuing to delay filling the role “runs counter to the national security interests of the United States,” the groups write.

But the show of support from industry groups isn’t likely to tip the scale in Plankey’s favor. Trump’s pick to lead CISA is facing stiff resistance from Senate Republicans, some of whom are withholding support for Plankey while others are more broadly apathetic when it comes to the cyber agency in general.

Our own John Sakellariadis reported last week (also for Pros!) that cybersecurity officials are increasingly worried that Plankey won’t be confirmed by the end of this year, meaning the White House would have to resubmit his nomination in 2026. Further delays could make operations even more difficult at CISA, which has already faced significant turmoil with massive staffing cuts.

The trade groups sent the letter to Majority Leader JOHN THUNE, Minority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER, and chair and ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, RAND PAUL (R-Ky.) and GARY PETERS (D-Mich.). None of the senators responded to Morning Cyber’s request for comment on the letter.

The Complex

SIGN OF LIFE: The Trump administration’s Golden Dome missile defense project is gearing up again after prolonged delays caused by the government shutdown and a lack of clarity on plans for the project, our colleagues at Morning Defense report today (for Pros!).

The Space Force is set to issue requests for proposals from companies on space-based interceptors for the defense shield on Dec. 7, according to a new notice. The interceptors can destroy missiles in the midcourse phase of flight, after the missile’s booster burns out. According to experts, that’s the best time to halt missiles from space, our colleagues write.

The notice added that the Defense Department could use “prize competitions” for the award, meaning companies would invest in building prototypes to compete for prize amounts in hopes that they could eventually win a production contract.

On the Hill

UNDER INVESTIGATION: The Trump administration appears to be escalating its campaign against the six Democratic lawmakers who released a video encouraging troops to resist illegal orders, our own Nicholas Wu reports.

In a joint statement today, Democratic Reps. JASON CROW (Colo.) and MAGGIE GOODLANDER (N.H.), alongside CHRIS DELUZIO and CHRISSY HOULAHAN of Pennsylvania said the FBI had put in a request with the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms for interviews with the lawmakers. The lawmakers bashed Trump for “using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass members of Congress,” adding that “we will not be bullied” into submission.

In a separate post, Sen. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-Mich.) wrote that the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division “appeared to open an inquiry” into her over her participation in the video. “The President directing the FBI to target us is exactly why we made this video in the first place,” Slotkin wrote.

The Pentagon announced Monday that it is investigating Navy veteran and Arizona Sen. MARK KELLY, another Democrat featured in the video, for “serious allegations of misconduct.” Trump has railed against the group of six lawmakers, claiming their video amounted to “sedition” and could be punishable by death.

The Senate and House Sergeants at Arms offices did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a spokesperson for the FBI.

Broadsides

DOUBTING DONALD: Trump has claimed that he can end the war in Ukraine. Brits aren’t so sure.

Think tank More in Common shared with our colleagues at London Playbook today their findings that 47 percent of British voters think Trump is an obstacle to stopping the war. Twenty-one percent said they thought he gave peacemaking efforts a boost, while just over 21 percent said he was neither helpful nor harmful. Eleven percent said they didn’t know.

The poll surveyed 2,062 British adults between Nov. 22-24, while U.S. and Ukrainian officials held talks on a peace agreement in Geneva. The margin of error for the poll was 2.2 percentage points.

A broad coalition of groups from across Canada is sounding an urgent alarm in advance of a critical parliamentary vote on Bill C-12.

The bill would open the door to discrimination and violations of human rights and due process in Canada’s immigration system, authorize sharing of sensitive personal immigration information, and expand dangerous approaches to drug policy. Yet it is being pushed through parliament with minimal debate while those that will be impacted by its sweeping changes are locked out of the process.

“This deeply concerning and highly controversial legislation will put many refugees in danger, risking their return to persecution in violation of rights protected under the Charter and international law,” said Gauri Sreenivasan, Co-Executive Director of the Canadian Council of Refugees. “And yet the bill is moving at break neck speed through Parliament while those with expertise and lived experience who want to advise on its dangers are shut out of the process. Neither the law nor the public interest is being served.”

The bill will deny many refugees access to fair and independent assessment and full appeal of their claims by the Immigration and Refugee Board because of arbitrary time limits and exclusions. This approach will not streamline Canada’s processing of refugee claims, but will lead to lower quality decisions while shifting backlogs to our already overburdened Federal Courts and to IRCC.

The bill will also compound harm arising from the Canada-US Safe Third Country Agreement, which abandons many refugees to the U.S. immigration system at a time when well documented human rights violations have become the dominant feature of that system.

”Bill C-12 would deny protection to vulnerable people irrespective of changes to their personal circumstances or political conditions back home. So many people like me, who sought safety here and have made lives here, would be shut out by this Bill. This isn’t just policy, it’s people’s lives,” said Tonny Muzira, Co-Founder & Director of Advocacy and Partnerships Centre for Black Development Options Canada. “Canada cannot turn its back on those seeking safety.”

Under Bill C-12, the government will also be able to cancel or suspend immigration documents and applications based on an undefined assessment of the “public interest”. This power grants dangerous discretionary power to the government without any individualized assessment or procedural safeguards.

“The bill sets up open-ended powers with little thought to the consequences and inevitable abuse”, said Louis-Philippe Jannard, of the Table de concertation des organismes au service des personnes réfugiées et immigrantes (TCRI). “We haven’t seen such broad, discretionary powers in our immigration system since the 1970’s, when their abuse led to rampant discrimination and fatal decisions.”

Bill C-12 would also authorize the government to share highly sensitive immigration information with few limitations. This includes changes in gender identity and the status of any refugee claimants, exposing vulnerable people in Canada to severe risk.

“Broad dissemination of sensitive personal information can place migrants and refugees at significant risk of discrimination and persecution in Canada and abroad”, said Tamir Israel, Director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s Privacy, Surveillance and Technology Program. “Despite this significant potential for abuse, Bill C-12 lacks minimum safeguards like the need to ensure information sharing is necessary and proportionate.”

Bill C-12 also doubles down on prohibition-based drug policy that has demonstrably failed to protect public health and safety.

“Instead of funding affordable housing and other health and social supports, Canada is supporting U.S.-led militarized drug enforcement,” said Nick Boyce, from the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition. “If Canada follows this path, it will be complicit in violations of international human rights law.”

In disregard of the dire risks posed by this legislative proposal, the bill has been fast-tracked and received minimal consideration in Parliament. It is scheduled for a final vote by the Standing Committee on Public Safety tomorrow—just three weeks after its study of the bill began.

Despite the highly attenuated timeline, dozens of refugee and migrant groups, human rights groups, labour organizations, health advocacy groups, representatives of the Black community, gender based violence groups, legal professional bodies, drug policy groups and others requested to speak at committee hearings but were denied. They have also submitted briefs expressing concern regarding Bill C-12’s consequences.

These groups were largely absent from committee proceedings and MPs will not have the time to consider the long list of concerns raised by these submissions. In contrast, MPs heard repeatedly from border and policing agencies and officials. The end result is that the voices of those most impacted by Bill C-12 have not been heard.

“MPs and the public should be extremely concerned that the government is fast-tracking legislation that will only multiply the possibility of discrimination, exploitation, and violations of human rights,” said Karen Cocq of the Migrant Rights Network. “ This government got elected promising to reject Trump-style politics, but Bill C-12 is the opposite of that. This bill cannot be fixed, it must be withdrawn.”",https://www.fcjrefugeecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Our-organization-ft.png,N,,2025-11-26 10:59:27.764293

Mr. Hegseth replied a day later: “Your medals are out of order & rows reversed.","The six Democratic members of Congress who recorded a video informing troops that they could refuse illegal orders said on Tuesday that they were being investigated by the F.B.I.

The group, made up of veterans of the military and the C.I.A., said the bureau had contacted the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms requesting interviews with them, though it is unclear what, if any, laws they might conceivably have violated with their video.

“President Trump is using the F.B.I. as a tool to intimidate and harass members of Congress,” the four House members, all military veterans, who took part in the video said in a joint statement. “No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution.”

The investigation is part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration to seek retribution against the president’s perceived political enemies. It comes one day after the Pentagon said it was investigating Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona, for his participation in the same video.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a letter addressed to the Department of the Navy, requested a briefing on the status of the inquiry into Mr. Kelly by Dec. 10.

The F.B.I. inquiry into the six lawmakers is being conducted by the bureau’s counterterrorism division, according to a statement by Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who served as a C.I.A. analyst and organized the video.

“The president directing the F.B.I. to target us is exactly why we made this video in the first place,” she wrote in the statement. “He believes in weaponizing the federal government against his perceived enemies and does not believe laws apply to him or his cabinet.”

The four House members who took part in the video are Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania.

The F.B.I. declined to comment on whether it was investigating the lawmakers.

Mr. Kelly is the only member of the group being investigated by the Pentagon for a possible court martial. As a retired naval officer, he is subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and could be recalled to active duty and disciplined. The other four military veterans did not serve long enough to retire and therefore do not receive a pension or fall under military law.

Legal experts have dismissed the investigations as a transparent attempt to seek vengeance with no grounding in the law. As part of their training, U.S. troops are told that they are obligated to refuse illegal orders from their chain of command.

The lawmakers did not refer to a particular order that they viewed as illegal. But Mr. Kelly and others in the video earlier raised concerns about the fate of U.S. troops involved in the Trump administration’s strikes on boats in the Caribbean.

Some, including Ms. Slotkin, have expressed concerns that Mr. Trump might deploy active-duty U.S. military troops to American cities to crack down on or even shoot at protesters.

This summer, Ms. Slotkin reminded Mr. Hegseth that one of his predecessors, Mark T. Esper, wrote in his memoir that he had been asked by Mr. Trump during his first term why the military could not “just shoot” protesters in Washington in the legs.

Mr. Hegseth on Tuesday appeared to be focused on other matters, such as a picture that Mr. Kelly had posted on social media of his military awards.

“In combat, I had a missile blow up next to my jet and flew through anti-aircraft fire to drop bombs on enemy targets,” Mr. Kelly wrote above the photo.

Mr. Hegseth replied a day later: “Your medals are out of order & rows reversed.

November 26, 2025

The United Kingdom has experienced another summer of anti-immigration protests and riots, which have continued into the fall. This escalation has led to an increase in racist attacks across the UK. For example, in York, “two Muslim men were attacked with tennis rackets and sticks and subjected to racist abuse” by a “group of 15 balaclava-clad youths on mountain bikes” (BBC, 2025). This is just one of several hate crime incidents that happened in June. This past August, two Sikh cab drivers were attacked in Wolverhampton, leaving one man with broken ribs and the second man needing hospital treatment for bruising (Fofana, 2025).

In Bristol, a nine-year-old girl was shot with an airgun and subjected to racial slurs. The police are treating this attack as racially motivated. The Avon and Somerset Police have noted the increase in race-related hate incidents in recent years. For example, “in 2024, a total of 3,774 incidents were recorded, compared to 3,150 the previous year and 2,743 in 2022. So far this year, 2,563 such incidents have been logged” (Yhnell and De La Mare, 2025). The rise in racially motivated attacks has made migrants and minority communities, including UK citizens, feel increasingly anxious and concerned for their safety.

Across the UK, there have been demonstrations and counter-protests outside hotels accommodating asylum seekers (Yhnell and De La Mare, 2025). In September, a protester in the Scottish city of Falkirk threw a brick through the window of the Cladhan Hotel after weeks of tense demonstrations. It was discovered that one of the asylum seekers housed there was jailed in June for raping a 15-year-old girl in 2023 (Briggs, 2025). Anti-migrant protests have persisted in other cities, including Bristol, Birmingham, Aberdeen, Dundee, and Perth, with demonstrators claiming that asylum seekers pose a threat to women’s safety.

Claims from these protestors that they are protecting women and children have been met with criticism from the End Violence Against Women Coalition. The coalition of 200 organizations across the UK have united to warn against “the weaponisation of violence against women and girls by far-right groups and mainstream politicians to further a racist, anti-migrant agenda” (End Violence Against Women Coalition, 2025). In August, a signed letter from the coalition was sent to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling for urgent action against the weaponization of violence against women and girls and highlighting the false narratives about immigration that far-right groups and politicians are spreading.

Contrary to the protesters’ claims, violent incidents targeting women and girls reveal that the safety of women was never the true motive behind the anti-immigration demonstrations. For instance, in Dundee, three men filmed themselves abusing women who were providing free soup and sandwiches to asylum seekers in temporary accommodation. In a video shared with the Scottish news media website, The Ferret, men can be heard shouting “I’ll fucking assault you all…Go back to your own place you fucking cow” or “the police aren’t here to protect you now”(Briggs, 2025). In another incident this past September in the West Midlands, a Sikh woman reported that she was raped in a racially motivated attack. She claimed that the perpetrators told her, “You don’t belong in this country, get out” (Stavrou, 2025).

These violent incidents have continued to escalate. In early October, a car was driven into members of the public at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester. A member of the security team at the synagogue was stabbed by a suspected assailant, British citizen of Syrian descent, Jihad Al-Shamie, who was subsequently shot and killed by firearms officers (Wilkinson, Hag, Stockwell, and Regan, 2025). Two men were killed in the attack, and three other people were taken to the hospital with serious injuries. While most reported incidents seem to target migrants and British citizens of Asian or African descent, hate crimes motivated by race and ethnicity appear to be occurring against all minority groups across the UK. Notably, the accident at the synagogue was followed by right-leaning newspapers quoting in their headlines that the attacker was “an Islamic terrorist”, helping to fuel the Islamophobia and racism that is overtaking the country (Ali, 2025).

The increase in racial attacks and protests is connected to growing frustration with the UK government's handling of immigration, as well as a general disillusionment with political leaders and their ability to bring about positive change for citizens. Many people in Britain have faced challenges due to austerity, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. Right-wing politicians and influencers have exploited this rising discontent to redirect that anger toward migrants.

Ex-convict and far-right campaigner Tommy Robinson, real name Stephan Yaxley-Lennon, was released from prison this year and has been active on social media, often spreading false narratives about migrant populations in the UK. He led a ""Unite the Kingdom"" protest this September in London, which drew between 110,000 and 150,000 people (Aljazeera, 2025). Some demonstrators rioted, confronting officers and engaging in physical and verbal abuse that resulted in 26 police officers being injured (Aljazeera, 2025). Robinson and his guest speakers, which included billionaire Elon Musk via video link, French far-right politician Eric Zemmour, and Petr Bystron of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party promoted the idea that British culture is being eroded. They also preached about the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, which claims that white Europeans are being intentionally replaced by non-white immigrants (Aljazeera, 2025).

In addition to Robinson's influence, Nigel Farage and his Reform UK political party have gained popularity. Farage is a far-right politician who has been making extreme, outlandish and xenophobic comments for decades (Hope Not Hate, 2024). He has used his political standing to spread conspiracy theories and misformation about minorities and migrant populations. The wave of displeasure with the current government and Farage’s success in the last general election has given him more agency to spread false narratives that embolden disenfranchised citizens.

The rise of racist and xenophobic attacks and protests presents a challenging time in the UK’s history that is reminiscent of racial tension in the 1970s. Not only are migrant populations being attacked, but UK citizens from diverse ethnic populations are also being victimized. The growing racial tension, misinformation from far-right leaders, and the inadequate response from the current Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have contributed to a sense that this movement is running unchecked (Elgot, Mason and Walker, 2025). Recent incidents of racism and xenophobia in the UK have violated both the European Convention on Human Rights and the UK's own hate crime laws. These actions pose serious risks to individuals, potentially resulting in harm or even death. As a consequence, communities are left terrified and increasingly divided.

Gary Younge, a professor of sociology at the University of Manchester, noted that, “One thing that differentiates this moment from others before it, where racial tension intermingled with xenophobia, is the global aspect of it. The same talking points about ‘the great replacement’ of ‘Indigenous’ white people, and the perceived threat to women in Europe, particularly from Black men, are showing up on my social media feeds and in discourse in the US, Ireland, the UK and across Europe,” Younge says. “They’re all feeding off each other” – even when the situations in these countries are not analogous.” (Malik, 2025). However, Younge believes, “there is still resistance, and that’s an important thing to insist on” (Malik, 2025). Importantly, while political leaders may fall short in their efforts to end racist and xenophobic incidents and riots, ordinary people have stepped up to resist far-right groups, emphasizing the necessity of treating all individuals with respect and kindness, and this underscores the ability of everyday citizens to combat human rights violations.

Glossary

Anti-immigration - Anti-immigration is a political stance that opposes immigration and advocates for policies that restrict or reduce the number of immigrants that enter a country. Opposition can vary from supporting reforms that completely ban immigration to calls for the removal of immigrants. Reasoning behind these views often include concerns over economic impact, cultural integration, and national security.

Asylum Seekers - An asylum seeker is an individual who has left their home country in search of refuge in another country. People may flee their home country due to fear of persecution or significant human rights violations. An asylum seeker is not yet recognized as a refugee and is currently awaiting a decision on their asylum claim.

Cost-of-Living Crisis - The UK's cost of living crisis refers to a period of falling incomes since late 2021, driven by high inflation peaking in October 2022. The rise in inflation and the lack of wage increases have led to higher prices for food, energy, and rent. Factors that have contributed to the crisis include the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, and the war in Ukraine.

European Convention on Human Rights - The European Convention on Human Rights is a treaty created by the Council of Europe to protect fundamental civil and political rights and freedoms across its 47 member states. Since 1950, this treaty has established legal commitments and standards of behavior for member governments to uphold and protect. Importantly, the UK is still a member despite leaving the European Union in 2020.

Great Replacement -The Great Replacement is a far-right, white nationalist conspiracy theory that falsely claims white populations in Western countries are being intentionally and systematically replaced by non-white immigrants by government elites and global institutions.

Indigenous - Indigenous are people or items that are native or original to a particular place. When referring to people, it is often linked to the first-known inhabitants of a region with strong ancestral links to the land before colonization or the creation of current state boundaries.

Food waste did not start with the Trump administration.
This Thanksgiving, think about wasted food – as a problem, and as a symptom of larger problems.","The U.S. government has caused massive food waste during President Donald Trump’s second term. Policies such as immigration raids, tariff changes and temporary and permanent cuts to food assistance programs have left farmers short of workers and money, food rotting in fields and warehouses, and millions of Americans hungry. And that doesn’t even include the administration’s actual destruction of edible food.

The U.S. government estimates that more than 47 million people in America don’t have enough food to eat – even with federal and state governments spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on programs to help them.

Yet, huge amounts of food – on average in the U.S., as much as 40% of it – rots before being eaten. That amount is equivalent to 120 billion meals a year: more than twice as many meals as would be needed to feed those 47 million hungry Americans three times a day for an entire year.

This colossal waste has enormous economic costs and renders useless all the water and resources used to grow the food. In addition, as it rots, the wasted food emits in the U.S. alone over 4 million metric tons of methane – a heat-trapping greenhouse gas.

As a scholar of wasted food, I have watched this problem worsen since Trump began his second term in January 2025. Despite this administration’s claim of streamlining the government to make its operations more efficient, a range of recent federal policies have, in fact, exacerbated food wastage.

Immigration policy

Supplying fresh foods, such as fruits, vegetables and dairy, requires skilled workers on tight timelines to ensure ripeness, freshness and high quality.

The Trump administration’s widespread efforts to arrest and deport immigrants have sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other agencies into hundreds of agricultural fields, meat processing plants and food production and distribution sites. Supported by billions of taxpayer dollars, they have arrested thousands of food workers and farmworkers – with lethal consequences at times.

Dozens of raids have not only violated immigrants’ human rights and torn families apart: They have jeopardized the national food supply. Farmworkers already work physically hard jobs for low wages. In legitimate fear for their lives and liberty, reports indicate that in some places 70% of people harvesting, processing and distributing food stopped showing up to work by mid-2025.

News reports have identified many instances where crops have been left to rot in abandoned fields. Even the U.S. Department of Labor declared in October 2025 that aggressive farm raids drive farmworkers into hiding, leave substantial amounts of food unharvested and thus pose a “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”

Foreign aid cuts

When the Trump administration all but shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development in early 2025, the agency had 500 tons of ready-to-eat, high-energy biscuits worth US$800,000, stored to distribute to starving people around the world who had been displaced by violence or natural disasters. With no staff to distribute the biscuits, they expired while sitting in a warehouse in Dubai.

Incinerating the out-of-date biscuits reportedly cost an additional $125,000.

An additional 70,000 tons of USAID food aid may also have been destroyed.

Tariffs

In the late 20th century, as globalized trade patterns grew, U.S. farmers struggled with agricultural prices below their production costs. Yet tariffs in the first Trump administration did not protect small farms.

And the tariffs imposed in early 2025, after Trump regained the White House, severed U.S. soybean trade with China for months. Meanwhile, there’s nowhere to store the mountains of soybeans. An October 2025 agreement may resume some activity, but at lower price levels and a slower pace than before, as China looks to Brazil and Argentina to meet its vast demand.

Though the soybeans were intended to feed the Chinese pig industry, not humans, the specter of waste looms both in terms of the potential spoilage of soybeans and the actual human food that could have been grown in their place.

Other efforts lead to more waste

Since taking office, the second Trump administration has taken many steps aimed at efficiency that actually boosted food waste. Mass firings of food safety personnel risks even more outbreaks of foodborne diseases, tainted imports, and agricultural pathogens – which can erupt into crises requiring mass destruction, for instance, of nearly 35,000 turkeys with bird flu in Utah.

In addition, the administration canceled a popular program that helped schools and food banks buy food from local farmers, though many of the crops had already been planted when the cancellation announcement was made. That food had to find new buyers or risk being wasted, too. And the farmers were unable to count on a key revenue source to keep their farms afloat.

Also, the administration slashed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that helped food producers, restaurants and households recover from disasters – including restoring power to food-storage refrigeration.

The fall 2025 government shutdown left the government’s major food aid program, SNAP, in limbo for weeks, derailing communities’ ability to meet their basic needs. Grocers, who benefit substantially from SNAP funds, announced discounts for SNAP recipients – to help them afford food and to keep food supplies moving before they rotted. The Department of Agriculture ordered them not to, saying SNAP customers must pay the same prices as other customers.

Food waste did not start with the Trump administration. But the administration’s policies – though they claim to be seeking efficiency – have compounded voluminous waste at a time of growing need.

In California, over 100,000 college students lack legal status, according to one estimate by an alliance of university leaders who advocate for immigrants.
Some legal groups that want to continue in-state tuition for students lacking legal status are challenging those states’ moves.
All of these scenarios require a student to complete the same AB 540 application as students who lack legal status.
For Michelle and other students without legal status navigating their own financial aid applications — and the misinformation online — a series of temporary court orders could create more panic.","Hours after the Trump administration sued California last week, threatening to end key benefits for students without legal status, Michelle was scrolling social media when she saw a video that made her panic.

The Trump administration is challenging California’s policy of providing in-state tuition, scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants without legal status — including Michelle, an immigrant who is a community college student in San Mateo County. CalMatters has agreed to withhold her full name because she fears drawing attention to her legal status.

On TikTok, rumors swirled. Michelle saw a video of a young man, around her age, asking if the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is gone. In reality, FAFSA is still around, and while the new lawsuit could affect some students’ financial aid, some top legal experts say the Trump administration is unlikely to win. Regardless, the court process may take weeks or much longer to resolve the government’s claims against California.

In the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges that California’s policy of granting in-state tuition and financial aid for some students without legal status is unconstitutional. Federal lawyers also argue that California’s policies violate a 1996 federal law, which bars states from providing benefits to residents without legal status that aren’t also available to U.S. citizens who live anywhere in the U.S. The Justice Department is arguing that California either needs to drop the policy or let all U.S. citizens, including those who are out-of-state, pay the same rate.

In California, over 100,000 college students lack legal status, according to one estimate by an alliance of university leaders who advocate for immigrants. Federal assistance, such as Pell grants and federal student loans, are off-limits to anyone who isn’t a U.S. citizen or does not have permanent legal status. California has its own money for college financial aid, which it distributes according to state law.

As long as individuals meet certain requirements, such as attending three years of high school in California, they’re eligible for in-state tuition, saving as much as $39,000 of dollars each year compared to their out-of-state peers. Once they meet those requirements, students without legal status can also qualify for the state’s cornerstone financial aid program, known as Cal Grant, though only a small fraction of these students actually apply for and receive it.

To Kevin Johnson, a law professor at UC Davis, Trump’s actions may be more about political wins than legal ones. “The Trump administration is engaged in a full-court press on undocumented immigrants and so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, and California and Governor Newsom in particular,” Johnson said. That the U.S. Department of Justice named the suit “United States of America v. Newsom” is another indication that this is political, he added.

Others noted that states have already invested in students without legal status and denying them an affordable path toward a college education is a waste of resources. Economists have pointed out that immigrants without status also are integral to the U.S. workforce and aren’t easily replaceable.

‘We didn’t expect them to go this low’

Even weak lawsuits or outright misinformation can make students nervous during November, when college and financial aid application season is in full swing.

On TikTok, videos of students panicking about the financial aid system surfaced last winter, after the Biden administration delayed and botched the rollout of the new FAFSA. Among its many glitches, the new form prevented students whose parents lacked a Social Security number from submitting their information.

After Trump was elected last November, fears about the total demise of federal financial aid swirled again on TikTok. Over the course of this year, as his administration targets universities and continues to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, those fears have persisted.

In California, Trump seeks to impose a $1 billion penalty on UCLA for alleged civil rights abuses, though a federal judge recently handed the White House a temporary loss on that front. His administration is also suing California colleges and universities for alleged antisemitism violations and has sought to freeze or curtail billions of dollars in federal research funding.

Much of those freezes have been blocked or reversed by federal judges, but hundreds of millions of dollars still remain cut off to campuses. Much, if not all, of those friction points between California and Trump could be resolved through settlements and negotiations, which are political in nature, said UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura in an interview.

Before Trump was elected, state leaders, including Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat, pushed for California to offer additional benefits to students without legal status, such as the opportunity to work campus jobs.

Now, with access to financial aid programs at risk for these students, Alvarez said the focus is shifting. “We didn’t expect it would go this low as to go after students that the president had previously said should be welcomed here.” In 2024, Trump told a podcast host that students should “automatically” receive “a Green Card,” otherwise known as permanent residency, when they get their college diploma.

Legal scholars doubt Trump’s lawsuit will win

The lawsuit against California is the Trump administration’s sixth against states with policies allowing in-state tuition for students without legal status. The White House went after Texas first, in June. Underscoring how much of a bipartisan issue in-state tuition is, Texan lawmakers were the first in the U.S. to enshrine the policy in 2001. In all, more than 20 states passed some in-state tuition policy benefiting some residents without legal status.

Trump’s legal attacks on the policy this year prompted leaders in Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas to side with the White House to terminate the benefit in those respective states. Some legal groups that want to continue in-state tuition for students lacking legal status are challenging those states’ moves.

Trump has also sued Minnesota and Illinois, states with Democrats as governors and attorneys general who are challenging Trump’s lawsuits.

The U.S. Department of Justice says that the federal law in question bars students without legal status from receiving in-state tuition and financial aid benefits based on their living in the state. This, the federal lawyers argue, violates federal law since public campuses in California require U.S. citizens from other states to pay higher tuition rates.

However, California’s law, Assembly Bill 540, doesn’t extend in-state tuition based on where students live, scholars and a previous court ruling say. Instead, students generally need to prove that they attended three years of high school or community college in California; they also need to earn in California a high school diploma or obtain enough community college credits to be eligible for transfer into a public university.

The Department of Justice says those three-year high school or community college requirements are tantamount to an in-state residency criteria and therefore violate the 1996 federal law.

But the California Supreme Court in 2010 already struck down that interpretation. The high court observed that some students living in areas bordering California are permitted to study at California high schools. High school students from out of state enrolled in private boarding schools also satisfy the requirement; they don’t count as residents of California either. And students who were residents of California during high school but moved to a different state could still enroll in California colleges or universities paying in-state tuition.

All of these scenarios require a student to complete the same AB 540 application as students who lack legal status. The only difference is that students without status must also complete an affidavit that they’ll pursue legal residency as soon as they can.

In fact, the University of California enrolled more students under AB 540 who were legal U.S. residents than those who weren’t, the state high court said then.

“If Congress had intended to prohibit states entirely from making unlawful aliens eligible for in-state tuition, it could easily have done so,” the state Supreme Court wrote in 2010. But Congress didn’t do that, the court noted.

Lawmakers in California who passed AB 540 in 2001 knew what the federal law restricted, said Motomura, and they crafted a state law that wouldn’t contravene what Congress intended. “It was drafted to avoid the residency test, and it was drafted to avoid the exclusion of U.S. citizens,” he said.

What’s likely next

California has already signaled that it will fight the lawsuit. “The Trump Administration has once again missed the mark with its latest attack on California, and we look forward to proving it in court,” wrote Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice.

Both the UC and the community college system said their tuition and financial aid policies have always been legally compliant. The Cal State University system did not respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration may also seek a preliminary injunction to halt California’s in-state tuition law for nonresidents, which would again expose Californians to a seesaw of temporary court orders, sometimes contradictory in nature, while the full legal merits of the case play out slowly in court.

Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, thinks the U.S. Supreme Court will likely side with California despite its conservative orientation if the case goes that far.

A major legal question underscoring the case against California is when and how federal rules preempt or supersede state laws. The Trump White House is arguing California’s in-state policies are preempted by federal law. But the legal concept of preemption is a pillar in jurisprudence. Liberal and conservative interests benefit similarly from a consistent application of preemption as a legal concept, Saenz said. For example, businesses rely on preemption rules in situations where a state law is more progressive or consumer-friendly than a federal rule and want courts to defend them from following the more demanding state rules.

The U.S. Supreme Court is “going to be very wary of making bad law in the realm of preemption, because it could then come back to bite the right wing in protecting businesses,” Saenz said.

For Michelle and other students without legal status navigating their own financial aid applications — and the misinformation online — a series of temporary court orders could create more panic. Financial aid is top of mind, said Michelle, but she doesn’t have time to track the legal back-and-forth of her eligibility.

In addition to being a full-time student, Michelle works four days a week at a restaurant, saving up money not only to support herself but also her family. She’s the oldest of four kids and said she sends $500 to her parents each month.

College is “an opportunity for me to be someone in life, to make my parents proud,” she said. Asked about the lawsuit at the cafeteria of her college, Michelle made a choking gesture with her hand, as though the threat of losing financial aid next year could kill her. “Trump is taking that opportunity away because he doesn’t like immigrants.”

The deadline to submit financial aid applications for community college is Sept. 2, but Michelle is already working on her application, just in case.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112823_DACA-Students_AE_CM_20.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-26 10:59:47.645468

Ferguson made this fragility clear in his letter: several Republican-led states aren’t redistricting because other Democratic states have stalled their efforts.","The unprecedented push to create new congressional districts mid-decade is hitting roadblocks in the form of local elected officials from both parties.

Republicans face headwinds in the 2026 midterms: the party in power often loses ground in the election after a presidential win, and Trump’s agenda isn’t going over well. The 2025 off-year elections showed voters favoring Democrats at higher-than-expected margins. Trump wants to keep the House in Republican control by redrawing congressional maps to create more Republican-friendly districts. He first pressured Texas, which responded by drawing five additional red districts, which led California to advance a now-approved ballot measure to create five more Democrat-friendly districts to offset Texas’s maps.

But the White House pressure campaigns haven’t found willing participants in all GOP-held statehouses, or from the courts. Texas’s maps were blocked by a federal court, and the US supreme court will review that decision, which could deal a blow to the whole gambit. Voters in Missouri are trying to stop their state’s gerrymander via a referendum.

The big mid-decade GOP gerrymander isn’t inevitable – but it isn’t over.

Some lawmakers, on the left and the right, are steeling themselves against the pressure. Some have philosophical opposition and believe in protecting the normal process, in which districts are drawn every 10 years after the census, and don’t want to wade into a nakedly partisan process and further undermine voters’ faith in democratic processes.

Others are doing their own math and realizing redistricting puts their own party at risk of a “dummymander”, or a district intended to help one party that unintentionally helps the opposition. There are legal calculations as well: new districts can invite lawsuits, and the supreme court decision could disrupt their plans.

Some statehouse leaders are protecting their members who would vote against redistricting efforts because they don’t want to subject their members to attacks or primaries. The bar to pass new maps is high in some states – the party needs near uniformity to clear it.

Mark Schreiber, a Republican representative in the Kansas House, said he doesn’t approve of redistricting for a political purpose. “I’m not just going to redistrict just to accommodate trying to increase chances for maintaining a majority in the US House,” he said.

Clarke Sanders, a Republican in the Kansas House, told the Guardian via email that redistricting “didn’t seem like a good idea to me” because the state just drew new districts three years ago. Kansas has four congressional districts, only one of which is held by a Democrat, Sharice Davids. Redrawing lines could risk the party losing not just in her district, but another district as well, he said.

“The problem is NOT the makeup of the district, the problem is, IMO, we don’t have a candidate,” Sanders said. “We could win in the district the way it is now with the right candidate.”

David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said the pushback is a “really positive development on both sides,” so long as it remains on both sides. Redistricting is historically rare, and the closer we get to an election, the more confusing it gets for voters and more difficult to implement for elections officials, he said.

“I’m impressed by the legislators who are thinking about the big picture and thinking about their voters rather than the possibility of gaining one more seat in a very closely divided House of Representatives,” Becker said.

Voters often disapprove of gerrymandering and see it as unfair. A recent YouGov survey found most in both parties opposed the idea when it was described. But a more recent Politico poll showed a majority in both parties wanted their parties to make more favorable districts, with the right wanting to keep power and the left seeking to push back against Trump.

It’s a distinction from the trend in many states, which have moved toward independent redistricting in which nonpartisan (or at least less partisan) committees help draw lines that better reflect their populaces.

“I don’t think anybody left of Maga wants to be here,” said John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. “This is a crisis that was thrust upon the country by Donald Trump picking up the phone, calling Greg Abbott and trying to steal five congressional seats at a moment in time when we had found a reasonable balance.”

Resisting intense full-court press from the White House is difficult for a party allegiant to Trump. But some in Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska and New Hampshire have refused to give in.

Trump targeted the Indiana Senate on Tuesday, saying the state was going to take up redistricting in two weeks and he hoped the Senate would find the votes to pass new maps.

“If they do, I will make sure that all of those people supporting me win their Primaries, and go on to Greatness but,” he wrote on Truth Social, “if they don’t, I will partner with the incredibly powerful MAGA Grassroots Republicans to elect STRONG Republicans who are ready to do what is needed to protect our Country.”

Some who haven’t publicly approved of redistricting in Indiana have had their homes swatted.

Rodric Bray, the Republican president pro tem of the Indiana Senate, is a key holdout. He said in a statement on 18 November that he wants to see a Republican majority in the US House, but he disagrees on how to achieve it. It makes more sense to focus on electing a Republican in the state’s first congressional district, which has trended right in recent cycles, rather than create new districts. Bray said this week the Senate would reconvene in December because redistricting “has received a lot of attention and is causing strife,” though it was unclear if his chamber had the votes to pass new maps.

On the left, states have largely operated in response to Republican efforts. Illinois governor JB Pritzker said his state is waiting to see what happens with Indiana.

“We’re watching what Indiana does,” Pritzker said earlier in November. “We may have to react to that. It’s certainly something that people have considered here, and the legislature has considered here. But we’ll have to see what happens.”

In Maryland, Senate president Bill Ferguson has opposed his state’s push to redistrict. He has seen intense scrutiny from his party for this position, especially as Democrats work to counter Trump’s grip on the federal government. “Meet the Most Hated Democrat in America,” a headline in the Bulwark said this month.

But others in his chamber agree. Cheryl Kagan, a Democratic senator, told Maryland Matters that there are many issues lawmakers should be focused on instead. “At some point, this feels like a risky distraction,” she said.

The holding pattern is fragile – if one state moves, others will likely follow suit, domino after domino. And Republican states have more of an opportunity to game the system: their legislative majorities oversee more Democratic seats than Democratic majorities do Republicans.

Ferguson made this fragility clear in his letter: several Republican-led states aren’t redistricting because other Democratic states have stalled their efforts. If Maryland moves forward, Republican states will, too. “That means that Maryland’s potential gain of one seat is immediately eliminated, and, in fact, worsens the national outlook,” he wrote.

It remains to be seen how many Republican state lawmakers will continue their stand against the Trump administration despite the threats of primaries or swatting attacks or bad blood with their fellow lawmakers.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8967170dc4d4663ee9f9a6c85070100f9f81e790/232_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a2bdcd58644c64fa1b6db4981b528ee",N,,2025-11-26 08:58:32.478639

RELATED: Issaquah on edge after ICE arrest outside preschool Garcia said there’s reluctance to pass similar measures in a smaller city and potentially risk the loss of federal funding.","Outside Seattle, the suburbs are often hubs for Latino and first-generation immigrant communities. Reports of ICE arrests in some of those smaller cities have been trending over the past weeks, although the official numbers are tough to pinpoint. Some suburban communities are responding to immigration enforcement in different ways.

The Burien neighborhood where Juan spent time growing up is quiet.

It’s close to 6 p.m., a time when people are typically getting home from work. The block is a mix of apartment buildings and suburban homes — lots of minivans and work trucks.

The only things moving in the neighborhood are Juan and his daughter, as they make their way to his uncle’s place.

ICE arrested Juan's uncle in late October, on a freeway on-ramp while he was on his way to work early in the morning, around 5 a.m. Juan said his uncle’s arrest — and that of several others — sent a chill through the neighborhood.

Juan agreed to speak with KUOW on the condition that we don’t use his last name.

“There used to be more people around walking — especially Hispanic people,"" he said. ""Now, as you can see, it’s empty. It’s really empty and I don’t blame them. They get scared [that they'll] come out, there’s someone waiting outside.”

A day after his uncle's arrest, Juan said he was stopped by law enforcement on the freeway in the middle of the road. He describes four cars surrounding him, and slowing down to a stop on the freeway. He believes it was ICE. He suspects they followed him from his uncle's neighborhood and were waiting for him the next day.

“ICE agents blend in,"" he said. ""It’s hard to notice them all of a sudden until they start coming out of their vehicles.""

They let him go. Juan has DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

He's an adult with a family of his own now. But years ago, before he got DACA, he was a kid living in the U.S. without legal status, brought here by his family. DACA provided people like him with work visas and protection from being immediately deported.

As for his uncle, the government had ordered him to leave the country decades ago. ICE has said one of their priorities is to follow up on cases where someone remains in the U.S. after they've been ordered to leave. But his uncle also has a daughter who has U.S. citizenship, which could help him stay in the U.S.

Juan said his uncle was taken from a life he spent decades building with his wife. Since then, Juan’s aunt has been keeping closer tabs on the street activity outside. KUOW agreed to not name her because of her immigration status.

Juan’s aunt said in the months and days leading up to her husband's arrest, she saw unmarked vehicles with tinted windows driving around the neighborhood.

Even if they don’t know everyone personally, over the decades, Juan's aunt said they’ve been able to familiarize themselves with their neighbors' cars, and they know when someone isn’t from the neighborhood.

“All of a sudden, we see trucks with different license plates,"" she said in Spanish. ""Not all of them are from here, the majority are from other places.”

In the weeks after her husband's arrest, reports increased of immigration enforcement happening in the cities surrounding Seattle, slowly making their way into the city.

Photos, videos, and news reports show unidentified federal agents making arrests on roads and parking lots in cities as far north as Everett, edging into Seattle on Aurora Avenue, and seen on the Eastside, in Redmond. Local police have verified that some of these were ICE arrests.

It’s unclear if there’s been an actual uptick. ICE did not respond to questions about arrest numbers.

But some wonder if these latest arrests are because federal agents are using license plate readers to identify undocumented immigrants. A recent Associated Press report revealed that Border Patrol is using license plate readers, and often referring some cars to other law enforcement agencies to make stops.

Conversations about license plate data and immigration are happening in Issaquah, Redmond, Bellevue, Bothell, and Burien, among others. Some neighborhoods in those cities have prominent immigrant communities, with between a quarter to nearly half of the population made up of people who were born outside of the United States.

During city council meetings, some public comments have pushed for a ban or restriction on license plate readers, and for the passage of measures to protect immigrants.

Hugo Garcia, who’s starting his second term on the Burien City Council, said he's disappointed he hasn't been able to get more done to protect the immigrant community in his city.

He'd like to have more flexibility to enact measures like those he's seen in Seattle, like proposals to ban masked law enforcement and to use Seattle Police to verify if federal immigration officers are making a legal arrest.

""They're able to do sanctuary city ordinances or update the ordinances directly a little bit easier,"" he said, ""whereas, for cities like us and other cities that contract with the sheriffs, we're worried about the liability and cost.""

Garcia said there’s reluctance to pass similar measures in a smaller city and potentially risk the loss of federal funding.

“Folks are scared to take action, to poke the bear, and bring even more attention to the city. It's been very hard for me to accept that,"" he said. ""And what can I do? OK well, I can volunteer, I can share the phone number.”

Garcia is a volunteer with an ICE watch group. People call in to report ICE activity, and they send volunteers like him out to document arrests and connect people to legal services. He was one of the people who went to Juan’s family in Burien after his uncle's arrest.

Juan, his cousins, and siblings — all of different immigration statuses — have started their own neighborhood watch. They’ll drive around and text each other updates. It takes a little extra time out of his day, but Juan feels it's worth it.

“I think about the people — older ladies, moms taking their kids, older dads trying to go to work —they've got to pay rent one way or another,"" Juan said. ""If I can put a little of my effort to do that, I will continue doing it.”",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/73b559404fa1f396b6a45c194efb8048?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-11-26 10:59:38.007211

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

President Trump said yesterday that “the original 28-Point Peace Plan…has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides, and there are only a few remaining points of disagreement,” adding that he will “ONLY” meet Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin “when the deal to end the War is FINAL or, in its final stages.” Trump announced that United States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff will meet with Putin next week and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll will hold another meeting with the Ukrainians, following his talks with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday. Barak Ravid reports for Axios; Aamer Madhani, Isobel Koshiw, and Konstantin Toropin report for AP News.

Zelenskyy wants to meet with Trump “as soon as possible,” to finalize a joint U.S.-Ukrainian agreement on the terms for ending the war, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak told Axios. While U.S. and Ukrainian officials have agreed in principle on most aspects of the now 19-point plan, Zelenskyy wants to negotiate on the matter of territorial concessions himself with Trump, Yermak said. Barak Ravid and Dave Lawler report.

Bloomberg News yesterday reported that Steve Witkoff had a phone call last month with a senior Russian official, Yuri Ushakov, to suggest they work together on a peace plan for Ukraine and said Putin should raise the idea with Trump, giving advice on how Putin should pitch it. The White House yesterday did not dispute the veracity of the reported call transcript and praised Witkoff for his discussions with Russian officials. “It’s a standard thing,” Trump said, adding, “that’s what a dealmaker does.” Alexander Ward reports for the Wall Street Journal.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Hamas yesterday handed over the body of a deceased Israeli hostage to Israel. After forensic testing, the Israeli government identified the body as Dror Or. The bodies of two hostages are still in Gaza. Aaron Boxerman reports for the New York Times.

Heavy rain yesterday caused further flooding in Gaza, swamping the tents of thousands of Palestinians. The Palestinian Civil Defence Service said that some tents have completely washed away as floodwaters rose 40 to 50 centimetres above ground level over the past week. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said yesterday that “lifesaving humanitarian aid must enter Gaza without obstruction and at scale,” following reports from the U.N. on Monday that Israel continues to limit aid deliveries into Gaza. Reuters reports; Wafaa Shurafa and Megan Janetsky report for AP News.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

“We have presented a strong text for a truce, but neither the [Sudanese Army] nor the [Rapid Support Forces] paramilitary have formally accepted the text we put forward,” U.S. envoy Massad Boulos said yesterday. Boulos said he welcomed the RSF’s declaration on Monday that its forces would enter a unilateral ceasefire immediately and hoped it would be upheld. A spokesperson for the Sudanese government said the RSF’s announcement was a “clear political manoeuvre” meant to distract from atrocities carried out by RSF fighters. The Sudanese Army said yesterday that it had repelled an attack in the West Kordofan state. Federico Maccioni reports for Reuters.

Médecins Sans Frontières said yesterday that it has withdrawn its staff from Zalingei Hospital in Darfur after a stretcher bearer, working for Sudan’s health ministry, was shot dead. “Our teams cannot resume humanitarian activities until the Rapid Support Forces guarantee safe conditions to protect staff and patients,” MSF Emergency Coordinator Myrian Laaroussi said. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Brazil’s Supreme Court yesterday ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to start serving his 27-year sentence at a federal police facility in Brasília for overseeing a failed plot to overturn the results of the 2022 election. Ana Ionova reports for the New York Times.

A group of 24 Nigerian girls who were abducted from their boarding school over a week ago have been released, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu said yesterday. More than 250 children abducted from St Mary’s Catholic School last week are still missing. James Chater and Mayeni Jones report for BBC News.

“We will crush all foreign interference” in Taiwan, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office told reporters today, adding “Japan’s deployment of offensive weapons in areas adjacent to China’s Taiwan region is extremely dangerous, deliberately creating regional tensions and provoking military confrontation.” Reuters reports.

Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te today announced that his government will introduce a $40 billion special budget for military spending, focussed on acquiring more weapons from the United States. “History demonstrates that compromising with aggressors ultimately brings only endless aftermaths of war and subjugation,” Lai said in his announcement. Chris Buckley and Amy Chang Chien report for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s (MBS) meeting last week grew tense when the two began discussing whether Saudi Arabia might join the Abraham Accords, according to two U.S. officials. The sources said that MBS explained to Trump that he wanted to move forward with normalization with Israel, but he cannot do so now because Saudi public opinion is highly anti-Israel, adding that Saudi society is not ready for such a move. One source said that the conversation between the two leaders was civil but tough. Barak Ravid and Marc Caputo report for Axios.

Zipline yesterday announced that it will receive $150 million from the State Department to expand commercial drone deliveries of blood, vaccines, and other medical supplies to Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Côte d’Ivoire. The agreement, under a new pay-for-performance model, will tie the release of taxpayer funds to Zipline’s ability to negotiate expansion contracts with the governments of these five African countries. Joann Muller reports for Axios.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Justice Department yesterday acknowledged in a court filing that it was Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem who decided to proceed with the deportation of 100 Venezuelan men to a prison in El Salvador despite a judge’s order to keep them in U.S. custody. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

Special agents at the Homeland Security Department have made fewer arrests for drug crimes and seized fewer weapons than in the previous fiscal year, with the number of arrests for civil immigration offences soaring from around 5,000 to over 94,500, according to an internal Homeland Security Investigations report reviewed by the New York Times. Hamed Aleaziz, Nicholas Nehamas, Michael H. Keller, and Alexandra Berzon report.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The six Democratic lawmakers who recorded a video informing troops that they could refuse illegal orders said yesterday that they are being investigated by the FBI. The group said that the FBI had contacted the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, requesting interviews with each of them. “President Trump is using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass members of Congress,” the four House members who took part in the video said in a joint statement. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth yesterday requested a briefing on the status of the inquiry into Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) from the Department of the Navy by Dec. 10. Greg Jaffe reports for the New York Times.

Republican and Democratic attorneys general from 35 states and the District of Columbia yesterday urged congressional leaders not to block state AI laws, warning of “disastrous consequences” if the technology is left unregulated. “Every state should be able to enact and enforce its own AI regulations to protect its residents,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the effort with attorneys general in North Carolina, Utah and New Hampshire. Jody Godoy reports for Reuters.

35 former employees of the General Services Administration, who were laid off during the government shutdown, have appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board, arguing that they should have been reinstated under the spending law that ended the shutdown. The law includes a provision that reverses any layoff that occurred during the lapse in federal spending that began on Oct. 1. The Trump administration argues that the provision does not cover those whose terminations had been set in motion before the shutdown began. Eileen Sullivan reports for the New York Times.

Former Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni, who was fired from the DOJ earlier this year, has joined Democracy Forward, one of the legal advocacy firms challenging the Trump administration’s approaches to immigration, benefits, and civil rights. Reuveni told the New York Times, “This is really a make-or-break moment for the rule of law, for democracy, for the rights of all people who live in this country.” Devlin Barrett reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Education Department is reviewing safety standards and “ongoing compliance issues” at the University of California, Berkeley, in response to a Nov. 10 Turning Point USA event, the department announced yesterday. The department’s Office of Federal Student Aid will investigate whether UC Berkeley violated the Clery Act, which requires higher education institutions that receive federal funding to disseminate crime data to the public, support victims of violence, and publicly outline their policies and systems for improving campus safety. Helen Coster reports for Reuters.

The U.S. Space Force has awarded about six small Golden Dome contracts to build up competing missile defense prototypes, according to two sources. The sources said that the awards went to several companies, including Northrop Grumman, True Anomaly, Lockheed Martin, and Anduril. Mike Stone reports for Reuters.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge yesterday ruled that a nationwide class of individuals who were living in the United States when they were detained by immigration authorities are legally entitled to a hearing to determine whether they can be released on bond while their deportation cases proceed. The judge ruled last week that the Trump administration’s policy adopted in July of denying bond hearings to migrants during domestic enforcement operations was illegal for specific individuals. Yesterday’s decision extended her ruling nationwide. Daniel Wiessner reports for Reuters.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) yesterday filed a lawsuit against Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Bill Pulte, claiming that Pulte breached federal privacy laws by repeatedly disclosing documents intended to accuse prominent Democrats of mortgage fraud. Zach Montague reports for the New York Times.

A coalition of 20 states, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, yesterday filed a lawsuit against the Department of Housing and Urban Development, seeking a court order blocking the “administration’s cuts and illegal new conditions” on the HUD’s Continuum of Care program funding. “These funds help keep tens of thousands of people from sleeping on the streets every night. I will not allow this administration to cut off these funds and put vital housing and support services at risk,” James said yesterday.

Spotify is on the list for airing ICE recruitment ads—a decision that also recently prompted a boycott call from the group Indivisible.
The group is urging Microsoft to end its ""$19.4 million contract with ICE to provide artificial intelligence capabilities and processing data.""
DEMAND: End all ICE/DHS immigration enforcement contracts and data hosting that enable deportations; adopt a binding human-rights policy banning support for immigration policing.
""To be removed from the boycott list, each targeted corporation must fulfill the specific demands outlined for its company.","A Gen Z-led advocacy group fighting for working-class priorities on Tuesday announced a boycott campaign targeting major corporations ""that enable, profit from, or directly collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the broader racist policies of the Trump administration.""

Beyond the Ballot launched ""Not With My Dollars: ICE Out of My Wallet"" as President Donald Trump's violent crackdown on immigrants in diverse communities across the United States continues and just days before Black Friday kicks off the winter holiday shopping season.

""We cannot out-organize a fascist administration while simultaneously bankrolling the companies profiting from its cruelty,"" said Victor Rivera, the organization's executive director, in a statement. ""Every dollar spent at a complicit corporation is a dollar funding the abduction and disappearance of our neighbors. It’' time to make corporate complicity unprofitable, for good.""

The group is taking aim at e-commerce behemoth Amazon and its grocery subsidiary, Whole Foods; tech giants Dell and Microsoft; Home Depot; streaming platform Spotify; and retail chain Target. The boycott webpage explains the reason each is listed, actions shoppers should take, and the campaign's demands. In some cases, it also offers alternative companies.

Target is under fire for its ""broad range of cooperation with the Trump administration's racist policies."" The campaign is calling on the company to not only publicly commit to refusing collaboration with ICE but also immediately reinstate its scrapped diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.

Spotify is on the list for airing ICE recruitment ads—a decision that also recently prompted a boycott call from the group Indivisible.

The campaign site calls out Home Depot because it has ""repeatedly allowed ICE agents to patrol and detain workers and customers in its parking lots and stores, usually without presenting judicial warrants or establishing probable cause,"" and demands an end to those practices.

The group is urging Microsoft to end its ""$19.4 million contract with ICE to provide artificial intelligence capabilities and processing data."" The Dell section highlights that it has provided $18.8 million to ""support the office of ICE's chief information officer through the purchase of Microsoft enterprise software licenses,"" and similarly calls for terminating that contract with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Amazon section states:

REASON: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the digital backbone of ICE's machinery, selling the cloud power that helps track, target, and tear families apart.

ACTION: Stop shopping on Amazon where possible; cancel Prime subscriptions if feasible; push universities, unions, nonprofits, and campaigns to move off AWS when and where feasible, and to issue statements condemning Amazon’s role in corporate-sponsored mass deportations.

DEMAND: End all ICE/DHS immigration enforcement contracts and data hosting that enable deportations; adopt a binding human-rights policy banning support for immigration policing.

ALTERNATIVES: Bookshop.org and local bookstores; direct-from-brand purchasing; cooperatives; independent retailers.

The site also stresses that ""every dollar spent at Whole Foods directly strengthens Amazon, whose AWS platform is the digital backbone of ICE's machinery, powering the tools used to track, target, and tear families apart.""

While the campaign is beginning just before Black Friday, boycott organizers aim to ensure it will ""not disappear"" after this week.

""Unlike other consumer boycotts, Not With My Dollars is designed for long-term pressure and escalation,"" Beyond the Ballot said. ""To be removed from the boycott list, each targeted corporation must fulfill the specific demands outlined for its company. Anything less is not accountability, just more corporate PR.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62239830&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C167,N,,2025-11-26 09:56:28.317732

An uncertain fate and no guarantees about the conditions endured by individuals sent to countries with which they have no ties have been the norm in these expulsions. Over time, many of them have ended up back in the countries they originally fled, where they face persecution or torture.

This is the case of Rabbiatu Kuyateh, who has made headlines because of a viral video documenting the mistreatment she suffers. In it, this 58-year-old nurse from Maryland is seen being violently dragged along the ground by men who appear to be officials from Ghana, the country to which she was deported days earlier. Kuyateh resisted in vain to avoid being sent back to Sierra Leone, the country where she was born and which she fled, and where she is currently in hiding.

Hers is a story like that of many migrants who, through the Administration’s stratagems, have ended up in the countries they fled without the U.S. government actually violating its own rules against sending them there directly. Instead, they have done so through a third government, such as Ghana’s. The White House maintains that it had guarantees that those deported to this African country would not be sent back to their countries of origin, but there are serious doubts about whether this was the case. This is especially true after the Ghana government itself denied the existence of any such agreement. Immigration experts see this as a strategy by Washington to protect itself from potential litigation.

“It was a solution to a problem: ‘We can remove these people from our custody and at the same time not break the law,’” Alexandra Williams, one of the lawyers on Kuyateh’s legal team, explained to EL PAÍS. The Sierra Leonean woman arrived in the U.S. 30 years ago fleeing the war in her country, where, due to her family’s political activism, she suffered torture and persecution.

She worked as a nurse in Maryland, where she had built a life. Her son, now an adult, was born in the U.S., while her parents were naturalized American citizens. Kuyateh, for her part, had a work permit and was under supervision, but it was enough to attend annual immigration checks. Everything seemed to be in order. “She went to those appointments every year to confirm that she was still in the country. She has no criminal record, and her address was up to date. She never missed an appointment,” says Williams, who explains that her client had protection against deportation to Sierra Leone.

Everything changed with the Trump administration, and her July appointment turned into an ambush. “They told her that because of the changes in the administration and its policies, they had to arrest her and remove her from the country, since she had a deportation order,” Williams says.

Her son hasn’t seen her since. She was arrested and, after a few days, transferred to a detention center in Louisiana. The next destination was Ghana. On the flight, she was accompanied by other migrants, handcuffed and shackled, like her, with the same uncertain fate. Over the phone, she told her son about the brutality with which they were treated, a brutality that also left its mark through injuries on her body.

The African nation is one of the latest destinations the Trump administration has chosen to send migrants it cannot directly return to their countries of origin because they have court-ordered protection. According to Human Rights First, which tracks deportation flights, the United States has carried out at least 21 flights with people from third countries to 10 destinations: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Eswatini, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uzbekistan. In addition, thousands of people have been transported to Mexico by land.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attempts to carry out the transfers secretly and as quickly as possible. In April, Massachusetts federal judge Brian E. Murphy issued a preliminary injunction requiring the government to give people at least 15 days to challenge their deportations to third countries, where they may face retaliation. However, two months later, the Supreme Court granted a stay, overturning Murphy’s order.

Human rights organizations denounce the violation of a basic principle of U.S. and international law that prohibits deporting people to a place where they may suffer torture, persecution, or other serious harm. But the administration is not giving detainees time to express their fears, as happened to Kuyateh, who was not allowed to voice her fear of being deported to Ghana, much less back to Sierra Leone.

The organization AMICA reports that deportations to third countries, followed by subsequent return to the countries from which people fled, have increased in recent weeks. “There are many people in that situation. Several have been deported to Mexico and are at risk of being sent back to their country of origin,” says Kelly Rojas, an immigration attorney with AMICA. Rojas declined to provide specific cases due to concerns for her clients’ safety. One of them was also sent to Ghana and then transferred to the West African country he fled, despite having a protective order preventing it. When he was deported, the lawyers lost contact and, as is often the case, received no information about where he was sent. “This person disappeared from the system. We called several ICE offices, and they told us different things about where he had been transferred,” Rojas recounts.

Maintaining contact once they arrive in their home countries is complicated, and continuing their defense is very difficult, since U.S. immigration lawyers cannot practice there. In these cases, it’s necessary to try to contact other local human rights organizations that can continue their advocacy. Exhaustion and hopelessness lead many to eventually give up. “What the United States government is doing right now is killing their will to fight for their rights. Some clients who are deported to their countries of origin have been in detention for so long that, even though their lives are in danger—which is why a judge in the United States issued them protective orders—they think that at least they are no longer in the detention center,” Rojas maintains.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/MVVITL2LILSZZF4GNDEGMAWZFY.jpg?auth=f0547454fd9ee03a2321c32b8893cc9826b3e0897d809fdf46741000d240ed35&width=1200,N,,2025-11-26 09:56:40.434837

But since many of these contracts with state and local governments include quick termination clauses, activists have the power to make a meaningful impact on the bottom line of these prison companies.
The state also contracts with GEO to operate six “day reporting centers” with state and county authorities.
Trump and [DHS Secretary Kristi] Noem couldn’t follow through [on their crackdown] without private prison companies.
Right now, that’s where a lot of the leverage is, pressuring state and local governments not to enter into these agreements with private prison firms.” Contracts with these firms could be ended quickly, according to the disclosures obtained by CMD.","This article is published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy.

On an August 7 earnings call, Damon Hininger, the CEO of CoreCivic, announced that the country’s largest private prison operator “is perfectly aligned with the demands of this moment … We are in an unprecedented environment with rapid increases in federal detention populations nationwide and a continuing need for solutions.”

Indeed, the Trump administration has delivered massive profits for private prison operators, with CoreCivic reporting an 18 percent revenue growth year over year for the third quarter, and GEO Group, the largest contractor working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), boasting record-breaking third-quarter earnings up 13 percent over the same period last year.

More from Matthew Cunningham-Cook

But while much of the rapid growth of both GEO and CoreCivic is tied to Trump’s immigration detention policies, these companies also rely on existing lucrative revenue streams from state and local communities. Whether it’s Vermont shipping prisoners to a CoreCivic facility in Mississippi or California using a historic LGBT gathering space for a GEO Group re-entry facility in San Francisco, a Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) review reveals that the architecture the Trump administration is using for its broad-based crackdown on immigrants relies on a pre-existing infrastructure: a privatized prison system built with the support of both political parties, much of it developed and implemented at the local level.

In its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), GEO Group discloses that only 62 percent of its 2024 revenue came from the federal Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service. Last year, CoreCivic earned just 51 percent of its revenue from the same sources. Both companies rely on state and local governments and other federal agencies for their remaining revenue.

The fact that many state and local governments often put the profits of private investors above best practices for rehabilitation and re-entry has helped create the infrastructure for the Trump administration’s often lawless crackdown, according to prison reform advocates. But since many of these contracts with state and local governments include quick termination clauses, activists have the power to make a meaningful impact on the bottom line of these prison companies.

“Any state leadership that takes issue with what the administration is currently doing in terms of immigration detention—as enabled by the private prison industry—[has a duty to look] at ways to cut ties with the industry entirely,” notes Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, which advocates for dismantling the private prison complex.

“Whether it’s helping with corrections management or … with re-entry services … [these companies] have shown their cards as to who they are and really should have no role [with ICE or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)] at all,” Tylek told CMD. “There’s no doubt that this industry is facilitating and enabling the rapid arrests, detention, and deportation of undocumented people, [along with] the harassment of communities of color, whether they are citizens or not.”

Both before the current immigration crackdown and since the beginning of this year, GEO Group and CoreCivic have been called out for widespread human rights violations at their immigration detention centers. Just this month, immigrant detainees in California sued ICE over conditions at a CoreCivic facility near Bakersfield, alleging it is riddled with insect infestations and sewage problems, and that they were denied access to water, food, and attorneys. This month, immigration detention inmates and their advocates in Louisiana alleged denial of medical care and inhumane overcrowding. In 2024, detained immigrants sued GEO over alleged widespread sexual abuse at a facility in California, and the Department of Justice opened an investigation into CoreCivic for an alleged culture of physical violence and sexual abuse at a private prison in Tennessee.

Blue-State Private Prison Contracts

Despite passing a law in 2019 to ban private prisons, California approved a new ten-year, $70 million contract with CoreCivic in 2024 for “re-entry services.” In addition, the state has multiyear contracts with GEO for over $300 million, for the same purpose, according to documents obtained by CMD through open records requests. Re-entry services refers to the process of reintegrating people in the criminal justice system or drug and alcohol treatment networks into mainstream society. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in October that bars California from enforcing the law against federally contracted immigration detention centers for now.

In July, a resident at a GEO Group facility in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco fled the facility and died, leading the city’s District 5 Supervisor Bilal Mahmood to call for an investigation, while human rights advocates called for closing the facility entirely.

In Arizona, which has a Democratic governor (Katie Hobbs) and a Democratic attorney general (Kris Mayes), nearly 3,000 inmates are sent to CoreCivic’s La Palma Correctional Center and more than 2,000 inmates are at its Red Rock Correctional Facility. Six inmates have died at these facilities this year alone.

In addition, Arizona recently sold a prison to Management & Training Corporation, which also detains people for ICE, for $15 million. Arizona also outsources the operation of four state prisons to GEO Group: the Central Arizona Correctional and Rehabilitation Facility and Florence West Correctional and Rehabilitation, both in Florence; Kingman Correctional in Kingman; and Phoenix West in Phoenix—for a total of 6,000 beds.

In Colorado, where Democrats control both houses of the legislature and every statewide office, the state has two major contracts with CoreCivic for a total of over 3,000 beds at the Bent County Correctional Facility in Las Animas and the Crowley County Correctional Facility in Olney Springs. CoreCivic also operates “community treatment centers” for Democratic-controlled Boulder, Adams, and Arapahoe Counties in Colorado. Arapahoe County outsources a 202-bed “residential center” to GEO Group, and the state has two GEO Group “day reporting centers.” CoreCivic is represented by the lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, whose chairman Norm Brownstein is “close” to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

Vermont, which has a moderate Republican governor (Phil Scott) and a Democratic majority in the legislature, ships 250 of its inmates to a CoreCivic facility in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi. In addition, the state has established itself as a center for reinsurance and captive insurance companies, and hosts GEO Group’s captive insurance subsidiary, Florina, which is set up to help reduce liability insurance costs for the company.

In Pennsylvania, which has a Democratic governor (Josh Shapiro) and a Democratic House, the state outsources a 142-bed “community corrections” facility in Chester County, along with a similar 100-bed facility in Scranton and a drug and alcohol treatment center in Reading, to GEO Group. The state also contracts with GEO to operate six “day reporting centers” with state and county authorities.

New Mexico has long been at the forefront of prison privatization, which began in earnest under libertarian former Gov. Gary Johnson, who was a Republican at the time. However, despite the fact that Democrats have controlled every statewide office and the legislature for the past seven years, New Mexico signed a new lease to rent the 596-bed Northwest New Mexico Corrections Center from CoreCivic in 2021. In addition, GEO Group runs two “community corrections” facilities for the state.

Democratic-controlled jurisdictions in red states also contract with CoreCivic and GEO Group. For example, Hinds County, Mississippi (home to Jackson), and Harris County, Texas (Houston), send inmates to a CoreCivic facility in Tallahatchie, Mississippi.

“This is an industry that has celebrated the Trump crackdown on immigrants as basically fundamental to the conditions they need in order to succeed,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, told CMD. “What I wouldn’t want people to miss is that, yes, the current administration is massively expanding the system even more, but they’re doing it on top of an infrastructure that has been [built] by both parties. GEO and CoreCivic have played a big role in that, both in their relationship with ICE and DHS, but also with their contracts with local governments.”

“This expansion of the system has gone through both parties,” Ghandehari reiterates. “The companies are in this to make a lot of money—[and] they’re excited to be cashing in [given that] 90 percent of people in ICE detention are in private facilities. Trump and [DHS Secretary Kristi] Noem couldn’t follow through [on their crackdown] without private prison companies. Right now, that’s where a lot of the leverage is, pressuring state and local governments not to enter into these agreements with private prison firms.”

Contracts with these firms could be ended quickly, according to the disclosures obtained by CMD. GEO Group’s SEC filing states that its “facility management contracts typically allow a contracting governmental agency to terminate a contract with or without cause at any time by giving us written notice ranging from 30 to 180 days.” CoreCivic’s filing states that most of its facility contracts “also contain clauses that allow the government agency to terminate the contract at any time without cause.”",https://prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CMD-Private-prisons-112625.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 09:56:42.999488

Third country deportations should not be used as a tool for immigration enforcement. Often used as a tool to manage a politicized migration “problem,” third country deportations have the potential to normalize rights-free zones, forced exile, and indefinite detention. In February 2025, DHS issued a policy directive on third country deportations. The policy proposes forcibly deporting noncitizens, even those with humanitarian relief, to a third country instead of a country that is their country of nationality or where they last resided. Third country deportations immediately sparked legal challenges over safety, due process, and human rights concerns.

The United States is not the first country to propose or conduct third country deportations, despite the serious human rights concerns they raise. The United Kingdom, the European Union, and Australia have all proposed third country return schemes as a tool for migration control, immigration enforcement, and domestic approval.

Orderly migration can and must include plans for safe and voluntary returns. UNHCR has recommended that better systems are needed to ensure that people who are not in need of refugee protection retain meaningful agency in their decision-making. Options such as voluntary repatriation, access to other lawful migration pathways, or the ability to legally move to another country are all rights-respecting approaches that can be reflected in domestic policy.

Policymakers should take pause and question if current policies proposed and in use around the world are indeed the best approach. As new policies are pursued by governments who are failing to prioritize dignity and compassion in an effort to respond to global failures, it will be more important than ever for organizations like USCRI and others to monitor these efforts.

UK – Third Country Offshoring

In April 2022, the UK Government under Conservative leadership announced the UK- Rwanda Asylum Partnership. Under the agreement, the UK would send people seeking asylum to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed. Rwanda built facilities that were fenced in, and it’s unclear whether asylum seekers would have had freedom of movement or opportunities to work. If asylum was granted, asylees could reenter the UK. If asylum was denied, individuals would be offered a chance to apply for asylum in Rwanda. Several countries have employed push-back strategies to offshore asylum, but the UK-Rwanda agreement was one of the first to propose sending asylum seekers who had entered UK soil to a third country on another continent to process their asylum cases.

In its justifications, the UK Government used divisive, politicized talking points—that people should not be rewarded for paying smugglers or for using “illegal routes” to seek asylum. In exchange for accepting asylum seekers, Rwanda was poised to receive ₤370 million in addition to further payments for each individual they received.

Human rights advocates and international human rights organizations called the deal an erosion of refugee rights, and the UK Supreme Court ruled it unlawful because of the risk of refoulement. In July 2024, the newly elected Labour Government announced that it would scrap the UK-Rwanda Asylum Partnership.

EU Return Hubs

In October 2024, the European Council (EC) proposed a “Common European System for Returns,” which will come into effect mid-2026. Any noncitizen who fails to voluntary leave the EU after exhausting their asylum application and appeals can be forcibly transferred to a third country “return hub.” The use of return hubs is also in the UK’s returns policy plan, and the government has stated that it is in discussions with a number of possible reception countries.

According to the EC, return hub agreements “can only be concluded with a third country where international human rights standards and principles in accordance with international law.” However, the EC’s proposal includes barebones safeguards, such as a monitoring mechanism and the disqualification of unaccompanied children and families with children. Despite the lack of detail, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and UNHCR support the proposal, citing the need for effective return systems.

Staging returns outside of EU territory creates the risk for rights-free zones, similar to how the U.S. Government has used Guantánamo Bay. The EC’s plan includes a monitoring mechanism, but it does not detail how human rights abuses will be redressed. There are no guidelines for how return hub facilities are designed and whether they will be adequate for vulnerable groups, respect freedom of movement, or allow for the pursuit of livelihoods and education.

The EC’s proposal is endorsed by IOM and UNHCR because third country returns are limited to noncitizens who are on notice that they are legally required to leave the EU. Other countries—like Italy and the United States—are proposing much harsher third country return schemes.

Italy – A Mixed-Use Facility

In 2023, Italy’s conservative government entered into an agreement with Albania to build offshore migrant detention centers. Italy’s conservative government initially planned to detain and fast-track asylum cases at the detention center, but that plan was initially blocked by Italian judges in October 2024. The main concern at issue is that the efforts to fast-track asylum claims impermissibly increases the risk of unsafe returns. In order to avoid legal challenges, Italy announced that it would use the detention center as a “return hub,” consistent with the EC’s proposal. However, on November 13, the Italian Prime Minister stated that her government is “determined to push ahead” with the original plan to detain asylum seekers and fast-track their cases.

The Italy-Albania facilities have already become a threat to human life and human rights abuses. In April 2025, even during the limited use of the Albanian detention center, 10 suicide attempts were reported. Although Italy said that only male adults will be detained in Albania, the detention center is outfitted with playgrounds and breastfeeding areas, questioning whether the Italian government eventually plans to send children, pregnant women, and other vulnerable groups.

Untested, Costly, and Dangerous

The risk of human rights abuses should be enough to deter such policies from even being considered. In addition, policymakers should be concerned about wasteful governmental spending. The UK-Rwanda Asylum Partnership would have cost UK taxpayers ₤1.8 million ($2.3 million) for every asylum seeker sent to Rwanda. And until the plan was abandoned, the UK paid Rwanda ₤290 million ($381 million), which Rwanda is refusing to pay back.

The Italian detention center in Albania cost €800 million ($930 million), construction went over schedule, and the first asylum seekers sent there were immediately transferred back to Italy due to legal challenges. Governments are using public resources to broker controversial agreements and legally defend questionable practices. Despite claiming to act in the public interest, many agreements and official determinations are not publicly available.

Fundamental human rights, individual lives, and diplomatic relationships are at stake. Moreover, it is unclear whether “return hubs” will motivate people to return to their countries of nationality. The plan fails to address the fate of stateless persons, as well as people who had to flee their homes as children who have no familiarity with their countries of nationality. Third country deportations simply shift the burden of processing returns to a third country. Moreover, many of these schemes make indefinite detention possible.

Countries should not use return hubs or any third-country agreement as a way around international human rights commitments. Migrants are human beings, not pawns to move around on the world map. Rather than turning to untested, costly, and dangerous proposals to enforce immigration laws, countries can reinvest in durable solutions, equitable responsibility-sharing, and human rights institutions. Finally, continued attention is needed to show how rights-respecting policy models can be developed and why they provide states with a more durable, effective framework.",https://reliefweb.int/modules/custom/reliefweb_meta/images/default.png,N,,2025-11-26 09:56:46.146144

Boasberg, at a hearing last week, had named Reuveni and Ensign as people he thought likely to be witnesses.
Closing my tabs For those who don’t what this is, it’s my effort to give a little thank you to paid subscribers.","Lawyers from the ACLU who have been challenging the Trump administration’s extreme immigration enforcement on Tuesday afternoon suggested that Emil Bove, now a federal appeals court judge, should potentially be called as a witness in Chief Judge James Boasberg’s contempt inquiry over the administration’s actions regarding deportation flights that left the U.S. on March 15.

Later Tuesday evening, Justice Department lawyers — while still maintaining that further contempt-related proceedings are not appropriate — responded by stating that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ultimately made the decision not to return the flights, after Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Bove “provided DHS with legal advice” about the flights and DHS’s acting counsel conveyed that advice, “as well as his own legal advice,“ to her.

“After receiving that legal advice, Secretary Noem directed that the AEA detainees who had been removed from the United States before the Court’s order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador,“ DOJ lawyers stated in the Tuesday night filing — more than eight months after the flights sent the people to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison.

The filings came as Boasberg moves forward — after a seven-month delay — in his contempt inquiry regarding the two flights carrying individuals who were being deported under President Donald Trump’s Alien Enemies Act proclamation, flights that went to El Salvador even after he ordered the administration to temporarily stop with AEA-based deportations on March 15.

Bove, a former personal criminal lawyer to Trump, was initially given a senior role in the Justice Department — a common occurrence in the second Trump administration. He is unique, however, in that he has since been confirmed to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

Bove also stands out because, before Senate Republicans confirmed him to the Third Circuit on a 5-49 vote*, he was involved in several ethically questionable actions from the Justice Department in the first months of the second Trump administration — including those relating to the Eric Adams case and the administration’s preparations for Trump’s Alien Enemies Act proclamation and the litigation against it. There has since also been reporting that Bove, while at DOJ, was supportive of the boat-strike murders that the administration has been engaged in in recent months.

After much delay due to the administration’s earlier appeal of Boasberg’s first order in the contempt inquiry, Boasberg on Monday ordered the parties — the ACLU representing the plaintiffs and DOJ representing the government — to provide “proposals” for how to proceed with the court’s “inquiry regarding a potential contempt referral,” including the “names of possible witnesses.“

In its responsive filing, the ACLU lawyers propose that DOJ be ordered to identify “all individuals involved in the decision not to halt the transfer of class members out of U.S. physical custody on March 15 and 16, 2025 … as well as all those with knowledge of the decision-making process.”

Then, relying on the names identified in fired DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni’s whistleblower disclosure, the plaintiffs’ lawyers put forward nine names as potential witnesses:

In addition to Bove and Reuveni himself — who, it was announced Tuesday, has been hired by Democracy Forward, an organization that previously was (but no longer is) involved as co-counsel in the case — the “potential witnesses” include Drew Ensign, the lawyer who appeared before Boasberg in court on March 15. Boasberg, at a hearing last week, had named Reuveni and Ensign as people he thought likely to be witnesses.

Additionally, the plaintiffs’ statement names August Flentje, who was Reuveni’s supervisor at the time of the Abrego Garcia hearing that led to Reuveni’s firing, as a potential witness, along with three other senior DOJ officials (James McHenry, Paul Perkins, and Yaakov Roth) and two senior Homeland Security officials (James Percival and Mazzara, the person who DOJ stated conveyed the legal advice to Noem on March 15).

The plaintiffs’ lawyers noted that this is not an exhaustive list and that several other people unnamed in the Reuveni disclosure — within DOJ, DHS, and the State Department — also “may possess relevant information.”

In DOJ’s response, lawyers acknowledged that Boasberg’s March 15 order issued in court included the requirement that people covered by the lawsuit “be returned to the United States.”

Laying out what happened next, DOJ’s lawyers named multiple people included in the ACLU’s list, including Ensign, Bove, and Mazzara. Through DOJ’s timeline, they also added Blanche and Noem to the list:

DOJ then raised privilege questions:

The Justice Department then proceeded to spend four paragraphs quoting from and relying on Judge Gregory Katsas’s concurring opinion (only for himself) at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to provide additional argumentation that “no further proceedings are warranted or appropriate“ — an argument that DOJ had been at last week’s hearing and was rejected by Boasberg. Such argumentation was also not requested in Boasberg’s Monday order.

As a last point, DOJ objected to the “involvement” of the ACLU lawyers in the contempt proceedings altogether, arguing that, as a criminal contempt matter, “Plaintiffs … lack standing to participate as anything other than fact witnesses.“

Finally, Tuesday’s filing was signed by four DOJ lawyers — Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate, the head of the Civil Division; Ensign; Tiberius Davis, Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General; and Anthony Nicastro, the acting director of the Office of Immigration Litigation. In a second filing DOJ submitted in the case Tuesday, however, one more name was on it: Flentje — Reuveni’s former supervisor and another name on the ACLU’s list.

Now, Boasberg will decide how to proceed.

* = Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted against Bove’s confirmation. Sen. Bill Hagerty did not vote.

This report was updated to include information about the Justice Department’s filing once it was submitted. The final update was at 12:20 a.m. November 26.

According to The Washington Times, arrests are averaging about 1,200 per day.

There are also planned changes for more than 200,000 people admitted to the United States as refugees, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. (TNND)

In an interview on Tuesday on the ""Ruthless"" Podcast, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, ""Under President Trump, we got rid of catch and release, so everyone’s talking about Oh my god, immigration detention is skyrocketing; you have so many people in custody. Well, we’re not just gonna arrest someone to give you a chance to go out and do something again,"" he said.

There are also planned changes for more than 200,000 people admitted to the United States as refugees, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Most will need to be re-interviewed, U.S. C.I.S. Director Joseph Edlow, with a focus on those who came in between January 20, 2021, to February 20, 2025.

In a recent interview with Edlow, he voiced his concerns about both refugees and immigrants overall who entered the country during the Biden administration.

The way I look at it is, the last four years we saw unchecked mass illegal immigration. What we are trying to do is kind of unravel that knot now,"" Edlow said.

Edlow said the refugee program at the time was being exploited.

""We have to make sure that everyone who is going through the process is telling the truth on their applications, first and foremost, that they are not a threat to public safety, that they are not a threat to national security,"" Edlow said.

There is also a new spotlight on the thousands of undocumented migrants who spent days or even weeks sheltering in some U.S. airports.

A report just released by the Senate Commerce Committee alleges the Biden white house pressured Boston Logan, Chicago O'Hare and at least eight other airports to house those illegal migrants despite concerns raised by airport officials.

According to the report, ""The Biden White House, through the FAA, pressured Logan, O’Hare, and at least eight other airports to house more illegal aliens as they arrived in the United States. When asked by the administration to house aliens, the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), Logan Airport’s operator, insisted that doing so would pose security and operational risks. The FAA, along with Democratic state and local officials, overruled Massport’s warnings and allowed aliens to sleep overnight in Logan airport terminals for more than a year. ""

He says he spent nearly six days at Broadview before being transported to an ICE detention facility in Oklahoma.
Documents he shared with NBC 5 Investigates show he was offered a $1,000 to self-deport through a DHS program.","Attorneys representing more than 600 ICE detainees are expected back in court next week to argue before an appellate court that their clients should be released.

The hearing follows a ruling by Federal Judge Jeffrey Cummings earlier this month, who found that hundreds of ICE detainees should be released from custody because ICE agents violated the terms of a 2022 consent decree that set firm boundaries on ICE agents’ use of “warrantless” arrests.

In court filings, ICE asserted that the terms of the consent decree had expired in June.

But Judge Cummings’ ruling stated otherwise.

In his 52-page order issued in early October, Cummings found that ICE had violated the terms of the consent agreement by making “warrantless” arrests throughout 2025 – including in “Operation Midway Blitz.”

But before any of the more than 600 detainees on the list were released – most of whom ICE deemed to be a “low risk” to public safety, attorneys for the federal government appealed Judge Cummings’ ruling. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay on the release.

The matter was put on pause this month until oral arguments could be made during a hearing, which is set for next week.

Throughout the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Chicago, attorneys and family members of those arrested by Border Patrol or ICE agents have said it’s been difficult to communicate with the detainees. They’ve alleged through a separate federal lawsuit that it’s hard to make phone calls or reach those being held in ICE custody, and that an ICE website devoted to detailing where detainees are being held isn’t always working or up to date.

NBC 5 Investigates used the list of 604 ICE detainees to measure where ICE detainees from Chicago have been held across the country.

This point-in-time snapshot offers a view into where detainees have been transported to county jails and ICE detention facilities across the country.

NBC 5 Investigates’ analysis found more than 164 detainees were taken to an ICE detention facility in Baldwin, Michigan; at least 61 were taken to a facility in Texas; another 26 were placed at a detention facility in Brazil, Indiana.

At least six jails throughout Kentucky have been used to hold ICE detainees from the Chicago area.

NBC 5 Investigates could not find information for 190 people on the list of 604 people, which was made public through the ongoing litigation in Cummings’ court.

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly responded to NBC 5 Investigates’ questions over the past few months by highlighting that the enforcement efforts in the Chicago area have targeted “the worst of the worst” and that “pedophiles, gangbangers and rapists” have been processed through the ICE processing facility in Broadview, IL.

While the Trump administration initially pitched immigration enforcement in Chicago as a means to address crime, immigration data from the TRAC website shows between 70 to 80 percent of those in ICE custody do not have criminal convictions, NBC 5 Investigates has found.

Court records show at least 75 people on the list of more than 600 have been removed from the U.S.

Rodrigo Domingo-Hipolito is one of those 75.

His name is on the list of 604 people who a federal judge says should be eligible for release from ICE custody.

But he has already self-deported.

Aside from a 2011 traffic conviction for driving on a suspended licensing – he has no criminal history.

He spoke to NBC 5 Investigates recently from Mexico – where he’s been since early November.

“Man it’s crazy. A lot of people. When I got there, there was like 90 guys inside the little room,” Rodrigo said of the Broadview facility, which has become the subject of a federal lawsuit alleging poor and inhumane conditions. DHS denies that there are poor conditions and has repeatedly said detainees received three meals a day have access to phones to communicate.

Rodrigo says he was arrested by immigration agents on his way to work in Cicero on October 3rd. He says he spent nearly six days at Broadview before being transported to an ICE detention facility in Oklahoma.

Online immigration court records show an immigration judge approved his request to voluntarily deport himself on October 21.

Rodrigo says he chose to do so because of health reasons and that after consulting with immigration attorneys, he saw no other options.

“At that point I was thinking it was the right thing to do because I don’t want to spend any more time in the jail because of my health. It was not well so, and I don’t want to spend more time on jail,” he said.

He says he was later transported to a jail in Louisiana where he was held for several more days. Documents he shared with NBC 5 Investigates show he was offered a $1,000 to self-deport through a DHS program. He says he has yet to receive the money.

He says conditions there were just as packed as what he experienced at Broadview and people got sick. He became upset when talking about the other detainees there whose families don’t know where they are.

“I think outside there is a lot of people – a lot of guys they need help a lot of people they never know if their family knows that they are inside,” he said.

The decision to self-deport was heartbreaking for him and his fiancé, Claudia, who asked not to use her last name because she – like Rodrigo – is undocumented.

“I feel a huge emptiness,” she said through tears. “I feel destroyed. Very destroyed.”

She told NBC 5 Investigates she is hopeful that he can return one day legally through obtained a visa because they had plans to settle down and buy a home together. They’ve been together for more than 10 years and now they’ve have no plans to see each other currently.

Since June, the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown is believed to have netted more than 3,300 arrests in the Chicago area. Attorneys estimate nearly 60 percent of those have been removed from the U.S.

While initially pitched as crime combatant, critics and those on the receiving end of the immigration enforcement efforts argue it has done little to address crime on a grand scale in Chicago, and instead has separated families.

“Yeah, man. It’s hard because 24 years living there. Now it’s a new beginning,” Rodrigo said.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2021/02/ICE-BERMUDEZ.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-11-26 11:00:23.426668

READ MORE: Trump limits annual U.S. refugees to 7,500. It’ll be mostly white South Africans

The review is likely to sow confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the United States during that period. It is likely to face legal challenges from advocates, some of whom said the move was part of the administration’s “cold-hearted treatment” of people trying to build new lives in the U.S.

The memo, signed by the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, and dated Friday, said that during the Biden years “expediency” and “quantity” were prioritized over “detailed screening and vetting.” The memo said that warranted a comprehensive review and “re-interview of all refugees admitted from January 20, 2021, to February 20, 2025.”

The memo indicated that there will be a list of people to re-interview within three months.

Advocates of the refugee program say that refugees are generally some of the most vetted of all people coming to the United States and that they often wait years to be able to come.

The memo also immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who came to the U.S. during the stated time period.

If the agency determines that a person shouldn’t have qualified for entry as a refugee, the person “has no right to appeal,” according to the memo, although if they are put in removal proceedings and sent to immigration court, they can then plead their case there. The memo also stated that even those who have already received their green card would be reviewed.

“USCIS is ready to uphold the law and ensure the refugee program is not abused,” Edlow wrote.

People admitted to the U.S. as refugees are required to apply for a green card one year after they arrive in the country and usually five years after that can apply for citizenship.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The moves described in the memo are the latest to take aim at the refugee program, which the administration suspended earlier this year and later set a limit for entries to 7,500 mostly white South Africans — a historic low of refugees to be admitted to the U.S. since the program’s inception in 1980. The Trump administration more broadly has ramped up immigration enforcement as part of its promise to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.

WATCH: A look at life for small group of refugees allowed in U.S. since Trump took office

The Biden administration admitted 185,640 refugees from October 2021 through September 2024. Refugee admissions topped 100,000 last year, with the largest numbers coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela and Syria.

Refugee advocates slammed news of the review, saying that it will traumatize people who have already gone through extensive vetting to make it to the U.S. in the first place.

“This plan is shockingly ill-conceived,” said Naomi Steinberg, vice president of U.S. policy and advocacy at HIAS, a refugee resettlement agency. “This is a new low in the administration’s consistently cold-hearted treatment of people who are already building new lives and enriching the communities where they have made their homes.”

USCIS expects to have a priority list for re-interviews within 90 days, Edlow wrote. His language points to a rigorous revisiting of why refugee status was granted in the first place.

“Testimony will include, but is not limited to, the circumstances establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear for principal refugees, the persecutor bar, and any other potential inadmissibilities,” he wrote.

Sharif Aly, President of the International Refugee Assistance Project, an advocacy group, criticized the administration’s actions in a statement late Monday, saying that refugees are “already the most highly vetted immigrants in the United States.”

“Besides the enormous cruelty of this undertaking, it would also be a tremendous waste of government resources to review and re-interview 200,000 people who have been living peacefully in our communities for years,” Aly said.

IRAP is currently part of a lawsuit seeking to overturn the administration’s suspension of refugee admissions.

In a decision issued on Monday, Justice Anne Turley dismissed Mohammadreza Vadiati’s application for judicial review, finding that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) had acted fairly and reasonably when it ruled him inadmissible under section 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which bars members of terrorist organizations.

Vadiati, who served two years as a conscript in the IRGC before seeking asylum in Canada, argued that his service was involuntary and that immigration officials failed to account for coercion or the impact on his family.

The court rejected those claims, saying he was given a full opportunity to respond to officials’ concerns.

“The applicant has failed to establish any procedural unfairness in the decision-making process,” Justice Turley wrote, concluding that conscription in the IRGC “does not negate membership in the group” under the immigration law.

Ottawa formally listed the IRGC as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code in June 2024.

What Does Canada's IRGC Terror Listing Really Mean?

Under Canada’s anti-terrorism laws, membership in or support for a listed terrorist entity can result in inadmissibility, asset freezes, and criminal penalties.

The listing of the IRGC – which Canada blames for human rights abuses and the 2020 downing of flight PS752 – has broad implications for thousands of Iranian nationals who performed compulsory service.

Canadian politicians, including MP Kevin Vuong and Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, have said the listing aims to curb Tehran’s influence in Canada and prevent IRGC-linked individuals from operating on Canadian soil.

Bruna Caroline Ferreira, a Brazil native and the mother of Leavitt’s nephew, was arrested near Boston on November 12, her attorney, Todd Pomerleau, told CNN.

Leavitt’s nephew has lived full time in New Hampshire with his father, Leavitt’s brother Michael, since he was born, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Ferreira and the White House press secretary have not spoken in many years, the source said.

A spokesperson with the Department of Homeland Security told CNN Ferreira was in the US illegally after overstaying a tourist visa that required her to leave the country in June 1999. Ferreira “has a previous arrest for battery” and is currently in removal proceedings, the spokesperson said.

Ferreira’s attorney said she was a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which grants temporary protection from deportation for those brought to the US as children.

She was unable to renew her status a few years ago during President Donald Trump’s efforts to end the program during his first administration, but is currently in the middle of a “lawful immigration process” for US citizenship, Pomerleau said.

Ferreira was arrested while driving to pick up her son from New Hampshire, Pomerleau told CNN. Ferreira and Michael Leavitt were previously engaged and have joint custody over their 11-year-old son, Pomerleau said.

Michael Leavitt told CNN affiliate WMUR Ferreira has maintained a relationship with their son, but the boy has not spoken to her since her detention. He described the situation as difficult and said he just wants the best for his son.

A GoFundMe page, verified by Ferreira’s lawyer, has been created by her sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, for legal fees and expenses. As of Wednesday morning, more than $15,000 has been raised.

“Bruna was brought to the United States by our parents in December of 1998, when she was just a child … Since then, she has done everything in her power to build a stable, honest life here,” Ferreira’s sister wrote in the GoFundMe campaign. She said Ferreira has “maintained her legal status through DACA.”

Trump tried to end DACA during his first term, but the Supreme Court ruled his administration had not taken the proper steps to do so.

Twenty states are suing the Trump administration over cuts made to funding for housing the homeless.

A coalition of 19 attorneys general and two governors made the move Tuesday to seek a court order that would block “cuts and illegal new conditions” to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Continuum of Care program, which works with local organizations to connect unhoused people with resources and housing.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced that more than half of the program’s 2026 funding for permanent housing will be cut and reallocated to temporary transitional housing with work or service requirements. The new conditions will also allow HUD to deny funding to any organizations that acknowledge transgender or nonbinary people.

This month, HUD instituted a cap on the amount of its program funds that can go to permanent housing at 30 percent. Previously, no cap existed, and 90 percent of its funds supported permanent housing.

The lawsuit argues that the conditions placed on the program are “unlawful and unconstitutional” because the funds were mandated by Congress to be distributed based on need. New York Attorney General Letitia James, the coalition’s leader, said in a press release that “communities across the country depend on Continuum of Care funds to provide housing and other resources to our most vulnerable neighbors.”

“These funds help keep tens of thousands of people from sleeping on the streets every night. I will not allow this administration to cut off these funds and put vital housing and support services at risk,” James said.

At a time when the country is in the midst of a housing crisis exacerbated by the Trump administration, these cuts will make things even worse if they are allowed to stand. Americans who end up losing their homes already have a tough time getting assistance. If this lawsuit doesn’t stop or slow the administration’s cuts, Americans without homes will get even less from the government.

Kash Patel’s days as FBI director may be numbered.

MS NOW reported Tuesday that President Trump is considering firing the embattled director as his errors pile up. Three anonymous sources told MS NOW that Patel had drawn Trump’s ire for his presumptuous social media posts during ongoing cases, using a government jet for a date night with his 27-year-old girlfriend, and assigning a SWAT team for her security detail.

Andrew Bailey, the FBI co–deputy director, is reportedly Trump’s top choice to replace Patel.

The White House responded to the reports. “President Trump has assembled the most talented and impressive Administration in history and they are doing an excellent job carrying out the President’s agenda,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “FBI Director Patel is a critical member of the President’s team and he is working tirelessly to restore integrity to the FBI.”

This isn’t the first time Patel’s FBI has witnessed rumors of internal upheaval. Just last month, Patel reportedly angered FBI leadership when he fired at least 30 bureau agents for being hostile to conservatism or Trump. And in October, he pissed off Trump and Justice Department officials by posting that the “FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack” on Halloween, despite the fact that no charges had been filed and local police didn’t have any details.

Back in July, deputy director and former MAGA podcaster Dan Bongino was so upset with how Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi handled the release of the Epstein files—from Bondi claiming that she had them on her desk to her then claiming the case was closed—that he skipped work, no call no show.

It seems clear that Patel is working on borrowed time. It shouldn’t come as any surprise that one of the most underqualified FBI leads in recent memory can’t seem to avoid these screw-ups.

This story has been updated.

Kash Patel’s FBI is joining the hunt against the so-called “Seditious Six,” signaling the administration’s commitment to taking revenge on the six Democratic members of Congress who dared tell soldiers that they didn’t have to follow illegal orders.

The FBI has requested interviews with Senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin, and Representatives Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan—all military and intelligence veterans—for their participation in the now-infamous video in which they reminded the military that they swore an oath to be loyal to the U.S. Constitution, not President Trump. The Trump administration saw this as treasonous, called for them to be hanged, and is weighing court-martialing Kelly.

The six members of Congress have yet to respond to the potential FBI interview.

It’s unclear when the interviews will occur or what exactly they entail. An anonymous Justice Department official told Reuters that the interviews would be to see “if there’s any wrongdoing and then go from there.” The FBI has yet to comment on the interviews, but one can assume that it won’t be very amicable given the Trump administration’s rhetoric around the situation.

“The video made by the ‘Seditious Six’ was despicable, reckless, and false,” Hegseth wrote Monday on his personal X account. “Encouraging our warriors to ignore the orders of their Commanders undermines every aspect of ‘good order and discipline.’ Their foolish screed sows doubt and confusion—which only puts our warriors in danger.”

Meanwhile, what Kash is up to:

The Department of Government Efficiency is claiming that it is still operational, despite reports that the agency has disbanded.

In a post on X Monday night, the account called a Reuters article reporting that the agency “doesn’t exist” with eight months remaining on its charter “fake news.”

“As usual, this is fake news from @Reuters,” the post read. “President Trump was given a mandate by the American people to modernize the federal government and reduce waste, fraud and abuse. Just last week, DOGE terminated 78 wasteful contracts and saved taxpayers $335M. We’ll be back in a few days with our regularly scheduled Friday update. 🇺🇸”

DOGE has not posted since then, or offered any proof of the cuts. It also didn’t refute a key piece of information in the Reuters article: that DOGE is no longer a “centralized entity.” Its acting administrator, Amy Gleason, is now an official adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the Department of Health and Human Services, even as she makes jokes on LinkedIn.

Many of DOGE’s functions have been taken over by the Office of Personnel Management, and many of its employees have moved to other agencies within the government. So what does the X post mean? Maybe DOGE is still a tool in the hands of Elon Musk and Russell Vought, or a scapegoat whenever the Trump administration wants to make massive cuts.

Whatever the case, the massive damage DOGE caused to the federal bureaucracy will live on and probably continue for the rest of the Trump administration. Whether the name lives on is another story.

A well-timed phone call from House Speaker Mike Johnson may have been the tipping point for the White House to call off releasing Donald Trump’s new health care plan.

Ahead of the decision Monday, Johnson cautioned Trump officials against including a two-year extension to Affordable Care Act subsidies as part of the president’s so-called “Healthcare Price Cuts Act,” The Wall Street Journal reported.

Johnson reportedly told White House officials that Republicans just couldn’t get behind extending subsidies, after the speaker had spent more than a month railing against Democrats’ bid to save the subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year. Should those tax credits permanently lapse, an estimated 5.1 million Americans will lose their health coverage by 2034.

Johnson’s decision to throw a wrench in Trump’s rollout comes as insurance premiums are set to skyrocket starting in January, and premiums for individuals will increase by as much as double for millions of Americans.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is attacking the Scouts for not being nice enough to boys.

Hegseth plans to cut all military ties with Scouting America, formerly known as the Boy Scouts, on the grounds that they are attacking “boy-friendly spaces,” being too “genderless,” pushing “gender confusion,” and adopting diversity, equity, and inclusion, according to a draft memo to Congress reviewed by NPR.

“The organization once endorsed by President Theodore Roosevelt no longer supports the future of American boys,” Hegseth wrote in the memo.

“The Boy Scouts has been cratering itself for quite some time,” Hegseth said in a 2024 Fox interview. “This is an institution the left didn’t control. They didn’t want to improve it. They wanted to destroy it or dilute it into something that stood for nothing.”

Under the proposal, Scouts will no longer receive medical and logistical support for their massive “National Jamboree” and will no longer be allowed to visit military bases.

The proposal has not yet been sent to Congress but would bring an end to 100 years of support from the U.S. government.

“Scouting is and has always been a nonpartisan organization,” Scouting America said in a statement responding to the news. “Over more than a century, we’ve worked constructively with every U.S. presidential administration—Democratic and Republican—focusing on our common goal of building future leaders grounded in integrity, responsibility, and community service.”

Retired Army Staff Sergeant Kenny Green—who has three children who are scouts—was caught off guard by Hegseth’s proposal.

“It’s gonna be kind of harsh the way I say this.… It’s kind of like they don’t care about us more than they care about their perceived message. Scouting … it probably is not a perfect organization, but … I can’t even say how vast their benefits are, especially for military families.”

From fat-shaming troops to complaining that soldiers have been emasculated, this is par for the course for the defense secretary.

More on what Hegseth has been up to t:

The peace plan offered by the Trump administration to end the war between Russia and Ukraine appears to contain few, if any, concessions from Russia, an administration official admitted Tuesday.

Maria Bartiromo interviewed U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker on Fox Business Tuesday morning, and pointed out that General Jack Keane, former Army vice chief of staff, told her that Russian President Vladimir Putin “hasn’t given up one concession in all of these months that [we’ve] been negotiating.”

Whitaker agreed and tried to spin what is obviously true by casting it as part of negotiations.

“There is some truth to what the general says, but let’s remember that there’s no perfect answer to this situation,” Whitaker said, adding, “Neither side is going to get what they want. We don’t know until we have a deal that’s hammered out who’s giving up what.”

Whitaker said that the Russians had a stronger position on the battlefield, and were making small gains every week, and that “unless Europe and the United States decided to take a different tack, this is where we end up, negotiating a peace deal from the reality.”

“We can all live in what-if worlds, but we have to live in the real world,” Whitaker added.

The initial plan proposed by the U.S. was heavily weighted toward Russia and even seemed to be translated from Russian, based on the syntax and vocabulary used. Even Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it “the wish list of the Russians.” U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators have since modified the plan, but that’s not likely to go over well with Putin.

Why did the Trump administration go public with Russia’s ideal solution instead of bringing Ukraine in on the process earlier? Now, while the deal may be acceptable to one side, it’s likely to fall through and prolong the fighting.

At least one Republican lawmaker was so outraged by the White House’s supposed Russia-Ukraine peace plan that he considered resigning from Congress then and there.

The Trump administration unveiled a 28-point peace plan last week that catered to some of Russia’s most outrageous demands, such as requiring Ukraine to swear off NATO membership and to hand over Crimea and the eastern Donbas region. Those two details alone have reversed long-standing U.S. policy with regard to the area.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have balked at the arrangement, but Nebraska Representative Don Bacon was reportedly “so angry” at the idea that he thought about quitting the lower chamber altogether, he told Axios Monday night.

Bacon has little to lose since he’s already on track to retire—he announced in June that he will not seek reelection in 2026, capping his 10-year career in Congress in early 2027.

That’s given the 62-year-old some extra wiggle room to lament the Trump administration’s maneuverings, damning the rushed peace process as the “Witkoff Ukrainian surrender plan” after special envoy Steve Witkoff, who played a major role in crafting the deal.

“In the end I have a commitment to our constituents to fulfill my term,” Bacon told Axios, noting that he “shared [his] anger” with House Speaker Mike Johnson but opted not to mention his resignation.

Ukraine and its European partners were excluded from the plan’s drafting process, reported The Guardian. But there is some evidence that the plan may have come directly from the Kremlin: Several sentences in the document are passive and clunky in English but make more sense when translated into Russian. That could be the influence of Kirill Dmitriev, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s envoy, who worked on the project alongside Witkoff.

Donald Trump has touted himself for months as a great peacemaker, pushing a narrative that he has—so far—solved eight foreign conflicts. Practically all of his war-solving braggadocio is “demonstrably untrue,” to the extent that several of the examples he often lists were never even at war. But despite repeated efforts, he has not made any headway on the Russia-Ukraine war.

Trump has conceded quite a bit to Russia’s dictator, to no avail. This summer, Trump literally rolled out the red carpet for Putin in Alaska, marking Putin’s first return to U.S. soil in more than a decade. But after the theatrics were over, the two world leaders still failed to reach a consensus on how to end the bloodshed, with Trump losing his cool while Putin demanded that Ukraine cede even more territory to Russia.

Many cases involve people whose cases in immigration court were reopened.
Arrests at ICE check-ins appear to have accelerated since early October in San Diego.
A federal judge will be deciding whether to release the three petitioners and whether to declare such detentions unlawful.","SAN DIEGO (AP) — A week before Chancely Fanfan was scheduled to attend an immigration court hearing in San Diego, he received a letter from the Department of Homeland Security instructing him to show up for what he thought would be a routine check-in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after his hearing.

After the 31-year-old Haitian man showed up with his wife and 11-month-old baby to his court hearing and ICE check-in on Oct. 20, immigration officers arrested him, providing no reason other than that the government required it, his attorneys said.

Fanfan had no criminal history and showed up to all his court hearings and check-ins with ICE since his arrival in the U.S. last year, according to the petition filed Tuesday in the Southern District of California. The Center for Immigration Law and Policy and the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law are challenging the October detentions of Fanfan and two others following their check-ins with immigration officers.

“Petitioners have had no criminal contact since their prior releases from DHS custody, and two petitioners have no criminal history of any kind,” according to the petition.

The petitioners were detained after entering through or between U.S. ports of entry when they came to the country. After vetting, they were released from federal custody.

The lawsuit alleges immigrants are being deprived of due process after previously being declared fit for release, only to be arrested and detained when suddenly summoned to reappear at an ICE office. Many cases involve people whose cases in immigration court were reopened.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.

The UCLA School of Law’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy said the detentions in San Diego alone “are certainly in the dozens, and likely exceeds 100.” The lawsuit is asking the judge to certify the class, which could mean that others who were arrested and detained in similar circumstances could benefit from a favorable ruling.

A gardener from Mexico who has lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years sat on the floor of a long hallway outside a packed waiting room at ICE’s San Diego office on Monday. He spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name, Lorenzo, be published because he feared potential consequences.

About 10 years ago, Border Patrol arrested Lorenzo at a highway checkpoint in Southern California. He went before an immigration judge who closed his case and spared him from being deported. For years, he had heard nothing from immigration authorities until last week, when he was told his case was being reopened and that he was to report to ICE on Monday. He didn’t follow up with the AP after his check-in.

Arrests at ICE check-ins appear to have accelerated since early October in San Diego. Lynn Devine, a volunteer observer, saw one woman who checked in being escorted to an elevator in handcuffs by two officers on Monday.

“She was looking at the floor. I told her I was praying for her,” Devine said.

A federal judge will be deciding whether to release the three petitioners and whether to declare such detentions unlawful.

In a statement, a justice department spokesperson said: “These operations were ordered consistent with the law of armed conflict.” The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.
The armed conflict designation is key because it allows Trump to operate under the so-called law of armed conflict, which permits the use of lethal force without violating federal murder statutes or international law.
But despite the plausible legal framework, the OLC opinion relies on a fact pattern about the cartels for which no public evidence appears to exist.
“A significant problem with this theory is that they still have not identified any state that’s engaged in an armed conflict with a particular cartel,” said Lederman.","The Trump administration is framing its boat strikes against drug cartels in the Caribbean in part as a collective self-defense effort on behalf of US allies in the region, according to three people directly familiar with the administration’s internal legal argument.

The legal analysis rests on a premise – for which there is no immediate public evidence – that the cartels are waging armed violence against the security forces of allies like Mexico, and that the violence is financed by cocaine shipments.

As a result, according to the legal analysis, the strikes are targeting the cocaine, and the deaths of anyone on board should be treated as an enemy casualty or collateral damage if any civilians are killed, rather than murder.

That line of reasoning, which forms the backbone of a classified justice department office of legal counsel (OLC) opinion, provides the clearest explanation to date how the US satisfied the conditions to use lethal force.

But it marks a sharp departure from Donald Trump’s narrative to the public every time he has discussed the 21 strikes that have killed more than 80 people, which he has portrayed as an effort to stop overdose deaths.

A White House official responded that Trump has not been making a legal argument. Still, Trump’s remarks remain the only public reason for why the US is firing missiles – when the legal justification is in fact very different.

And it would also be the first time the US has claimed – dubiously, and contrary to the widely held understanding – that the cartels are using cocaine proceeds to wage wars, rather than to make money.

In a statement, a justice department spokesperson said: “These operations were ordered consistent with the law of armed conflict.” The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.

The new rationale being advanced by the administration comes as the legal justification gains heightened importance amid a military campaign against the cartels that shows signs of dramatically expanding.

The US now has an extraordinary force in the Caribbean with the arrival of the USS Gerald Ford, the world’s most advanced super-carrier, which brings capabilities to hit land targets, which Trump has said he wants to pursue.

And this week, defense secretary Pete Hegseth threatened senator Mark Kelly with court-martial after he recorded a video with five other Democratic lawmakers warning military members to question unlawful orders, apparently in reference to the strikes.

Cartel goals disputed

According to three lawyers directly familiar with the OLC opinion blessing the boat strikes, the collective self-defense argument is said to be a key plank of the legal analysis.

The opinion formalizes a 21 July meeting of a “restricted interagency lawyers group” of four career and four political appointees from the Pentagon, the office of the joint chiefs of staff, the CIA, the White House and the OLC.

It principally argues that the US has entered an armed conflict with the cartels because it is helping allies in the region like Mexico and Colombia, which, according to an administration official, asked for US help confidentially for fear of reprisals.

The armed conflict designation is key because it allows Trump to operate under the so-called law of armed conflict, which permits the use of lethal force without violating federal murder statutes or international law.

The opinion then finds Trump does not need congressional approval because the administration satisfied OLC’s two-prong test: whether the strikes serve a national interest, and whether they would not be of a prolonged scope, nature or duration.

For instance, it outlines four areas of national interests the strikes serve, from the duty to provide assistance to allies, to preserving regional stability, to protecting the US from the influx of illegal drugs themselves.

But despite the plausible legal framework, the OLC opinion relies on a fact pattern about the cartels for which no public evidence appears to exist.

The closest analogy is perhaps the Taliban and al-Qaida trafficking opium during the war on terror to finance its terrorist activities. But in that instance, it was clear their primary goal was to wage armed attacks against the US and Nato allies, and the opium financed their weapons.

It is uncertain whether the same applies to drug cartels in Latin America.

Martin Lederman, a former deputy assistant attorney general at OLC during the Obama and Biden administrations, expressed skepticism with the administration’s claims about collective self-defense.

“A significant problem with this theory is that they still have not identified any state that’s engaged in an armed conflict with a particular cartel,” said Lederman.

“Nor has the administration provided any evidence that another state engaged in such an armed conflict has asked the US to destroy cocaine shipments that are allegedly being used to subsidize armed violence against the requesting state,” he said.

An administration official said it had evidence that each boat carries around $50m worth of cocaine, the proceeds of which are being used to acquire sophisticated weapons, but the underlying intelligence is classified.

Still, the justice department’s OLC is not an expert in assessing the intelligence findings or the purported objectives of the cartels; typically, it ends up deferring to the US intelligence community.

For this opinion, a senior administration official acknowledged, OLC did not attempt to stress-test the purported goals of the cartels – or the underlying facts to determine the existence of an armed conflict.

OLC considered only a narrow question posed by the White House of whether it was a lawful policy option for the president to use military force against unflagged vessels in international waters transporting cocaine.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9d2740a05fe651a2f03ede88ef788cfc97f19c9/458_0_4583_3667/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b74ebd0424db483f55a3b01b022358b8",N,,2025-11-26 04:57:12.770517

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Bruna Caroline Ferreira is a ""criminal illegal alien from Brazil"" who overstayed her tourist visa, which expired in June 1999.

The woman has an arrest on suspicion of battery, the spokesperson said. It’s not clear how the case was resolved.

Ferreira, who the source familiar with the situation said has never lived with Leavitt's nephew, is at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center amid proceedings to have her removed, the DHS spokesperson said.

Garland, extending previously granted declaratory relief to all members of the newly certified Bond Eligible Class. The ruling effectively rejects Matter of Yajure Hurtado and the related ICE policy that had long subjected certain noncitizens who entered without inspection to mandatory detention under INA § 235(b)(2)(A)—without the possibility of bond.

Background and Procedural Posture

Last Friday, the court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the named petitioners, holding that individuals who entered without admission/inspection but were not apprehended at the border are not properly detained under INA § 235(b)(2)(A). Instead, the court concluded that such individuals fall under INA § 236, the general arrest-and-detention statute that provides for custody redetermination by an immigration judge, including bond consideration.

Today’s class certification order explicitly adopts that same relief on a nationwide basis. On page 14 of the certification order, the court states:

“When considering this determination with the MSJ Order, the Court extends the same declaratory relief granted to Petitioners to the Bond Eligible Class as a whole.”

This linkage between the summary judgment ruling and the class certification order means that the declaratory judgment is now binding for all class members nationwide.

Key Holding

The court’s combined orders establish the following principle:

Class members are detained under INA § 236—not INA § 235(b)(2)(A)—and therefore are legally entitled to consideration for release on bond.

This represents a significant shift away from the now-rejected framework of Matter of Yajure Hurtado, which had treated virtually all noncitizens who entered without inspection as subject to mandatory detention without bond under § 235(b)(2)(A), regardless of the circumstances of their apprehension.

The Nationwide Bond Eligible Class

The court certified the following class:

All noncitizens in the United States without lawful status who:

(1) have entered or will enter the United States without inspection;

(2) were not or will not be apprehended upon arrival; and

(3) are not or will not be subject to detention under

• 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) (mandatory criminal detention),

• 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) (expedited removal), or

• 8 U.S.C. § 1231 (post-final-order detention)

at the time DHS makes the initial custody determination.

Because the class is nationwide, DHS and ICE must now treat individuals meeting this definition as eligible for bond hearings, unless a separate statutory mandatory-detention ground applies.

Impact

This litigation represents one of the most consequential detention-authority decisions in years. Its effects include:

• Immediate bond eligibility for thousands of noncitizens who previously were deemed mandatorily detained under § 235(b)(2)(A).

• Uniform nationwide standards on how DHS must classify such individuals when making initial custody determinations.

• Significant constraints on ICE practices that had expanded § 235 detention far beyond its text and purpose.

• A likely increase in bond redetermination hearings before immigration judges across the country.

Government appeal is possible, but unless and until a higher court stays or overturns the orders, DHS is legally bound to comply.

In a rare interview about what she views as an existential threat to the integrity of democratic institutions, Chief U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall told the ABC7 Chicago I-Team the number of threats directed toward federal judges has increased year-by-year.

ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch

""I've personally seen with my own judges on the bench, that number of threats increased significantly,"" Judge Kendall told the I-Team. ""The whole concept of our entire democracy is based on the three branches of government, and one branch has to be independent of each other branch. Judges have to be able to not be swayed by public opinion, be swayed by money, be swayed by reputation, they have to be able to do the job and apply the laws.""

The number of threats to judges nationwide has increased by 40% in the last four years, according to data from the U.S. Marshals Service.

In Chicago, federal judges for the Northern District of Illinois are also seeing an acute rise in threats over many cases related to recent immigration enforcement operations.

Sources confirmed with the I-Team that at least five federal judges representing high-profile cases have received some form of threats, including District Judge April Perry, who is overseeing a case about the National Guard's deployment in Illinois; District Judge Sara Ellis, who is presiding over a case involving federal immigration agents' use of force; District Judge LaShonda Hunt, who issued a ruling on fencing outside of the Broadview U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility; District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who is presiding over litigation involving a warrantless arrest consent decree; and Magistrate Judge Laura McNally, who is overseeing litigation over conditions inside the Broadview ICE facility.

When asked about these threats, Kendall told the I-Team, ""No question. I don't think it matters which side they would have ruled. That's the climate that we're in.""

""If you rule for or against a particular issue, it seems to be fair game for this kind of reactive behavior on the part of the public. And mind you, it's not all of the public. We have tremendous support. ... But it doesn't matter when it's pitted up against this group of individuals that choose to use this language, choose to use these attacks to spread derogatory information about individual human beings,"" Kendall said.

The Federal Bar Association's Chicago chapter recently condemned the rise in threats to judges in the Northern District of Illinois and across the country.

""Expressions of public sentiment-whether criticism or praise-are not threats to judicial independence,"" the FBA Chicago chapter statement reads. ""Recent threats of violence directed at Chicago federal judges for simply doing their job, however, are unacceptable and have no place in our discourse.""

In response to rulings in several local immigration-related cases, officials with the Trump administration have called out ""activist judges"" as responsible for rulings it deems not in the administration's favor.

Judge Kendall said the entire bench rules impartially.

""Each of the judges on this bench, they don't go out to be political,"" Judge Kendall said. ""They go out saying, 'I've got my law degree, I've got my oath from the President. It's now time for me to listen to evidence, listen to facts, apply the law and come to a fair and impartial decision.'""

But with the rise of social media, and access to personal information online, Judge Kendall says intimidation has increased, especially in recent months.

Clerk of Court for the Northern District of Illinois Thomas Bruton said he has seen this first-hand.

""We have seen threats significantly increase,"" Bruton said. ""We've seen threats increase both online, through email communication, through phone communication, and it's concerning.""

Bruton added, ""It's a difficult job when you look at the statistics and the number of judges that have been threatened, you look at the number of staff that have received inappropriate communications. But it's our job to keep everyone safe.""

Geoffrey Deas is the assistant director of judicial security for the U.S. Marshals Service. Deas told the I-Team he is particularly concerned with ""silent hunters,"" or people who may not have made any active threat but are triggered to action by violent rhetoric.

Deas explained the U.S. Marshals Service evaluates any communications sent to district judges, and if the communication goes beyond ""First Amendment Protected Speech,"" the U.S. Marshals, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigations, has statutory power to investigate further.

In 2025, Deas said 364 different judges out of approximately 2,500 active judges nationwide were named as threatened on a protective investigation.

Deas said he expects to see an uptick in threats to judges locally because of the intensity surrounding recent immigration-related rulings.

Judge Kendall worries the threats could have long-term consequences.

""It's really critical that you can seek redress in the federal court,"" Judge Kendall said. ""The public really needs to understand how serious it is for the independence of the judiciary because judges just need to be able to do their job. ... If they're disagreed with, then there's a higher court. But in order to do that, well, we have to be able to just honestly do our jobs without that nervousness of threats.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18210633_112525-wls-iteam-judges-mark-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-26 02:56:54.967750

The report describes the practice of only allowing detainees to be taken to hospital if they were handcuffed as “a form of coercion”.

The report comes at a time when the government has pledged to expand immigration detention so it can deport more people.

The IMB national chair, Elisabeth Davies, said: “It’s about operational force being used for operational convenience.” She added that she has written to the Home Office “numerous times” raising concerns about the high levels of handcuffing and the lack of clear justification provided.

The report provided examples of restraint IMB is concerned about, including a man who was on constant suicide watch who was screaming and resisting removal. He took off his trousers and was carried naked from the waist down to a plane. Staff took turns to push his head against his seat. The report found the impact on his dignity to be “profound”.

It also reprinted a note on a detention centre staff whiteboard saying: “Thought of the Day: Handle Stressful situations like a dog. If you can’t eat it or hump it, piss on it or walk away.”

Davies said the sign was not hidden in any way. She has called for changes in staff culture and said the sign was an example of staff culture: “I think that offers little reassurance.”

Another example of a concerning staff culture highlighted by the report involved an incident where a personal protection trainer told officers: “If someone’s coming at me, I’m going to keep myself safe. I don’t worry about what’s proportionate, I won’t worry about Serco or my job, my priority is to look after myself.”

A spokesperson for the government contractor Serco, one of the private contractors used by the Home Office to manage detention centres, said: “This report is full of unevidenced assertions and unsubstantiated comments which do not reflect our professional training or how we treat people in our care. Our officers only use appropriate and proportionate force as a last resort, and the use of force is closely monitored.”

Missed opportunities for de-escalation are also identified in the report, including a case where a man was restrained after failing to obey an instruction to stand up. The report finds no evidence of a trauma-informed approach, despite many detained people having experienced trauma, including torture and trafficking, with nothing to indicate that this was being considered when planning or executing force interventions.

Significant gaps were identified in the recording of force with incomplete documentation, inaccurate records, and ineffective review processes identified, raising concerns about governance and accountability.

Davies added: “The findings of this report are deeply concerning. For the use of force to be lawful, it must be necessary, reasonable, proportionate and justifiable, but what we are seeing is a system where restraint has become routine, oversight is weak, and the dignity of detained individuals is too often disregarded.

“We need meaningful cultural change and robust accountability to protect the rights of highly vulnerable people in detention. As national chair, I call on the Home Office to act urgently to strengthen oversight, embed trauma-informed practices, and ensure that force is only used when absolutely necessary.”

A spokesperson for Medical Justice, which supports the health of people in immigration detention, said: “The findings of this report are distressing. The Home Office continues to preside over the dangerous use of force and restraints demonstrating an inexcusable disregard for the safety of vulnerable people in its care.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “Last week, the home secretary announced the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in modern times, which will make it easier to remove and deport migrants. As part of this, we are reforming human rights laws and replacing the broken appeals system.

“We will carefully consider the findings in the report. The Home Office reviews all incidents of use of force to ensure that techniques are used proportionately.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8856c9942c673266266a38d1adec3b60fb6af5f8/1173_339_3327_2661/master/3327.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=536c839768501141464f5acddf086b66",N,,2025-11-25 20:57:31.380244

In April, ICE agents raided a nightclub in Colorado Springs, where the lawsuit said G.R.R.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ conduct during arrests in Colorado has been “unlawful,” a federal judge ruled Tuesday in an order that restricts how immigration officers can arrest people in the state.

The preliminary injunction ruling is a significant victory for immigrants rights groups, who sued ICE last month to stop “indiscriminate” arrests and detentions. The lawsuit alleges that ICE agents are arresting and detaining people in Colorado because of their skin color, accent or perceived nationality, without determining flight risk, to fulfill arrest quotas set by the Trump administration.

ICE must repay the bond money posted by three named plaintiffs in the case, all immigrants arrested in Colorado, remove their ankle monitors and stop making warrantless arrests in the state without determining and documenting each person’s flight risk, according to the the ruling by U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson in Denver.

“ICE’s hubris and violent behavior have been on national display for months,” said Hans Meyer, owner of the Meyer Law Office and an immigration attorney for the plaintiffs. “But as Judge Jackson’s decision makes clear, no one — including ICE — is above the law.”

The Meyer Law Office filed the suit along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado and Olson Grimsley Kawanabe Hinchcliff & Murray LLC.

ICE’s Denver field office referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The ruling could force ICE to curb its arrests of bystanders in targeted operations or its use of large sweeps of apartment buildings and workplaces, where officers do not know the identities of all of the people they are arresting before they arrive.

The law firms sued ICE on behalf of four people, including Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah student who was brought to the U.S. as a child. ICE arrested Dias Goncalves in June after a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy pulled her over in Fruita and asked about her accent and immigration status. She spent 15 days in ICE’s Aurora detention center and paid $2,000 for her bond, according to the ACLU.

U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson in Denver ruled that Dias Goncalves and two of the other plaintiffs now represent a class that includes all people arrested since Jan. 20, 2025, and people who will be arrested by immigration officers in Colorado “without a warrant and without a pre-arrest, individualized assessment of probable cause that the person poses a flight risk.”

Jackson ruled that ICE’s behavior of making warrantless arrests without probable cause that the people arrested are flight risks is “part of a larger policy, pattern, or practice by ICE in this state.”

Jackson ordered immigration officers to stop making warrantless arrests in Colorado unless the arresting officer determines before the arrest that there is probable cause that the person is in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws and there is probable cause that the person will escape before a warrant can be obtained.

After a warrantless arrest, immigration officers now must document evidence of a person’s flight risk, including only evidence that they were aware of before making the arrest. That documentation will have to include evidence of a person’s ties to the community that weigh against flight risk.

ICE will have to provide the lawyers representing the plaintiffs a random set of these probable cause forms for their review regularly, the order said, and specific forms upon request.

In addition to repaying three of the plaintiffs’ bonds and removing their ankle monitors, ICE must rescind any reporting requirements for them. ICE also is barred from rearresting the plaintiffs without a judicial warrant, according to the order, and is not allowed to detain them again unless there is a “material change in circumstances.”

In his ruling, Jackson said the plaintiffs in the case have likely suffered irreparable harm due to ICE’s actions.

“Although none of them presented a flight risk by any reasonable measure, they were each arrested and detained without warning, ultimately spending between approximately two weeks and three months in custody,” Jackson’s order said. “On its own, this constitutes great harm.”

A plaintiff identified in the lawsuit as J.S.T. is a 36-year-old asylum seeker who has lived in Colorado for 15 years. On Feb. 5, ICE agents raided the Whispering Pines Apartments complex in Aurora, where he had lived for seven years. ICE agents arrested J.S.T. as he was leaving the apartment parking lot to drive to his job at a restaurant and grocery store. He spent four weeks at the Aurora detention center and lost his home as a result, according to the lawsuit. He paid $25,000 for his bond, according to the ACLU.

And a plaintiff identified in the lawsuit as G.R.R. is a 32-year-old father and construction business owner who has lived in the U.S. for 11 years. In April, ICE agents raided a nightclub in Colorado Springs, where the lawsuit said G.R.R. was waiting as a designated driver for a friend. G.R.R. spent seven weeks at the Aurora detention center, according to the lawsuit. He paid $10,000 for his bond, according to the ACLU.

A fourth plaintiff, Refugio Ramirez Ovando, is a 43-year-old father who has lived in Colorado for 20 years and is the father of four U.S. citizen children. ICE agents in unmarked cars pulled him over in May when he was on his way to work in Grand Junction at the construction concrete company where he has worked for 18 years. ICE held him at the detention center in Aurora for more than 90 days, according to the lawsuit.

Jackson, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama in 2011, found that Ramirez Ovando doesn’t have standing in the case because he has obtained legal permanent residency and is unlikely to suffer similar ongoing harms like the rest of the plaintiffs.

Citing testimony in the case last month from the third in command at ICE’s Denver field office, Greg Davies, Jackson said the court has reason to believe ICE has a pattern or practice of failing to assess people’s individual flight risks. Davis “could not seemingly recall the correct standard, stating, at one point, that he believed a warrantless arrest was authorized if ‘there’s a possibility of that person possibly escaping.’”

Meyer, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said he and the legal team are exploring what possible remedies might be available to people already arrested without warrants under similar circumstances in Colorado who could be considered part of the new class.

The preliminary injunction, he said, should be seen as a first step toward accountability for ICE’s actions. Meyer cautioned that ICE has chosen not to comply with court orders elsewhere.

“Coming right before Thanksgiving when people get to congregate with their families, this is a powerful decision that reinforces the fact that ICE has been terrorizing communities throughout Colorado and breaking federal law with impunity,” he said. “Our expectation is that ICE will now be held to account for its lawlessness by the courts.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Colo_Sun_Vizguerra_ICE_02-copy.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 20:57:40.103279

Respondent asserts that petitioner is detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1) (‘§1225(b)’), while petitioner insists that he is eligible for such a hearing under 8 U.S.C. §1226 (a) (‘§1226(a)’). …

“Petitioner contends that, although he was initially detained pursuant to §1225(b)(1), once he entered full removal proceedings under §1229a, the statutory authority for detention became §1226(a), thereby entitling him to a bond hearing under §1226(a). The government rejoins that petitioner was detained under §1225(b)(1) under which detention is mandatory.

“The government is correct. Petitioner offers no support for his contention that the statutory authority shifted to §1226(a) and nothing in the statutory scheme indicates that an alien in §1229 proceedings is to be detained under §1226. …

“To the extent petitioner argues that his parole after arrival placed him under §1226(a) rather than §1225(b), he is mistaken. …

“Having established that §1225(b) (1) is the applicable statute, the next question is whether petitioner has been afforded the statutory rights to which he is entitled. It is clear that he has. …

“Petitioner, relying on case law, also claims that his detention without a bond hearing violates the Due Process Clause. … That argument is, however, premised on his incorrect assertion that he is subject to §1226. As explained above, petitioner’ s detention is pursuant to §1225(b) and that distinction is dispositive of his constitutional claim. …

“Because of the entry fiction doctrine, mandatory detention of petitioner under §1225 does not deprive him of due process or run afoul of the Constitution. Upon revocation of his humanitarian parole, petitioner was placed in custody pursuant to §1225(b)(1) just as though he had been stopped at the border and his due process rights were significantly curtailed accordingly. … Those rights, whatever they may be, do not include the right to a bond hearing.”

Oregon joined 21 other Democratic-led states in August to sue the federal government for threatening to withhold $1.4 billion in federal Victims of Crime Act funding unless the states agreed to help with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit never went to trial because the Trump administration abandoned its plan after the suit was filed, allowing states to retain federal grants without any new immigration enforcement rules.

The state of Oregon doesn’t have to pay anything out of pocket by signing onto another state’s lawsuit, according to Oregon Department of Justice spokesperson Jenny Hansson.

The Oregon Department of Justice has spent at least $19,000 in legal fees and travel expenses this year to send employees to attend court hearings in Washington D.C. and New York, according to public records obtained by the Capital Chronicle. Meanwhile, by filing the lawsuits the state has kept about $4.5 billion meant for Oregon Health and Science University research, electric vehicle infrastructure, sexual health education programs and education programs supporting low-income and unhoused students.

The lawsuits are to ensure Oregonians aren’t left paying the price when the federal government oversteps or breaks the law, Hansson said.

“The Oregon Department of Justice is committed to protecting Oregonians — not wasting their money,” Hansson told the Capital Chronicle. “The resources we’ve invested in defending Oregon’s rights in court are a fraction of what’s at stake.”

Oregon’s federal litigation team isn’t funded with direct taxpayer dollars

Some states set aside millions for potential lawsuits against the Trump administration. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom in late 2024 convened a special session to set aside $25 million to pay for anticipated legal costs against the Trump administration. In Maryland, Attorney General Anthony Brown received $1 million from the governor to fund a federal litigation team, Maryland Matters reported.

The state of Oregon did something similar, allocating $8.2 million in its 2025-27 Department of Justice’s budget to fund 20 full-time positions to support civil litigation and for the “defense of state interests.”

What’s unique about Oregon is that the money going toward defending state interests isn’t coming from the state general fund — or money collected from personal or corporate income taxes — but rather it’s coming from proceeds from civil litigation when the state is awarded damages, according to legislative fiscal analyst Steve Robbins.

With this designated funding, the department created a federal litigation team to respond to national legal issues. An agency webpage tracks all the lawsuits Oregon is a part of tied to immigration, human rights, LGBTQ+ issues, federal employment and other Trump administration policies.

In total, Oregon’s Department of Justice’s budget increased by 4% from the previous two-year cycle, raising its budget to $1 billion.

Some of that new funding also includes $17 million to support child advocacy centers and support services for domestic and sexual violence victims, $13 million to replace some of its legal software, $8.8 million to upgrade its child support software system and $10.8 million to add 33 full-time attorneys in its trial division to reduce the state’s need to contract with more expensive, private firms.

ICE is holding 554 people per day in its two Southern Nevada detention centers, data released Nov. 20 revealed. The Nevada Southern Detention Center in Pahrump is holding 461 people compared with the 365 individuals it held as of Sept. 25, the last time ICE released data. The Henderson Detention Center holds 93 ICE detainees per day, compared with 78 in September.

In Washoe County, the changes are more dramatic. Since September, the number of ICE detainees at the Washoe County Jail has jumped from 16 to 46 people per day — an increase of nearly 200 percent.

The new numbers come as ICE eyes creating a new detention facility in Nevada while the state struggles to meet capacity. At a press conference this weekend, Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem hinted at the possibility of expanding space in the state and, according to reporting from The Washington Post, the department is looking into constructing a “soft-side” facility — a makeshift structure composed of tents — at the Nevada Southern Detention Center.

Such a facility would double detention capacity in Nevada, adding space for about 450 people, per documents obtained by The Washington Post.

“We have some conversations that are ongoing — but I can't speak directly to details that are being finalized,” Noem told an Indy reporter at the press conference at Harry Reid International Airport.

The growth in detainees has put additional pressure on the Nevada Southern Detention Center, already one of the most over-capacity ICE detention centers in the country. The facility — which has a capacity of more than 1,000 and also holds detainees for other federal agencies — is only contracted to hold a maximum of 250 ICE detainees per day, but it is now exceeding that limit by more than 210 people.

Officials have previously raised concerns about adequate access to medical care and legal representation at the facility.

Changes to accommodate increasing ICE demands are already underway in Northern Nevada. In August, Washoe County had a $430,000 federal grant approved by the state to make improvements to the county jail, including dedicated holding cells and office space for ICE — although the sheriff's office wrote online that it was not planning to expand capacity with the funding.

Rising arrests?

Despite the dramatic increase in ICE detainees, it is harder to track down data about the number of immigration arrests in the state as most arrest data is not typically broken down on a local scale.

It is not uncommon for ICE detainees to be transferred from facility to facility prior to deportation, meaning that the number of those detained does not precisely indicate the number arrested. Recent Los Angeles Times reporting found that 12 percent of those detained from January through July 2025 have been transferred at least four times.

Still, the most recent information does signal that arrests are on the rise. An Indy analysis from this summer found that through the end of this June, ICE arrested about 48 people in Nevada weekly, more than four times the weekly average in the final 16 months of President Joe Biden’s administration.

Information from that data set, which derives from public records, has not been updated since July.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2025/07/042ca30f-ap25198625261415.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 20:57:43.630407

Detained DACA recipients question their arrests Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago Santiago, a 28-year-old activist from El Paso, was arrested in August despite showing immigration officers a valid work permit obtained through DACA.","McALLEN — Yaakub Vijandre was preparing to go to work as a mechanic when six vehicles appeared outside his Dallas-area home. Federal agents jumped out, one pointed a weapon at him, and they took him into custody.

Vijandre is a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has shielded hundreds of thousands of people from deportation since 2012 if they were brought to the United States as children and generally stayed out of trouble. The Trump administration said it targeted Vijandre over social media posts. The freelance videographer and pro-Palestinian activist described his early October arrest to his attorneys, who relayed the information to reporters.

His arrest and several others this year signal a change in how the U.S. is handling DACA recipients as President Donald Trump’s administration reshapes immigration policy more broadly. The change comes as immigrants have face increased vetting, including of their social media, when they apply for visas, green cards, citizenship, or to request the release of their children from federal custody. The administration also has sought to deport foreign students for participating in pro-Palestinian activism.

DACA was created to shield recipients, commonly referred to as “Dreamers,” from immigration arrests and deportation. It also allows them to legally work in the U.S. Recipients reapply every two years. Previously if their status was in jeopardy, they would receive a warning and would still have a chance to fight it before immigration officers detained them and began efforts to deport them.

In response to questions about any changes, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement saying that people “who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportations. DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.” DACA recipients can lose status “for a number of reasons, including if they’ve committed a crime,” she said.

McLaughlin also claimed in a statement that Vijandre made social media posts “glorifying terrorism,” including one she said celebrated Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida’s leader in Iraq who was killed in a U.S. strike in 2006.

An attorney for Vijandre, Chris Godshall-Bennett, said Vijandre’s social media activity is “clearly” protected speech. He also said the government has not provided details about the specific posts in court documents.

Vijandre is among about 20 DACA recipients who have been arrested or detained by immigration authorities since Trump took office in January, according to Home is Here, a campaign created by pro-DACA advocacy groups. The administration is seeking to end his DACA status, which could result in him being deported to the Philippines, a home he has not visited since his family came to the U.S. in 2001, when he was 14.

DACA has faced legal challenges

DACA survived the first Trump administration’s attempt to rescind the program when the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the administration did not take the proper steps to end it.

There have been other attempts to end the program or place restrictions on recipients.

This year, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that would deny work permits for DACA recipients who live in Texas. The Trump administration recently presented its plans to a federal judge who is determining how it will work.

The administration also has issued new restrictions on commercial driver’s licenses that would prevent DACA recipients and some other immigrants from getting them. Last year, 19 Republican states stripped DACA recipients’ access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. And the number of states where immigrant students can qualify for in-state tuition has dwindled since the Justice Department began suing states this year.

“This administration might not be trying to end DACA altogether the way that they did the first time around, but they are chipping away at it,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, spokesperson for United We Dream, which is part of Home is Here, the coalition keeping track of public cases of DACA recipients who have been detained.

Detained DACA recipients question their arrests

Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago Santiago, a 28-year-old activist from El Paso, was arrested in August despite showing immigration officers a valid work permit obtained through DACA.

Days later, federal officers arrested Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira as the 28-year-old father was arriving at his El Paso home with his children following a doctor’s appointment. Agents dislocated his shoulder, according to his attorneys.

Both Santiago and Gamez Lira were held for over a month while their attorneys petitioned for their release.

Marisa Ong, an attorney for Santiago and Gamez Lira, said the government failed to notify either of her clients of any intention to terminate their DACA status.

“DACA recipients have a constitutionally protected interest in their continued liberty,” Ong said, adding that “the government cannot take away that liberty without providing some valid reason.”

DACA recipients can lose their status if they are convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanors like those involving harming others, driving under the influence or drug distribution, or three or more misdemeanors. They can also lose their status if they pose a threat to national security or public safety.

DHS claimed in a statement that Santiago was previously charged with trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia and that Gamez Lira was previously arrested for marijuana possession.

Ong said that when attorneys sought their release “the government presented no evidence of any past misconduct by either individual.”

Vijandre, the Dallas-area man who was arrested in October, remains in a Georgia detention facility. His attorneys say he received notice two weeks before his arrest that the government planned to terminate his DACA status but that he wasn’t given a chance to fight it.

“I think that the administration has drawn a very clear line and at least for right now, between citizen and noncitizens, and their goal is to remove as many noncitizens from the country as possible and to make it as difficult as possible for noncitizens to enter the country,” Godshall-Bennett, Vijandre’s attorney, said.",https://i0.wp.com/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DACA-Rally-REUTERS.jpg?fit=2560%2C1706&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-25 21:56:43.396754

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Monday said ICE lodged an arrest detainer against Nina Kristina Jaaskelainen, who is from Finland, after she was recently arrested in Florida.

For over TWO DECADES, Jaaskelainen has been in our country illegally, skirting the law without consequence. Now, a baby, a mother, and a dog have been assaulted by her,” McLaughlin said in a news release.

The Cambodian government has long failed to ensure an adequate standard of living, compelling many families to obtain predatory microfinance loans, making the tenuous situation of people who returned even more difficult.

The government should follow through on its pledges to find jobs for those who returned and implement more effective measures to protect all Cambodians from predatory debt collection practices.

(Bangkok) – The Cambodian government is failing to provide support to hundreds of thousands of migrant workers with microfinance debts who returned from Thailand because of hostilities in mid-2025, Human Rights Watch said today.

Even before the border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand, from July 24-28, Cambodian officials encouraged migrant workers in Thailand to return home because of rising tensions, and more than 900,000 have done so. The government’s promises of jobs and other support have not materialized for most though, and many are under pressure to repay microfinance loans they took before seeking work in Thailand. The government should assist returned migrant workers to find jobs in Cambodia and adopt measures to provide meaningful debt relief to them and other Cambodians.

“The Cambodian government has an obligation to assist the migrant workers its officials encouraged to return from Thailand because of discrimination and recent hostilities,” said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should ensure that predatory microfinance institutions are not putting improper pressure on returned migrants and other marginalized Cambodians who are struggling to feed their families.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 56 former migrant workers in Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey province who returned from Thailand between May and September.

The Cambodian government has long failed to ensure the rights to an adequate standard of living, education, and health care, compelling many families to obtain predatory microfinance loans. The return of hundreds of thousands of Cambodian migrant workers because of hostilities with Thailand and the promises of support from the Cambodian government have made their already tenuous situation even more difficult, Human Rights Watch said.

In May, tensions escalated at the Thai-Cambodia border. On June 14, Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen called on all Cambodians working in Thailand to return home to avoid expulsion or mistreatment in Thailand, calling it a “real and inevitable risk.” Prime Minister Hun Manet, Hun Sen’s son, said the government was prepared to facilitate repatriation, with the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training pledging more than 70,000 jobs for returned migrants and the Ministry of Economy and Finance ready to offer a “range of economic and social intervention packages aimed at improving their daily lives.”

On June 23, Thailand ordered the closure of all land crossings with Cambodia, except for migrant workers returning to Cambodia.

Migrant workers told Human Rights Watch that they returned to Cambodia due to discrimination and harassment in Thailand, as well as the Cambodian government’s promises of employment and social assistance. But many said that once back in Cambodia, they have been skipping meals and forgoing medical care to make repayments on microfinance loans they incurred before going abroad. In 2023, the average Cambodian household held more debt than they spent for the year.

A 17-year-old who had worked for two years in Thailand said she had dropped out of school and migrated to help her mother repay a microfinance loan. She said that after fighting between Thailand and Cambodia began, her Thai employers would regularly verbally harass her: “I would cry every day because of the bad treatment at work.”

Despite government promises, returned migrant workers said that there were very few jobs available once they got back home. Some travelled to find work in the capital, Phnom Penh, hundreds of kilometers away from their homes in provinces along the Thai-Cambodia border, but few reportedly found employment.

A 32-year-old woman who tried to get a job at a Cambodian garment factory after returning from Thailand said she did not have the necessary experience. “I took a three-day skills test, and I didn’t pass because I didn’t have the skills to work and sew the garments,” she said. “They want skilled workers, and we don’t have the skills.”

Many returned migrants have loans from banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs). For years, Cambodian banks and MFIs have engaged in predatory lending, causing a household debt crisis, and pressure to repay debts often contributes to the decision to migrate to Thailand for work. Cambodia has the most microcredit debt per capita anywhere in the world.

A 2019 report from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) identified microfinance debt as a growing driver of migration from Cambodia, and Cambodia’s microfinance sector has grown rapidly since then. The Cambodian Development Resource Institute (CDRI) reported that one-third of returned migrant workers are from households that hold formal loans ranging from US$5,000 to US$8,000, several times larger than Cambodia’s annual median per-capita income.

A 41-year-old woman who had lived in Thailand for 10 years working in construction in Bangkok said that she now had to balance repaying her loans with paying for health care and her children’s education. “We have to decide between food, making MFI payments, and whether our kids can still afford to go to school,” she said. Her household used to have three people working in Thailand but now all have returned, and the family has cut back to two meals a day. She said that if they miss their monthly loan repayment of more than $100, they will lose the land they pledged as collateral for the loan.

Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which Cambodia is a party, governments are obligated to take steps, to the maximum of their available resources, to progressively realize the human right to an adequate standard of living. This includes the obligation to protect people from conduct by third parties, such as predatory microfinance institutions, that would prevent the fulfillment of this right. Under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, private companies also have responsibilities to respect human rights and to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for practices that have harmed people.

The Cambodian government should take prompt action to uphold the rights of returned migrant workers, including by following through on its pledges to assist them in finding employment. The government should also implement more effective measures to protect all Cambodians, including returned migrant workers, from predatory debt collection practices and the potential human rights harms of debt servicing.

This could include the restructuring of loans for returned migrant workers and others affected by the Thai-Cambodia border conflict, who face extreme economic hardship. The government needs to enforce penalties for aggressive debt collection practices and ensure that all microfinance institutions and lenders follow ethical standards for loan recovery.

The government also needs to address the broader situation that compels many families in Cambodia to take on considerable debt, including by removing barriers to health care and free education. The Cambodian government should allocate appropriate resources to both sectors and set budgetary spending targets aligned with international benchmarks.

“The situation is dire for these returned migrant workers, who are rapidly eroding their savings to survive and pay off their debts,” Lau said. “Cambodian authorities need to act swiftly to protect Cambodians from microfinance lenders and financial institutions and support workers who returned from Thailand at their urging.”

Fear of Violence, Discrimination Drove Migrant Workers to Return

Many migrant workers told Human Rights Watch that they returned to Cambodia because they experienced or feared discrimination in Thailand, or feared violence, as tensions rose at the border.

A woman, 44, who had worked in Thailand for more than 20 years, said that after the border conflict began on July 24, everyday life in Thailand became more difficult. She recalled being told, “Why don’t you go back to Cambodia and pick up the bones of the dead Cambodians?”

“My husband and I could not handle the discrimination, so we returned,” she said. “People in the market didn’t want to sell us food because we are Cambodian. Every time we went to work, we felt this discrimination.”

A man, 30, who had worked in Thailand for 10 years reported witnessing violence against Cambodian migrant workers. “A group of Thai men, around 50, were on foot and motorbikes looking for Khmer to attack,” he said. “One of the people in my village was also beaten and chased [until] I was about 10 meters away. The couple wanted help but there were so many Thais beating them, no one dared to help.”

Thai media reported several assaults on Cambodian workers, as well as social media posts of a Thai ultra-royalist activist talking about Cambodian workers who were ungrateful and taking jobs from Thai citizens.

Returned migrants said that Thai police and authorities also discriminated against Cambodian workers. A woman, 37, who worked in construction in Bangkok said that Thai police would ask migrant workers, “Do you want to go home to Cambodia, or do you all want to go to prison together?”

A man, 18, who also worked in construction in the Thai capital, recalled Thai police going door-to-door to check visas and passports of Cambodian migrant workers, asking for money or detaining people who could not pay. Some migrant workers reported being required to pay bribes to Thai police or soldiers when they crossed back into Cambodia.

The border between Cambodia and Thailand has remained shut, and many workers fear a return to Thailand would mean further discrimination or even violence from Thai authorities or employers. Thai media reported that about 300 Cambodian migrant workers were arrested between mid-June and September for attempting to cross into Thailand without permission. Other Cambodian migrant workers have reported staying in Thailand despite the situation due to the economic pressures stemming from loans, including bank and microfinance loans from Cambodian financial institutions.

After border tensions again increased in early November, Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on November 10 announced the suspension of a policy that allows about 100,000 migrant workers from Cambodia to stay in Thailand for an additional year after their work permits expire. This has left the legal status of Cambodian migrant workers remaining in Thailand in limbo.

Promises of Jobs Unmet

Some migrant workers said that Cambodian government promises of jobs and social assistance also encouraged them to return home. On June 14, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet posted on his Facebook page that the government was ready to handle a mass repatriation of workers, and specifically mentioned that the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training would help find jobs for returned migrants due to a shortage of tens of thousands of workers in the country.

Upon returning to Cambodia, many migrants found that there were few jobs available, and those that did exist were either too far from their homes or a poor match for their skills. A woman, 53, returned to Cambodia due to fears of violence and because she read news reports that the Cambodian government had jobs for returning migrant workers. “But when we returned, there were no jobs for us,” she said.

A man, 28, said that getting hired at a garment factory in Cambodia was difficult because the jobs were far away, and returned migrant workers often lacked any connections that could help them secure employment. Others reported that the costs of transportation and housing in Phnom Penh and the length of time it would most likely take to find a job would make it too expensive for many returned migrants to seek employment in the capital.

The CDRI reported that the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training claimed there were 190,000 jobs available for returned migrant workers. Even if true, with more than 900,000 migrant workers returning, more than 700,000 workers would not be covered.

The CDRI further noted a mismatch between the available jobs and returned workers, with the majority of migrants returning to border provinces, such as Banteay Meanchey and Battambang, while most of the available jobs were in Phnom Penh. In addition, more than half of returned migrant workers had been working in construction or agriculture in Thailand, while most of the available jobs in Cambodia were in other sectors.

In October, a group of local civil society organizations called on the government to address these issues through improved social security, especially unemployment benefits, large-scale and gender-sensitive employment programs, and debt relief, among other measures.

International human rights law provides everyone the right to social security, including during periods of unemployment. Currently, nobody who is unemployed in Cambodia has access to social security, based on the International Labour Organization’s data.

Debt Pressures

As Human Rights Watch has previously reported, Cambodian households often take out loans from paying supplementary school fees to affording out-of-pocket payments for essential medicines, and other human rights. But when household income must be diverted to service debt, it can also limit the fulfillment of rights like health, education, and an adequate standard of living, which includes the rights to food, housing, and water.

Like other Cambodians living in rural areas or in poverty, many returned migrant workers are in significant debt to microfinance institutions for loans they took out years ago.

While the Cambodian government has adopted laws and policies to regulate MFIs, they remain largely unenforced, allowing predatory lending and collection practices to persist.

In correspondence with Human Rights Watch from July, the National Bank of Cambodia, which has the authority to sanction and suspend or revoke licenses of MFIs, did not provide any instances in which it had penalized or sanctioned MFIs for any violation of consumer protection or regulatory laws or policies. Rather, the government has repeatedly demonstrated a preference for voluntary measures and self-regulation.

On July 30, the National Bank of Cambodia issued new guidelines to financial institutions that “encouraged” them to enact unspecified “relief” for returned migrant workers. None of the people interviewed identified any meaningful relief measures by microfinance institutions or banks.

A woman, 18, who was until recently working at an agricultural factory in Thailand said she moved abroad after dropping out of school in grade 9 because her family had to sell the motorbike that she was using to ride to school to repay their microfinance loans. She said that since returning to Cambodia in July, she eats about half as much meat as she used to at each meal and is worried about not being able to pay for treatment for her mother’s medical condition.

A woman, 35, who used to work on a farm in Thailand before the fighting began, took a microfinance loan to build a home, but now struggles to juggle repayments along with food and medical costs. “I have to cut down on my food a lot ... we are replacing meat and protein with more rice now,” she said. “Credit officers come to my home to pressure me to make payments.… I am afraid they will take my land. We are afraid of the MFIs more than we are of the police.”

A woman, 47, who has both microfinance debt and informal loans, expressed fears about repaying her debts: “I’m willing to go without eating to pay back my loans out of fear of losing my land that my home is on.”

These pressures have led returned migrant workers to take on more debt to make ends meet and avoid forced land sales, a common practice of credit officers who pressure borrowers to sell their land without using the legal foreclosure method when they are unable to repay their loans. A man, 55, with a microfinance loan who had pledged his land as collateral, said: “When I am late on repayments, I walk around my village looking to borrow money from people out of fear of losing my land and my home on it ... I worry every day about my microfinance loan repayments; I worry all the time. Whatever I have I will sell, because I am worried about them taking my land.”

Healthcare costs put over-indebted households under further financial strain, with 61 percent of all healthcare costs in Cambodia covered out-of-pocket, by far the highest percentage in the region and among the highest in the world.

A woman, 33, who had recently returned after working in Thailand for four years, said that she initially left Cambodia because she could not earn enough to repay a microfinance loan, which she needed partly to pay for treating her mother’s chronic illness.

“When we are late, credit officers will come and harass us to make payments, and we would avoid staying home to not have them pressure us,” she said. “There have been maybe three or four families in my village who have lost land because they didn’t pay MFI loans. The families who lost land had to go work in Thailand, but now we don’t know where they are, because they have nothing to come back to.”

Two former construction workers in Bangkok—a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old woman—had each taken out microfinance loans to cover healthcare expenses for family members, using land that their houses are on as collateral. They said they ate less than they did before returning from Thailand because they were worried about losing their land. “I repay because I’m worried that they [credit officers] will take my land away,” the woman said. “I see on Facebook that people have lost their land, so I stress about it.”

The Cambodian Government’s Inadequate Response

There are few options available for returned migrant workers who cannot find work and are burdened with heavy microfinance debt.

The Cambodian government should take prompt action to uphold the rights of returned migrant workers, including by following through on its pledges to assist them in finding employment. The government should also take additional measures to implement more effective consumer protection measures to protect all Cambodians, including returned migrant workers, from predatory debt collection practices and the potential human rights harms of debt servicing. This could include the restructuring of loans for returned migrant workers and others affected by the Thai-Cambodia border conflict, who face extreme economic hardship. The government needs to prohibit and enforce penalties for aggressive debt collection practices and ensure that all microfinance institutions and lenders follow ethical standards for loan recovery.

The government also needs to address the broader situation that compels many families in Cambodia to take on considerable debt, including by removing barriers to health care and free education.

NEWS THEN & NOW

Then:

Policy and attitudes toward immigration have changed throughout U.S. history, including toward those seeking safety from political repression or violence, known as refugees or asylum seekers. The first department of immigration in the U.S., known as the Bureau of Immigration, was founded in 1891.

Anti-immigrant sentiment would often target specific populations of immigrants. In the mid-1800s, before the Civil War, a political group called the ""Know-Nothings"" pushed back against Irish and German immigration. On the West Coast, the Gold Rush brought Chinese immigrants who were often met with discrimination. This discrimination led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese laborers from immigrating for ten years and made obtaining citizenship close to impossible. Later, workers would have to seek special permits to be eligible for employment.

Anti-immigration laws peaked around World War I, including quota systems by country and other barriers such as literacy tests.

After World War II and the establishment of the United Nations, the U.S. began to accept more ""displaced persons"" under ""expedited admission"" or a simpler process for immigration. Formal laws governing asylum cases, or a category of refugees seeking protection from political persecution, were established in response partly to people displaced by the Vietnam War.

Now:

The Trump administration has begun to dismantle asylum in the United States, partly through executive order. According to one order signed early in Trump's second term, ""The United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.""

As noted in this segment, many individuals seeking formal asylum protections in court are being arrested and deported shortly after judges dismiss their cases.

Lawyers from around the country are working together and organizing, to find legal strategies to free detained immigrants.

Monterey and Santa Cruz counties are at the center of a power struggle with the state over a key part of the clean energy transition—battery storage.

A congressional hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Monday focused on what witnesses called the chilling effects of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Immigration Lawyers Get Help From Unlikely Allies In Fight To Free Clients

After the 2024 presidential election, Stacy Tolchin expected the next four years to be an uphill battle. The Pasadena-based immigration lawyer lived through the chaos from the first Trump term. She remembers family separation, the Muslim travel ban and attacks on refugee and asylum programs. Yet, Tolchin and other lawyers and advocates were still surprised at the speed and sophistication of the current administration’s mass deportation campaign.

“It’s really much worse than I even contemplated it would be at the beginning of the year,” she said. The Trump administration has stripped international students of their visas, deported people to one of the most dangerous prisons in the world, and launched violent immigration sweeps in American cities.

Besides the public-facing tactics, the administration has also made a series of quiet legal maneuvers that have made it much more difficult for immigrants to fight deportation cases. These efforts include: Funneling people into fast-track deportation programs, making it harder for immigrants to hire lawyers and making it almost impossible for detainees to get out on bond.

But after being knocked on their heels in the early months of Trump’s new term, lawyers nationwide are now banding together and developing their own legal strategies. “We need warriors, we need people to help us in this fight,” Tolchin said. Chief among them are writ of habeas corpus petitions — federal lawsuits that challenge illegal and indefinite detentions. Collectively, they have filed more than 4,000 habeas petitions as last-ditch efforts to get their clients released from immigration detention centers.

Filing a habeas petition is unfamiliar for many attorneys. To help bridge the knowledge gap, immigration lawyers are turning to informal networks for help. Some organizations, like the American Immigration Lawyers Association, have even hosted formal workshops where lawyers can network and get a crash-course in filing habeas petitions.

Why Regulating Battery Energy Storage Is Taking So Long On The Central Coast

Santa Cruz County took a small step last week toward developing a policy to regulate battery energy storage systems (BESS).

At almost the same time, Monterey County supervisors were having a similar conversation. “We just can’t have somebody come in here while we don’t have an ordinance,” said District 2 Supervisor Glenn Church, during a Nov. 18 meeting. “We gotta develop an ordinance.”

The heart of the issue for both counties is the idea of local control. Currently, companies can apply with the state for permits to build and run a BESS. They don’t have to go through the county. But, if counties have ordinances governing BESS facilities, a company can instead choose to go the local route. That could mean more community support.

Here’s the challenge—the state’s climate goals demand a lot more renewable energy storage, fast. Local government is often slow. In Santa Cruz County, they were deciding whether to start a year-long process to develop an ordinance. Even that was delayed. In Monterey County, they were weighing whether to enact a temporary moratorium on new BESS facilities. That didn’t happen either.

Congressional Hearing Examines Effects Of Immigration Enforcement In Southern California

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach, convened a congressional hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Monday to gather testimony about alleged violations by federal immigration agents, whom they accuse of improperly detaining immigrants and citizens alike, often without probable cause or warrants.

The hearing included testimony from elected officials, experts and residents who have been directly impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Andrea Velez is a U.S. citizen who was detained by ICE agents while on her way to work in June. “Terrified, I used my work bag as a shield, but he slammed me into the sidewalk and accused me of interfering,” she said. “When I asked for his badge or a warrant, he refused and handcuffed me. They didn’t believe I was a U.S. citizen or bother to check my ID. I spent most of that first day shackled in a van watching others arrive, distraught and taken against their will.”

Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight also launched a new tracking system to document possible misconduct and abuse during federal immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/GettyImages-2216992166-2000x1334.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 21:56:50.926566

New Finance Committee Analysis Shows Historic Cuts To Health Care, Food Assistance, Education, And Child Welfare Programs

Text of the Report (PDF)

Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released a new analysis outlining the extensive harm the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are inflicting on millions of children nationwide. The report details how Republican actions are reducing access to health care, slashing food assistance, weakening education and child welfare systems, and advancing immigration policies that traumatize vulnerable families.

“Despite empty promises to the contrary, Trump’s agenda is going to leave kids in America sicker, hungrier and less safe,” Wyden said. “By making the largest cuts to health care and food assistance in the nation’s history, Donald Trump and Republicans have left children and their families poorer and worse off in ways that will be felt for generations.

The report explains how the Republican agenda has cut more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, threatening coverage for children who rely on them for affordable health care. The analysis highlights how children’s hospitals are expected to lose billions in funding and how families will face higher premiums, new bureaucratic hurdles, and a greater risk of losing coverage altogether. It also documents unprecedented cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and related nutrition supports, including reductions that will affect more than 16 million children.

The report builds on previous work by Wyden to expose how the Trump-Republican agenda is leaving America less healthy. Last month, Wyden revealed how Trump Administration policies and the reconciliation bill will harm Americans with cancer. Earlier this month, Wyden exposed how health care providers across the country are slashing jobs and closing their doors on account of the Republican cuts.",https://www.finance.senate.gov/themes/finance/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 21:56:54.372661

In addition to capping the amount of funds that can be spent on permanent housing, HUD is requiring more total homeless dollars be subject to competitive bidding.","California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta sued the Trump administration Tuesday seeking to stop a federal policy change that advocates say could force 170,000 formerly homeless Americans back on the streets or into shelters.

The lawsuit focuses on a federal program known as Continuum of Care that sends money to local governments and nonprofits to fight homelessness.

This month, the Trump administration announced it was drastically cutting the amount of money the program will pay for rental subsidies in permanent housing and shifting those dollars to temporary housing and services instead.

With subsidies for permanent housing reduced, advocates say 170,000 people could return to homelessness. Locally, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority has warned 5,000 L.A. County households, containing 6,800 people, could be at risk of losing their homes, which would erase the small decline in homelessness reported this year.

“This [federal] program has proven to be effective at getting Americans off the streets, yet the Trump Administration is now attempting to illegally slash its funding,” Bonta said in a statement.

HUD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This month, the department said its policy change “restores accountability to homelessness programs and promotes self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans” in part by redirecting most money to transitional housing and supportive services that it sees as more effective than permanent housing.

Bonta filed the lawsuit along with 19 state attorneys general and two governors.

The lawsuit alleges the HUD policy change violated the law in several ways, including that the department failed to properly notice the change and that the new restrictions on funding violate the separation of powers because they were not imposed by Congress.

In addition to capping the amount of funds that can be spent on permanent housing, HUD is requiring more total homeless dollars be subject to competitive bidding.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6821813/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3411x1791+0+242/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F89%2F0b1c094c4051b0041a582c87bb2d%2Fcalifornia-bonta-26497.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 18:58:41.083177

The city’s immigrant communities are on alert and expressing anxiety about the expected arrival of U.S. Border Patrol agents. Federal officials have said little publicly about what is planned for New Orleans, though troops reportedly could arrive as early as Nov. 28 in preparation for raids to begin in early December.

On Nov. 22, Louisiana Bishop Shannon Duckworth issued a statement upholding the baptismal call to respect the dignity of every human being. The following is Duckworth’s full statement.

Beloved Sisters and Brothers,

Grace and peace to you in the name of the One who calls us to “do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with our God” (Micah 6:8).

In recent days, we have received notice of upcoming immigration enforcement actions that will take place across various Louisiana communities. As the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana, I am mindful of our responsibility both to uphold the dignity of every person and to support the common good of our cities and towns.

Louisiana is a state that values order, stability, and the rule of law. As a diocese, we affirm the need for lawful systems of immigration and the importance of public safety. We also affirm that the current system is broken and requires reform. At the same time, we ask that the exercise of governmental authority be proportional, humane, and respectful of constitutional protections. Law and order must never be divorced from justice, and justice must never be separated from mercy.

We therefore urge all enforcement personnel, public officials, and community leaders to conduct themselves with compassion; to avoid actions that separate families unnecessarily; to respect houses of worship, schools, and hospitals as sensitive locations; and to honor the inherent worth of every human being regardless of immigration status.

During this period of heightened anxiety, we ask Louisiana congregations and faith communities to commit themselves to prayer, hospitality, practical and lawful assistance, and responsible reporting.

To those living in fear during this time: You are not alone. Your lives have dignity. Your children matter. Your faith communities walk beside you. While we cannot prevent lawful enforcement actions, we can stand with you, spiritually, pastorally, and humanely, so that fear does not have the final word.

The God we worship is a God who “is near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18), and who calls nations to embody compassion. We pray that Louisiana may respond to these days not with panic, hostility, or division, but with courage, prudence, and neighborly love.

Faithfully,",https://i0.wp.com/episcopalnewsservice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ENS_placeholder_2024.jpg?fit=600%2C400&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-25 22:56:30.152808

Michael Leavitt won $1 million in a DraftKings contest in 2014, according to The North Andover Eagle Tribune.","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt now has a family connection to the ICE actions sweeping the country — her nephew’s mother was arrested by agents in Revere earlier this month.

Bruna Ferreira, a Boston-area resident who migrated with her family to the U.S. from Brazil as a child, according to her sister and immigration authorities, is now in custody at an ICE facility in Louisiana.

Michael Leavitt, the press secretary's brother, had a relationship with Ferreira, and the two have a son.

A Trump administration official confirmed the connection between Ferreira, Michael Leavitt and his sister Karoline Leavitt — the 28-year-old New Hampshire native who rose from relative obscurity to occupy one of the most prominent positions in the White House. The official said the child's parents have not spoken in years, and that the child has lived full-time in New Hampshire with Michael Leavitt since his birth.

WBUR could not immediately confirm whether the boy only lived with his father after the couple separated. The split happened about 10 years ago, according to a family member.

Karoline Leavitt declined to comment on the arrest. The administration official said, “Karoline had no involvement whatsoever in this matter.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Ferreira had a ""previous arrest for battery."" She entered the U.S. on a tourist visa that required her to leave the U.S. in 1999, McLaughlin said.

“Under President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation,” McLaughlin said.

A lawyer for Ferreira was not immediately available for comment.

No battery charges against Bruna Ferreira could be located in Massachusetts' online court records.

Michael Leavitt won $1 million in a DraftKings contest in 2014, according to The North Andover Eagle Tribune. At the time, the story said, Leavitt and Ferreira were engaged and their son was 8 months old.

In a statement, Michael Leavitt said, “My only concern has always been the safety, wellbeing, and privacy of my son.”

Ferreira’s sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, started a GoFundMe page to help with legal costs to fight the ICE charges and allow her sister to stay in the country. According to the post, Ferreira has maintained her legal status through a program for people who entered the country as children — Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. She has “followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing,” according to the GoFundMe page.

“She is hardworking, kind, and always the first to offer help when someone needs it,"" Dos Santos Rodrigues wrote.

Why this is happening now The Trump administration says limits on graduate loans are needed to reduce tuition costs.
It believes that capping student loans will push universities charging higher-than-average tuition to look at lowering rates.
The Trump administration's proposal, by contrast, says only the degrees spelled out in the new regulation can count as professional programs.
Under the new plan, students in professional programs would be able to borrow $50,000 a year and up to $200,000 in total.","A coalition of nursing and other health care organizations are angry over a Trump administration plan that could limit access to student loans in some cases.

Students pursuing graduate degrees in nursing, physical therapy, public health and some other fields would face tighter federal student loan limits under the plan because it doesn't consider them professional programs.

The revamp is part of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress.

While graduate students could previously borrow loans up to the cost of their degree, the new rules would set caps depending on whether the degree is considered a graduate or professional program.

The Education Department is defining the following fields as professional programs: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology.

Left out are nursing, physical therapy, dental hygiene, occupational therapy and social work as well as fields outside of health care such as architecture, education and accounting.

While the plan is still being finalized, the new student loan caps would take effect next July.

Why this is happening now

The Trump administration says limits on graduate loans are needed to reduce tuition costs. It believes that capping student loans will push universities charging higher-than-average tuition to look at lowering rates.

To define what counts as a professional program, the Education Department is turning to a 1965 law governing student financial aid. The law includes several examples of professional degrees but says it isn't an exhaustive list. The Trump administration's proposal, by contrast, says only the degrees spelled out in the new regulation can count as professional programs.

One in 6 of the nation’s registered nurses held a master’s degree as of 2022, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

The details of the plan were recently hashed out in a federal rulemaking process.

What this means for students

Some future students could find it more costly or difficult to pursue a specialized degree. Under the new plan, students in professional programs would be able to borrow $50,000 a year and up to $200,000 in total.

Other graduate students, such as those pursuing nursing and physical therapy, would be limited to $20,500 a year and up to $100,000 total.

Trump administration says impact will be minimal

The Education Department says its data show 95% of nursing students, for example, are in graduate programs that won’t be affected by the new caps. The department says the vast majority of students are in programs that cost less than the $100,000 cap being proposed for federal student loans.

Students already enrolled in graduate programs would be grandfathered into current lending limits.

Health groups say change will worsen nursing shortage

A coalition of health care organizations has urged the Education Department to change course, arguing that post-bachelor’s health care degrees that are needed for licensure or certification should be considered a professional degree.

They also say that fields being excluded are largely filled by women and in high-demand. According to a U.S. Census Bureau report in 2019, women made up about three-fourths of the full-time, year-round health care workers in the U.S. and accounted for a much higher share in jobs such as dental and medical assistants.

The organizations contend that capping federal student loans will make the ongoing nursing shortage even worse, force students to seek more expensive private loans and threaten patient care.

The American Association of Colleges of Nursing says if the proposal is finalized, “the impact on our already-challenged nursing workforce would be devastating.”

Giving nurses a chance to further their education and advance their careers has attracted young people to the profession, said Susan Pratt, a nurse who is also president of a union representing nurses in Toledo, Ohio.

But making that harder could push away future nurses, she said.

“It's just a smack in the face,” Pratt said. “When we were during the pandemic, the nurses showed up, and this is the thanks we get.”

More concerning, while the overall number of international students on U.S. campuses is down 1 percent from the previous academic year, new international students declined 17 percent, according to new fall 2025 snapshot data published this week by the Institute for International Education.

The snapshot is based on 825 institutions that host more than half of all international students.

This could signal larger decreases ahead as international students graduate and if difficulties obtaining student visas remain. International students have faced new rules causing visa delays and denials, social media vetting policies, travel restrictions and universities nationwide have faced cuts to federal research funding that supports graduate students, according to the survey.

“While we share concern about the recent decline … our commitment remains unwavering: to create an environment where students from around the world feel valued, supported, and inspired to succeed,” said Angie Paccione, executive director of the Colorado Department of Higher Education. “We want future students to see Colorado as their academic home — a place where they can learn, thrive, and belong.”

How did Colorado schools fare this fall?

The report shows graduate students are driving most of the decline. That’s true for the University of Denver, where international enrollment declined 19 percent this fall, driven mostly by graduate students.

The Colorado School of Mines cohort dropped about 8 percent. Colorado State University’s international enrollment decreased by 4.5 percent. CU Boulder’s undergraduate international numbers were down 10 percent.

Figures weren’t available for all new international students in Colorado who are on campus for the first time. But new international students at CU Boulder declined 27 percent, mostly among graduate students. The federal government has cut research funding at many universities, which attract graduate students.

There are significant cultural and economic consequences. One national study shows the decline amounts to $1.1 billion in lost revenue and nearly 23,000 jobs.

“Their diverse perspectives enrich our classrooms, and their cultural and economic contributions — amounting to more than $409 million — strengthen communities across the state,” Paccione said.

No university would speculate on the impacts of federal government decisions. A CU spokesperson said the university is focused on supporting the international community.

“We are also looking at ways to strengthen our enrollment strategies and overall support for international education and global initiatives that will continue to drive our value as a leading public research university.”

Last academic year’s figures show slight growth

Another Institute for International Education report released this week, the Open Doors report, shows the slowing began last school year. The number of international students in Colorado grew 1.8 percent last academic year compared to 4.5 percent the previous year. Nationwide, total international student numbers fell 7 percent.

It shows 10,547 students from abroad studied at Colorado universities last year, up 184 students from the year before. Colorado slipped from 23rd to 24th in the nation.

India remained the dominant sender, making up 33 percent. China declined from 11.2 to 9.7 percent. Kuwait stayed about the same, Saudi Arabia had a slight increase, and the number of students from Canada stayed about the same.

CU Boulder, CU Denver and Colorado State University all grew in international students last year. DU was down 136 international students (its own statistics show 113), and the Colorado School of Mines dropped sharply by 254 students.

Study abroad

The number of students studying abroad increased modestly to 6,583, with CU Boulder sending the most students. The most popular destinations were Italy, Spain, the UK, France and Japan.

In terms of the percentage of students who study abroad, the Institute for International Education ranked the University of Denver ninth among doctoral-granting institutions. More than 71 percent of 2023-24 graduates studied abroad. Students pay tuition to DU, and then DU pays that tuition to the study abroad program. The Cherrington Global Scholars initiative covers the cost of round-trip airfare and visa application fees.

This academic year, 846 DU students have committed to going abroad, with most already at their destinations for the fall quarter.

“DU study abroad students expand their horizons, deepen cultural understanding, and build lifelong skills and confidence that empowers them to grow academically, personally, and professionally in ways no classroom at home can fully replicate,” said Uttiyo Raychaudhuri, vice provost for internationalization.

In the spring of 2025, CU Boulder posted a 40 percent year-over-year increase in students studying abroad. The university ranked fifth among doctorate-granting institutions for providing semester-long study abroad opportunities. It ranked 13th for institutions awarding credit for study abroad.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/09/210908-CU-UNIVERSITY-OF-BOULDER-HIGHER-EDUCATION-COLLEGE-KEVINJBEATY-01.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 19:57:05.395992

Charlotte is over 150 miles from the coastal border, over 500 miles from the Canadian border, and over 1,200 miles from the Mexican border.

Roving patrols Historically, Border Patrol agents would only conduct these vehicle searches near the border to prevent illegal entry into the United States.
Border Patrol agents are rarely disciplined for misconduct, even when it results in death.","When Border Patrol agents descended upon Charlotte, North Carolina last week, many wondered why they were allowed to stop and question people so far from the border. Typically, it’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who have become ubiquitous with the largescale enforcement operations of the second Trump presidency, seen roaming the streets of places like Chicago and Los Angeles.

Charlotte is over 150 miles from the coastal border, over 500 miles from the Canadian border, and over 1,200 miles from the Mexican border. So why, then, were Border Patrol agents—mostly known for their operations along the U.S.-Mexico border—arresting people deep in the interior of the country?

The short answer: legally, Border Patrol has more authority than most people realize—and politically, the Trump administration is leveraging every ounce of that authority.

What the 100-mile zone does (and doesn’t) mean

A key source of confusion is the so-called “100-mile zone.” Under Section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), immigration enforcement officers—including both ICE and Border Patrol—can “board and search for” unauthorized immigrants on vessels, trains, aircraft, or vehicles located “within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States.”

Federal regulations define that “reasonable distance” to generally be within 100 miles of land and coastal borders. (Airports are not covered in the 100-mile zone, as they serve as ports of entry for international travelers.)

The 100-mile zone limits Border Patrol’s authority to a certain extent: they cannot board buses or trains outside the zone, nor can they set up fixed vehicle checkpoints. It is, however, within their power to pull a driver over and interrogate them about their immigration status if they have “reasonable suspicion” that they are not a citizen.

Border Patrol vs. ICE: Why the distinction is blurring

The INA defines agents from both Border Patrol and ICE as “immigration officers,” meaning they share a set of nationwide enforcement authorities, including:

The power to interrogate any person they believe may be an immigrant about their right to be in the United States.

The power to make warrantless arrests if an individual is believed to be violating immigration law and likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained.

The power to make arrests for immigration-related felonies and, in some cases, other federal crimes committed in their presence.

These authorities apply anywhere in the country, not just near the border.

Roving patrols

Historically, Border Patrol agents would only conduct these vehicle searches near the border to prevent illegal entry into the United States. Now, they’re being used by immigration agents far from the border, on the mere suspicion that someone “looks” undocumented. The Trump administration has taken this authority to the extreme, sending Border Patrol and ICE “roving patrols” to terrorize communities.

The Supreme Court intervened to let the controversial tactic continue. A majority of the justices overturned, without any explanation, a ruling that masked and armed agents could not snatch people off the street and question them based on their perceived race, what language they speak, what they do for work, and even where they happen to be when they encounter an immigration agent. Both a federal court in Los Angeles and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had previously ruled that these actions amounted to illegal racial profiling.

In a concurrence, Justice Kavanaugh argued that these stops were not a significant problem for citizens and lawfully present immigrants, based on his belief that individuals could show ID and be permitted to go immediately. However, in many cases, this has proven to be false, as Department of Homeland Security officers have detained U.S. citizens and lawfully present immigrants for hours, or days, while their paperwork was checked.

While the case will likely eventually reach the Supreme Court again, for now, courts have little ability to step in to limit the actions of these roving patrols.

Border Patrol: A history of violence and immunity

Under President Trump’s mass deportation agenda, every immigration officer counts—so both ICE and Border Patrol are pulled into interior operations that would have previously been handled by ICE alone.

Border Patrol is not only legally able to participate, they’re well-practiced in aggressive enforcement tactics developed in border communities where they have enjoyed heightened authority for over a century.

Since its creation in 1924, the Border Patrol agents have stereotyped and dehumanized the targets of enforcement actions. The agency reveals little to the public or Congress about how it operates and largely gives its officers autonomy in the field. Border Patrol agents are rarely disciplined for misconduct, even when it results in death. Despite this lack of transparency and accountability, the budget, workforce, and arsenal of the agency have grown significantly over the decades; a growth which has been supercharged by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/immigration-impact-border-patrol-charlotte-zone.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 17:57:20.396101

Judge Ann Aiken at the U.S. District Court in Eugene granted a request from the nonprofit Newport Fishermen's Wives and Lincoln County for a temporary restraining order in the case pending further proceedings.

The helicopter normally stationed at a small USCG facility in Newport was abruptly moved 70 miles south to North Bend, and the plaintiffs argued that DHS was illegally shuttering the facility without any public notice or opportunity for comment.

While there are procedures under federal law which might allow Noem to shut down the facility, the plaintiffs argued that she both did not follow those procedures and, even if she had, they said the decision would not have been ""legally or factually defensible.""

""The evidence before the Court at this juncture is that those procedures were not followed and the Court can discern no hardship to Defendants in an injunction requiring them to continue operating the Newport Air Facility as they have for the better part of four decades,"" Aiken wrote in her opinion.

The DHS decision to remove the helicopter from Newport came about after local officials learned earlier this month that the federal agency was looking at the Newport Municipal Airport as the possible location for a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility.

According to Lincoln County Commissioner Walter Chuck, DHS moved the helicopter on Oct. 30, without any prior notification to local leaders.

""If there is a rescue helicopter that is a half an hour, one hour away, it makes it very difficult for our men and women to survive in the cold waters. Hypothermia sets in very quickly,"" Taunette Dixon of the Newport Fishermen’s Wives told KGW last week.

In a statement, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said that the helicopter has been stationed in Newport for nearly 40 years and that moving the helicopter leaves one of the Pacific's most dangerous stretches without timely aerial coverage, putting lives at risk.

""This helicopter isn’t a luxury — it’s a critical part of how we keep people alive on the Oregon Coast,"" he said.

As of Monday night, the Newport air station was completely unstaffed. Meanwhile, Dungeness crabbing season is set to begin Dec. 16.

Judge Aiken's restraining order will last 14 days unless extended or replaced with a permanent injunction.

In a video posted to social media on Tuesday, Newport Mayor Jan Kaplan said that a Texas-based firm called Team Housing Solutions, which had initially inquired about leasing airport property in an apparent bid to set up a detention location for ICE, was now actively contacting hotels along the Oregon coast. They were looking into pricing and availability for up to 200 rooms for a year, the mayor said.

There also remain 18 job postings for an ICE facility in Newport, the mayor said, with the latest posted Nov. 19.

The statement deepens a dispute between the Trump administration and Democrats, including Arizona senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly and Michigan congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, over the video message, which urged the military and intelligence services members to “refuse illegal orders”.
“To be honest, the president’s reaction and the use of the FBI against us is exactly why we made the video,” she said.

The four politicians, along with two others, had made a video encouraging US military service members to resist unlawful orders – a message that angered Trump, who posted on social media that the group were “traitors” and thus could be jailed or even face the death penalty.

The statement, released by congressional lawmakers Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, confirmed that the FBI had contacted the House and Senate sergeants at arms requesting interviews with them.

“No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our constitution,” they said, adding that they had each sworn an oath “to support and defend” the US constitution.

“That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship,” they added.

The statement deepens a dispute between the Trump administration and Democrats, including Arizona senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly and Michigan congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, over the video message, which urged the military and intelligence services members to “refuse illegal orders”.

Slotkin said the FBI’s counter-terrorism division had notified the group that “they are opening what appears to be an inquiry against the six of us” and described the move as a “scare tactic” by Trump.

“To be honest, the president’s reaction and the use of the FBI against us is exactly why we made the video,” she said.

“He believes in using the federal government against his perceived adversaries, and he’s not afraid to use the arms of the government against people he disagrees with. He does not believe the law applies to him … which is exactly why we made the video, to give people some assurance that they weren’t alone as they watch this stuff unfold.”

An Alien File (A-File) is a record that holds a noncitizens’ immigration history. It includes copies of forms they may have filed, information about their immigration arrests (if they have had encounters with immigration enforcement), and some immigration court records. This file is crucial to immigrants and their legal representatives when applying for immigration benefits or defending themselves against potential deportations. Unlike in criminal courts, where defendants have the right to access their criminal files, noncitizens in immigration proceedings must obtain their A-Files by filing requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

Recently, immigration attorneys have been reporting increased incidents of USCIS rejecting requests or withholding information contained in A-Files when filing these FOIA requests. The changes seemingly deviate from USCIS procedures described in guidance documents. For example, attorneys reported that the agency required new information to verify individuals’ identity when making the request. Also, practitioners state that the agency now redacts certain forms with information that it previously released. These withholdings not only act as roadblocks to individuals’ understanding of their immigration history, but can also stymie legal representatives’ ability to provide noncitizens with adequate legal advice.

On November 24, 2025, the Council filed a FOIA request with USCIS for updated guidance materials the agency uses to process FOIA requests for A-Files. The request seeks current agency guides and other records of updates to the procedures, documents of new training, and other related records. It builds on the documents USCIS previously published.

Andrea Velez, an American arrested by US immigration officials over the summer, described how she was accosted by masked agents while on her way to work. She said she was charged with assaulting an officer and held for two days in a federal detention center, where detainees had to pay for a cup in order to have water. The charges against her were ultimately dismissed due to what her attorney described as a lack of evidence.

Democrats organized the hours-long congressional oversight hearing in Los Angeles in order to hear testimony about the impacts of Donald Trump’s sweeping deportation agenda, and look at alleged civil rights abuses by federal agents and the “unlawful” detention of US citizens.

“Every person in our country has a right to due process, regardless of immigration status. It’s critical that the Oversight Committee document and hold accountable those that are defying the constitution, violating civil rights, and terrorizing families and communities,” Robert Garcia, a Democratic California congressman, said in a statement.

The White House said earlier this month that the federal government had arrested more than 150,000 undocumented immigrants and deported nearly 140,000 people since Trump took office.

His administration has made southern California a focal point for its aggressive mass deportation campaign. Federal agents have descended on car washes and Home Depot stores, and near schools and workplaces, leaving southern California communities in fear and parks and churches empty. The federal government has been accused of “blatant racial profiling” and civil rights violations.

“Right now we are living an American nightmare,” said Jasmine Crockett, a Democratic representative from Texas.

The situation has left lasting effects on southern California communities and residents affected by the raids.

Velez said in her testimony: “I still live with the trauma everyday.”

Karen Bass, LA’s mayor, described the raids as “an attack from our own federal government” and an affront to cities and people across the US.

“We will hold every federal agency accountable, and we will relentlessly defend the rights of every resident in Los Angeles – and across this nation,” Bass said. “Reports that Angelenos, including US citizens, were forcibly held, physically attacked, and deprived of their freedom without cause are not only outrageous – they are intolerable.”

Garcia on Monday announced the creation of a new oversight dashboard documenting “verified incidents of possible misconduct and abuse” during federal immigration enforcement operations”.

The Effects of Immigration Enforcement on Student Outcomes in a New Era of Immigration Policy in the United States David Figlio and Umut Özek.","Two new studies provide a first look at how schoolchildren in two of America’s largest states have been affected by the immigration crackdown President Donald Trump ordered after taking office in January. Both show student performance fell during the spring semester in parts of California and Florida as authorities began enforcing federal immigration laws much more aggressively than in prior years.

The studies also reveal a dynamic many news stories overlook: The surge in immigration raids and arrests has consequences for various student groups — not just unauthorized children or children whose parents are not authorized to be in the U.S.

“This is much broader than that,” says economist David Figlio, who cowrote one of the papers.

The first paper, published Nov. 4 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates that student absences spiked in southern California after the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol launched “Operation Return to Sender” at the beginning of the year.

Federal officials targeted California’s Central Valley starting Jan. 7, the day after Congress certified the results of Donald Trump’s presidential election win. Many parents in the area, a major hub for agriculture and food processing, kept their kids home from school.

Stanford University education professor Thomas Dee, who conducted the first study, estimates that students in the five Central Valley counties he examined missed an estimated 22% more days of school during the spring semester of 2025 than they had in the spring semesters of 2024 and 2023. Younger kids were absent most often. For example, the average number of days that schools reported pre-kindergarten students as being absent rose an estimated 35%.

The second paper, a working paper the National Bureau of Economic Research released Nov. 10, offers a detailed look at student performance in Florida. It examines test scores, attendance and discipline across grade levels in an unidentified Florida county that researchers describe as large, urban and home to one of the nation’s 10 biggest school districts.

A main takeaway of that analysis: Test scores dropped among middle and high school students who speak Spanish at home, the vast majority of whom are U.S. citizens. That includes children whose families are from Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory where U.S. citizenship is granted at birth, says Figlio, who coauthored the working paper with economist Umut Ozek.

As of 2022, nearly one-third of all kids living in Florida were Puerto Rican, according to 2024 report from the National Research Center on Hispanic Children & Families, a collaboration of three universities and the nonprofit research organization Child Trends.

Schools that primarily serve students from lower-income households saw their average test scores fall farther than schools that primarily serve students from wealthier households. Girls’ scores tended to drop more than boys’ scores. Meanwhile, lower-performing students’ scores worsened more than those of higher-performing students.

Absentee rates in both states

The researchers all looked for statistically significant changes in absenteeism during the spring 2025 semester. Dee found that the average student in southern California missed an estimated two additional days of school.

He says schools in other parts of the U.S. may see student attendance dip when immigration enforcement increases. He points to Charlotte, North Carolina as a recent example.

On Nov. 17, more than 30,000 kids in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg public school system were absent — three times as many students as the previous Monday , The Charlotte Observer reports. Two days earlier, masked Border Patrol agents arrived in the state’s largest city for an immigration crackdown. By Wednesday, more than 250 people had been arrested, according to The Associated Press.

“I suspect we will see similar effects elsewhere, but I think this is an active area of research and we’re going to want to know more,” says Dee, a professor at Stanford’s Graduate School of Education and a fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and the Hoover Institution, a conservative-leaning public policy think tank at Stanford.

However, Figlio and Ozek determined that absentee rates in the Florida county they studied stayed about the same after immigration authorities ramped up enforcement efforts.

How the two studies differ

Differences in the researchers’ findings could be due to several factors, including student demographics and the type of immigration enforcement each paper examines.

In the Florida county that Figlio and Ozek studied, more than 35% of public school students are Hispanic. Dee studied five California counties where more than 70% of public school students are Hispanic.

Each study looks at immigration enforcement from a different lens. Dee aimed to gauge the impact of a series of immigration raids that occurred unexpectedly in southern California in January 2025. Less than two weeks after the raids, Trump rescinded national guidelines that had been in place since 2011 to discourage law enforcement officials from enforcing immigration laws in so-called “sensitive areas” such as schools and churches.

Dee’s research shows how an unusually large increase in daily student absences across southern California coincided with four days of concentrated immigration enforcement in that region.

Figlio and Ozek, on the other hand, looked at changes in the rate of immigration arrests in Florida over a longer stretch of time. They learned that apprehension rates rose sharply after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. But the number of student absences in the county they studied stayed about the same during the spring 2025 semester, explains Figlio, a professor of economics and education at the University of Rochester who is a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.

Florida test scores

Figlio and Ozek did find a link between immigration arrests and scores on Florida’s statewide exam, the Florida Assessment of Student Thinking, administered three times a year to students in most grades. They found that test scores dropped during the spring 2025 semester, compared to the scores students received earlier in the 2024-25 academic year and during the 2022-23 academic year.

To better understand that relationship, they pored over data on country of origin for unauthorized immigrants who had been arrested in Florida as well as for students in the Florida county. They show that after Trump took office, immigration arrest rates tripled for unauthorized immigrants across all countries of origin. Arrest rates increased even more for unauthorized immigrants from certain parts of the world, including Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua.

Figlio and Ozek created a measure they call “school-level immigration apprehension intensity,” which represents the proportion of students at each individual school who were born in the same countries as the unauthorized immigrants who had been apprehended. They discovered that test scores for Hispanic students and students who speak Spanish at home tended to drop more at schools where a larger proportion of students were born in Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua, consistent with the statewide apprehension trend.

Their paper uses percentiles to describe the changes in test scores. They refer to the difference between Hispanic students’ and non-Hispanic white students’ scores — historically, Hispanic students’ scores have lagged behind those of white students — to give readers a sense of how large the drop in test scores was in spring 2025.

They write: “These are relatively modest effects: For example, the White-Hispanic test score gap in [this county] is 17 percentiles (so the effect on Hispanic students represents only about 3 percent of this gap) while the gap between English-speakers and Spanish-speakers is 8 percentiles (so the effect on Spanish-speakers corresponds roughly to 10 percent of this gap.”

Florida student discipline

School discipline reports also fell among Hispanic students and students who speak Spanish at home, albeit slightly. In their paper, Figlio and Ozek offer two possible reasons for that.

“First, it could be due to change in student behavior: students who are more likely to be exposed to immigration apprehensions (Hispanic and Spanish-speaking students) might try to avoid getting in trouble at school,” they write. “Second, it could be due to change in educators’ attitudes towards these students: teachers and principals might be more lenient towards similar behaviors from students who experience hardships due to increased immigration enforcement. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, we are unable to disentangle these two channels.”

News reporting tips

Dee and Figlio offered three tips to help journalists report on immigration enforcement under President Trump and its impact on local children.

1. Explain that missing school is a big deal for students.

Student attendance is a leading indicator of student performance. Dee stresses that it’s also a “harbinger of downstream impact,” because coming to school regularly influences how much and how well kids learn and how connected they feel to their school. When kids are frequently absent, they tend to earn lower test scores and take longer to graduate high school, which can later affect their future career choices and personal income.

Dee urges journalists to remind audiences that K-12 schools already are struggling to make up for learning losses during the COVID-19 pandemic. They continue to wrestle with chronic absenteeism, which worsened after COVID-19 and remains high nationwide.

“These immigration raids are complicating recovery,” Dee says.

Absenteeism can also hurt a school’s finances. Public school funding in some states, including California, New York and Texas, is based on average daily attendance.

2. Make clear that immigration enforcement activities affect whole communities, including people who are not immigrants.

“One thing I think our study helps bring to light is the notion that, if we are correct, there is community impact,” Figlio says.

He recommends that journalists broaden their immigration coverage by focusing on how people of various ages and backgrounds are affected by the immigration crackdown. A story he hasn’t seen told is increased enforcement has impacted families from Puerto Rico.

“Journalists have focused a large, large amount on undocumented people in the United States, and I think that’s important — but it’s a ‘yes and … ’ [situation] as far as I’m concerned,” Figlio adds. “I’d like journalists to dig in more.”

Dee recommends journalists ask teachers how immigration enforcement has affected classroom management and lesson planning. They should ask students how it has affected their classroom activities, friendships and lives outside school.

3. Familiarize yourself with the body of research on how immigration enforcement activities affect students.

Both researchers advise journalists to familiarize themselves with the research to date on how immigration enforcement in the U.S. has affected children. Figlio says journalists should not read his paper and assume they know enough to report thoroughly on the topic.

“This is the most current, most relevant data out there — but it’s still just one study,” Figlio says.

Earlier studies can provide important insights on how immigration enforcement impacts a variety of student-related metrics, including mental health and educational attainment years into the future. But journalists should keep in mind that immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has been much more aggressive than in recent decades.

A paper Dee cowrote several years ago finds that Hispanic student enrollment fell in U.S. counties where local law enforcement agencies partnered with federal agents to enforcement immigration laws under so-called ‘‘287(g)agreements.” Between 2000 to 2011, a total of about 320,000 Hispanic public school students in those counties were displaced, according to the analysis, published in 2019 in the American Educational Research Journal.

“Now, back to late Friday night, when he hurled ugly late-night threats against Minnesota’s Somali community.
I’m proud to stand up for our Minnesota values with my brothers and sisters.","SAINT PAUL, Minn. — In a post on his social media platform late Friday night, President Donald Trump announced that he would “immediately” terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somali immigrants living in Minnesota. In response to the President’s attacks on Minnesota’s Somali community, Congresswoman McCollum joined Minnesota leaders and stakeholders from the Somali community at a press event in the Minnesota Capitol Rotunda on Monday morning to defend our Minnesota values and vibrant immigrant communities. During the press event, Congresswoman McCollum delivered the following remarks(link is external):

“The Somali-American community is a vibrant part of our state, and I’m here today to stand with my brothers and sisters. In Minnesota, as was pointed out by the other speakers, we welcome our immigrant neighbors and treat them with respect, and we treat them with dignity. It’s been 50 years since the Vietnam War when we welcomed Hmong and Lao war veterans who fought alongside American forces during the secret war in Laos. They were welcomed into our communities. In the 1990s during the Somali Civil War, Minnesota again provided a safe new home for families displaced by extreme violence. The Minnesota immigrant communities are making contributions that make our neighborhoods and our nation a better place.

“Republicans continue to single out Democratic states that follow federal immigration law, turning our neighbors into scapegoats to win votes. I’m ready to get to work, seriously, about fixing our broken immigration system. It’s time for Trump and Republicans to come to the table if they truly care about comprehensive reform that upholds America’s values and keeps our country safe. Instead, for months Trump’s been stoking tensions across the country with reckless and illegal mass deportations that violate the essence of America: due process. Across America, he’s illegally deploying the National Guard and at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per day. In Washington D.C., it’s $1.3 million per day for the deployed National Guard.

“Now, back to late Friday night, when he hurled ugly late-night threats against Minnesota’s Somali community. You have to ask yourself why. It’s because Trump and Republicans are doing nothing to address the real crises facing us as Americans: The U.S. economy is in shambles, the cost of living is soaring, Trump and Republicans have created a health care crisis, and they’ve failed to deliver essential heating assistance for Minnesotans this winter.

“We know that when Donald Trump is in trouble, he always falls back to what he knows: throwing attacks and creating chaos. Americans deserve better than Trump’s attacks and misinformation about what’s happening here in Minnesota. Here’s the reality: Crime is declining. We continue to be ranked as one of the best states to start a business and raise a family. If Trump and House Republicans are serious about addressing the real challenges facing our country, they wouldn’t be attacking; they’d be listening to Minnesotans seeing their health care premiums rise, struggling to afford Trump’s taxes of tariffs – and that effects everything from groceries, to gas, to heating.

“I want to be clear: An attack against one of us is an attack against all of us. I’m proud to stand up for our Minnesota values with my brothers and sisters. I thank Governor Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison for all they do to move things forward in court. And I’m so proud to stand with my brothers and sisters in the Minnesota House and Senate. We haven’t changed our values since I served here. Let me say it again: An attack against one of us is an attack against all of us.”

Lauren Underwood on Monday called conditions inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview “terrible” and warned that staffing is expected to triple by January at ICE facilities in the Chicago area in anticipation of more immigration enforcement.
The congresswoman told reporters she saw no detainees, despite ICE having processed some people in the Chicago area this weekend.
Within the six states, there are 3,000 detainees in custody.

Underwood’s office said the Broadview center will reportedly be used as a training facility for newly hired deportation officers.","U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood on Monday called conditions inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview “terrible” and warned that staffing is expected to triple by January at ICE facilities in the Chicago area in anticipation of more immigration enforcement.

The congresswoman told reporters she saw no detainees, despite ICE having processed some people in the Chicago area this weekend. The ICE acting director told Underwood the last time anyone stayed overnight at the facility was “a couple weeks ago.” ICE officers told Underwood there were no detainees or staffers because they were “updating their systems and installing new security cameras.”

Underwood also staunchly warned that despite the departure of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino from Chicago, targeted immigration operations in the area are not over.

“Border Patrol is not gone. Mr. Bovino might not be here now, but according to these folks today, Operation Midway Blitz is still a joint operation between Border Patrol and ICE, and they have not received any instruction around an end date,” Underwood said. “I would not make those assumptions that there’s any kind of delay or reprieve.”

U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have insisted that Operation Midway Blitz would continue in Chicago, and a DHS source said about 100 agents would remain behind. The source also said 1,000 agents could return to the streets in March.

Underwood said the facility’s acting director, Samuel Olsen, is leaving his post this week and will be replaced by a new acting director who will be in charge of Broadview, the Downtown processing facility, and overseeing a six-state region.

DHS officials told Underwood that the Chicago immigration court docket is now among the largest in the nation, with more than 230,000 cases pending and more than 470,000 cases across the six-state region. She learned 30,000 people in Chicago are categorized as ready for removal. Within the six states, there are 3,000 detainees in custody.

She also warned that staffing for Chicago-area ICE facilities is expected to triple within months — stemming from a $150 billion to $170 billion infusion of funding over four years to DHS from President Donald Trump’s 2025 tax bill. Underwood said they are also pursuing contracts for temporary office space, potentially trailers near the Broadview facility. Underwood’s office said the Broadview center will reportedly be used as a training facility for newly hired deportation officers.

“That money is being spent here,” Underwood said. “The staff footprint in this facility and Downtown, the Downtown processing center is slated to probably triple by January. ... They are increasing immigration enforcement at that rapid rate. The American people need to see what’s happening in our community and the conditions under which people are being kept.”

Underwood’s visit provides a behind-the-scenes look at what advocates for detainees and former detainees described as unsanitary and cramped conditions, and what U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman even called a “prison.” Gettleman on Nov. 5 issued a 15-point temporary restraining order that calls for the federal government to improve conditions for detainees at the facility. The order addresses bedding, cleanliness, food, access to medications, access to lawyers and more. A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for Dec. 17.

Underwood described the holding cells as segregated by gender, with the largest cell holding 45 plastic chairs and three showers. Beds for women were limited, and Underwood said most female detainees are being transferred to Kentucky. Transgender detainees are being sent to Denver. She called conditions at the facility “terrible” and “not a place where you want to spend time.” Gettleman recently heard testimony about people being held there 100-150 to a cell.

“The shower works and then each holding cell had a toilet. The toilet was not in any way anything that any of us would be comfortable using, certainly not in an area that is open to others,” Underwood said. “There’s nothing at all comfortable. It does not meet what I would consider to be the minimum criteria for a detention cell.”

Underwood said ICE staffers made it clear “they are under no legal obligation to meet those criteria because this is not a detention facility — it’s a processing facility.”

Signs in English and Spanish said detainees could use a shower at least every other day upon request. The same sign said detainees could receive bottles of water for free with meals and upon request. She said detainees were being fed Subway sandwiches or food from Walmart. The facility has no food vendors on contract and no medical contracts. She spotted one package of Huggies, some sanitary pads for women and foot powder.

Underwood said she has been trying to visit the facility since September. She said her visit was only granted after funding was restored after the government shutdown.

“I believe that the standards need to be improved, and I understand that there’s ongoing litigation that would then enhance those minimum standards, which we are monitoring very closely,” Underwood said. “I intend to be back to this facility, and I have made a request to visit all DHS facilities in Illinois, and I look forward to the administration granting that request.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fe79e88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3425+0+287/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F2e%2F4d9096e54bae961ab217479771b3%2Fbroadview-112525-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:59:41.114500

This guest post does not necessarily reflect the views or expertise of Human Rights First. It is part of a partnership between UCLA Law and Human Rights First, where UCLA Law students use the new Democracy Watch tracker to analyze legislative threats to democracy.

The Supreme Court seems primed to weigh in on President Trump’s attempted deployment of National Guard forces in the near future. Court battles in California, Oregon, Illinois, Washington, DC, and elsewhere have delayed the deployments, and President Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to empower federal troops to carry out domestic law enforcement activities if the Court rules against him. This is in conjunction with increasing federal efforts to criminalize protests against the Trump Administration’s actions. A man was charged with a federal felony for providing face shields to people lawfully protesting in Los Angeles. At least five elected officials have been arrested or confronted while exercising lawful oversight duties or legally protesting. The September 22 Executive Order targeting “antifa” —which is not an organization— as a “domestic terrorist organization,” a term that holds no legal meaning, further underscores this pattern.The designation is so broad that it seems designed to justify the criminalization and targeting of anyone or any organization opposed to the Trump Administration’s policies. The accompanying National Security Presidential Memorandum makes this explicit, , authorizing action against individuals who they deem to be “obstructing the operations of the Federal Government,” explicitly citing opposition to ICE tactics. To drive this point home, when House Oversight Committee Democratic Ranking Member Robert Garcia (D-CA) unveiled an online tracker to document abuses and civil rights violations by ICE agents, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem tweeted a not-particularly-subtle threat that anyone who supports any sort of accountability for ICE misconduct will be prosecuted.

The right and freedom to dissent is fundamental to stemming the growth of authoritarianism. The ability to freely express opposition and disagreement with the actions of a government is a critical aspect of a functional democracy. Conversely, attempts to suppress dissent and the free exercise of protests is a hallmark of authoritarianism. Such attempts to inhibit or chill speech can include the use of militarized law enforcement in places with large protests, as well as political and legal attacks on people who exercise their right to protest or criticize the government or its actions.

And They Have Friends In the Legislative Branch

This criminalization of protest and dissent is not solely a top-down effort: the Trump Administration has allies in Congress and in State Legislatures around the country proposing and passing new laws designed to make it easier to prosecute protesters. Human Rights First’s Democracy Watch Tracker has identified 20 federal and 65 state-level bills from 2025 alone that, if passed, would curtail the right to protest and assemble in some form. Donald Trump has attempted to deploy National Guard troops to many cities that are most active in exercising their right to protest and assemble, namely Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago, with additional or rumored deployments pending in San Francisco, St. Louis, Baltimore, New Orleans, and New York. Many of the bills Human Rights First has tracked are coming from the very states that are actively protesting, and the Trump Administration is targeting.

Federal legislators from Tennessee have introduced the Protecting Law Enforcement from Doxxing Act, , which would make publishing the name of an ICE agent a felony punishable by up to five years in prison— reinforcing their push to criminalize opposition to ICE tactics.. Notably, this bill does not apply the existing legal definitions of doxxing, codified at 18 USC 119, which prohibit the disclosure of Social Security numbers, home addresses, home and mobile phone numbers, personal emails, or home fax numbers. Instead, this bill criminalizes disclosing only the names of federal law enforcement officials.

Other bills are attempting to criminalize protestors by making it a federal crime to bloc public roads. Tennessee and Louisiana Senators support the Safe and Open Streets Act which would make obstructing or delaying commerce on a public road a federal crime, similarly punishable by up to five years in prison. California, New York, and Tennessee Members of Congress support the Safe Passage on Interstates Act to make obstructing or delaying commerce on a federal interstate highway a federal crime punishable by up to fifteen years in prison — an extremely harsh penalty clearly designed to discourage protests and dissent.

Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt, who represents St. Louis (where Trump has mused about sending guardsmen) sent a letter strongly supporting the investigations and crackdown on “antifa,” a term meaning “anti fascist” that is often used to imply the existence of an organized group that does not in fact exist. This rhetoric is an example of a dog-whistle that has been increasingly used to discredit and target protestors and political dissent by linking them to this nonexistent entity, and to justify increased law enforcement actions against lawful protest.

Around the country, similar legislation, especially related to blocking streets, has been introduced in several states either currently or prospectively facing National Guard deployments. In Oregon, House Bill 2534 makes impeding traffic a Class C felony under the riot statute (as above, a five-year prison sentence). In Illinois, H.B. 2357 makes blocking roadways a felony, and goes further by allowing the local sheriff where a planned protest is occurring to limit the size of the gathering at their discretion, while also prohibiting local jurisdictions from exercising Home Rule rights to permit protests. And in Tennessee, both H.B. 0729 and S.B 0672 go even further still: they increase the penalties for obstructing sidewalks, railways, elevators, aisles, or hallways to a felony punishable by up to six years in prison, while increasing the penalties for obstructing a highway or street to a maximum of 12 years in prison.

Louisiana’s S.B. 15 is taken straight from the Trump Administration’s playbook of viewing any opposition to ICE’s actions as illegitimate. Enacted into law on June 20th, 2025, it expanded Louisiana’s obstruction of justice statute to include civil immigration proceedings and any act intended to “hinder” or “interfere” with federal immigration enforcement efforts, an extremely broad category that could be plausibly invoked against anyone protesting ICE’s actions in Louisiana or distributing Know Your Rights information to immigrants. It further requires that, upon request, an individual must be released into federal custody if federal immigration officials allege “that the person to be released either illegally entered or unlawfully remained in the United States.” There is no requirement in the law that federal officials offer any proof of their allegations nor reason for wanting to detain the person.

The movement to target, suppress, and chill dissent is not just a Trump Administration effort. Federal and State legislators from around the country are not just supportive of the Administration’s criminalization of free speech and protest; they are working to enshrine these measures into law. From all levels of government, there is a coordinated authoritarian effort to suppress dissent and criminalize anyone who speaks out or opposes the Trump Administration’s policies. Empowering ICE to act anonymously and with impunity naturally leads to protests against such abuses of power. Legislatures are responding by attempting to criminalize those who protest and oppose that abuse of power, and the Trump Administration is using selective prosecution and the mobilization of the National Guard to make it clear that this Administration will respond to the exercise of constitutional rights with the authoritarian whip of state violence.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/themes/launchframe/assets/images/open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:59:23.864390

The lawsuit is one of hundreds filed throughout the United States challenging the Trump administration’s new interpretation of longstanding immigration laws.

Despite those rulings, immigration judges continue to deny detainees’ requests for bond hearings, leading to additional lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court.","Another Iowa county jail is being sued for holding an individual who’s being detained by federal officials for possible deportation.

Javokhir Rahimov-Akobirovich, a native of Uzbekistan who is seeking asylum in the United States, is suing Hardin County Jail Administrator Nick Whitmore and Hardin County Sheriff Dave McDaniel in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.

Also named as defendants are Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons, St. Paul ICE Field Office Director Peter Berg, and Acting Director for the Executive Office for Immigration Review Sirce Owen.

In his lawsuit, Rahimov-Akobirovich argues he has lived in the United States for the last five years and first came into contact with ICE when deportation proceedings were initiated in October 2020.

Court records indicate that in December 2020, Rahimov-Akobirovich was released from custody under a $5,000 bond that was approved by an immigration judge in San Diego, California. On Nov. 20, 2025, Rahimov-Akobirovich, who lives in Calexico, California, was traveling through Iowa when he was apprehended by ICE agents and placed in the Hardin County Jail.

The lawsuit alleges Rahimov-Akobirovich is the victim of the Trump administration’s new policy suggesting that every individual held for possible deportation is subject to mandatory detention regardless of how long they’ve lived in the United States.

“ICE and the DOJ have adopted this position even with the weight of almost every federal district court against them,” the lawsuit asserts, adding that without relief from U.S. District Court, Rahimov-Akobirovich faces “the prospect of months, or even years, in immigration custody, separated from his family and community.”

The lawsuit, which alleges due-process violations and unlawful denial of release on bond, seeks a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order preventing federal officials from moving Rahimov-Akobirovich out of Hardin County until a decision can be reached in the matter. It alleges ICE is “ignoring” the fact that Rahimov-Akobirovich was free on bond, as approved by an immigration judge, when agents had him jailed in Hardin County.

The Department of Justice and the other defendants in the case have yet to respond to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit is one of hundreds filed throughout the United States challenging the Trump administration’s new interpretation of longstanding immigration laws. Dozens of cases have been filed in Iowa, with many of them naming as defendants the counties in which DHS and ICE are holding people in jail.

For close to 30 years, the DOJ and the courts held that individuals who were living in the United States and were then subject to deportation proceedings were entitled to a hearing on whether they should be released on bond while their deportation case was pending.

In July of this year, the Trump administration, through DHS, ICE and the Department of Justice, announced new “guidance” regarding the detention of applicants for admission to the United States. The guidance, which has since been declared to be DOJ policy, states that all persons who have entered the United States without inspection are deemed subject to mandatory detention without the possibility of a bond hearing.

On Sept. 5, 2025, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued a decision consistent with the administration’s new policy, holding that immigration judges lack the authority to hear bond requests in such cases.

That shift in policy upends the longstanding interpretation of federal law that said individuals already living in the United States while seeking lawful admission — as opposed to individuals apprehended at the border — were entitled to due process and could argue for pretrial release on bond.

Lawyers for people rounded up and jailed under the administration’s new interpretation of the law argue the new policy was crafted in response to Congress’ appropriation of billions of dollars to expand the immigration system, which will soon enable ICE to double its capacity to jail individuals on any given day.

Since July, immigration judges around the nation have embraced the administration’s new interpretation of the law, stating they lack the jurisdiction to determine bond for any person who has entered the United States without inspection, even if that person has resided in the United States for decades.

That, in turn, has led to hundreds of detainees across the country suing DHS, ICE and their local jailers in U.S. District Court, which is entirely separate from Immigration Court. In the overwhelming majority of those cases, federal judges have ruled in favor of the detainees and said those individuals are entitled to bond hearings.

When ICE agents swarmed a man in the parking lot of Downey Memorial Christian Church in Los Angeles, the church pastor told the officers that they didn’t have permission to be on church property. When they wouldn’t leave or show her any identifying information, she pulled out her phone to record the arrest. In response, an agent pointed a gun at her. Days later, while a man was videorecording a raid outside a Home Depot, DHS agents tackled him to the ground, arrested him and held him in detention for more than twenty-four hours.

These aren’t isolated incidents. Across the country, masked, armed federal agents in combat gear are snatching people from homes, workplaces, parks, and places of worship — and attacking those who attempt to film or document their activity.

The First Amendment protects the right to record and disseminate footage of law enforcement officers carrying out their official duties in public — that includes ICE, CBP and any other officers engaged in immigration enforcement activity. Yet in an apparent attempt to cover up their abuses, DHS is systematically attacking the right to record their agents at work.

That’s why we’ve filed a FOIA request for DHS records concerning people who record, livestream, or publicize immigration raids and arrests. We want to uncover relevant agency records — such as policy directives, training materials, legal analyses, and communications — to learn how the agency side steps the First Amendment right to record, how it’s instructing its agents to respond to cameras in the streets, and how widespread its retaliatory pattern is.

High-level Trump administration officials have already indicated that they consider the recording of immigration agents to be a threat rather than a right. At a July 2025 press event, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem declared that “violence” includes “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at.” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin later reinforced this characterization of filming agents, telling reporters that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents . . . . We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.”

On the other hand, DHS agents are recording their own interactions during raids, posting on social media, and providing exclusive access to reporters that support Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda.

The administration has self-interested reasons to suppress community recordings of immigration raids. Bystander recordings of law enforcement have proven critical to uncovering abuses and holding the government accountable, from footage of police brutalizing Rodney King in 1991 to the video of Derek Chauvin murdering George Floyd in 2020. Independent documentation can also be crucial to track and provide legal support to detained people and to counter government lies about law enforcement incidents. Video recordings of recent immigration arrests have served all of these purposes, which is why we must urgently defend this fundamental First Amendment right.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/11/ICE-photographer-FOIA.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:59:49.270736

ICE raid in St. Paul?

What we know:

The crowd had gathered outside a home in the area of Maryland Avenue East and Payne Avenue amid an operation that involved federal authorities, including ICE agents and a U.S. Marshals task force. St. Paul police officers were also at the scene, assisting with crowd control in riot gear.

Protesters held signs and called out anti-ICE chants as investigators worked inside a home.

The backstory:

Agents were on the scene at least through the 11 o'clock hour on Tuesday morning but cleared the scene starting around 12:30 p.m.

As they left, police used tear gas to clear protesters who were blocking vehicles in the street.

What were federal agents doing?

What we don't know:

FOX 9 has not been able to confirm whether the operation was related to immigration enforcement or simply a criminal investigation. FOX 9 has reached out to St. Paul police, the City of St. Paul, and the Department of Homeland Security for more information on the incident.

Agents at the scene did tell FOX 9's Corin Hoggard they were in the area looking for two people, one of whom ran away and went into a house.

Use of force by St. Paul police

What they're saying:

Outgoing St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter spoke with protesters following the raid but told the upset residents that he didn't yet have all the details about what happened.

""They don't coordinate with us,"" the mayor said, saying they weren't aware of the raid until it happened. ""They don't give us the information in advance… They sort of – what they do nationwide – pop up on the scene and create chaos and then leave. And then local communities are left trying to sort out chaos.""

Protesters raised concerns to the mayor about the use of tear gas and pepper spray by St. Paul police officers working crowd control during the incident. Two state lawmakers, Reps. Athena Hollins and Liish Kozlowski, said they were pepper sprayed by St. Paul police.

Speaking with the media afterward, Carter said it was a frustrating situation for everyone involved. ""Community members are frustrated. This is what we see ICE agents doing all over the country, showing up, creating havoc, creating chaos, and leaving local communities trying to figure out how to navigate the trauma they create. That's part of the troubling practice they create.""

Broader Policy and Ethical Considerations The termination of Myanmar’s TPS designation exposes tensions between immigration policy, national security priorities, and human rights obligations.
Ethically, the move raises questions about the U.S.’s commitment to protecting vulnerable populations amid geopolitical interests.","The Trump administration’s decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Myanmar nationals living in the United States reflects a broader shift in immigration policy, emphasizing enforcement and national security over humanitarian considerations. This policy change affects nearly 4,000 individuals who initially received protection due to the armed conflict and humanitarian crises following Myanmar’s military coup in 2021. While the administration asserts that conditions in Myanmar have improved enough to warrant the termination of TPS, evidence from human rights organizations depicts an ongoing crisis. This article analyzes the policy’s rationale, its human rights implications, and resulting consequences for Myanmar refugees.

Policy Background and Rationale

Temporary Protected Status was originally granted to Myanmar nationals after the military coup created extraordinary and unsafe conditions for returnees. It ensured that those affected by the crisis could legally remain and work in the U.S. temporarily. The Trump administration’s policy reversal, effective January 26, 2026, is grounded in the Department of Homeland Security’s position that “""the situation in Burma has improved enough that it is safe for Burmese citizens to return home"" ”. The administration cites Myanmar’s end to the state of emergency, ongoing ceasefire agreements between ethnic armed groups and the military government, and plans for national elections as evidence of progress and a return to stability. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem emphasized,

“After reviewing country conditions in Burma and consulting with appropriate U.S. government agencies, the Secretary determined that Burma no longer continues to meet the conditions for TPS designation.”​

This policy represents a core element of the administration’s broader immigration approach, which has seen the rollback of TPS protections for multiple other countries. The stated goal is to return TPS designations to their original ""temporary"" intent, avoiding indefinite or extended stays under humanitarian protections.

Human Rights Context and Contradictions

While the administration highlights political and security improvements in Myanmar, human rights organizations paint a starkly different picture. The ongoing conflict since the coup has caused massive civilian displacement—estimated at over 3.5 million people—and numerous casualties due to military operations and airstrikes. Reports of arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture, and detentions persist. According to international observers, the elections planned by Myanmar's military are widely regarded as neither free nor fair, undermining claims of democratic progress.

Critics argue the policy disregards these human rights realities. The termination of protections for nearly 4,000 vulnerable individuals is seen as inconsistent with the ongoing humanitarian crisis. As one rights group has pointed out, “Homeland Security's misstatements in revoking TPS for people from Myanmar are deeply troubling,” reflecting a dissonance between U.S. policy and documented abuses. The decision is also viewed as part of a broader pattern of reducing humanitarian protections for immigrant communities in favor of stricter enforcement.​

Impacts on Myanmar Nationals and Broader Immigrant Communities

The elimination of TPS forces affected Myanmar nationals to either seek alternative immigration relief or risk deportation to a country still embroiled in violent conflict. Many individuals protected under TPS have established strong ties to the U.S., including work, family, and community involvement. This policy shift places not only these individuals at risk but also their families and dependents, contributing to heightened fears of detention, separation, and social disruption.

Moreover, this move fits within a wider crackdown on immigration, evidenced by simultaneous travel restrictions and TPS terminations for other nationalities. Concerns over visa overstays and national security cited by the administration advance a policy narrative that prioritizes enforcement objectives over humanitarian needs. This dynamic increases uncertainty and anxiety within immigrant communities, potentially undermining social cohesion and integration.

Broader Policy and Ethical Considerations

The termination of Myanmar’s TPS designation exposes tensions between immigration policy, national security priorities, and human rights obligations. While the administration frames the decision as evidence of political progress and a return to normalcy, ongoing abuses and instability indicate a considerably more complex reality. Ethically, the move raises questions about the U.S.’s commitment to protecting vulnerable populations amid geopolitical interests.

By revoking TPS protections, the administration arguably shifts away from humanitarian principles enshrined in U.S. immigration policy frameworks. This is part of what some rights advocates have characterized as “""the largest de-documentation effort in U.S. history"" ” which exposes hundreds of thousands of immigrants to deportation and dismantles protections built over decades.​

The Trump administration’s termination of Temporary Protected Status for Myanmar nationals underscores a decisive turn towards immigration policies centered on legal restrictions and security concerns rather than humanitarian imperatives. While framed as a response to improved conditions in Myanmar, the policy ignores substantial evidence of ongoing human rights abuses and conflict, placing vulnerable individuals at risk. The repercussions extend beyond Myanmar nationals to broader immigrant communities, highlighting critical ethical and policy challenges in balancing human rights with national security priorities.",https://impactpolicies.org/admin/storage/photos/shares/2025/Trump%20Myanmar%20TPS%20Termination%20and%20Its%20Impact%20on%20Human%20Rights%20and%20Refugees.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 14:57:45.659143

A congressional hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Monday focused on what witnesses called the chilling effects of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Immigration Lawyers Get Help From Unlikely Allies In Fight To Free Clients

After the 2024 presidential election, Stacy Tolchin expected the next four years to be an uphill battle. The Pasadena-based immigration lawyer lived through the chaos from the first Trump term. She remembers family separation, the Muslim travel ban and attacks on refugee and asylum programs. Yet, Tolchin and other lawyers and advocates were still surprised at the speed and sophistication of the current administration’s mass deportation campaign.

“It’s really much worse than I even contemplated it would be at the beginning of the year,” she said. The Trump administration has stripped international students of their visas, deported people to one of the most dangerous prisons in the world, and launched violent immigration sweeps in American cities.

Besides the public-facing tactics, the administration has also made a series of quiet legal maneuvers that have made it much more difficult for immigrants to fight deportation cases. These efforts include: Funneling people into fast-track deportation programs, making it harder for immigrants to hire lawyers and making it almost impossible for detainees to get out on bond.

But after being knocked on their heels in the early months of Trump’s new term, lawyers nationwide are now banding together and developing their own legal strategies. “We need warriors, we need people to help us in this fight,” Tolchin said. Chief among them are writ of habeas corpus petitions — federal lawsuits that challenge illegal and indefinite detentions. Collectively, they have filed more than 4,000 habeas petitions as last-ditch efforts to get their clients released from immigration detention centers.

Filing a habeas petition is unfamiliar for many attorneys. To help bridge the knowledge gap, immigration lawyers are turning to informal networks for help. Some organizations, like the American Immigration Lawyers Association, have even hosted formal workshops where lawyers can network and get a crash-course in filing habeas petitions.

Why Regulating Battery Energy Storage Is Taking So Long On The Central Coast

Santa Cruz County took a small step last week toward developing a policy to regulate battery energy storage systems (BESS).

At almost the same time, Monterey County supervisors were having a similar conversation. “We just can’t have somebody come in here while we don’t have an ordinance,” said District 2 Supervisor Glenn Church, during a Nov. 18 meeting. “We gotta develop an ordinance.”

The heart of the issue for both counties is the idea of local control. Currently, companies can apply with the state for permits to build and run a BESS. They don’t have to go through the county. But, if counties have ordinances governing BESS facilities, a company can instead choose to go the local route. That could mean more community support.

Here’s the challenge—the state’s climate goals demand a lot more renewable energy storage, fast. Local government is often slow. In Santa Cruz County, they were deciding whether to start a year-long process to develop an ordinance. Even that was delayed. In Monterey County, they were weighing whether to enact a temporary moratorium on new BESS facilities. That didn’t happen either.

Congressional Hearing Examines Effects Of Immigration Enforcement In Southern California

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach, convened a congressional hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Monday to gather testimony about alleged violations by federal immigration agents, whom they accuse of improperly detaining immigrants and citizens alike, often without probable cause or warrants.

The hearing included testimony from elected officials, experts and residents who have been directly impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Andrea Velez is a U.S. citizen who was detained by ICE agents while on her way to work in June. “Terrified, I used my work bag as a shield, but he slammed me into the sidewalk and accused me of interfering,” she said. “When I asked for his badge or a warrant, he refused and handcuffed me. They didn’t believe I was a U.S. citizen or bother to check my ID. I spent most of that first day shackled in a van watching others arrive, distraught and taken against their will.”

David Remnick

Editor, The New Yorker

In early September, the New Yorker staff writer Sarah Stillman received a video call from a group of eleven people who had been forcibly deported from the United States and flown to a secret detention camp in the forests of Ghana. “My stomach is really hurting, and we have to beg for food,” one man told her. “We fear we’ll be tortured and killed,” another said.

In this week’s issue, Stillman, a winner of the Pulitzer Prize and many other awards, reveals how the Trump Administration has been deporting scores of people, including some who had lived here for decades and others who have no criminal records, to countries where they have no known connection––to Uzbekistan, South Sudan, Panama, Ghana, and the small African nation of Eswatini. Many of these people had been granted legal protection in the U.S. from being deported to their home countries, based on credible claims that they would face persecution, torture, or death there. By using this shadowy process, known as third-country removal, the Administration has found a way to sidestep that obligation; what happens to deportees abroad is out of the U.S. government’s hands. “It’s absolutely shocking and illegal,” an immigration attorney and activist says. “And it fits this Administration’s general pattern—draconian, cruel processes that create a spectacle and coerce people into leaving of their own accord.”

Many of the public raids, traffic stops, and aggressive arrests being carried out by federal immigration agents across the U.S. have produced horrifying images and have sparked opposition to the Administration’s policies. But this aspect of the American deportation regime has largely been hidden from the public; and, as Stillman reports, third-country removals are only growing more common. They are often done quickly and with great secrecy, leaving family members in the dark about the whereabouts of their loved ones. Stillman reports on an informal “detective agency of sorts,” made up of lawyers, human-rights advocates, and flight-tracking experts, that has sprung up to provide families with some answers. Still, many deportees enter a kind of black hole after they are sent abroad. Stillman, who has the skills of both an investigative reporter and a humane chronicler of our times, speaks to one man who tells her that before he was deported to Eswatini and confined there without legal rights, he’d lived in Brooklyn. They were, quite nearly, neighbors.

CFPB staff were informed that DOJ will begin assuming matters from the CFPB’s enforcement and legal divisions in the coming weeks, with transfer logistics to be worked out. It remains unclear whether all pending cases will survive the transition or whether case schedules and continuity will be affected.

Why Now?

As discussed here, earlier this month, DOJ notified the D.C. courts that the CFPB anticipates exhausting available funds in early 2026, attaching an Office of Legal Counsel opinion concluding the Bureau cannot lawfully draw its statutory funding from the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) while the Fed is operating at a loss. The opinion interprets “combined earnings” to mean realized profits, not gross revenues, and warns of Appropriations Clause and Antideficiency Act risks if transfers occur without available earnings. The CFPB expects to operate through at least December 31, 2025 under an existing injunction but may face Antideficiency Act constraints thereafter.

What’s Changing?

The contemplated hand‑off to DOJ would cover the small number of CFPB enforcement matters still pending in federal district and appellate courts, as well as several rule‑challenge suits. Ongoing investigations are expected to remain with the CFPB for now.

In its report, Law360 noted that the CFPB has already dropped nearly two dozen enforcement cases this year and has been hampered by staffing actions and attrition following Acting Director Russell Vought’s decision not to replenish the agency’s cash reserves.

The memo also immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who came to the U.S. during the stated time period.
The memo also stated that even those who have already received their green card would be reviewed.
The Trump administration more broadly has ramped up immigration enforcement as part of its promise to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.
The Biden administration admitted 185,640 refugees from October 2021 through September 2024.","The review is likely to sow confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the United States during that period. It is likely to face legal challenges from advocates, some of whom said the move was part of the administration’s “cold-hearted treatment” of people trying to build new lives in the U.S.

The memo, signed by the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, and dated Friday, said that during the Biden years “expediency” and “quantity” were prioritized over “detailed screening and vetting.” The memo said that warranted a comprehensive review and “re-interview of all refugees admitted from January 20, 2021, to February 20, 2025.”

The memo indicated that there will be a list of people to re-interview within three months.

Advocates of the refugee program say that refugees are generally some of the most vetted of all people coming to the United States and that they often wait years to be able to come.

The memo also immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who came to the U.S. during the stated time period.

If the agency determines that a person shouldn’t have qualified for entry as a refugee, the person “has no right to appeal,” according to the memo, although if they are put in removal proceedings and sent to immigration court, they can then plead their case there. The memo also stated that even those who have already received their green card would be reviewed.

“USCIS is ready to uphold the law and ensure the refugee program is not abused,” Edlow wrote.

People admitted to the U.S. as refugees are required to apply for a green card one year after they arrive in the country and usually five years after that can apply for citizenship.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The moves described in the memo are the latest to take aim at the refugee program, which the administration suspended earlier this year and later set a limit for entries to 7,500 mostly white South Africans — a historic low of refugees to be admitted to the U.S. since the program’s inception in 1980. The Trump administration more broadly has ramped up immigration enforcement as part of its promise to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.

The Biden administration admitted 185,640 refugees from October 2021 through September 2024. Refugee admissions topped 100,000 last year, with the largest numbers coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela and Syria.

Refugee advocates slammed news of the review, saying that it will traumatize people who have already gone through extensive vetting to make it to the U.S. in the first place.

“This plan is shockingly ill-conceived,” said Naomi Steinberg, vice president of U.S. policy and advocacy at HIAS, a refugee resettlement agency. “This is a new low in the administration’s consistently cold-hearted treatment of people who are already building new lives and enriching the communities where they have made their homes.”

USCIS expects to have a priority list for re-interviews within 90 days, Edlow wrote. His language points to a rigorous revisiting of why refugee status was granted in the first place.

“Testimony will include, but is not limited to, the circumstances establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear for principal refugees, the persecutor bar, and any other potential inadmissibilities,” he wrote.

Sharif Aly, President of the International Refugee Assistance Project, an advocacy group, criticized the administration’s actions in a statement late Monday, saying that refugees are “already the most highly vetted immigrants in the United States.”

“Besides the enormous cruelty of this undertaking, it would also be a tremendous waste of government resources to review and re-interview 200,000 people who have been living peacefully in our communities for years,” Aly said.

IRAP is currently part of a lawsuit seeking to overturn the administration’s suspension of refugee admissions.

(KOIN) — Nearly 300 students from McMinnville High School walked out of school Monday morning to protest the ICE arrest of a fellow student last week and demanded ICE leave the city.

The 17-year-old was arrested Friday while on his lunch break. Border Patrol agents said they called in ICE after 2 vehicles barricaded their SUV. Officials with the Department of Homeland Security said both drivers — the McMinnville teen and a 20-year-old named Eduardo Soto Elias — were arrested for allegedly impeding federal officers.

Authorities said both were taken to the Portland ICE facility for processing. It is unclear at this time if any federal charges have been brought against them.

“Honestly, after what happened to that kid, the 17 year old, I don’t feel safe going to school,” McMinnville High student Alexis Hernandez Flores told KOIN 6 News. “I don’t feel safe walking the streets of McMinnville no more.”

Another student, Jesus Pacheco, agreed.

“You can say you’re a US citizen, they don’t care. They’ll just take you. So no, I don’t feel safe,” Pacheco said.

Yamhill County Commissioner David “Bubba” King told KOIN 6 News the federal crackdown is already impacting local businesses. And fear tactics, he said, have crossed a line.

“They’ve crossed the line here with having students being afraid to go to school, and that’s across our district,” King said. “The Dayton superintendent put out a plea for community support for their students and that doesn’t look like waving signs or being loud, but really just showing up for our kids and showing them that they matter.”

The McMinnville School District said administrators and police monitored the rally to keep students safe.

In a letter to families, the superintendent wrote: “Students who leave are no longer under school supervision … and would be marked ‘unexcused’ … but welcomed back when they return.”

Last week, the district doubled down on its commitment to follow Oregon’s sanctuary promise laws, which bars staff from sharing student information for immigration purposes without a court order.

Joining Bass in the procession was LA Auxiliary Bishop Matt Elshoff, OFM, Cap.
The procession was organized by non-profit organization One LA-IAF, which is affiliated with the national Industrial Areas Foundation and said it’s been “documenting violations of civil rights” related to the raids.
Isaac Cuevas, director of immigration affairs for the Archdiocese of LA, believes it was important that the Catholic Church had a visible presence at the procession and congressional hearing.
As he was marching alongside Bass and community leaders on Monday, Elshoff said images from the 1960s civil rights movement of religious leaders marching alongside community leaders began to run through his mind.","Catholic clergy marched with demonstrators in downtown LA Monday morning to support hearings into alleged civil rights violations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Southern California.

About 100 demonstrators, including LA Mayor Karen Bass, walked Nov. 24 from Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church (“La Placita”) near downtown LA to the Metropolitan Water District, where Bass and U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach) hosted a hearing with testimony from community leaders, experts, and affected families about the harm caused by the federal immigration sweeps that began in June.

Joining Bass in the procession was LA Auxiliary Bishop Matt Elshoff, OFM, Cap. and Father Arturo Corral, pastor of La Placita.

“Our inherent dignity, whether you're documented or undocumented, ultimately comes from God, and it's channeled through his son, Jesus Christ, whose actions we need to follow,” Bishop Elshoff told the crowd before the start of the procession.

Elshoff also explained that during their fall meeting in Baltimore this month, his fellow US bishops had issued a “Special Message” on immigration. The statement was released with the encouragement of Pope Leo XIV, whom Elshoff reminded marchers had recently said that people in the U.S. illegally should be treated with dignity and that their status can be addressed through the justice system.

The procession was organized by non-profit organization One LA-IAF, which is affiliated with the national Industrial Areas Foundation and said it’s been “documenting violations of civil rights” related to the raids. Representatives from groups like Immigrant Defenders Law Center and The Coalition for Human Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) also marched.

Carrying signs that said “Due process for all” and “End the violence!”, the crowd marched east singing a rendition of the civil rights era protest song “Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Round.”

The rally came as the Trump administration’s efforts to ramp up deportations of undocumented immigrants continue in the LA area and other U.S. cities. Garcia, a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, announced last month with Bass that Congress would investigate the arrests of US citizens by ICE agents and the immigration raids themselves.

Father Brendan Busse, SJ, pastor at Dolores Mission in Boyle Heights since 2022, was one of those who spoke at the hearing. He described the chilling effects of the raids on his parish community, speaking of people hiding in their apartments out of fear, and a woman “paralyzed in grief” after losing her daughter to a failed organ transplant. The woman, Busse said, hesitated to give her daughter a proper burial, afraid of drawing attention to her immigration status.

“The fear and trauma of this enforcement affects us all in ways that are often unseen,” said Busse, who also said he’s spoken to hospital workers who feel unsupported or unsure about how to offer care to patients in ICE custody.

Isaac Cuevas, director of immigration affairs for the Archdiocese of LA, believes it was important that the Catholic Church had a visible presence at the procession and congressional hearing.

“Based on the testimony that we heard today, it's evident that communities in LA are really being affected by the overhanded tactics used by immigration agents,” said Cuevas, who attended the rally.

As he was marching alongside Bass and community leaders on Monday, Elshoff said images from the 1960s civil rights movement of religious leaders marching alongside community leaders began to run through his mind.

“It’s a different era, a different language, a different culture,” said Elshoff. “But we’re dealing with the same issue, that of the inherent dignity of people.”",https://angelusnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/01_Elshoff_OneLA_IAF_march_112425-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:57:37.273672

The Trump administration has already revoked the relief for hundreds of thousands of other immigrants, including Haitians, Venezuelans, Afghans and Nicaraguans.","The news website Axios is reporting President Trump may be ready to hold talks with Venezuela’s leader Nicolás Maduro as the U.S. ramps up military threats. The reports came on the same day the Trump administration designated Maduro as the head of a foreign terrorist organization, fueling fear of a potential U.S. invasion of Venezuela, which holds the world’s largest known reserves of oil. While the Trump administration claims its escalating attacks on boats in the Caribbean are in response to drug trafficking, critics say this is just another attempt by the U.S. government to destabilize Venezuela to force a regime change and exploit resources, including oil. Florida Congressmember María Salazar, Republican assistant whip, made these remarks during an interview Monday with Fox Business.

Rep. Maria Salazar: “Venezuela, for the American oil companies, will be a field day, because it will be more than a trillion dollars in economic activity.”

We’ll have more on Venezuela later in the broadcast.

In Sudan, the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group has announced a unilateral three-month ceasefire in its fight against Sudan’s military rulers. The announcement came after the head of the Sudanese Armed Forces rejected a ceasefire proposal advanced by the so-called Quad — Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the United States. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan cited the UAE’s role in arming the Rapid Support Forces, who he says have carried out genocide and other atrocities in territory it controls. Since fighting between the rival military factions erupted in April 2023, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes.

Israel has continued to violate its ceasefire agreement with Hamas, launching attacks across Gaza that killed at least four Palestinians and wounded several others on Monday. The strikes came as heavy rains flooded the tents of displaced Palestinians, who’ve been forced to shelter outdoors after Israel’s assault left some 90% of Gaza’s buildings damaged or destroyed. On Monday, three Palestinian children were injured in two separate explosions in Gaza City, apparently caused by unexploded Israeli ordnance.

Meanwhile, the U.S.- and Israel-backed so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says it has ended its operations in Gaza. The group’s aid distribution points were widely condemned by human rights groups as “death traps,” with the U.N. reporting more than 850 Palestinians were killed while attempting to access food — even as Israeli authorities barred the U.N. and international aid organizations from bringing food and basic goods into Gaza.

Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen is calling on the Trump administration to secure the release of a 16-year-old Palestinian American citizen from Florida who was arrested by Israeli soldiers during an early-morning raid on his family’s West Bank home in February. Mohammed Ibrahim has reportedly suffered beatings in Israeli detention and has lost a considerable amount of weight. This is Senator Van Hollen.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen: “This is an American kid, so you would think that the United States government would be doing everything possible to secure his release. But they’re not. After all, we have a very close relationship with Israel. United States taxpayers provide billions of dollars to the Netanyahu government and the state of Israel.”

The White House has acknowledged that U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee met secretly with the convicted spy Jonathan Pollard at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in July. Pollard is a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer sentenced to life in prison for stealing classified U.S. material and sharing it with Israel. Pollard served 30 years in a federal prison before he was granted parole under President Obama in 2015. He moved to Israel in 2020.

In Ukraine, at least six people were killed in the capital Kyiv overnight as Russia launched a wave of missile and drone attacks, targeting buildings and energy infrastructure. Separately, six people, including two children, were wounded in Russian attacks on the port city of Odesa. Ukraine countered with drone attacks that killed three people and injured eight others in Russia’s southern Rostov region.

The violence came hours after talks on a U.S.-backed peace plan wrapped up in Geneva and as U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll reportedly headed to Abu Dhabi for talks with a Russian delegation and Ukraine’s intelligence chief. On Monday, Moscow rejected a Ukrainian and European Union-backed 19-point counterproposal to the 28-point peace plan supported by President Trump.

The Trump administration has suspended all green card applications submitted by refugees who were admitted into the U.S. under President Biden. Trump officials are also reportedly planning to track down and reinterview refugees who came to the U.S. between January 2021 and February 2025. That’s according to the Associated Press, which obtained a memo signed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow saying the Biden administration prioritized “expediency” and “quantity” in admitting refugees, and not “detailed screening and vetting.” But advocates have refuted those claims, as refugees often wait years before they’re even permitted to enter the U.S. after strict vetting during the application process. An estimated 200,000 refugees were admitted into the U.S. by Biden.

A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from expanding its rapid deportations of some immigrants, citing due process violations. For some three decades, the U.S. government has fast-tracked the removal of immigrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border. When Trump returned to office, expedited removals were then expanded to include immigrants arrested anywhere in the United States and who the Trump administration claimed could not prove they had lived in the U.S. for at least two years.

In related news, the Trump administration is moving to revoke temporary protected status for immigrants from Burma and Somalia. This will impact hundreds of Somali immigrants living in Minnesota and nearly 4,000 immigrants from Burma, who will now face deportation. TPS is a relief granted for immigrants fleeing war and other disasters that have made their home countries unsafe. The Trump administration has already revoked the relief for hundreds of thousands of other immigrants, including Haitians, Venezuelans, Afghans and Nicaraguans.

The Trump administration lied to a federal judge, claiming Costa Rica was unwilling to accept Kilmar Abrego Garcia if the United States attempted to deport him to the Central American country. The Washington Post reports a Costa Rican official rebutted the Trump administration’s claims in court that the only viable destination to deport the Maryland father, who is originally from El Salvador, is the West African nation of Liberia. The Trump administration has previously attempted to deport Abrego Garcia to other nations where the U.S. now has so-called third country agreements, including Uganda and Eswatini, countries Abrego Garcia has no ties to. Abrego Garcia is awaiting trial for human smuggling charges, which he and his legal team say were fabricated by the Trump administration after they illegally sent him to CECOT, the maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

Georgia Congressmember Marjorie Taylor Greene is predicting other Republican lawmakers could soon resign from Congress, after she stunned Washington, D.C., on Friday by announcing she’ll step away from the House of Representatives in January. Her surprise resignation will leave Republicans with a slim majority; they currently hold 219 seats compared to Democrats’ 213. Marjorie Taylor Greene spent years as a leader of the MAGA movement but had an acrimonious split with President Trump after she condemned Israel’s assault on Gaza as a “genocide,” called on Congress to address the spiraling cost of healthcare, and cast a deciding vote on a discharge petition calling for the release of the Epstein files. That led Trump to withdraw his endorsement while accusing her of being a “traitor.” This is an excerpt of Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation speech.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene: “I refuse to be a battered wife, hoping it all goes away and gets better. If I am cast aside by the president and the MAGA political machine and replaced by neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, military-industrial-war complex, foreign leaders and the elite donor class, that can never, ever relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced, as well.”

On Sunday, Marjorie Taylor Greene denied a report from Time magazine that she “privately told allies” she was considering a presidential bid, rejecting the report as a “complete lie.”

The Pentagon has launched an investigation into Arizona Senator Mark Kelly after he joined five other Democrats in a video reminding U.S. service members that they have a duty to disobey unlawful orders. On Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media post that Kelly, who’s a retired U.S. Navy captain, falls under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and could be recalled to active duty to face a court-martial. This comes after President Trump accused the six Democratic lawmakers, who are military or CIA veterans, of ”SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” and shared a social media post calling for them to be hanged.

A federal judge has thrown out criminal indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, after determining the interim U.S. attorney hand-picked by President Trump to bring the cases was not lawfully appointed. Lindsey Halligan, a former insurance attorney with no prosecutorial experience, was named interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in September after Trump’s previous hand-picked U.S. attorney resigned under pressure from the White House for refusing to bring criminal charges against Trump’s critics. The cases were dismissed “without prejudice,” meaning the Trump administration could try to bring another indictment against Letitia James; meanwhile, the statute of limitations in Comey’s case expired in September.

The Environmental Protection Agency has approved the use of two new pesticides that contain fluorinated substances commonly referred to as “forever chemicals” because they take centuries to break down in the environment. The EPA also announced it is relaxing a rule mandating that companies report products containing the chemicals, and proposed further weakening limits in drinking water. For decades, forever chemicals have been used to produce countless industrial and consumer goods, even though they have been linked to cancer and birth defects for over half a century.

The oldest survivor of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre has died at the age of 111. Viola Ford Fletcher was 7 years old when she survived a wave of attacks by racist white mobs who set fire to homes, businesses and churches in Greenwood, a thriving African American business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, known as “Black Wall Street.” Fletcher devoted her life to raising awareness about the Tulsa race massacre. In 2021, she testified to Congress ahead of the 100th anniversary of the massacre.

Viola Ford Fletcher: “I will never forget the violence of the white mob when we left our home. I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burned. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams. I have lived through the massacre every day. A country may forget this history, but I cannot. I will not. And other survivors do not, and our descendants do not.”

Viola Ford Fletcher’s 2023 memoir is titled “Don’t Let Them Bury My Story.” Last year, the Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit brought by Fletcher and other remaining survivors who sought reparations from Tulsa.",https://assets.democracynow.org/assets/default_content_image-354f4555cc64afadc730d64243c658dd0af1f330152adcda6c4900cb4a26f082.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:59:36.154551

In 2019, the conservatives upheld partisan gerrymandering by a 5-4 vote, ruling that drawing election districts is a “political question” left to states and their lawmakers, not judges.
They also looked poised to restrict the reach of the Voting Rights Act in a pending case from Louisiana.
On Monday, Dunn, the Texas voting rights attorney, responded to the state’s appeal and told the justices they should deny it.
No one will be confused by using the map that has governed Texas’ congressional elections for the past four years,” he said.","The Texas redistricting case now before the Supreme Court turns on a question that often divides judges: Were the voting districts drawn based on politics, or race?

The answer, likely to come in a few days, could shift five congressional seats and tip political control of the House of Representatives after next year’s midterm elections.

Justice Samuel A. Alito, who oversees appeals from Texas, put a temporary hold on a judicial ruling that branded the newly drawn Texas voting map a “racial gerrymander.”

The state’s lawyers asked for a decision by Monday, noting that candidates have a Dec. 8 deadline to file for election.

They said the judges violated the so-called Purcell principle by making major changes in the election map “midway through the candidate filing period,” and that alone calls for blocking it.

Texas Republicans have reason to be confident the court’s conservative majority will side with them.

“We start with a presumption that the legislature acted in good faith,” Alito wrote for a 6-3 majority last year in a South Carolina case.

That state’s Republican lawmakers had moved tens of thousands of Black voters in or out of newly drawn congressional districts and said they did so not because of their race but because they were likely to vote as Democrats.

In 2019, the conservatives upheld partisan gerrymandering by a 5-4 vote, ruling that drawing election districts is a “political question” left to states and their lawmakers, not judges.

All the justices — conservative and liberal — say drawing districts based on the race of the voters violates the Constitution and its ban on racial discrimination. But the conservatives say it’s hard to separate race from politics.

They also looked poised to restrict the reach of the Voting Rights Act in a pending case from Louisiana.

For decades, the civil rights law has sometimes required states to draw one or more districts that would give Black or Latino voters a fair chance to “elect representatives of their choice.”

The Trump administration joined in support of Louisiana’s Republicans in October and claimed the voting rights law has been “deployed as a form of electoral race-based affirmative action” that should be ended.

If so, election law experts warned that Republican-led states across the South could erase the districts of more than a dozen Black Democrats who serve in Congress.

The Texas mid-decade redistricting case did not look to trigger a major legal clash because the partisan motives were so obvious.

In July, President Trump called for Texas Republicans to redraw the state map of 38 congressional districts in order to flip five seats to oust Democrats and replace them with Republicans.

At stake was control of the closely divided House after the 2026 midterm elections.

Gov. Greg Abbott agreed, and by the end of August, he signed into law a map with redrawn districts in and around Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio.

But last week federal judges, in a 2-1 decision, blocked the new map from taking effect, ruling that it appeared to be unconstitutional.

“The public perception of this case is that it’s about politics,” wrote U.S. District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown in the opening of a 160-page opinion. “To be sure, politics played a role” but “substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.”

He said the strongest evidence came from Harmeet Dhillon, the Trump administration’s top civil rights lawyer at the Justice Department. She had sent Abbott a letter on July 7 threatening legal action if the state did not dismantle four “coalition districts.”

This term, which was unfamiliar to many, referred to districts where no racial or ethnic group had a majority. In one Houston district that was targeted, 45% of the eligible voters were Black and 25% were Latino. In a nearby district, 38% of voters were Black and 30% were Latino.

She said the Trump administration views these as “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders,” citing a recent ruling by the conservative 5th Circuit Court.

The Texas governor then cited these “constitutional concerns raised by the U.S. Department of Justice” when he called for the special session of the Legislature to redraw the state map.

Voting rights advocates saw a violation.

“They said their aim was to get rid of the coalition districts. And to do so, they had to draw new districts along racial lines,” said Chad Dunn, a Texas attorney and legal director of UCLA’s Voting Rights Project.

Brown, a Trump appointee from Galveston, wrote that Dhillon was “clearly wrong” in believing these coalition districts were unconstitutional, and he said the state was wrong to rely on her advice as basis for redrawing its election map.

He was joined by a second district judge in putting the new map on hold and requiring the state to use the 2021 map that had been drawn by the same Texas Republicans.

The third judge on the panel was Jerry Smith, a Reagan appointee on the 5th Circuit Court, and he issued an angry 104-page dissent. Much of it was devoted to attacking Brown and liberals such as 95-year-old investor and philanthropist George Soros and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“In 37 years as a federal judge, I’ve served on hundreds of three-judge panels. This is the most blatant exercise of judicial activism that I have ever witnessed,” Smith wrote. “The main winners from Judge Brown’s opinion are George Soros and Gavin Newsom. The obvious losers are the People of Texas.”

The “obvious reason for the 2025 redistricting, of course, is partisan gain,” Smith wrote, adding that “Judge Brown commits grave error in concluding that the Texas Legislature is more bigoted than political.”

Most federal cases go before a district judge, and they may be appealed first to a U.S. appeals court and then the Supreme Court.

Election-related cases are different. A three-judge panel weighs the facts and issues a ruling, which then goes directly to the Supreme Court to be affirmed or reversed.

Late Friday, Texas attorneys filed an emergency appeal and asked the justices to put on hold the decision by Brown.

The first paragraph of their 40-page appeal noted that Texas is not alone in pursuing a political advantage by redrawing its election maps.

“California is working to add more Democratic seats to its congressional delegation to offset the new Texas districts, despite Democrats already controlling 43 out of 52 of California’s congressional seats,” they said.

They argued that the “last-minute disruption to state election procedures — and resulting candidate and voter confusion —demonstrates” the need to block the lower court ruling.

Election law experts question that claim. “This is a problem of Texas’ own making,” said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

The state opted for a fast-track, mid-decade redistricting at the behest of Trump.

On Monday, Dunn, the Texas voting rights attorney, responded to the state’s appeal and told the justices they should deny it.

“The election is over a year away. No one will be confused by using the map that has governed Texas’ congressional elections for the past four years,” he said.

“The governor of Texas called a special session to dismantle districts on account of their racial composition,” he said, and the judges heard clear and detailed evidence that lawmakers did just that.

In recent election disputes, however, the court’s conservatives have frequently invoked the Purcell principle to free states from new judicial rulings that came too close to the election.

Granting a stay would allow Texas to use its new GOP friendly map for the 2026 election.

The justices may then choose to hear arguments on the legal questions early next year.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ca2f3fa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1620x851+0+202/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1b%2F5c%2F6040dc684460ba635199d367621f%2Ftexas-lifts-mask-mandate-la-thmb.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:57:48.593000

An agency webpage tracks all the lawsuits Oregon is a part of tied to immigration, human rights, LGBTQ+ issues, federal employment and other Trump administration policies.","In early October, a multi-state lawsuit kept $15 million in the hands of Oregon nonprofits that help survivors of sexual assault and abuse.

Oregon joined 21 other Democratic-led states in August to sue the federal government for threatening to withhold $1.4 billion in federal Victims of Crime Act funding unless the states agreed to help with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit never went to trial because the Trump administration abandoned its plan after the suit was filed, allowing states to retain federal grants without any new immigration enforcement rules.

It’s one of 46 lawsuits the state has filed against the Trump administration, often teaming up with other Democratic states to prevent federal funding cuts. The state of Oregon doesn’t have to pay anything out of pocket by signing onto another state’s lawsuit, according to Oregon Department of Justice spokesperson Jenny Hansson.

The Oregon Department of Justice has spent at least $19,000 in legal fees and travel expenses this year to send employees to attend court hearings in Washington D.C. and New York, according to public records obtained by the Capital Chronicle. Meanwhile, by filing the lawsuits the state has kept about $4.5 billion meant for Oregon Health and Science University research, electric vehicle infrastructure, sexual health education programs and education programs supporting low-income and unhoused students.

The lawsuits are to ensure Oregonians aren’t left paying the price when the federal government oversteps or breaks the law, Hansson said.

“The Oregon Department of Justice is committed to protecting Oregonians — not wasting their money,” Hansson told the Capital Chronicle. “The resources we’ve invested in defending Oregon’s rights in court are a fraction of what’s at stake.”

Oregon’s federal litigation team isn’t funded with direct taxpayer dollars

Some states set aside millions for potential lawsuits against the Trump administration. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom in late 2024 convened a special session to set aside $25 million to pay for anticipated legal costs against the Trump administration. In Maryland, Attorney General Anthony Brown received $1 million from the governor to fund a federal litigation team, Maryland Matters reported.

The state of Oregon did something similar, allocating $8.2 million in its 2025-27 Department of Justice’s budget to fund 20 full-time positions to support civil litigation and for the “defense of state interests.”

What’s unique about Oregon is that the money going toward defending state interests isn’t coming from the state general fund — or money collected from personal or corporate income taxes — but rather it’s coming from proceeds from civil litigation when the state is awarded damages, according to legislative fiscal analyst Steve Robbins.

With this designated funding, the department created a federal litigation team to respond to national legal issues. An agency webpage tracks all the lawsuits Oregon is a part of tied to immigration, human rights, LGBTQ+ issues, federal employment and other Trump administration policies.

In total, Oregon’s Department of Justice’s budget increased by 4% from the previous two-year cycle, raising its budget to $1 billion.

Some of that new funding also includes $17 million to support child advocacy centers and support services for domestic and sexual violence victims, $13 million to replace some of its legal software, $8.8 million to upgrade its child support software system and $10.8 million to add 33 full-time attorneys in its trial division to reduce the state’s need to contract with more expensive, private firms.

“We haven’t taken our eyes off the day-to-day work that matters to Oregonians,” Hansson said. “We continue to deliver on core services and priorities — protecting working families, seniors and consumers and keeping communities safe and defending Oregon’s values.”",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6293-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 09:57:30.017340

Putting barriers around schools.

The police chief said officers will respond to reported ICE activity, possibly with lights and sirens, if necessary.

It mandates training for city employees to handle ICE interactions and somehow make signs distinguishing between public and private spaces to ensure ICE cannot enter private areas without a judicial warrant.

“I think it's important to focus on, you know, not giving people a false sense of security,” Councilor Cristian Salgado pointed out as he referred to possible solutions.

All this is in response to an increase in reported ICE activity in Washington County, including the high-profile detainment of a Hillsboro man named Victor Cruz due to an apparent mistaken identity.

After nearly a month in ICE custody, Cruz was released from detainment following a judge's order.

Senate Republicans ultimately confirmed Mr. Bove to the bench.","A former Justice Department lawyer who spoke out publicly about the Trump administration’s aggressive maneuvers to deport migrants has joined one of the legal advocacy firms challenging the administration’s approaches to immigration, benefits for the poor and civil rights.

In an interview with The New York Times, Erez Reuveni said he decided to work for the group Democracy Forward because “this is really a make-or-break moment for the rule of law, for democracy, for the rights of all people who live in this country.”

Mr. Reuveni, who worked for almost 15 years as a government lawyer, during which he often defended the Trump administration’s immigration policies, was fired earlier this year in a standoff with his own bosses about what he said were efforts to mislead or ignore federal judges.

Administration officials have said he refused to follow orders and have denied Mr. Reuveni’s claims, which were buttressed in part by a series of emails and text messages shared among government lawyers surrounding the rushed removals in March of more than 200 migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

Mr. Reuveni filed a whistle-blower complaint to Congress and government agencies, saying a senior official, Emil Bove III, suggested the department should be prepared to ignore court orders to ensure the planes of migrants were shipped away.

In testimony before Congress, Mr. Bove denied the thrust of Mr. Reuveni’s allegations, though when pressed on particulars, he said he could not recall specific language that was used.

Mr. Reuveni has also said he was told by his superiors to sign an appeal brief arguing that a migrant who had been mistakenly deported to El Salvador was a terrorist, despite a lack of evidence for such an accusation.

Mr. Reuveni has said he refused, telling a supervisor, “I didn’t sign up to lie.” He was placed on administrative leave and eventually fired.

Last week, a federal judge signaled his intent to call Mr. Reuveni as a witness in a contempt proceeding against the administration.

Mr. Reuveni said he decided to work for Democracy Forward because “all people have a right to safety, liberty, due process, and to me personally, it’s very important to fight the fight that articulates that point of view.”

The group’s president and C.E.O., Skye Perryman, said she hired Mr. Reuveni because he has “seen the anti-immigrant autocratic playbook up close,” and will be part of a team of lawyers, including others who once worked in the government, who are “very well positioned to figure out the best ways to confront it.”

Ms. Perryman praised Mr. Reuveni as a person of integrity who “ultimately lost his job as a result of his commitment to the ethics requirements of the legal profession.”

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, has called Mr. Reuveni “a disgruntled former employee.”

His whistle-blower complaint was sent to Congress shortly before a confirmation hearing for Mr. Bove to become a federal appeals court judge. While Democrats reacted to his account with alarm and indignation, Republicans accused him of participating in a smear campaign aimed at derailing that nomination.

President Trump’s 28-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine now has 19 points following negotiations in Geneva, according to a Ukrainian official. A source told ABC News that the updated peace agreement no longer includes a strict limit on the size of the Ukrainian army, nor does it include a provision granting amnesty for acts committed during the war. “As of now, after Geneva, there are fewer points, no longer 28, and a lot of the right things have been taken into account in this framework,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said yesterday. It remains unclear exactly what points were removed. David Brennan reports.

U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is set to meet with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi today to discuss the latest version of the peace framework negotiated in recent days between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, according to a senior U.S. official. Paul McLeary reports for POLITICO.

The Kremlin said yesterday that a European counter-proposal to the U.S. peace plan was not constructive and simply would not work for Russia. The European plan significantly altered the meaning and significance of key points on NATO and ceding territory, as outlined in Trump’s 28-point plan. Vladimir Soldatkin reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv this morning killed at least six people and injured 13, according to Zelenskyy. In a video address released yesterday, Zelenskyy had urged Ukrainians to “be cognizant that Russia will not ease its pressure on us, on Ukraine, on our people.” People were still being evacuated from buildings at the time of writing. Cassandra Vinograd and Maria Varenikova report for the New York Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israeli forces yesterday killed three Palestinians in Gaza near the yellow line, which demarcates areas of Gaza still under Israeli control, according to Palestinian medics. The Israeli military said it fired after identifying “terrorists” crossing the yellow line and approaching its troops. Nidal Al-Mughrabi and Alexander Cornwell report for Reuters.

The U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation will officially close its operations in Gaza after suspending its work last month, according to GHF’s director and two Israeli sources. “We are winding down our operations as we have succeeded in our mission of showing there’s a better way to deliver aid to Gazans,” GHF Executive Director John Acree said in a statement. Tal Shalev and Eve Brennan report for CNN.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

“In response to international efforts, chiefly that of…. President Donald Trump…I announce a humanitarian ceasefire including a cessation of hostilities for three months,” Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, said yesterday. Dagalo’s statement appeared to announce a unilateral ceasefire a day after the commander-in-chief of the Sudanese Armed Forces rejected a ceasefire proposal by the U.S.-led mediators. Nafisa Eltahir and Khalid Abdelaziz report for Reuters.

Amnesty International said in a report published today that the atrocities committed by the RSF in El Fasher constitute war crimes and may also constitute other crimes under international law. Samy Magdy reports for AP News.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

Trump told his advisers that he is planning to speak directly with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, administration officials told Axios. The sources said Trump’s decision could be a sign that U.S. strikes or direct military intervention in Venezuela are not imminent. “Nobody is planning to go in and shoot [Maduro] or snatch him – at this point. I wouldn’t say never, but that’s not the plan right now,” according to one official. Marc Caputo reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Afghanistan’s Taliban government today accused Pakistan of launching overnight strikes, killing 9 children and one adult woman. Chief spokesperson for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, described the attacks as “atrocities”, adding that “at the appropriate time, [Afghanistan] will give the necessary response.” Pakistan’s military and government did not immediately comment on the allegation. Abdul Qahar Afghan and Munir Ahmed report for AP News.

The U.N. World Food Programme announced today that nearly 35 million people in Nigeria could go hungry in 2026, adding that a surge in militant attacks and instability in northern Nigeria is driving hunger to record levels. The WFP also warned that it will run out of funds for emergency food and nutrition aid by December as a result of funding cuts. Elisah Bala-Gbogbo reports for Reuters.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Trump yesterday signed an executive order launching “the Genesis Mission,” a new federal effort to “unleash a new age of AI-accelerated innovation and discovery.” The Genesis Mission will “dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, strengthen national security, secure energy dominance, enhance workforce productivity, and multiply the return on taxpayer investment into research and development.” The order describes the Genesis Mission as “comparable in urgency and ambition to the Manhattan Project.” Jared Perlo reports for NBC News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Following a call yesterday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said on social media that he accepted an invitation to visit Xi in Beijing in April. Chinese state media said that Xi had called Trump to maintain the positive momentum in their relationship since they met in South Korea last month. They are said to have discussed Ukraine, Taiwan, fentanyl and soybeans. Ana Swanson and Alan Rappeport report for the New York Times.

Trump yesterday signed an executive order that begins the process of designating certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as “Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists,” particularly those in Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt. Alec Dent reports for the Washington Post.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Homeland Security Department announced yesterday that it is terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation for Myanmar, finding that it is no longer needed because it is safe for citizens to return. The status will expire for the roughly 4,000 Myanmar nationals under this protection on Jan. 26. Simon Lewis reports for Reuters.

The Trump administration has ordered a broad review of all 233,000 refugees who entered the United States under the Biden administration, according to an internal government memo signed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joe Edlow and seen by Reuters. The memo says that USCIS will terminate the refugee status of people already in the United States if they are found not to meet refugee criteria, claiming that the Biden administration potentially prioritized expediency and quantity over quality interviews and detailed screening. It also orders a halt to all processing of applications for permanent residence for refugees who entered under Biden. Ted Hesson and Kristina Cooke report.

The Justice Department has changed its position and will no longer try to stop Democratic-led states from using federal grant money to provide legal help to undocumented immigrant victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. 19 states and the District of Columbia yesterday agreed to drop a lawsuit filed last month over the new grant conditions. Nate Raymond reports for Reuters.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A federal judge yesterday dismissed separate criminal charges against the former FBI director James B. Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that Lindsey Halligan had been unlawfully appointed as Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and therefore had no lawful authority to present the indictments. The cases were dismissed without prejudice, meaning the Trump administration could potentially re-file the charges under a properly appointed prosecutor. Attorney General Pam Bondi said yesterday that she will “take all available legal action, including an immediate appeal,” adding “Lindsey Halligan is an excellent U.S. attorney and shame on them for not wanting her in office.” Alan Feuer and Devlin Barrett report for the New York Times; Rebecca Falconer reports for Axios.

Attorney General Pam Bondi yesterday asked the Manhattan federal court to release sealed materials related to the grand jury investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The Justice Department made this same request over the summer, but it was refused on grand jury secrecy grounds. In the new request, Bondi said the DOJ interprets the new Epstein Files Transparency Act “as requiring [the court] to publish the grand jury and discovery materials.” Benjamin Weiser reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Pentagon announced yesterday that it is investigating Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), a former Navy pilot, over possible breaches of military law after Kelly appeared in a video calling for troops to defy illegal orders. The Pentagon’s statement said Kelly may be recalled to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures, citing a federal law that allows for the recall of retired service members. Konstantin Toropin and Ben Finley report for AP News.

A sweeping new investigation by the Associated Press is raising serious questions about what's happening inside America's immigration courts.

White House correspondent Liz Landers has more on how the administration has circumvented the asylum process.

Liz Landers:

Every day, all across the country, asylum cases are being tossed out, and asylum seekers exit the courtroom into the waiting arms and cuffs of immigration officers, that according to a new report from the Associated Press headlined ""Migrants thought they were in a court for a routine hearing. Instead, it was a deportation trap.""

One of its authors, Josh Goodman, joins us now.

Josh, thank you for joining the ""News Hour.""

Josh Goodman, Associated Press:

Thank you.

Liz Landers:

In reporting this story, you and your colleagues went to 21 immigration courts. Can you describe the scene as you watch migrants walk into court and then walk out into a legal snare?

Josh Goodman:

Yes, we witnessed multiple arrests over several months. This was a routine practice by which government attorneys would go before a judge, dismiss a case, which would typically be a good outcome for someone trying to stay in the United States.

And as soon as they would leave the courtroom, they would be arrested by ICE agents or federal agents, frequently with masks. Nationwide, it's estimated that there were over 2,000 arrests in this manner. Some of the courts were quite chaotic, arresting people in hallways. People were being trapped in elevators. Journalists were being rough-handled, scenes of fathers being torn from their children, women begging federal agents to let their husbands go.

These are people who wanted to follow the rules. They didn't have a criminal record. They were making an asylum claim and going through all the stages that are required and were completely blindsided by what happened to them.

Liz Landers:

What has changed in these immigration courts under this new Trump administration?

Josh Goodman:

So these immigration courts were kind of structurally flawed from the very beginning. They are not part of the independent judiciary in the way that tax court or federal court or any multiple courts around the United States are.

They are part of the executive branch. They actually are part of the Justice Department. They had a degree of professionalism over time that was built up. And these judges were allowed to really rule like any other court. But they were always very vulnerable to some sort of takeover.

What we have seen now under the second Trump administration, they are effectively exploiting those vulnerabilities, issuing new orders about what judges can and cannot rule on. And they're really narrowing the scope that these judges have to decide the cases.

Liz Landers:

How do the attorneys and judges within the immigration court system feel about the role that they're playing under this new Trump administration tactic?

Josh Goodman:

What I found is that overall these are people who are very patriotic. They signed up to work in the immigration system because they wanted to protect America's borders, root out the true people who need asylum from some of the people who are claiming it for nonlegal reasons or economic refugees, for example.

And they did not sign up for this at all. One of the judges I talked to said, this is really like deciding death penalty cases in a traffic court environment, because they have so few tools to actually mete out justice that — and they have such a huge docket — that they are rushing through these cases without giving them the due consideration that they need.

And I noticed in some of the text messages between the federal agents and the attorneys a great deal of empathy and people kind of saying to themselves, this is cruel and we don't really want to be a part of this.

Liz Landers:

I was struck by that in your reporting, that these attorneys who are arguing in front of these judges are in direct contact, it seems, with the ICE agents who are waiting outside.

Josh Goodman:

This process starts about two weeks in advance. Every attorney is assigned a number of people, like maybe 40 cases that day. They have to come up with a list for the client — the client here is ICE — of people who they would — quote, unquote — call ""amenable"" to detention.

And then, on the day of the hearings, the attorney and the ICE officer in the hallway are coordinating almost in real time so that they can identify what the individual looks like, what kind of shirt, black shirt, a white shirt, whatever they're wearing, as well as if indeed the judge dismissed the case, because that was the hook.

If the judge didn't dismiss the case, they couldn't arrest these individuals. If they're trying to reach a quota every day, it's a lot easier to pick up people at court.

Liz Landers:

One of the stated reasons that the Trump administration has adopted this new policy is to work through the asylum system's yearslong backlog. Is it affecting the backlog and is it affecting other systems?

Josh Goodman:

That's a great question. The backlog is a huge challenge. It has been for many, many years. It keeps growing. The numbers themselves are not 100 percent clear.

The government has said that they have managed to reduce the backlog from about 4.2 million to 3.8 million cases, which is still mind-boggling for only 600 judges nationwide. But they're also benefiting from the fact that the border itself is sealed. In other words, there's not a lot of new people coming in and clogging up the system.

But every time that there are arrests in the streets, any time there are major roundups, those people also get sort of thrown back into the system, and they can actually increase the numbers. So, it's not entirely clear, but I think, at a very minimum, what we can say is that the backlog is not growing as fast as it once was.

Liz Landers:

So you find in this reporting that a number of these judges, these immigration court judges have been laid off. You guys profile in your story a judge in Ohio who had been fired.

Why are immigration judges getting fired right now if there is such a backlog to process these cases?

Josh Goodman:

Yes, I mean, this is a great conundrum. There's about 90 judges that have been fired since February. And the government, Trump administration, very clearly says that they are not targeting anyone from a viewpoint perspective.

But the data speaks for itself. These judges were more favorable to migrants than the national average.

Liz Landers:

Josh Goodman, thank you so much for joining us.

Tracking Down Children From Venezuela More than 17,000 Venezuelans, largely men, have been deported to Venezuela this year, according to Venezuelan officials.","The 11-year-old from Venezuela was alone in his Texas home, waiting for his mother, who had been detained by U.S. immigration officials. She would never come back.

The boy, Emmanuel Leandro Caicedo Venecia, ended up living by himself for three months this summer, attending school, even walking to his fifth-grade graduation to collect his diploma, his mother said. A neighbor brought food, but Emmanuel mostly fended for himself.

His mother had decided it had to be this way. Afraid that her son would be placed in foster care, she had made a choice while in detention: She lied to immigration officials, she said, telling them that Emmanuel was being taken care of by an adult. She was deported to Venezuela without him in late July, with Emmanuel eventually moving in with an acquaintance.

“I just keep hoping he’s reunited with me,” his mother, Deisy Carolina Venecia Farías, said earlier this year.

Venezuelan officials claim that 150 Venezuelan children, from newborns to teenagers, have wound up separated from their parents as President Trump’s deportation campaign has accelerated. Most of the children were born in Venezuela, and some in Colombia, but some of the youngest, including months-old babies, were born in the United States, complicating efforts to repatriate them.

While there is no tally kept by U.S. officials or advocacy groups, Venezuelan officials shared a list of children they said had been separated, and The New York Times interviewed the parents and relatives of more than a dozen children, corroborating their accounts with court documents, police records and immigration case files.

The Venezuelan government’s roster includes children whose parents were deported to Venezuela as well as children whose parents remain locked up in the United States.

In interviews, many of the parents said they had chosen to be deported without their children, a painful decision that they made to avoid months in detention. They hoped, they said, that returning to their homeland would expedite a reunion with their children.

Others asserted that they were pressured or misled by U.S. immigration officials into boarding deportation flights without their children, some of whom have ended up in foster care.

The Trump administration has said that it does not separate families, a divisive practice that roiled the president’s first term. During the summer, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency issued updated guidelines that require its officers to give immigrants who are in the United States illegally the choice to be deported with their children.

“ICE does not separate families,” the spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, said. “Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates.”

While some families have been deported together, many mothers and fathers have been landing in Venezuela without their children, setting off a diplomatic scramble inside the Venezuelan government to track down and repatriate the children.

Other Latin American countries — including Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico — appear to be grappling with similar separations, sometimes involving U.S.-born children, according to media reports. But no country has been as vocal about the separations as Venezuela has.

The government of the country’s autocrat, Nicolás Maduro, has turned the separations into a national rallying cry against the United States amid rising tensions between both countries and a large American military buildup in the Caribbean.

Mr. Maduro’s own policies, including repression, economic mismanagement and human rights abuses, played the largest role in the migration crisis that pushed more than seven million people to leave Venezuela, according to a broad swath of political analysts and human rights groups. Now, he is attempting to cast himself as a champion for Venezuelans he claims have been mistreated by Mr. Trump.

Families clamoring for the return of their children have put almost all their hopes in Mr. Maduro. They have readily participated in government-led rallies in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, and recorded heartfelt videos shared on social media. In August, many families signed a letter to Melania Trump, the first lady, asking her “to listen to the cries of families.”

“My girls call me asking when I’m going to pick them up,” Anabel Bustamante, 26, who has been separated from her 3- and 7-year-old daughters for nine months, said in an interview.

“They asked recently if they could sneak into a box and be shipped to Venezuela,” said Ms. Bustamante, whose daughters, Diangerlin and Aranza, are living with their grandmother in Arkansas.

Ms. Bustamante hasn’t seen the girls since February, when police officers showed up at her house on a sleepy street in Arkansas, where the family lived after migrating to the United States two years ago. They charged her with nonfinancial identity fraud, according to police records, which she surmised was related to her work as a delivery driver without papers.

Ms. Bustamante was jailed and transferred to a detention center in Louisiana, where she said federal officials asked her to sign a document if she wanted to be deported with her daughters. She declined to sign it, she said, out of fear that ICE officers would detain her sister and mother if they went to retrieve her daughters.

In July, she was deported, leaving her daughters behind.

An Agonizing Choice

Many parents, most of whom entered the United States during the Biden administration, told The Times that they were offered the choice to be deported with their children.

Some of them regarded that as an agonizing pressure tactic: If they wanted to be deported with their children, some said ICE told them that they would have to spend as long as a year in detention while U.S. officials retrieved their children and made travel arrangements.

Jaimary José Cárdenas Paz said that she was urged by ICE and a social worker to deport without her 9-year-old, José Daniel Urdaneta Cárdenas, after ICE agents detained her with her partner outside an immigration courthouse in Boston on May 7.

On May 19, while Ms. Cárdenas, who had entered the United States in 2024, was in detention, an ICE officer interviewed her. She told the officer, “What I want is to get out of here and go back to my country with my son,” according to a transcript.

But she said that officials later told her that José Daniel, who was staying with his aunt in Massachusetts, “could have a better future in the United States,” and perhaps even be granted U.S. citizenship in the future.

She said officials told her that she would remain in ICE custody for six to nine months if she wanted to be deported with her son. She chose to leave without José Daniel, on July 11.

Ms. McLaughlin, the D.H.S. spokeswoman, said Ms. Cárdenas “chose to be removed by herself and asked her son be placed in the care of his aunt.” Her son was deported to Venezuela two months later, in September.

A few said that they were never offered a choice or were given misleading guidance, with one mother saying that she boarded a plane with the impression that her son would be on the flight, but wasn’t.

María Alejandra Rubio González said that she repeatedly asked immigration officials to be deported to Venezuela with her 8-year-old son, Anyerson, who stayed with a friend in the Atlanta suburbs after she was arrested on March 15. She was charged with driving under the influence and without a license by local officials, police records show.

“They told me, ‘OK, we’re aware. Don’t worry, you’ll be deported with your son,’” she recalled. When officers tried to place her on a deportation flight, she said she refused to board because she didn’t see her son on the plane.

“I cried and I cried, and I didn’t get on,” she said. “They tricked me.”

Ms. Rubio González was ultimately deported without Anyerson on July 23, along with more than 200 other Venezuelans, including four mothers who also left without their children, she said.

Ms. McLaughlin said Ms. Rubio González “chose not to file an appeal” after she was ordered deported by a judge and “relinquished custody of her son to a friend.” The mother was reunited with her son more than six months later, after the friend handed over Anyerson to ICE and the Venezuelan government facilitated his return on Sept. 17.

Tracking Down Children From Venezuela

More than 17,000 Venezuelans, largely men, have been deported to Venezuela this year, according to Venezuelan officials.

Along the way, Venezuelan leaders say, 150 children younger than 18 have been split up from their parents, after the adults were detained or deported.

Fifty-seven of those children have slowly been reunited with their families in Venezuela. They were placed on deportations flights following negotiations between the Venezuelan and U.S. governments.

Venezuelan officials have shared lists of children they want back with the U.S. State Department, which has forwarded that information to ICE. The diplomatic channels appeared to have deteriorated since the United States began striking suspected drug-smuggling boats off Venezuela’s coast, even as deportation flights continue

Officials in Venezuela have described the separations in stark terms, broadly accusing the Trump administration of “kidnapping” the children.

Cases reviewed by The Times show that many parents landed in ICE custody after being picked up by immigration officials — leaving immigration court or at a traffic checkpoint — or after having run-ins with the law, according to police records.

In Georgia and Texas, states in which local law enforcement officials regularly cooperate with ICE, some parents were pulled over by police and jailed for traffic violations, such as driving without a license, before being transferred to ICE custody.

“Just like American citizens who commit crimes may face separation from their family, so, too, can illegal aliens,” Ms. McLaughlin said.

‘Let It Be Mine’

During the past few months, anxious families flocked to Simón Bolívar International Airport, outside Caracas, propelled by the hope that flights from the United States would include a clutch of children who had been separated from their parents.

Mothers pray under their breath.

“Que sea el mío, Dios mío, que sea el mío.”

“Let it be mine, my God, let it be mine.”

One morning in September, a group of mothers crumpled to the floor upon learning that their children were not on the flight they had been waiting for. Their cries and pleas pierced the airport terminal.

But the agony has also given way to scenes of joy.

After nearly seven months apart, the mother of Emmanuel, the 11-year-old who lived alone for three months, arrived at the airport after being told that her son was coming home on Nov. 7.

The mother, Ms. Venecia Farías, 35, hadn’t seen him since she was detained by Border Patrol officers on April 21, along with her husband, while they were driving to their home near the U.S.-Mexico border, in Brownsville, Texas.

Ms. McLaughlin argued that she was detained by Border Patrol trying to “illegally re-enter the country” after leaving the United States without her child. Ms. Venecia Farías said that was false.

“That’s crazy,” she said, insisting that she never left the United States and was arrested after taking a wrong turn on her way home, driving into one of many Border Patrol checkpoints near the border.

She recounted the challenges that she originally faced to make it to the United States, including thousands of dollars paid to smugglers and a brief kidnapping in Mexico. “You think I was going to leave the United States? To Mexico?”

After his mother was detained, Emmanuel spent most of the summer living alone. He slept on a mattress on the floor and administered a nebulizer to treat chronic asthma, his mother said. He eventually moved in with an acquaintance in Texas, who charged his mother $400 a week to cover the boy’s expenses.

The sum was so large that Ms. Venecia Farías had to crowdsource money to pay the cost from Venezuela. Emmanuel, approaching adolescence, had grown more irritable. And asthma attacks always loomed.

All the worrying would come to an end.

Earlier this month, Emmanuel disembarked from a plane and spotted his mother among a throng of families. He hurried, brushing past the crowd as his mother spread her arms.

He leaped, so hard that they both fell onto a sofa, weeping and locked in a tight embrace.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ORDER TO RE-VET ALL REFUGEES IS SHAMEFUL MOVE TO BULLY THE MOST VULNERABLE

IRAP strongly condemns latest attempt to de-legalize migrants by threatening their status

(NEW YORK, NY)— Tonight, Reuters reported on a memo from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) ordering the agency to re-vet and re-interview all refugees who entered the United States during the Biden administration. According to the report, the memo also orders a halt to all processing of applications for permanent residence these refugees have filed. TheInternational Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) strongly condemns this latest attempt to target and de-legalize migrants by threatening their status.

The following is a statement from Sharif Aly, President of the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP):

“Trump campaigned on a promise to target immigrants. This order is one more in a long line of efforts to bully some of the most vulnerable members of our communities, by threatening their lawful status, rendering them vulnerable to the egregious conduct of immigration enforcement agencies, and putting them through an onerous and potentially re-traumatizing process.

Refugees who entered via the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program are already the most highly vetted immigrants in the United States. They have come here to find safety and stability after fleeing war, violence, and persecution – to threaten them like this is an insult not only to refugees but to all who have worked to maintain the integrity of this program for decades.

Besides the enormous cruelty of this undertaking, it would also be a tremendous waste of government resources to review and re-interview 200,000 people who have been living peacefully in our communities for years. Americans should be outraged that this administration is consistently targeting our friends and neighbors, just because of where they were born.”

Asked by Kyiv Post’s Washington correspondent about Minsk’s actions forcing migrants toward EU borders such as Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia, the official emphasized on Monday that the US is taking the issue seriously, particularly for countries bordering the nation.

“On the Belarus point. … weaponized migration is definitely something of serious concern to the US, and I’m sure it’s a serious concern to countries that are bordering Belarus and are very proximate to that conflict. So it’s definitely something we’re taking a look at,” the official said.

Refocusing human rights on mass migration

The official was speaking at a Washington Foreign Press Center briefing about the State Department’s latest decision to unveil a broader initiative aimed at reshaping its human rights agenda to address what the administration describes as the “mass migration crisis” in Europe.

This concern over Belarus’s actions serves as a potent example of a challenge the US is now seeking to officially document and confront.

Last Thursday, the department sent a cable to US embassies across Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, instructing them to begin collecting data on “migrant-related crimes and human rights abuses facilitated by people of a migration background.”

The official said the directive reflects a wider effort by the Trump administration to approach human rights “without selectivity,” addressing issues previously overlooked because they were politically inconvenient or did not fit prevailing narratives.

The official emphasized that mass migration represents an “existential threat to Western civilization and the safety of both the West and the world.”

The cable is designed both to gather data and to engage allied governments on US concerns. The administration is signaling that it stands “ready, willing, and able” to support partners in addressing the crisis.

Concerns over judicial disparities

The official raised concerns about judicial disparities, describing a two-tiered system in which crimes committed by migrants often result in lighter punishments than comparable offences by locals.

While officials stressed that the US recognizes the benefits of targeted, high-skilled immigration for economic growth, they drew a clear distinction between that and the broader migration flows now affecting Europe and other Western nations.

“The phenomenon we’re talking about here is completely different,” the official said, arguing that the economic benefits of large-scale migration are “completely dubious” and do not reflect the experiences of local populations dealing with displacement, rising crime, and community strain.

On coordination with allies, the official confirmed that US embassies have been instructed to engage directly with governments such as the UK, Sweden, and Germany to convey concerns, encourage data collection, and offer support.

A federal judge on Monday tossed out separate criminal charges against the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and New York’s attorney general, Letitia James.

The manner in which the judge dismissed the Comey indictment could now lead to a legal fight over whether the government can try to refile the charges with another grand jury.

Devlin Barrett, who covers the Justice Department and the F.B.I. for The New York Times, discusses President Trump’s campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies and walks us through the judge’s rulings.

The intervention into domestic affairs goes beyond illegal immigration and seeks to caution Canberra that a significant intake of migrants, “particularly of a culture that’s radically different from Australia’s”, can lead to political and economic instability.

A senior State Department official said the administration had instructed diplomats at its embassy in Canberra to “begin collecting data and reporting on migrant-related crimes and human rights abuses facilitated by people of a migration background”.

Similar cables were sent last week to all US embassies in Europe, as well as Canada and New Zealand. The governments of these countries were not consulted beforehand, but the US embassies have been instructed to contact them and offer to “help”.

The senior State Department official, who spoke on condition of not being named, said the US government was concerned a large influx of migrants could strain markets, naming Australia’s housing crisis as an example.

“Beyond that, we want to caution the Australians,” he told this masthead. “We love the Australian people … We just want to warn our friends that if you import a rapid number of individuals of any background, particularly of a culture that’s radically different from Australia’s, without any sort of mechanism for diffusing the impact, that can lead to political unrest, that can lead to economic instability.”

The official said that while illegal immigration was “the elephant in the room”, the Trump administration was concerned about mass migration more broadly.

“You have to have some common sense about that,” he told this masthead. “You also have to understand the limitations ... and the security concerns that come with mass migration, and what happens when you import a substantial number of people into a very tight, particular area.”

A spokesperson for the Australian government said the Trump administration had not raised the matter with Australia.

“Australia is a pluralist nation, we welcome different races, religions and views, united by respect for each other’s humanity and for each other’s right to live in peace,” the spokesperson said.

Australia admits 185,000 permanent migrants a year, mostly skilled workers. Net overseas migration, which includes temporary workers, international students and visitors, is falling rapidly from a post-COVID high of 538,000 in 2022-23. It has now dropped to about 316,000, lower than forecast.

But Opposition Leader Sussan Ley has pledged to unveil a policy that would further cut the intake, amid a hot-button debate over immigration and population.

In a separate cable, the State Department also instructed embassies to begin collating its next annual human rights report, traditionally one of the most comprehensive studies of human rights abuses around the world.

The Trump administration is changing the focus of the report to scrutinise countries’ enforcement of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, as well as government funding for abortion services and gender transition surgery for children.

The senior State Department official, on a briefing call to news media, said the administration was not afraid to call out its allies “just as much as we’re willing to call out our enemies”.

It was also determined to address human rights concerns that have been ignored by the global human rights community “because they were politically incorrect, or they weren’t convenient to the prevailing narratives”.

The official said the fact that the mass migration project was being managed by the department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour indicated how seriously the administration was taking the issue.

“This is a real problem. There are security implications to this. There are cultural implications to this. There are economic implications to this,” he said. “We think it’s about time that for the sake of our allies, for the sake of their citizens, for the sake of our friends, someone said something about this.”

The latest intervention continues a global project articulated by Vice President JD Vance when he spoke at the Munich Security Conference in February, warning European leaders their voters were rebelling against “out-of-control migration”, and that politicians ignored the will of the people at their peril.

US President Donald Trump dramatically pressed the case when he told the United Nations in September that “the globalist migration agenda”, along with environmental and economic policies to combat climate change, were destroying Western societies. “Your countries are going to hell,” he said.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1656%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_54%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/484502fa862fb199336932a385b075c763332377,N,,2025-11-25 09:57:40.089430

Protests outside the facility have grown increasingly tense as federal agents used chemical agents that area neighbors felt.

Meanwhile, federal agents are also under investigation in connection with the death of a suburban man fatally shot by ICE agents during a traffic stop.","CHICAGO — Chicago has entered what many consider a new uneasy phase of a Trump administration immigration crackdown that has already led to thousands of arrests.

While a U.S. Border Patrol commander known for leading intense and controversial surges moved on to North Carolina, federal agents are still arresting immigrants across the nation’s third-largest city and suburbs.

A growing number of lawsuits stemming from the crackdown are winding through the courts. Authorities are investigating agents’ actions, including a fatal shooting. Activists say they are not letting their guard down in case things ramp up again, while many residents in the Democratic stronghold where few welcomed the crackdown remain anxious.

“I feel a sense of paranoia over when they might be back,” said Santani Silva, an employee at a vintage store in the predominantly Mexican neighborhood of Pilsen. “People are still afraid.”

Intensity slows, but arrests continue

For more than two months, the Chicago area was the focus of an aggressive operation led by Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol commander behind similar efforts in Los Angeles and soon Louisiana.

Armed and masked agents used unmarked SUVs and helicopters throughout the city of 2.7 million and its suburbs to target suspected criminals and immigration violators. Arrests often led to intense standoffs with bystanders, from wealthy neighborhoods to working-class suburbs.

While the intensity has died down in the week since Bovino left, reports of arrests still pop up. Activists tracking immigration agents said they confirmed 142 daily sightings at the height of the operation last month. The number is now roughly six a day.

“It’s not over,” said Brandon Lee with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “I don’t think it will be over.”

Suburb under siege

Bearing the brunt of the operation has been Broadview, a Chicago suburb of roughly 8,000 people that has housed a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center for years.

Protests outside the facility have grown increasingly tense as federal agents used chemical agents that area neighbors felt. Broadview police also launched three criminal investigations into federal agents’ tactics.

Community leaders took the unusual step of declaring a civil emergency last week, after Bovino left the area, and moving public meetings online.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said the community has faced bomb threats, death threats and violent protests because of the crackdown.

“I will not allow threats of violence or intimidation to disrupt the essential functions of our government,” Thompson said.

Questionable arrests and detentions

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has touted more than 3,000 arrests, but the agency has provided details on only a few cases where immigrants without legal permission to live in the country also had a criminal history.

The Trump administration takes to social media to post photos of supposed violent criminals apprehended in immigration operations, but the federal government’s own data paints a different picture.

Of 614 immigrants arrested and detained in recent months around Chicago, only 16, less than 3%, had criminal records representing a “high public safety risk,” according to federal government data submitted to the court as part of a 2022 consent decree about ICE arrests. Those records included domestic battery and drunken driving.

A judge in the cases said hundreds of immigrant detainees qualify to be released on bond, though an appeals court has paused their release. Attorneys say many more cases will follow as they get details from the government about arrests.

“None of this has quite added up,” said Ed Yohnka with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, which has been involved in several lawsuits. “What was this all about? What did this serve? What did any of this do?”

Investigations and lawsuits

The number of lawsuits triggered by the crackdown is growing, including on agents’ use of force and conditions at the Broadview center. In recent days, clergy members filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging they were being blocked from ministering inside a facility.

Federal prosecutors have also repeatedly dropped charges against protesters and other bystanders, including dismissing charges against a woman who was shot several times by a Border Patrol agent last month.

Meanwhile, federal agents are also under investigation in connection with the death of a suburban man fatally shot by ICE agents during a traffic stop. Mexico’s president has called for a thorough investigation, while ICE has said it did not use excessive force.

An autopsy report, obtained recently by The Associated Press, showed Silverio Villegas González died of a gunshot wound fired at “close range” to his neck. The death was declared a homicide.

In October, the body of the 38-year-old father who spent two decades in the U.S. was buried in the western Mexico state of Michoacan.

A chilling effect

Many of the once bustling business corridors in the Chicago area’s largely immigrant communities that had quieted down were seeing a buzz again with some street vendors slowly returning to their usual posts.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Federal_Enforcement_Chicago_86095-fc91a.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 12:57:34.614201

In their action filed in January, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship along with Sikh and Quaker groups were granted a temporary restraining prohibiting ICE raids on member properties.
An SBC spokesperson said neither Pressley nor the Executive Committee have been briefed about planned ICE raids, according to the report.
The presence of immigration agents during the holiday season would be harmful to faith communities even if the reported raids do not occur, according to the filing.","A coalition of religious groups has asked a federal court to prevent federal immigration agents from raiding houses of worship during the holiday season.

The plaintiffs in New England Synod, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, et al., v. Department of Homeland Security, et al. filed the petition amid swirling rumors and news reports that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has plans to apprehend worshipers in Spanish-speaking and other congregations during Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holiday services in the coming weeks.

“If these reports are true, it is outrageous that the administration would so blatantly seek to undermine the freedom to worship freely as we enter an important time for many faiths,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which serves as co-counsel in the action.

The possibility that raids could be carried out on church campuses and in sanctuaries creates even more urgency for the lawsuit on behalf of the Alliance of Baptists, American Baptist Churches in the USA, Metropolitan Community Churches and numerous Quaker and Evangelical Lutheran Church in America regions, Perryman said.

“The reports circulating this week are alarming and incompatible with our Constitution. We are taking swift action to ensure that the protections already recognized by the court are upheld and that faith communities can gather and worship, free from government coercion.”

The concern stems from the Trump administration’s January termination of longstanding federal prohibitions against immigration raids in sensitive locations such as churches, hospitals and schools. Since then, federal agents have arrested undocumented immigrants on or near church properties, but incursions into sanctuaries and other buildings have not been reported.

Yet multiple religious groups have filed lawsuits similar to this one seeking to bar ICE and other agencies from such actions.

In their action filed in January, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship along with Sikh and Quaker groups were granted a temporary restraining prohibiting ICE raids on member properties. Fellowship Southwest, now known as FaithWorks, the Hispanic Baptist Convention and other groups were denied a restraining order in their separate lawsuit filed earlier this year.

Both social media and news accounts have been stoking fears that DHS plans to sweep through houses of worship during the holiday season. A WhatsAPP message warning of impending church raids in Atlanta sparked apprehension in that city, while reports of federal officials briefing Baptist, Catholic, Pentecostal and Jewish leaders of impending actions has raised concerns throughout New England.

“Two Hispanic pastors who lead Southern Baptist churches in New England say that SBC President Clint Pressley and its Executive Board received briefings on the plan and discussed it with Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller and White House Border Czar Tom Homan,” This Week in Worcester reported.

An SBC spokesperson said neither Pressley nor the Executive Committee have been briefed about planned ICE raids, according to the report.

A Hispanic Pentecostal pastor said his church had been visited several times by ICE and FBI agents, according to the publication, which cited unnamed DHS sources. “In all three conversations, agents asked questions about the names of specific congregation members, their home addresses and the frequency they attended church services.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied the agency is targeting churches, according to the National Catholic Reporter: “ICE does not raid churches — regardless of if it is holiday season or not. This is just another false narrative to try and demonize our brave ICE law enforcement who are facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them and a 8000% increase in death threats.”

However, the department vowed that no house of worship will be off limits thanks to President Donald Trump’s January directive opening health care, education and sacred spaces to enforcement actions: “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense.”

But plaintiffs in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America lawsuit are taking no chances. The notice they filed Nov. 21 in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts cites continued immigration enforcement actions at or near member facilities, including the presence of masked and armed agents in church parking lots and apprehensions being made on or near church properties.

The presence of immigration agents during the holiday season would be harmful to faith communities even if the reported raids do not occur, according to the filing. “Plaintiffs respectfully request the court’s prompt intervention to prevent serious and irreparable harm to worshippers’ ability to practice their faith in community with others during a time of such vital religious significance.”",https://baptistnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shutterstock_1144500824.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 07:56:31.199279

It looks like all the other office buildings on this commercial strip not far from the Mall at Prince George’s.

But it’s a place of life-changing decisions nonetheless. Some people come here and win appeals for asylum or an extension of their residency in the U.S. Others leave unsure of their future in the country.

“Have you seen ICE?” one man asked a passerby in Spanish on a recent day, hunched over a walker and clutching a folder of papers. He asked for help finding the right courtroom for his hearing, and he wanted to know if a man in a suit nearby was a lawyer. He said he didn’t have one.

It’s a common problem outside the Hyattsville court, where Capital News Service reporters have visited on multiple court days this fall, talking to people as they come and go.

Many of the respondents appear without lawyers. Many don’t feel comfortable speaking English.

Every day, respondents walk through the building’s sterile, white-washed hallways, where immigration policy meets the real life of Maryland residents. Thousands of people come through the Hyattsville Immigration Court every year. The backup of pending cases in this venue stood at around 21,000 during the fiscal year that ended in September, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

During the same fiscal year, almost 8,000 new proceedings were filed in Maryland, slated for this court in Prince George’s County and its twin court in Baltimore, according to TRAC.

CNS reporters spoke with court observers who watch these cases play out on a regular basis.

“I think [immigrants are] very valuable in our culture and our economy. To me, they are most welcome, and certainly they’re making a huge economic contribution,” said Jim Bell, another court observer. “Them being here and them being in legal trouble bothers me a lot.”

Several weeks ago, Patricia Anne Murphy, a local resident who comes to observe court each week, saw one couple’s hearing was bumped from its original 8:30 a.m. start time. Murphy offered to get them food, but the husband responded by pointing to a sign stating that food and drinks aren’t permitted.

Murphy then offered to take them to lunch, but once again, she received a no. The pair was scared of ICE.

“His partner said, ‘We don’t dare go out, we’re afraid once we’re in here, we want to stay here until we’re done,’ ” Murphy said. “You know … talk about existential shocks of feeling this person’s fear.”

Daily proceedings

The day typically begins with sessions in the 8 o’clock hour.

The courtrooms occupy the sixth and seventh floors of the office building. The hearings are held in rooms the size of a high-school classroom, made court-like by a long wooden judge’s bench against the back wall.

The judges have years of experience in the legal system, many in immigration law, on both sides of the issue. Some have worked with the Department of Homeland Security, others have worked with immigrant rights organizations.

A respondent’s table sits directly before the translator to allow for clearer communication with non-English speakers. One by one, respondents are called to the table and asked a series of questions.

“Can you please state your name?” they’re asked. “Is this the language you best understand?”

During several weeks of observing the courtrooms, CNS reporters have witnessed different answers to the questions: “Si,” “Oui,” “Yes,” “I don’t understand.”

Before long, the questions shift.

“Do you understand that you’re in the United States without permission?” a judge asked one recent day. “Do you understand the consequences of what will happen if you don’t return to court?”

Their families sit on church-like pews, with children playing on the floor nearby.

Many respondents appear without legal representation. As of August in Maryland, that number is about 37% of respondents with pending cases and Maryland addresses, according to TRAC.

And in a time of shortage, some of the respondents may fall victim to lawyer scams.

“They hired quasi lawyers from other countries who claimed they were lawyers to help them fill out the asylum applications,” Bell said, of one story he heard at the Baltimore Immigration Court. “They had paid and trusted them to do it correctly. This didn’t happen.”

These quasi-lawyers are known as “notarios,” Bell said.

Families in the courtroom

But even within these stressful situations, there’s another emotion: joy. In one judge’s courtroom at the Hyattsville Immigration Court sits a large bin of stuffed animals, including a large shark with a zippered mouth.

Children, sitting with parents waiting to hear the date of their asylum hearings, dash over to the bin. One girl’s arm is swallowed by the shark as she runs over to her mother, pretending to be bitten by the shark. She’s joyous when a court employee tells her she can take a toy home.

In another courtroom, a pair of children play among the benches as their father’s hearing goes on. They giggle and crawl. At times, they appear to catch the judge’s attention, and their mother moves with haste to quiet them down.

They do not wear the same serious expressions as their parents, and, like passersby to the ordinary office building holding the court, they might not know or understand what happens here. For them, it is a new experience. New places to climb, new toys to take home.

The Upper Tribunal gives guidance on this question in MM, R (On the Application Of) v SSHD (effect of withdrawal section 94B) [2025] UKUT 385 (IAC).

Revival of leave?

The starting point is that the making of a deportation order cancels any permission, including settlement or indefinite leave to remain, that a person may have under s5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971.

The position since the Supreme Court’s decision in R (George) v SSHD [2014] UKSC 28 is that a successful appeal against a deportation order does not reinstate or ‘revive’ a foreign criminal’s previously held indefinite leave. Per current policy and practice, if you win your appeal on human rights grounds but have had your indefinite leave to remain cancelled, you are generally given renewable 30 month periods of permission to stay in the UK.

BUT: a deportation order made under s32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 does not invalidate leave to enter or remain as long as s79(4) and s78 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applies, i.e. while there is a pending appeal under section 82(1) of the 2002 Act, which has been brought when the appellant is in the UK.

Where a claim is certified under section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 there is no in country right of appeal and so s79(4) and s78 do not apply.

The upshot of this is that some people who the Home Office attempts to deport keep their indefinite leave to remain after winning their appeals, others do not. It depends on the process that the Home Office followed when it made the decision to deport.

In the case of MM, the applicant attempted to challenge whether or not the Home Office took the correct path in his case.

The path not taken

MM arrived in the UK in 1984, and was granted indefinite leave to remain in 2003. He was convicted of various criminal offences, and received a sentence of imprisonment for 27 months in 2015 for burglary. The Home Office made a Stage 2 decision to deport on 20 June 2016, certifying his human rights claim under section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. A deportation order under s32(5) UK Borders Act 2007 was signed on the same day.

In August 2018, following the Supreme Court judgment in R (Kiarie & Byndloss) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 42 (which challenged the lawfulness of s94B certification and out of country appeals), the Home Office withdrew the 2016 human rights claim refusal and the s94B certification and made a new decision, still refusing the human rights claim, but with an in-country right of appeal. MM exercised his in-country right of appeal, and eventually won.

However, since MM’s human rights claim had been certified under s94B so that he did not have a right of appeal exercisable from inside the UK, the protection in section 79(4) did not apply and the Home Office could therefore make a deportation order under section 32(5) which in turn invalidated his indefinite leave to remain. The Home Office therefore granted him 30 months leave in January 2023.

In his judicial review challenge to this decision, MM’s legal team argued that the Home Office should not have followed the course that they did and that (para 58)

… having withdrawn the section 94B certificate and the decision in [MM’s] human rights claim, the[y] ought at that point to have revoked the deportation decision or, if not, ought to have reinstated his ILR pending the outcome of the reconsideration of his human rights claim and pending his appeal against the refusal of his claim, restoring him to the position he would have been in if the section 94B certificate had not been made. Alternatively, that the applicant’s ILR automatically revived once the section 94B certificate was withdrawn.

The legal bases for the challenge are dealt with in some detail in the judgment (paras 47-81), but were ultimately rejected by Judge Kebede of the Upper Tribunal.

Since compliance with and enforcement of the English-language proficiency standard and pressure on non-domiciled CDLs hit a boiling point in 2025, more states are amping up enforcement. A handful of states have partnered with Immigration and Customs Enforcement during these multi-day enforcement blitzes.

Oklahoma has been hot to trot, with three raids in recent months (more on the third raid below). Indiana and New York have also gotten in on the action as of late.

Texas and Wyoming are the latest to conduct these safety blitzes.

Texas enforcement blitz

Texas officials said they apprehended 31 truck drivers who were believed to be in the U.S. illegally.

As part of the joint operation by the Texas Department of Public Safety and federal law enforcement, 105 commercial vehicle inspections were conducted along Interstate 40. According to a news release from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, troopers were unable to verify the lawful presence of 31 drivers despite them all having CDLs. Texas officials said that the “majority” of the CDLs had been issued in California.

The suspected drivers were referred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to the news release, ICE determined that all of the drivers were in the U.S. illegally.

“Millions of Texans drive on our highways, roads, and streets every day,” Abbott said. “When illegal immigrants break the law and illegally drive on our roads, they endanger the lives of countless Texans and Americans. This joint state and federal operation along one of the nation’s longest transcontinental highways removed illegal drivers and unsafe vehicles from Texas roads. While liberal states like California issue licenses to illegal immigrants and risk the lives of Americans, Texas will work with our federal partners to maintain safe roads and apprehend illegal immigrants to protect our communities.”

Wyoming Operation Safe Haul

Wyoming got in on the ICE action, running a three-day blitz looking for undocumented immigrants and truck drivers with a non-domiciled CDL.

With Wyoming’s aggressive enforcement and out-of-service rates for non-compliance with the English proficiency standard, it was likely only a matter of time before they got even more aggressive. According to data from the OOIDA Foundation, since June, when the out-of-service penalty for lack of English proficiency was reinstated, Wyoming has a 92.5% out-of-service rate on 562 English-language proficiency violations.

Enter Operation Safe Haul, a partnership between the Laramie County Sheriff’s Office, Wyoming Highway Patrol and ICE. Between Nov. 18 and 20, a safety blitz targeting commercial drivers was conducted.

According to a Sheriff’s Office news release, the trio of agencies conducted 133 inspections, placing 44 vehicles and 38 drivers out of service – 16 for CDL/licensing issues, 10 for English-language violations, and two for drug violations.

“I am sorry to see these irresponsible and undocumented drivers tarnish the reputation of professional commercial carrier drivers who uphold safety regulations and keep America moving,” said Laramie County Sheriff Brian Kozak in a press release.

Oklahoma’s Operation Guardian strikes again

Launching its third such safety blitz in as many months, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol’s Operation Guardian hit again. This time on Nov. 17, the 12-hour enforcement effort focused on Highway 69 in Bryan County, Okla.

According to an Oklahoma Department of Public Safety news release, 160 commercial motor vehicle inspections were conducted. Seven “legal aliens” were cited for violation of the English-proficiency standard. Of note, there were also 76 undocumented immigrants arrested for immigration violations during passenger vehicle stops.

While the two previous Operation Guardian releases specifically mentioned ICE as part of the enforcement partnership, the new release on the current blitz is unclear. Calls to Oklahoma DPS were not immediately returned.

Meanwhile, in the courts

The Department of Transportation initiated a direct final rule – one that does not go fully through the rulemaking process before its effective date – to stop the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs while the program is reviewed.

The rule, which took effect immediately in late September, was expected to remove about 194,000 non-domiciled CDLs. Under the interim rule, an Employee Authorization Document (EAD) was no longer enough to obtain a non-domiciled CDL. Additionally, asylum seekers, asylees, refugees and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients would be excluded from eligibility.

A lawsuit was filed by a number of groups, including the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, challenging the direct final rule. The groups not only challenged the rule’s legality but also requested an emergency stay.

On Nov. 10, the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted an administrative emergency stay to give the court more time to look at the merits of the case. Three days later, the court elevated the administrative stay to a full emergency stay.

U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pledged on Nov. 18 to battle the lawsuit, telling Laura Ingraham on the Ingraham Angle that agency leaders were reviewing legal strategies.

Two days later, the DOT requested that the lawsuit be put on pause while the rulemaking process is completed. This is a common tactic used in court cases when a final rule is challenged. No ruling on the request had been released as of press time.

However, one more clock is ticking, and that’s the one on the original request for comments on the interim final rule.

Although the emergency rule originally took effect in late September, the agency was still going through the rulemaking process and accepting comments through Nov. 28.

“In anticipation of promulgating a final rule, the government respectfully moves to hold these cases in abeyance,” the DOJ attorneys wrote on Nov. 19. “The comment period on the interim final rule at issue closes in just nine days, on Nov. 28. The agency intends to review the comments received, respond to those comments (including changes to the rule, to the extent appropriate) and issue a final rule.

“An abeyance will conserve judicial and party resources and promote the efficient and orderly disposition of the pending petitions, including by ensuring the parties do not unnecessarily brief issues rendered moot or otherwise changed by the promulgation of a final rule.”",https://landline.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11-24-25-non-dom-saga-continues-pic.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:57:45.975872

Of people booked into ICE custody this fiscal year (since October 1, 2025):

Nearly three in four (73 percent) had no criminal conviction.

Nearly half had no criminal conviction nor even any pending criminal charges.

Only 8 percent had a violent or property criminal conviction.

Only 5 percent had a violent criminal conviction.

A majority of criminal convicts had vice, immigration, or traffic convictions.

The appendix table at the end of this report provides the detailed breakdown of the data by detailed type of crime.

The earliest data I obtained that was reported in this way comes from April 26, 2025. Compared with October 2024 to April 2025—before the White House shifted focus completely away from criminals—80 percent of the increase in daily ICE book-ins have come from individuals without criminal convictions.

Since October 1, only 8 percent of detained persons had either a violent or property crime. As many people were detained with an immigration conviction (e.g., illegal entry/​reentry) as violent convicts.

In its posts on this subject, DHS and ICE often include people with pending criminal charges as “criminal arrests,” even though these people have never been found guilty, and the charges are often minor and regularly dismissed. ICE is depriving these people of due process by arresting them prior to a conviction. Nonetheless, ICE data show that nearly half (47 percent) of all ICE detainees this fiscal year

Other data sources support the conclusions from the number of ICE book-ins. The Deportation Data Project, which is run by UC Berkeley Law School in collaboration with the UCLA School of Law’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, has obtained data on ICE arrests via the Freedom of Information Act. ICE arrests are individuals charged as removable by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, so it excludes people arrested by Border Patrol and referred to ICE for detention who are included in the data above.

This arrest dataset also does not disclose the type of crime committed. In any case, it similarly shows that by late July, 67 percent of ICE arrests were of people without criminal convictions. It also shows that by late July, nearly 40 percent of ICE arrests were of people without criminal convictions or criminal charges. This is a dramatic change from President Joseph Biden’s policies under which only one in 10 arrests were individuals without any criminal conviction or charge.

More important than the share of arrests is the absolute number of these arrests. Already by late July, ICE arrests of immigrants without criminal convictions had increased by 571 percent from the weekly average to start the calendar year. ICE arrests of immigrants without criminal convictions or criminal charges increased a staggering 1,500 percent since January 1.

Finally, the last data source comes from public data directly from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website, showing that by mid-November, 69 percent of current ICE detainees who were arrested by ICE had no criminal conviction and 40 percent had no criminal charge. The number of people in detention who were convicted of a crime and had no pending charges increased a staggering 2,370 percent since January from fewer than 1,000 to over 21,000.

The ICE data show that the share of immigrants detained after an ICE arrest who had criminal convictions has fallen in half since January from 62 percent of detainees to 31 percent in November. At the same time, the share of detainees without a criminal conviction or criminal charge has exploded from 6 percent to 40 percent of detainees.

The same ICE dataset shows that in November 2025, 70 percent of those who ICE deported had no criminal conviction, and 43 percent had no criminal conviction or criminal charge. Across all available datasets, it is clear that the Trump administration is not living up to its promises to deport millions and millions of criminals or to prioritize the worst of the worse. So far, the administration has removed barely 90,000 individuals with criminal convictions and fewer than 150,000 individuals with convictions or pending charges.

President Trump’s deportation agenda does not match the campaign promises that he made nor the rhetoric from his officials. The president has already recognized that deportations are hurting the US economy in deporting good workers. But perhaps more importantly, the agenda is taking resources away from targeting true public safety threats, whether from immigrants or Americans. ICE should redirect its resources back toward serious public safety threats.",https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/optimized/public/multimedia/podcast/cato_commentary_2020.jpg?itok=DYvnNPDY,N,,2025-11-25 03:57:19.989110

During a Monday status hearing, U.S. District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell set a conference for Dec. 16-17 in her Fort Myers courtroom.

“I think we’re closer on a lot of issues than we were before,” Polster Chappell said. “And I would think that the parties can come to the table and reasonably come to some agreements that aren’t going to be overly burdensome on the defendants but also will allow the plaintiffs to have the rights that they deserve.”

Attorneys representing detainees at the facility are seeking a preliminary injunction to make it easier for their clients to meet and communicate with them. The detention center was built last summer at a remote airstrip in the Everglades by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Eunice Cho, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Monday that detainees’ attorneys must make an appointment to visit three days in advance, unlike at other detention facilities where lawyers can just show up during visiting hours. She pointed out that detainees often are transferred to other facilities after their attorneys have made an appointment to see them and that scheduling delays have been so lengthy that detainees are unable to meet with attorneys before key deadlines.

Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state, said most of the concerns initially raised by the detainees and their attorneys have been addressed and that previous delays were due to trying to construct a facility for thousands of detainees in a remote area with little infrastructure.

The lawsuit is one of three federal cases. In an environmental lawsuit, a federal appellate court panel in September allowed the center to continue operating by putting on hold a lower court’s preliminary injunction ordering it to wind down by the end of October.

Back is also facing an additional charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution in Hennepin County.

According to the indictment, Back allegedly went to meet the girl and was arrested, with officers finding two cellphones and ICE identification.

In an interview with investigators, Back claimed he didn’t know why he continued talking to the girl after learning her age, stating, ""I don’t really know if there is anything to say. It’s all there in the texts.""

CHICAGO — When federal immigration agents detained a South Los Angeles tamale vendor, her husband and their customer in June, a multiracial group of neighbors organized a march and vigil to denounce the arrests and collect donations for the affected families. Neighbors grieved collectively and laid flowers at a makeshift altar.

“This cement, this corner needs transformation,” a speaker said at the vigil, a demonstration of cultural pride and unity among different racial and ethnic groups in the face of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests, according to social media posts about the event.

Over the months that followed, neighbors have been meeting in back yards and community spaces to develop plans to protect each other and “reclaim” their streets. Their work offers insights on how people across racial and cultural backgrounds are showing up for each other as federal agents sweep across communities.

In recent weeks, Block Club Chicago and LA Public Press have spoken to residents in both cities about building multiracial solidarity and caring for families affected by widening immigration enforcement efforts. For some, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in both cities reflect a reality about state violence that Black people, including Black immigrants, have known for decades: Under the premise of law enforcement, armed agents can swoop in, wreak harm on a community and snatch people seemingly with impunity.

Enrique Gaspar, an organizer with the anti-poverty nonprofit Community Coalition, which organized the South LA march and vigil, told LA Public Press solidarity has become a daily practice after months of witnessing beloved neighbors get disappeared by federal agents.

“We made a plan to protect ourselves,” Gaspar said in Spanish. “Because an attack against one of us is a strike against all of us. We need to confront ICE terror together.”

After a spate of immigration arrests in the area, primarily Black and Latine neighbors came together to organize a “reclaim our streets” campaign to protest local ICE activity, inform immigrants about their legal rights and care for people affected by raids, Gaspar said.

People leaned on each other again when the time came to advocate for rent control in LA, or to canvas the neighborhood in support of Proposition 50. Members of the organization also drop off food and other mutual aid to neighbors who are too afraid to go outside due to their immigration status.

Neighbors realize they need to stand up for each other, regardless of anyone’s racial identity or citizenship status, because federal agents’ violent behavior is a threat to everyone, Gaspar said.

“We’re a multi-racial coalition working for a better place to live,” Gaspar said. “This is a community that needs to be defended. We’re affected by the same problems.”

South LA is home to a large number of immigrants, primarily from Latin America, though it was once a historically Black region of the city before waves of migration and gentrification changed its demographic makeup. It’s now a predominantly Latine region of LA.

The demographic changes reflect a nationwide trend of Black communities being pushed out by gentrification, disinvestment and pro-developer policies. As South LA changed, tensions emerged between groups, especially as public services were cut or social safety nets collapsed, but opportunities for mutual aid and solidarity also sprung up.

Gaspar, a former newspaper editor from Mexico, is clear-eyed about the challenges in building multiracial solidarity against ICE, but he’s not deterred by them. Cultural and language barriers come up during community meetings and they require deliberate, intentional work — and the financial capacity to hire translators — to ensure everyone can contribute fully.

Gaspar said Latine people must also work to eradicate anti-Blackness and racism if they’re to help build multiracial solidarity. Collective work on issues like rent control or immigrant defense helps neighbors identify the commonalities they share with each other, he said.

“We’re invaded by that [white supremacist] ideology, and the only way to rid ourselves of it is through education,” Gaspar said.

Immigration Enforcement In Black Communities

As both U.S. political parties have cracked down on immigrants and deported millions in recent decades, Black immigrants have been severely impacted, too.

Though images of predominantly non-Black immigrants being detained by ICE dominate news reports and social media, a review of federal immigration enforcement data reveals a more complex narrative.

Despite making up only 5.4 percent of the undocumented population in the United States, Black immigrants accounted for 20 percent of immigrants facing deportation based on criminal convictions, according to a data analysis by the Black Alliance for Justice Immigration and 76 percent of Black immigrants are deported because of contact with the police.

The study also found that people from predominantly Black countries who were detained by ICE were disproportionately more likely to be placed in solitary confinement.

Protecting immigrants from ICE raids and reforming immigration law isn’t an issue that solely Latine people must contend with, said Maraky, an LA-based Black Alliance for Justice Immigration member.

“The ICE dragnet makes all Black people vulnerable,” said Maraky, whose last name is being withheld by Block Club and LA Public Press due to credible fears of retaliation over their activism. “Immigration enforcement is an extension of anti-Black policing. We’re overpoliced and oversentenced.”

Since the second Trump administration began its recent crackdown on immigrants, the Black Alliance for Justice Immigration has been providing support for Black immigrants in LA and across the country.

LA County is home to at least 74,850 Black immigrants, the largest such population in California. Nationwide, one in 10 Black people are immigrants, according to a 2022 Pew report.

Black and Latine people share common struggles against state repression and injustice, Maraky said. Recent examples of solidarity between groups like the Brown Berets and Black Panthers provide roadmaps for how to challenge oppression together, they said.

But people have to keep showing up for each other, Maraky said.

“We have this shared class struggle that requires us to be able to be in solidarity with one another,” Maraky said. “But it’s important that solidarity not always fall on the most marginalized to produce their part in solidarity, and we look to our non-Black people of color in LA to really think about how we are showing up for each other.”

Maraky said LA Mayor Karen Bass should prevent the LA Police Department, known as LAPD, from providing support, even indirectly, to ICE operations. The department has faced criticism from residents who say LAPD’s actions — from standard traffic control to confrontations and, in some cases, violence against ICE protesters and journalists — during immigration arrests are a form of direct collusion with federal agents.

A spokesperson for Bass said the LAPD is prohibited from supporting immigration enforcement but her office didn’t answer questions about the department’s behavior when it responds to calls for support by federal agents.

From Slave Patrols To ICE Raids

For LA resident Joan Agoh, there’s a throughline between ICE arresting immigrants and the violence that the United States has inflicted on Black people for centuries.

The mechanisms targeting immigrants and the infrastructure caging people arrested by ICE is the same that criminalizes Black people, said Agoh, an organizer with the human rights organization Black Alliance for Peace.

When ICE agents have U.S. Supreme Court approval to factor someone’s race and whether they speak Spanish into justification for arrest, Agoh hears echoes of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which required police to arrest people believed to be fleeing enslavement.

“As Black folks in the United States, we know intimately what it is to be walking down the street and to be stopped simply for the color of your skin,” Agoh told LA Public Press. “These struggles are deeply connected.”

Seeing ICE agents clad in body armor and carrying high-powered rifles, Agoh sees remnants of undemocratic U.S. military interventions that have destabilized countries like Haiti.

She also sees the results of the ongoing “1033” federal program, which has transferred over $7 billion of U.S. military equipment to over 8,000 local police agencies in recent decades.

The LAPD and the LA County Sheriff’s Department have received over $3 million and $14 million, respectively, in equipment from the program, ranging from helicopters and rifles to sand bags and mine resistant vehicles, according to federal records analyzed by The Marshall Project.

“Where is ICE getting their armor from? It’s the same Pentagon pipeline that militarizes police nationwide, and it gets deployed oftentimes in Black, and indigenous and Brown communities,” Agoh said. “There’s no world in which we’re shouting to end police violence and say nothing about ICE.”

Block Club and LA Public Press were unable to verify the claim that Department of Homeland Security agencies such as ICE acquire equipment from the 1033 program.

BAP is calling on the federal government to shut down the program.

Since immigration enforcement operations surged across Southern California this summer, Black Alliance for Peace members have participated in protests against raids, mutual aid programs, and volunteer patrols tracking federal agents’ activity in various communities.

Over the past six months, Victoria, an LA-based member of Black Alliance for Peace, has joined other volunteers on morning patrols tracking ICE around Central LA. Riding in cars, on bikes or walking around, patrols also check in with people in the community and ensure day laborers are safe.

“We’re in a symbiotic relationship with the rest of the community to tell us if they’ve seen suspicious cars, or if they don’t recognize someone in their neighborhood taking pictures or harassing people,” said Victoria, whose last name Block Club and LA Public Press aren’t sharing due to concerns about retaliation stemming from their activism.

Victoria said the multiracial solidarity among patrollers has been vital in their work to keep immigrants safe, especially when communicating about new tactics federal agents employ or where sweeps are happening.

“I’ve seen a lot of community building of people who normally wouldn’t be talking to each other but are coordinating for the benefit of each other’s safety,” Victoria said. “There’s a strategic narrative that this is a certain type of person’s fight. ICE activity is going to affect all of us.”

In LA County, solidarity is “a necessity” for communities of color, Agoh said. Black LA residents in particular have dealt with decades of violence and racial profiling by the LA Police Department, even after a U.S. Justice Department consent decree sought to reform the agency.

Agoh said multiracial coalitions won’t be built overnight or easily sustained, but the work of practicing solidarity must continue.

“If I’m interested in the liberation of my people, I’m interested in liberation for all people.” Agoh said. “We can’t say this isn’t our fight.”

‘Heartening’ Connections Emerge In Chicago

As Porsha Weekly folded clothes behind the front desk at La Tiendita, a “free store” hosted at an African Methodist Episcopal church on Chicago’s South Side, a Latine woman approached and asked her a short question in English.

The woman and others in her group sought to browse the collections of donated clothing, toiletries and home goods. Weekly, a Black resident of the Washington Park neighborhood, responded briefly in Spanish.

After years of inflammatory rhetoric around the cultural differences between the South Side’s longtime Black residents and its new Latine arrivals, that mundane exchange at La Tiendita reflects a community working in ways big and small to adjust to those differences.

The two women continued communicating, mostly non-verbally, until two volunteers fluent in Spanish stepped in to guide the visitors through the shop. One of Weekly’s children, wearing a hoodie obtained from La Tiendita, passed the time playing with a rambunctious toddler from the shoppers’ group.

Such connections across language and cultural barriers “are very heartening,” said Dani Salazar, a lead volunteer at the shop who emigrated from Venezuela when he was 11.

“I would like to think that it’s not just because the situation has gotten so much worse for the [Latine] community, but also that it’s because [Black and Latine residents] have shared space for a while, and we are bonding [and] forming a closer connection with each other,” Salazar said.

La Tiendita has since early 2024 operated out of Coppin AME Church’s community center in Washington Park, one of the overwhelmingly Black South Side neighborhoods whose demographics have noticeably changed since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began sending immigrants from his state to Chicago three years ago.

Now, three months after the Trump administration escalated its immigration enforcement in Chicago and created even more chaos for Latine and Black residents alike, members of each community say the need for unity has rarely been more obvious.

La Tiendita’s most frequent volunteers — half of whom are Black, the others Latine — recognize that such solidarity will only be built through consistency, Salazar said.

“This is a place that was built in a moment of crisis,” Salazar said of the shop’s founding as thousands of people arrived in Chicago with few resources or connections.

But even as city officials have pared back the infrastructure they established amid that crisis, La Tiendita’s organizers are “committed to continuing the work, remaining a part of this community and continuing to serve the Black and Latine communities here that still need the services we provide,” Salazar said.

A Unique Struggle On Chicago’s Southeast Side

A few miles south of Washington Park, on Lake Michigan’s shoreline, are the neighborhoods of South Chicago and East Side. They’re split by the Calumet River and joined by two bridges, which alternately serve as symbols of division and unity in the community.

More than nine in 10 residents across these working-class neighborhoods are people of color, yet they’re largely segregated: 70 percent of South Chicago is Black, while 86 percent of East Side is Latine.

“We are so unique when it comes to Black and Brown struggle,” said Eva Maria Lewis, who is from the Southeast Side and founded the violence prevention nonprofit Free Root Operation.

Despite the clear differences in neighborhood makeup, the Southeast Side’s collective response to Trump’s crackdown draws on a long history of cross-racial organizing. The community was once home to massive steelmaking operations, which for decades attracted workers from a multitude of cultures.

The neighborhood’s “rapid response” team — which alerts neighbors to the presence of “la migra” and mobilizes existing aid networks — features many familiar faces from more recent environmental justice, labor and pro-Palestinian movements in the community.

“Solidarity is important, because who else is going to look out for us?” said Marcelina Pedraza, a union electrician at Ford’s Southeast Side assembly plant. “The people in my community, in the schools, across the street from me — we are going to keep each other safe.”

That’s not to say Chicagoans of color always form a unified front.

Anti-Blackness is rampant across the city, Lewis said. For example, as shops were looted in Latine communities like Little Village and suburban Cicero during the 2020 uprisings, some Black Chicagoans shopping in or passing through those areas were targeted with bricks, bats and harassment.

On the flip side, some Black residents — many of whom descend from people who fled violence and poverty in the South during the Great Migration — have been among the loudest voices against the city’s support for migrants.

These barriers to unity are structural and intentional, locals said. On top of the mistrust sewn by decades of divestment, redlining and racial violence in Black neighborhoods, local leaders’ rollouts of migrant resources in those same areas have been plagued by flip-flopping and communication failures.

“It’s easy to take the bait when talking about resource scarcity in our communities,” Lewis said. “But when we are able to focus in on the root causes, it allows us to have more ammunition towards positive change.”

To overcome those barriers, some Chicagoans are turning to deceptively simple practices: self-reflection, pattern recognition and trust-building.

Weekly, who was a “shopper” at La Tiendita before she started volunteering, admits she was at first bothered by La Tiendita’s existence. With mostly Spanish-speakers running and receiving items from the shop when she first visited last year, she believed Latines were only looking out for their own in a neighborhood that’s 95 percent Black, she said.

But as Weekly continued to receive items and eventually volunteer — and as word about the store spread beyond Spanish-speaking communities — she said she saw the organizers prove their commitment to visitors of all backgrounds. By “very rough” estimates, La Tiendita’s visitor base is now about 70 percent Black and 30 percent Latine, Salazar said.

“I grew from that,” Weekly said of her initial frustrations. “I have befriended [Latine] friends, and I know a little Spanish. … We don’t see [race]. We see community and love and giving. That’s it, that’s all.”

Finding Common Ground, And Empathy

Amid the feds’ crackdown, residents are also drawing parallels between the seemingly exceptional violence of the immigration operations and the regularly inequitable tactics of local policing — and urging other Black and Latine Chicagoans to see their struggles as linked.

As agents chased and incarcerated immigrants around the city, they also detained, zip-tied and choked out Black U.S. citizens. Meanwhile, county and state police have for weeks arrested protesters of numerous backgrounds outside a suburban immigration processing center.

In one case, Customs and Border Patrol agents violently detained a young Black man outside an East Side Walgreens on Oct. 14, the same day agents fanned out across the community and crashed into, injured, arrested and tear-gassed people.

A month later, dozens of residents marched in the streets past the Walgreens and other sites of that day’s chaos with signs reading “Unity in Struggle” and “Until We Are All Free.”

“For me, it’s really valuable … to have a camaraderie with the neighbors,” said Frances Mercado, a biracial Black and Mexican woman who lives at the intersection where agents gassed residents in defiance of local cops’ requests.

“We all talk — maybe not in-depth, or not in [about] our whole family life — but at least we’re cordial and kind to each other and respectable.”

In another incident in South Shore, which neighbors the Southeast Side, 37 immigrants and additional U.S. citizens were detained in a military-style raid Sept. 30.

Weeks later, a small group of Black residents gathered on the sidewalk outside the South Shore building. Though the group had initially gathered to socialize, some shifted focus when they saw city workers filing onto the property to perform a code inspection.

Several in the group peppered a buildings department employee with questions about the city’s handling of the building, which had deteriorated for years prior to the mass arrival of immigrants in the neighborhood, let alone the September raid.

A few others, citing that same history, denied to reporters that Latine migrants were to blame for the property’s appalling conditions.

Black and Latine Chicagoans are also being brought together by fresh attacks on food access.

As the Trump administration refused to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the recently ended government shutdown, Lewis’ Free Root Operation worked with Nuevo Leon Restaurant in Little Village to provide 260 people with free taco dinners one night last month.

Free Root Operation will continue food distributions, with further cuts to SNAP benefits on the horizon, Lewis said. Free meals allow neighbors in need to put “prejudices to the side” and focus on “the potential for us to get what we need — and for it not to come at the expense of each other’s wellbeing,” she said.

Extreme and visible pressures like sudden demographic changes, the immigration crackdown and cuts to federal benefits are pushing Chicagoans of color to find common ground. That gives community organizers an opportunity to build lasting connections, Lewis said.

“There is this line of empathy we can have on people,” she said. “There is a huge opportunity for us to learn from one another; an opportunity to be conscious around how these systems have caused our communities to play each other, and instead build and learn.”",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/Rally-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 20:59:26.426228

For the second time in just over a year, farm workers and immigrant rights advocates last Saturday staged protests at multiple Hannaford supermarket locations to pressure the regional grocery chain to guarantee better labor conditions for dairy workers.

Locally, protesters gathered outside the Hannaford in Morrisville’s Fairground Plaza on Nov. 15 to push the company and its multinational Dutch parent company, Ahold Delhaize, to participate in immigrant rights advocacy group Migrant Justice’s Milk with Dignity program.

The Milk with Dignity program asks participating corporations to pay more for dairy products to ensure better working conditions for workers on dairy farms. Vermont-based ice cream giant Ben & Jerry’s has participated in the program since 2017.

In October, Vermont Way Foods, a progressive distributor of Vermont products, announced a partnership to allow Migrant Justice to monitor working conditions in their products’ dairy supply chain, and even promoted the partnership with a “Cheese with Dignity” product.

In a survey conducted by Migrant Justice of Vermont farmworkers, over two-thirds of survey takers said they make less than minimum wage — in some cases far less — while another two-thirds reported suffering an injury due to working conditions.

Though Migrant Justice has targeted Hannaford in pressure campaigns to join Milk with Dignity since 2019, the campaign has escalated since protestors last appeared at the Morrisville location in October 2024.

In April, Migrant Justice filed a complaint with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international trade forum in which 37 countries develop policy around economic trade, alleging “grave human rights violations” in Hannaford’s dairy supply chain.

Ahold Delhaize responded by commissioning an independent human rights investigation. Migrant Justice “recently hosted the investigators charged with looking into labor violations, connecting them with workers on farms supplying Hannaford-brand milk,” the group said in a website post promoting the Nov. 15 protests, as investigators return to the Netherlands to submit their report.

Representatives for Portland, Maine-based Hannaford grocery or Ahold Delhaize did not respond to requests for comment.

With Hannaford under greater pressure, protestors returned to Fairground Plaza on with makeshift instruments, blaring music and chants in English and Spanish, handing out flyers to would-be shoppers and asking them to boycott the supermarket for a day.

A farmworker employed on a farm that guarantees fair labor conditions as part of the Ben & Jerry’s supply chain and asked that his name be withheld due to concerns of retaliation said that he valued the working conditions guaranteed by the Milk with Dignity program compared to what he sees on other farms.

“I have a voice, and I know that I have rights,” he said in Spanish, according to Migrant Justice spokesperson Will Lambek, who acted as translator. “For example, if I get sick, I can take a day off and I’ll still be paid for it. For Hannaford supply chain workers, even if they get sick, they have to keep working.”

Hannaford responded with an increased security detail, employing not just private security guards as they had the previous year but also law enforcement with the Morristown Police Department and the Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department. Officers questioned anyone attempting to park in the Hannaford parking lot to ensure only customers were allowed.

Farmworkers and activists gathered publicly on Nov. 15 even as federal immigration detainment actions have become increasingly common, with nine people detained in Hardwick in September and another seven detained after a targeted raid at a gas station in Jeffersonville earlier this month.

Eight people were detained after an immigration police raid on a Franklin County dairy farm in April, and Jose Ignacio De La Cruz, an organizer with Migrant Justice, and his stepdaughter were detained after being pulled over on the road by the United States Border Patrol in Richford in June.

“We are here again, speaking up and demanding our rights, and there is a lot of risk to that,” the farmworker said. “We understand that, but if we were to let ourselves be conquered by our fear, that would be letting them win.”",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/farmworkers-protest-morrisville-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 20:59:16.457009

Bass joined Congressman Robert Garcia, Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and other Democratic members to hear testimony from local and community leaders for the public record. Garcia said it is important to document allegations of misconduct by federal agents when they happen.

For months, local officials have alleged that immigration enforcement tactics used during raids throughout Southern California are unlawful. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Public Counsel and other immigration and civil rights attorneys claimed that federal agents were violating the Constitution by arresting people solely based on their skin color, performing raids without warrants and denying legal counsel to detainees.

A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Public Counsel and other immigration and civil rights attorneys over the summer claimed that federal agents were violating the Constitution by arresting people solely based on their skin color, performing raids without warrants and denying legal counsel to detainees.

A lower court judge ruled to temporarily halt immigration raids in Southern California in July. In August, an appeals court ruled to largely keep the restrictions made by the lower court's ruling.

The Congressional field hearing featured several panels where leaders accused the Trump administration of sending masked men who have instilled fear in communities. Bass claimed that Angelenos are scared to leave their homes, which has a significant impact on the local economy. She explained that the Los Angeles economy cannot function without immigrant labor.

CBS LA has reached out to the White House for comment and is waiting for a response. Previously, President Trump claimed that mass deportations were necessary in Democrat-run cities because elected officials want to ""expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good-paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens.""

Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson called the immigration raids ""an erosion of trust"" and said local governments have like his have strengthened their resources and offered services like legal counsel to residents.

Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett accused President Trump of ""running the most openly racist immigration regime in modern American history.""

The committee also heard from U.S. citizen Andrea Velez, who claimed she was wrongfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on June 24. Velez said she was accused of interfering with ICE and taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center. She claimed that while she was held, she was denied access to make a phone call to family or contact a lawyer.

Velez said her case was ultimately dismissed due to lack of evidence but said she fears for her safety and the safety of others.

Garcia said the committee is not only focused on possible violations on LA but across the country.

The Guardian last week initially reported that the FBI monitored immigrant-rights activists by accessing a “courtwatch” Signal group, which organizes volunteers who observe public hearings at three federal immigration courts in NYC. A two-page “joint situational information report” from the FBI and the NYPD dated from Aug. 28, which The Guardian obtained, had quoted from the encrypted messaging app Signal and characterized the court watchers as “anarchist violent extremist actors.”

The CITY was first to confirm that the NYPD had been involved in the operation. Despite Signal being end-to-end encrypted, the FBI stated that it obtained the messages through a “sensitive source with excellent access,” implying that someone within the chat was sharing information.

In a statement to amNewYork, an NYPD spokesperson on Monday distanced itself from the joint report, saying it is not an NYPD document. The department said it relates to a broader counterterrorism investigation into a range of potential criminal activities, including weapons training, violence against law enforcement, property damage, and discussions about bomb-making.

The NYPD added that the report has been reviewed by an external civilian representative under a standing court order that created 10-member NYPD Handschu Committee in the wake of federal lawsuits alleged the department improperly investigated the Muslim community.

The committee, which includes nine NYPD officials and a civilian representative, oversees the opening, extension, and closure of investigations into political activity, including terrorism.

The civilian representative, currently attorney Muhammad Faridi, serves a five-year term and can report potential abuses to the NYPD commissioner and the federal judge overseeing the Handschu case.

Faridi, appointed by Mayor Adams in 2023, told The City Friday that he had reviewed NYPD records, saying it referred to one surveillance subject and concluded that the inquiry meets Handschu Committee guidelines.

When asked about the NYPD’s involvement while speaking at Monday’s announcement in Central Park for his transition team, Mamdani said it was “deeply troubling” and “that’s something that we’re going to look into.”

Speaking on the important role court observers have played in the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown, Mamdani recalled a conversation he had a with a Brooklyn pastor on the campaign trail who spoke of an immigrant they had accompanied to a hearing “and part of the reason that she was able to go home that day is because of the court watchers who were there.”

He told reporters that the NYPD having any involvement in spying on court watchers is not something that will be part of his administration and “something that we follow up on.”

For months, amNewYork has been reporting on volunteer court observers who accompany immigrants to their required ICE check-in appointments on the fifth floor of 26 Federal Plaza, where they monitor and document what they believe are increasing detainments.

They say ICE is increasingly arresting individuals there, sometimes before they even reach their scheduled appointments, and have lately stressed that these moments happen out of sight of journalists and lawyers.

Responding to further questions about federal immigration enforcement, Mamdani said New York’s sanctuary laws already allow cooperation with federal authorities for a narrow list of serious crimes, but he criticized ICE for focusing enforcement on children and immigrants whose only offense is being present in the city.

“What I said to the president is that New York City sanctuary laws have a provision within them that allows the city to work with the federal government for a specific set of serious crimes, and that has been the law for decades here in New York City,” said Mamdani. “What’s giving so many New Yorkers, including myself, a deep amount of concern is that the focus of ICE’s immigration efforts has not been on those serious crimes. They have, in fact, been on children as young as six years old, being detained and deported. They have been on New Yorkers whose crime seems to just be being here in New York City.”

The mayor-elect added that his commitment to public safety is to keep all New Yorkers safe, and “that’s where we have a difference of opinion.”",https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/the-big-story-reuters.jpg?quality=51&w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-11-24 22:56:50.660189

Schwartz Federal Building and United States Courthouse.

Reps. Juan Vargas and Scott Peters, both D-San Diego, were refused entry on Oct. 20. On Oct. 27, they were joined by Sen. Alex Padilla, D-California, Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-San Diego, and Rep. Mike Levin, D-San Clemente, and were again turned away.

""As members of Congress, we have the right and the responsibility to enter detention sites in order to conduct oversight without prior authorization,"" Vargas said. ""Today, we were again blocked from entering. If nothing is wrong here, why are we not allowed in? What is ICE hiding? We came here to confirm that the law is being followed.

""After being denied entry again, I cannot say for certain that's the case. We will continue to push DHS for answers to what is going on here. We will not stand by while we continue to hear reports that people are being held in concerning conditions.""

Monday is supposed to be different. The Representatives said they now have permission to visit the facility following the conclusion of the longest federal shutdown in U.S. history.

The legislators sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting director of ICE Todd Lyons in October, laying out a pattern of ""ignored requests and stonewalling"" by DHS, raising concerns that the agency is blocking congressional oversight in violation of the law.

""Last week, we began to hear alarming reports of increased numbers of people being detained in the basement facilities of the federal building during routine immigration check-ins,"" the joint letter read. ""We have also heard reports that people were being detained in subpar conditions, without access to attorneys, medical care, or proper nutrition.

""Even though we identified ourselves as members of Congress who were conducting federal oversight, local ICE officials denied us entry and told us that we needed seven days' notice to schedule a site visit. After the visit, we again reached out to reiterate our request in writing for a tour of the facilities. In response, ICE sent an automated response indicating that the `ICE Office of Congressional Relations staff are currently out of the office and unable to respond to emails, phone calls, or perform other work-related duties' and that `incoming inquiries' would be reviewed only `(o)nce funding is restored.'""

ICE at the time told the legislators that only requests approved seven days in advance would be allowed to inspect its facilities -- a new policy put in place this summer by the DHS.

As a result, for at least 43 days during the shutdown, these detention centers had little to no Congressional oversight, leaving the condition of those detained unknown to the general public. The leaders hammer this point.

""As members of Congress, we have the right and responsibility to conduct governmental oversight of federal agencies,"" they wrote. ""These oversight responsibilities are especially important in situations, like here, where reports indicate that people's well-being may be at risk. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. This administration has routinely denied this right and created arbitrary barriers in an attempt to prevent Congressional oversight.""

Although permission has been granted, it may not be enough. In June, Reps. Judy Chu, D-Monterey Park, Gil Cisneros, D-Covina, and Derek Tran, D-Cypress, were turned away from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center despite being legally authorized to visit the San Bernardino County facility.

""For nearly a decade, I've visited Adelanto because of its notorious history of violating detainees' basic human and constitutional rights,"" Chu said after she was denied entry. ""Unfortunately, it appears that Adelanto's inhumane track record continues as we hear reports that detainees rounded up after Trump's ICE raids in Los Angeles are being denied their right to due process and that even U.S. citizens may have been detained. And yet, our attempts as Members of Congress to conduct oversight at Adelanto, which is expressly permitted by law, were unlawfully denied, blocking us from getting the truth about what's going on behind illegally closed doors.

(AP) — A federal judge in Florida wants civil rights attorneys and lawyers for the U.S. and for Florida to meet next month to hammer out a settlement in a lawsuit over whether detainees at an immigration center in the Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz” are getting adequate access to legal representatives.

During a Monday status hearing, U.S. District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell set a conference for Dec. 16-17 in her Fort Myers courtroom.

“I think we’re closer on a lot of issues than we were before,” Polster Chappell said. “And I would think that the parties can come to the table and reasonably come to some agreements that aren’t going to be overly burdensome on the defendants but also will allow the plaintiffs to have the rights that they deserve.”

Attorneys representing detainees at the facility are seeking a preliminary injunction to make it easier for their clients to meet and communicate with them. The detention center was built last summer at a remote airstrip in the Everglades by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Eunice Cho, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Monday that detainees’ attorneys must make an appointment to visit three days in advance, unlike at other detention facilities where lawyers can just show up during visiting hours. She pointed out that detainees often are transferred to other facilities after their attorneys have made an appointment to see them and that scheduling delays have been so lengthy that detainees are unable to meet with attorneys before key deadlines.

Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state, said most of the concerns initially raised by the detainees and their attorneys have been addressed and that previous delays were due to trying to construct a facility for thousands of detainees in a remote area with little infrastructure.

The lawsuit is one of three federal cases. In an environmental lawsuit, a federal appellate court panel in September allowed the center to continue operating by putting on hold a lower court’s preliminary injunction ordering it to wind down by the end of October.

A third lawsuit claims immigration is a federal issue and that Florida agencies and private contractors hired by the state have no authority to operate the facility.

President Donald Trump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. While the facility was built and operated by the state and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing Florida for $608 million.

For years, the US outpaced other countries in refugee admissions, allowing millions into the country since the Refugee Act of 1980.
The Trump administration knows this full well,” he said in a statement to CNN.
The agency has the authority to terminate refugee status, according to the administration memo, with no option to appeal the decision.","The Trump administration is moving to reinterview certain refugees who were admitted to the United States under former President Joe Biden as part of a comprehensive review of their cases, according to an internal memo and a source familiar with the plans.

The effort marks an unprecedented step in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — this time, targeting one of the world’s most vulnerable populations. Refugees must show that they were persecuted or face persecution in their home countries and undergo rigorous vetting prior to entering the United States in what is generally a yearslong process.

Trump officials have scrutinized the admissions program, which has historically had bipartisan support, and argued that the previous administration didn’t sufficiently vet the people who entered the US. Trump has largely halted refugee admissions, with the narrow exception of White South Africans.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services is expected to be charged with the review and reinterview process, according to the memo, dated November 21, citing an operational necessity to ensure refugees don’t pose a national security or public safety threat. Between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2025, around 235,000 refugees entered the US after going through the admissions process.

CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House for comment. The State Department referred CNN to DHS.

For years, the US outpaced other countries in refugee admissions, allowing millions into the country since the Refugee Act of 1980. But the program took a hit during Trump’s first term when he slashed the number of refugees allowed to come to the US, and during the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in a temporary suspension of resettlements. Biden tried to rebuild the program and eventually set an annual ceiling of 125,000 admissions.

“Just the threat of this is unspeakably cruel. … To threaten refugees with taking away their status would be re-traumatizing and a vicious misuse of taxpayer money,” said Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, a refugee resettlement organization, in a statement to CNN.

The president of Refugees International, Jeremy Konyndyk, echoed this, noting that “refugees who enter the US through the refugee admissions program are the most vetted and scrutinized of any migrants.”

“They pass intensive reviews of their refugee status, background checks, and security screenings. The Trump administration knows this full well,” he said in a statement to CNN.

“At a time when the Trump administration is trying to resettle White South Africans,” who he said don’t meet the criteria as refugees, “it’s very hard to see this as anything other than a pretext to revoke protections from those who actually need them.”

The anticipated interviews are intended to ensure that refugees met the criteria for admission when they were allowed in the country. The agency has the authority to terminate refugee status, according to the administration memo, with no option to appeal the decision.

The memo also orders a hold on pending applications for refugees to adjust their status in the US until the USCIS director determines otherwise. A year after refugees are admitted to the country, they are required under US law to apply for permanent status.

In remarks on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September, Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau argued that the current international asylum system and frameworks, including the Refugee Convention, are outdated and have been abused, making “mass illegal migration legal.”

“The asylum system has become a huge loophole in our migration laws, and we just have to be realistic about this,” Landau said at the US-led event, titled “Global Refugee Asylum System: What Went Wrong and How to Fix It.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2247321387-20251119021425881.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-24 18:57:04.478892

In a separate cable, the State Department also instructed embassies to begin collating its next annual human rights report, traditionally one of the most comprehensive studies of human rights abuses around the world.
It was also determined to address human rights concerns that have been ignored by the global human rights community “because they were politically incorrect, or they weren’t convenient to the prevailing narratives”.
Loading The senior policy adviser at the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour, Samuel Samson, graduated from university in 2021.
In May, he posted an essay on the department’s Substack shaming Europe for its “democratic backsliding”, facilitation of mass migration and descriptions of certain right-wing political parties as extremists.","Washington: The Trump administration will collect data on crimes and human rights abuses committed by migrants to Australia as part of its global drive to combat mass migration, which it describes as “an existential threat to Western civilisation”.

The intervention into domestic affairs goes beyond illegal immigration and seeks to caution Canberra that a significant intake of migrants, “particularly of a culture that’s radically different from Australia’s”, can lead to political and economic instability.

A senior State Department official said the administration had instructed diplomats at its embassy in Canberra to “begin collecting data and reporting on migrant-related crimes and human rights abuses facilitated by people of a migration background”.

Similar cables were sent last week to all US embassies in Europe, as well as Canada and New Zealand. The governments of these countries were not consulted beforehand, but the US embassies have been instructed to contact them and offer to “help”.

The senior State Department official, who spoke on condition of not being named, said the US government was concerned a large influx of migrants could strain markets, naming Australia’s housing crisis as an example.

“Beyond that, we want to caution the Australians,” he told this masthead. “We love the Australian people … We just want to warn our friends that if you import a rapid number of individuals of any background, particularly of a culture that’s radically different from Australia’s, without any sort of mechanism for diffusing the impact, that can lead to political unrest, that can lead to economic instability.”

The official said that while illegal immigration was “the elephant in the room”, the Trump administration was concerned about mass migration more broadly.

“You have to have some common sense about that,” he told this masthead. “You also have to understand the limitations ... and the security concerns that come with mass migration, and what happens when you import a substantial number of people into a very tight particular area.”

Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment overnight.

Australia admits 185,000 permanent migrants a year, mostly skilled workers. Net overseas migration, which includes temporary workers, international students and visitors, is falling rapidly from a post-COVID high of 538,000 in 2022-23. It has now dropped to about 316,000, lower than forecasted.

But Opposition Leader Sussan Ley has pledged to unveil a policy that would further cut the intake, amid a hot-button debate over immigration and population.

In a separate cable, the State Department also instructed embassies to begin collating its next annual human rights report, traditionally one of the most comprehensive studies of human rights abuses around the world.

The Trump administration is changing the focus of the report to scrutinise countries’ enforcement of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, as well as government funding for abortion services and gender transition surgery for children.

The senior State Department official, on a briefing call to news media, said the administration was not afraid to call out its allies “just as much as we’re willing to call out our enemies”.

It was also determined to address human rights concerns that have been ignored by the global human rights community “because they were politically incorrect, or they weren’t convenient to the prevailing narratives”.

The official said the fact that the project was being overseen by the department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour underscored how seriously the administration was taking the issue.

The latest intervention continues a global project articulated by Vice President JD Vance when he spoke at the Munich Security Conference in February, warning European leaders their voters were rebelling against “out-of-control migration”, and that politicians ignored the will of the people at their peril.

President Donald Trump dramatically pressed the case when he told the United Nations in September that “the globalist migration agenda”, along with environmental and economic policies to combat climate change, were destroying Western societies. “Your countries are going to hell,” he said.

College of International Studies professor Joshua Landis wrote in a Monday post on the social platform X that Vahid Abedini, an Iranian Studies professor, was boarding a flight on his way to attend the Middle East Studies Association in Washington, D.C. Abedini was then detained and placed in jail, according to Landis.

Landis wrote in the post that Abedini has an H-1B visa, which is given to immigrants who are temporarily employed in specialty occupations or services of exceptional merit and abilities, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Landis wrote that this designation includes higher education faculty.

According to Abedini’s OU profile, he earned his doctorate in political science from Florida International University. Before joining OU, he served as a visiting assistant professor in the department of political science at the University of Arkansas.

Abedini teaches courses on elite politics, development, technology and foreign policy, focusing on the Middle East and Iran, according to his OU profile. According to OU’s course catalog, he is teaching two classes this fall: The Global Politics of Oil and Political Economy of Development. He’s listed to teach one course, Elite Politics in Iran, in spring 2026.

“We are praying for his swift release,” Landis wrote.

Landis told OU Daily in a phone call Monday afternoon Abedini is currently being detained in Oklahoma. Since his arrest, Abedini has been in contact with his ex-wife and another OU professor, Landis said.

Landis said Abedini is working with a lawyer to resolve the situation, but Landis is unsure how soon he will get a court date.

“We’re waiting for him to get in front of a court. We were hoping (it) would be today, but of course, the lawyers say, ‘Oh, that’ll never happen,’” Landis said. “Because it evidently just takes forever to get a court hearing, so you just languish in jail.”

Landis, who also serves as the co-director of the Center for Middle East Studies and the director of the Farzaneh Family Center for Iranian and Persian Gulf Studies, said he helped Abedini with his legal documentation, and believes Abedini has followed all necessary steps to lawfully stay in the country.

“This guy is illegally detained. He's following all the laws. The university has been following the laws. He's been impeccable about doing everything and signing papers, and I was deeply involved in that process,” Landis said. “The university has been extremely diligent in doing its duty.”

Landis said he received an email instructing him to direct all inquiries about Abedini’s detainment to OU Marketing and Communications. OU Marketing and Communications wrote in an email to OU Daily Monday afternoon that it did not have a comment on Abedini’s detainment.

A spokesperson from ICE wrote in an email to OU Daily that it would look into the arrest.

Background

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, he has been vocal about his goal to increase immigration enforcement and border security, including the mass deportation of immigrants lacking permanent legal status.

In July, Congress passed a bill allocating about $170 billion for Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda, including $45 billion for detention centers, $30 billion for additional personnel and maintenance, and $46.5 billion for the southern border wall.

The Department of Homeland Security announced in a press release Oct. 27 that more than 527,000 “illegal aliens” have been deported from the U.S. under the Trump administration. According to the release, roughly 1.6 million others had “voluntarily self-deported.”

KOCO reported in September that deportations in Oklahoma have increased by 70%, from 1,000 deportations filed from January to March to 1,700 in the second quarter of the year. KOSU reported in October that, as of July 28, 1,994 people have been arrested and booked into one of 88 different local detention centers across Oklahoma, and flagged either for or by ICE.

In April, the Trump administration revoked visas of international students across the country. Schools that reported having students with a terminated legal status include Harvard University, Stanford University, the University of Michigan, the University of California at Los Angeles and Ohio State University.

On April 8, The O’Colly, the student newspaper at Oklahoma State University, reported that eight OSU students had their immigration records terminated by the U.S. government. The University of Central Oklahoma confirmed to KOCO on April 8 that four students had their visas revoked.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/oudaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/2f/22f9ca06-9ed3-4df2-8f3d-08a5464d017f/6924d28708c4d.preview.jpg?crop=700%2C368%2C0%2C49,N,,2025-11-24 17:57:59.801528

“ICE agents wrongfully detained a high school intern outside the Superior Court – an outrageous and indefensible act that could have completely upended a young person’s life,” McKee said.
A court staffer familiar with the situation told CNN that the situation began inside a courtroom, where ICE agents were taking photos of the high schooler.
Before the judge could leave with the student, ICE agents surrounded his car.
Their tactics have become so commonplace that protesters were already demonstrating outside the courthouse before ICE detained the teen.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have infuriated Rhode Island’s governor, a senator, and its state Supreme Court chief justice after officers detained a high school statehouse intern on suspicion that they were an illegal immigrant.

Recordings of the incident show ICE agents detaining the teen, who was traveling from the statehouse to his school as part of an internship at the Rhode Island Superior Court. The teen was being driven to school by a judge when ICE agents intercepted them.

Governor Dan McKee called the incident ""indefensible"" in a statement.

“ICE agents wrongfully detained a high school intern outside the Superior Court – an outrageous and indefensible act that could have completely upended a young person’s life,” McKee said.

A court staffer familiar with the situation told CNN that the situation began inside a courtroom, where ICE agents were taking photos of the high schooler.

Security reportedly asked the individual to stop taking photos of people inside the courtroom, which is when the individual identified themselves as an ICE agent.

It's unclear why the ICE agent was taking photos.

The student was reportedly disturbed by the incident, prompting Superior Court Associate Justice Joseph McBurney to offer the student a ride back to his school.

Before the judge could leave with the student, ICE agents surrounded his car. The footage shows at least six agents descending upon the vehicle and asking the teen and the judge to exit.

Approximately 30 seconds later, a federal agent can be seen on the video restraining the intern's hands and escorting him away as protesters shout at the agents.

""He's a f***** kid,"" one protester can be heard yelling in the video.

McBurney explained to the agents that the teen is an intern at the court and that they had made a mistake, according to CNN, citing the staffer.

The intern was taken across the street and was later released after ICE verified his identity, according to the Rhode Island Judiciary.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security reportedly told CNN that its agents had been searching for a ""child predator"" and ""briefly questioned someone who resembled the target,"" but that that individual was never taken into custody or arrested.

ICE has been criticized for stalking around courthouses and schools looking for people to abduct. Their tactics have become so commonplace that protesters were already demonstrating outside the courthouse before ICE detained the teen.

Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul A. Suttell said the incident only proves the point of the protesters at the courthouse.

“This egregious incident underscores both the community’s and the Judiciary’s concerns about how ICE is conducting its operations in Rhode Island,” the judge said.

Democratic Senator Corey Booker, who represents New Jersey, denounced ICE in a social media post on Sunday.

“A teenager. A U.S. citizen. Detained by ICE at a courthouse. This isn’t law and order—this is intimidation. It doesn’t protect our communities; it undermines them. It violates the trust people need to safely access the justice system,” Booker wrote. “It wastes law-enforcement resources that should be focused on real dangers, not innocent kids. We must condemn this and demand accountability. America is better than this.”

McKee blamed the situation squarely on the Trump administration, which has empowered ICE to operate with a vague and almost unrestrained mandate in America's cities.

“This was not a harmless mistake. It was the direct result of callous and chaotic policies by the Trump Administration,” McKee said. “Moreover, ICE’s failure to exercise even a shred of due diligence is shameful and underscores just how broken and dangerous these federal policies are.”",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/07/21/EEUU-NI%C3%91OS_MIGRANTES_04282.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-11-24 18:57:14.446565

She described using her work bag as a shield, as an ICE officer slammed her into the sidewalk.
“They didn’t believe I was a U.S. citizen or bother to check my ID,” Velez said.
“No citizen should have to carry a passport in their own country to prove that they’re an American.”","There was the U.S. citizen who said she no longer feels safe after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer slammed her to the ground in downtown Los Angeles and later accused her of assault — a case prosecutors dismissed soon after.

The Long Beach mayor, who said immigration agents have seized more than 50 residents off the city’s streets — including 11 in a single afternoon Thursday, among them a gardener tackled inside Polly’s Pies restaurant.

A Boyle Heights pastor who told of a mother who lost her young daughter after a failed organ transplant and was paralyzed over whether to cremate her or bury her, as she wanted, because she feared being deported and unable to visit her child’s grave.

During a congressional oversight hearing Monday in L.A., more than a dozen elected officials, experts and community members laid bare the impact of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown. It was an exclusively Democrat event and no one spoke up in support of the raids.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach), announced last month that Congress was opening “a broad investigation” into arrests of U.S. citizens by ICE officers, as well as a separate probe into immigration raids overall.

“We want to establish a record, because when the political winds change, we want to hold those accountable,” Bass said ahead of the hearing. “We want transparency and accountability for all of the egregious unconstitutional acts that are taking place. The raids might be off the nightly news, but they continue every single day, and we don’t ever want anyone to forget that.”

U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas described the current situation as “an American nightmare.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

For months, agents have roamed the streets of L.A., toting guns and chasing down undocumented immigrants. The scenes that have played out here — protesters being arrested, immigrants dragged out of their cars — have been repeated in Chicago, Charlotte, N.C., and other cities with largely Democratic leadership.

As of last month, federal authorities had arrested more than 7,100 undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles area since June 6, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Among those who provided testimony was Andrea Velez, a U.S. citizen who was on her way to work in June when masked men came running toward her. She described using her work bag as a shield, as an ICE officer slammed her into the sidewalk.

“They didn’t believe I was a U.S. citizen or bother to check my ID,” Velez said.

Prosecutors initially charged Velez with assault on a federal officer, alleging that Velez, who is 4 feet 11 inches, stood in the path of an ICE officer with her arms extended, striking his head and chest when they collided. Soon after, prosecutors dismissed the case.

Velez told committee members that she now carries her passport with her.

“I think it is shameful that this administration makes citizens feel like they have to carry a passport in their own country,” Rep. Mark Takano (D-Riverside) said. “No citizen should have to carry a passport in their own country to prove that they’re an American.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6cb2493/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5542x2910+0+393/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F16%2Fb3%2F2c7223e24b9bb5eaedf190100075%2F1531307-me-robert-garcia-profile-009-eat.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 17:57:54.504360

Recent media reports indicate that the Trump administration is turning that purpose on its head by mandating reporting in support of ideological priorities at odds with governments’ human rights obligations.

The 2024 version of the State Department report issued by the Trump administration in August already removed or significantly reduced sections on political freedoms, corruption, gender-based violence, and LGBTQ+ persecution. New guidance sent in November to US embassy personnel worldwide looks set to do even more damage.

According to the Washington Post, embassies will be instructed to document whether governments are implementing various policies the Trump administration opposes as though they were human rights violations. In reality, though, many of these targeted policies are important efforts to support and improve respect for human rights. These include government policies to improve access to abortion services and gender-affirming care, as well as efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.

These changes would translate parts of the administration’s rights-abusing domestic policy agenda into US foreign policy.

This isn’t just about political slogans or ideological debates. US diplomatic pressure around these issues can influence whether people can exercise their rights, access essential services, and live with dignity. In many countries, restrictions on reproductive health care violate the rights of women and girls, while others on evidence-based gender-affirming careviolate the rights of transgender people, and attacks on inclusivity policies undermine the rights of marginalized people.

As the US government turns against key facets of international human rights protection, other governments should step forward.

On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a draft notice in the Federal Register, to be formally published the following day, revealing the change.

It credited Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem with making the determination to end the programme.

“After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Burma [Myanmar] no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation for Temporary Protected Status,” the document said.

“The Secretary, therefore, is terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation of Burma as required by statute.”

Some 3,969 citizens of Myanmar currently enjoy Temporary Protected Status, a legal immigration pathway for foreign nationals whose home country is unsafe to return to.

The status grants successful applicants already in the US the ability to legally stay and work in the country. Another 236 applications from Myanmar were pending as of November 10.

But the administration of President Donald Trump has sought to reduce immigration into the US.

It has therefore attempted to rescind Temporary Protected Status for several groups, including citizens of Haiti, Afghanistan, Venezuela and other countries facing instability.

Just last Friday, Trump posted on his platform Truth Social that he was “hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota”, accusing gangs of Somali nationals of “terrorizing” the state.

“Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER,” Trump wrote.

Legal experts, however, question whether a president can revoke Temporary Protected Status from a specific group in a specific state. Some have accused Trump of attempting to intimidate immigrants, in order to force them to leave the country.

Under Trump, the federal government has also restricted its cap on refugee admissions to 7,500, a historic low.

In addition, the Trump administration has sought to strip hundreds of thousands of immigrants of another temporary protection called “humanitarian parole”. That programme allows immigrants to come into the country on a short-term basis due to emergency situations or humanitarian concerns.

Several of those efforts face ongoing legal challenges. So far, however, the Supreme Court has largely sided with the Trump administration.

In an unsigned May 30 decision, for instance, a majority on the high court lifted a lower court’s ruling that had barred the Department of Homeland Security from ending humanitarian parole for nearly 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians.

Two left-leaning justices — Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor — issued a dissent, warning that removing the pause would cause great harm to US immigrants while the legal challenge proceeds.

The decision, Brown Jackson wrote, “undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending”.

Unrest in Myanmar

In the case of Myanmar, the Department of State has issued a level-four travel advisory — the highest tier — warning against transit through the country.

It cited the risk of “armed conflict, the potential for civil unrest, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, poor health infrastructure, land mines and unexploded ordnance, crime, and wrongful detentions”.

In February 2021, the military toppled the government of President Aung San Suu Kyi, and the country has grappled with civil war ever since, marking the latest chapter in a nearly eight decades of internal unrest.

The military leadership is locked in a fight with members of the exiled government as well as armed ethnic groups and civilian opposition groups.

It has led a campaign of heavy air strikes, some of which reportedly targeted schools and hospitals. Both rebels and soldiers have been accused of human rights abuses, including torture.

The United Nations estimates the long-running conflict has created nearly 1,585,298 asylum seekers and refugees as of October, with many seeking protection in nearby countries like Bangladesh and Malaysia.

Members of the persecuted Rohingya ethnic group have been rendered stateless amid the fighting.

Citizens from Myanmar were initially given Temporary Protected Status in the US under former President Joe Biden in May 2021.

The administration then extended the protection designation twice: once in September 2022 and again in May 2024. The latest 18-month extension was slated to expire on Tuesday, November 25.

The termination of the Temporary Protected Status will take effect 60 days after the Federal Register notice is officially published.

In its statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Secretary Noem had deemed conditions in the country sufficiently safe for its citizens to return.

“Burma [Myanmar] continues to face humanitarian challenges due in part to continued military operations against armed resistance and the need for humanitarian assistance,” the notice said.

“There have, however, been improvements in Burma’s governance and stability at the national and local levels.”

The notice added that allowing Myanmar citizens to stay ran “contrary to the U.S. national interest”.

In March, the Department of Homeland Security told Congress that 9,590 Myanmar citizens were eligible for the protection, but had yet to apply.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-10T120242Z_1428126799_RC2MTHAVH2B8_RTRMADP_3_MALAYSIA-MYANMAR-CAPSIZE-1764007647.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-24 15:56:22.862029

SEIU President Verrett Calls on Airline Charter CEOs to Stop Profiting from ICE Deportations

Letter to Airline CEOs Demands Companies Sever Contracts with ICE Air as Trump Administration Leads Campaign of Terror Against Immigrant Communities

NATIONWIDE — April Verrett, president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU), today called on four major charter airlines to end their contracts with ICE and stop profiting from the Trump administration’s cruel and inhumane immigration policies. In letters sent to the CEOs of Avelo Airlines, Global X, Eastern Airlines, and Omni Air International, Verrett denounced the companies’ role in separating immigrant families and demanded the airlines they run immediately sever contracts with ICE Air, the agency’s air transportation arm.

Across the country, families and communities are being torn apart as ICE conducts raids that target people based on their skin color, language, workplace or neighborhood. Masked agents have detained and deported thousands, often without due process. Most of these deportation flights are operated by the four charter airlines.

In the letter to the airline CEOs, Verrett writes, “Terrorizing essential workers, families and entire communities is antithetical to responsible business practices, and it is also bad for business and the U.S. economy. Whether from a moral, legal, or economic standpoint, the bottom line is: it’s time for businesses to sever contracts with ICE Air.”

The letter is part of SEIU’s “De-ICE These Flights” campaign to protect immigrant workers and defend the constitutional rights of all working people. Nearly 10,000 SEIU members and allies have already signed the campaign’s online petition demanding the four charter airlines end contracts for ICE deportation flights.

SEIU’s campaign aims to educate institutional investors holding a stake in these companies or their parent companies on the inherent financial risks of enabling deportations, which destabilize the U.S. economy by attacking an essential immigrant workforce. SEIU members and millions of working people are participants in retirement security plans that may be exposed to the risks to the economy posed by these practices.

Avelo Airlines, Global X, Eastern Airlines, and Omni Air International and other private corporations are making millions in profits from government contracts that enable Trump’s deportation economy. On ICE deportation flights, immigrants are often shackled and subjected to abuse, including being denied access to air conditioning, toilets and the ability to protect themselves during an emergency if restrained.

SEIU represents 2 million service and care workers across the economy, including at colleges and universities, airports, hospitals, and federal, state, and local government agencies. The “De-ICE These Flights” campaign builds off SEIU’s Solidarity Summer organizing earlier this year, which culminated in a Justice Journey in Louisiana that mobilized tens of thousands of workers, allies, and communities to defend immigrant communities and ensure all workers are treated with dignity and respect.

""We want to scrape ICE from our communities,"" said Palmira Figueroa, the communications director for the National Day Laborers Organizing Network.

The activists each purchased an ice scraper for just 17 cents at the store before getting back in line to return the item. The act clogged customer service lines, something they say is a political act urging Home Depot to keep federal agents out of their stores.

""We want to scrape ICE from our communities,"" said Palmira Figueroa, the communications director for the National Day Laborers Organizing Network. ""It's kind of symbolic, right, to use an ice scraper. Buy it and try to collapse their system for a moment, or for some time, with the group of people that are witnessing and are willing to stay, to stand up for the human rights of day laborers.""

For nearly an hour, the ""buy-in"" operation stalled the store from operating as usual. The protesters then marched through the aisles of Home Depot, which led management to close the store down. Figueroa said that demonstrators noticed the quick action the store took, despite not closing down for any immigration operations that had previously happened in their parking lots.

""Oh, you can actually shut a store, right? You can shut for this, but you cannot, you have not, shut them when an ICE raid and abuse is happening,"" she said.

CBS Los Angeles reached out to Home Depot officials for comment on the protest, but has not yet heard back. In previous requests for statements on immigration operations happening outside of their stores, Home Depot's communications team has repeatedly said that they do not cooperate with ICE agents and are not notified of operations before they happen.

""We want for Home Depot to condemn these ICE raids on their property,"" Figueroa said. ""We know they can do that. They should speak out, reject the use of its stores and their sites for fear and violence.""

Its actions include unlawful detention of individuals, kidnapping people off the streets, punishing those who opposed the government and a lack of accountability to the public. There is only one organization that fits within the definition of secret police in the United States: Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE.

The agency was officially founded in 2003 under the Department of Homeland Security. In the aftermath of 9/11, agencies dealing with customs and immigration were combined. The goal was to find a more efficient way to deal with issues related to immigration enforcement.

But in the years that followed, ICE became the mechanism of the right-wing agenda for immigration. The agency under the second Trump administration has received a $75 billion increase in funding for the next five years. Huge amounts of money have been funneled to weapons, detention centers and recruitment.

The goal of this administration with ICE, along with many of its policies, has been vengeance — especially towards the enemies of the state — dictated by either the personal or political enemies of the president. Even the political staffers within the administration, who often hold antisemitic and racist views, have their own vengeance against groups who are not “Heritage Americans.”

The first target was international students who took a stand against Israeli actions in the Israel-Hamas war. ICE acted by arresting student activists, like Mahmoud Khalil, and columnists, effectively making criticism of American foreign policy illegal for foreign nationals.

But the main target of this vengeance has been Hispanic communities throughout the country. These communities have been terrorized, with streets emptied and businesses losing customers. Fear has become the norm for many millions of Americans, with or without legal status.

This has caused U.S. citizens to disappear from their families for days without any information, taken by masked men in unmarked vehicles and kept in appalling detention centers. Conditions there involve beating, lack of medical care and overcrowding, which have resulted in the deadliest year in detentions.

Such actions are done within an agency that is shameless and lacks any public accountability. ICE agents’ faces are covered, and detention centers refuse entry to congresspeople, despite being required to by law. This secrecy has given agents the ability to act without consequence in their behavior against migrants and protestors alike.

Civil liberties and human rights don’t end with foreign nationals; rights are universal. Giving the government the ability to restrict unalienable rights for some people gives it the authority to restrict those rights for all of us.

ICE is no longer just an agency focused on enforcing immigration laws in the United States, but rather has become a tool of the White House to destabilize the nation. The actions of ICE, whether in Los Angeles or in Chicago, have disrupted the community and inflamed tensions.This is by design — the White House pushed narratives of chaos and rioting in blue states to send in the troops and to exercise power over the opposition.

It is the authoritarian playbook to promote chaos in the streets, using the internal instability as an excuse to restore order. ICE has been used as a tool in this playbook, whether in Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles or Chicago.

The treatment of ICE agents or protests against the organization has been characterized as unlawful or rioting. This has been done with the ill intention of giving the president an excuse to use the Insurrection Act, giving him the authority to deploy the military within the United States.

Institutions once shaped into a certain culture often become very difficult to change. To allow an organization where the rot of abuse and racism is at its core to remain would be the greatest act of malpractice.

It will be like the failure of the Russian government to abolish the KGB following the fall of communism, an intact security apparatus that was more than happy to help facilitate the rise and rule of Vladimir Putin.

Just like the last four years, the organization will hide in the background, and the rot will grow, only to come out in full force in the next authoritarian administration to enforce its power over enemies of the state. Given that the Republican Party is indulging more in far-right beliefs, there is a possibility that the next Republican administration will be even worse.

For any reasonable believer in liberal democracy, there is only one solution to this violation of human rights: the abolishment of ICE, but also the prosecution of individuals who knowingly violate those rights. An institution that abuses people and a workforce that takes full enjoyment in inflicting harm has passed the point of reform; instead, it is a cancer on the American political system. The only option left is to remove this cancer before it kills our democracy.

This all comes less than 24 hours after ICE allegedly picked up the pieces of an NYPD enforcement operation in the same area.
Cops had confiscated more than 25 bags of counterfeit trademark items being illegally peddled by vendors in the area.
“NYPD personnel immediately left the area and did not interact with federal agents in any manner,” an NYPD spokesperson said.","The NYPD returned to Canal Street on Sunday and arrested a street vendor, confiscating counterfeit items, one day after ICE crashed a similar enforcement operation 24 hours earlier.

Just the sight of cops was enough to trigger a frantic fear of ICE on Nov. 23, as vendors were spotted stuffing their faux wallets, bags, and sunglasses into white sheets before hightailing it at the sound of a siren or the sight of a suspicious vehicle.

Throughout the day, officers from the 5th Precinct ,and others who told amNewYork they were placed on the detail from other commands, patrolled the Chinatown area in an attempt to keep the sellers away. Some of the offices stood on foot posts and prevented the vendors from returning to the area; others scouted the street, pushing the open-air market further and further back.

ICE agents, however, were not seen during Sunday’s operation.

As the day wore on, vendors stood in defiance, continuing to hawk their wares despite the NYPD’s presence nearby. This caused several clashes, with some cops pushing their way and gathering the bundles of goods, stuffing them in the back of their police cruiser, leaving a mountain in the rear seat.

In another instance, one vendor took off running, leading to a horde of cops chasing him through the street until they managed to cuff him and place him under arrest.

“Why did you run?” one cop yelled.

His fellow vendors approached the flashing lights of squad cars and argued with authorities, telling them that he was just “scared.”.

According to several vendors amNewYork spoke with, who asked to remain unnamed, many of those attempting to make a living by selling the products are on edge due to ICE activity and the prevalence of far-right influencers filming them.

One vendor named social media star Nick Shirley as being particularly problematic

“He is not a good person; he should not be doing that and working with ICE,” one man said.

“That is not what journalists should do,” another said.

This all comes less than 24 hours after ICE allegedly picked up the pieces of an NYPD enforcement operation in the same area. According to ICE themselves, they conducted an operation on Nov. 22 to arrest one Abdou Tall. The agenc caled him “an illegal alien from Senegal” and said he had multiple arrests “relating to trafficking counterfeit merchandise.”

“Tall fled from law enforcement on foot for several blocks before he tripped and fell and then continued to actively resist arrest. Our officers followed their training and successfully arrested him,” the agency claimed.

The NYPD stated that its operation took place just before 11:10 a.m. on November 22, near the corner of Canal Street and Broadway. Cops had confiscated more than 25 bags of counterfeit trademark items being illegally peddled by vendors in the area.

At around noon on Saturday, police reported, federal agents came to the location. Their operation, the NYPD said, was unrelated to any department activity.

“NYPD personnel immediately left the area and did not interact with federal agents in any manner,” an NYPD spokesperson said.

On Monday the Department of Homeland Security said it was terminating the designation of Burma (Myanmar) for Temporary Protected Status relief.

The withdrawal of protection for Myanmar nationals comes two days after Trump also ended TPS protections for Somali immigrants in Minnesota.
This is what he does to change the subject.” Each time the Trump administration has moved to end TPS relief, it has run into significant legal challenges.","The Trump administration announced it will cancel temporary asylum for about 10,000 Myanmar nationals living in the US, despite the country being ruled by a military dictatorship that has a record of executing dissidents.

On Monday the Department of Homeland Security said it was terminating the designation of Burma (Myanmar) for Temporary Protected Status relief. It claimed that after reviewing conditions in Myanmar and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, “the secretary [Kristi Noem] determined that Burma no longer continues to meet the conditions” for TPS designation.

The order, set out in a post on the Federal Register, is expected to come in effect in 60 days.

The Trump administration has already withdrawn protected status for a number of other nationalities, including Afghanistan, Cameroon, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan and Venezuela, as part of sweeping changes to immigration policy.

The TPS program allows immigrants from designated countries to remain in the US for up to 18 months with eligibility for legal work authorization when conditions like armed conflict or health crises make a safe return untenable. TPS status is typically renewable.

The DHS order said: “In parallel with the national political process, armed ethnic groups have established local and ethnic administrations, which have made tangible gains in governance and public services, signaling broader improvements in Burma’s stability.”

Myanmar is ruled by a military dictatorship that has a long and continuing record of executing people it deems part of resistance or pro-democracy movements.

The country was originally designated for TPS in May 2021 under the Biden administration, “on the basis of extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevented nationals of Burma from returning to the country in safety”. In 2022, the designation was extended for another 18 months, and again in March 2024 until November this year.

Nearly 10,000 people from Myanmar have been made eligible for protections.

In June, the Trump administration said it was adding Myanmar to a travel ban aimed to stop immigration from nations that it deems to have a “large-scale presence of terrorists”. The travel ban also affects citizens from Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

The decision to end TPS status for Myanmar comes after a campaign to maintain the designation by the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI), along with dozens of relief and human rights organizations.

“The United States has a moral and legal obligation to protect those who cannot safely return to Myanmar,” said Eskinder Negash, the president of USCRI, in a statement. He said protected status for Myanmar was “not just compassionate – it’s essential”.

According to the Pew Research Center, an estimated 240,000 people in the US identified as Burmese in 2023, citing figures provided by census data.

The withdrawal of protection for Myanmar nationals comes two days after Trump also ended TPS protections for Somali immigrants in Minnesota. “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State,” he claimed, and accused state governor Tim Walz of overseeing a state that was a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.

Walz responded scathingly in a social media post: “It’s not surprising that the president has chosen to broadly target an entire community. This is what he does to change the subject.”

Each time the Trump administration has moved to end TPS relief, it has run into significant legal challenges. Earlier this month the American Civil Liberties Union warned that the administration had already placed more than 675,000 people at immediate risk of family separation, detention, and deportation. It group called the administration’s pattern of immigration actions “one of the most sweeping rollbacks of humanitarian protections in the program’s history”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef4c8315fb8354fc145ed8377996b15e129bc88/667_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9c8d54c5af20fc56bed8e79561006ad",N,,2025-11-24 14:57:43.240772

Congressman Krishnamoorthi underscored that the seriousness of the allegations requires a full accounting from DHS and immediate steps to restore confidence in ICE’s personnel-screening process.","WASHINGTON – Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) today sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem raising “serious concerns regarding recent reporting about lapses in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) hiring and vetting processes,” concerns made “even more urgent by the arrest of an ICE agent in Bloomington, Minnesota, during a multi-agency sting targeting individuals attempting to solicit a minor at the Mall of America.” In the letter, Congressman Krishnamoorthi wrote that although “public information about the individual’s background remains incomplete,” the nature of the allegations “heightens longstanding questions about ICE’s capacity to ensure that its personnel meet the agency’s own requirements.”

Quoting ICE’s own standards, Congressman Krishnamoorthi noted that “personnel vetting involves assessing an individual’s background, character, and other pertinent factors to ascertain their suitability” and that “all positions require security vetting and drug test,” with law enforcement vetting taking an average of three months to complete. Yet, “multiple recent investigations have revealed that ICE has permitted recruits to appear for training… before all required vetting steps were finished.”

The congressman also cited reports that instructors have discovered “disqualifying information only after recruits had already begun training,” including issues that “should have prevented their entry into the academy.” Additional independent reporting suggests that ICE’s accelerated hiring strategy could lead to “catastrophic” outcomes if vetting lapses continue unaddressed. Congressman Krishnamoorthi noted the “findings raise fundamental questions about the consistency of ICE’s practices with its own publicly posted protocols, and whether systemic weaknesses, procedural shortcuts, or oversight gaps are undermining the integrity of the personnel-screening process.”

Congressman Krishnamoorthi requested a detailed response from Secretary Noem by December 10 to oversight concerns in five key areas:

The vetting steps completed for the Bloomington employee and whether required procedures were followed.

ICE’s criteria for allowing recruits to enter training when portions of vetting remain unfinished.

The Associated Press has published the results of a wide-ranging investigation showing that the U.S. Border Patrol has built a nationwide dragnet driver-surveillance system that it uses to target people it thinks are “suspicious.” The Border Patrol, which most Americans probably just think, as its name says, patrols the border, has long been a lawless, rogue agency. Now it appears to have become an ugly new nationwide intelligence agency and police force that targets innocent people using techniques that should be unacceptable in a free society.

Congress needs to act rapidly to rein in this program, as do state and local governments that are allowing some of these federal agencies to put plate readers on their highways and their law enforcement officers to participate directly and through data sharing arrangements.

Here’s how it works:

Collect data on Americans’ movements. The U.S. Border Patrol (which is part of Customs and Border Protection [CBP], which is part of DHS) has secretively built a system of automated license plate readers (ALPR) across the nation that carries out dragnet surveillance of millions of Americans’ movements

Identify “suspicious” movement patterns. Border Patrol “intelligence” operatives monitor this data for movements they deem suspicious. We know little about what they consider suspicious, or what kinds of AI algorithms they are using to do so.

Find an excuse to pull them over. Local police, acting at the behest of the feds, then pull over the targeted driver using what is known as a “pretext stop,” in which officers use real or claimed minor traffic violations as an excuse to pull over a driver whom they really want to target for other reasons.

Interrogate, search, and seize. Once the person has been stopped due to some supposed legal violation, they are aggressively questioned, according to the AP, and often searched and subject to having their property seized without proof of wrongdoing in a manner tantamount to theft.

Not only is the Border Patrol engaging in a mass-surveillance domestic intelligence operation, but it’s about to receive billions more with which to build this system as the Trump Administration and Congress funnel money into anti-immigration efforts.

This system is rife with problems

The Border Patrol’s surveillance infrastructure is made up of its own plate readers strung across highways from the southern border to such faraway places as Illinois and Michigan. We don’t know the full extent of their placement. It also accesses a similar nationwide network of plate readers run by the DEA, and has been authorized to access systems operated by private companies. Immigration agencies’ access to data collected by the ALPR company Flock has sparked widespread controversy, and the company, which is feeling the heat, says it no longer has a formal relationship with any DHS agencies. But there are other companies in this space that engage in mass driver surveillance, including Motorola (operating as Vigilant) and Rekor. Neither company responded to a request for comment by AP. We know that at least ICE has direct access to the Vigilant database, and they and other immigration agencies may also have contracts with Rekor.

We know little about how the government singles people out for stops. We do know that private companies advertise the ability to not only collect data on Americans’ comings and goings, but also to use AI to flag some people with supposedly suspicious travel patterns. I recently wrote about how the company Flock has been doing this; both Vigilant and Rekor also boast that they do the same.

A former CBP official told the AP that the agency develops “patterns of life” about people to try to detect when they deviate from their normal daily routine in suspicious ways. This is a term for an activity that stretches back to the use of aerial mass surveillance during the Iraq war, when searches for patterns of life were used to try to locate Iraqi resistance fighters planting roadside bombs. Of unclear effectiveness and impossible to carry out at scale without watching everyone all the time, pattern-of-life surveillance has clearly now been brought home. (In 2021, an attempt by Baltimore police to deploy mass aerial surveillance akin to that used in Iraq was struck down by the courts).) Logs of nationwide Flock plate searches obtained by the ACLU of Massachusetts show that “pattern of life” has been listed regularly as the purpose of a search by police agencies across the country.

Once a target is identified, the AP reports, officers use such alleged violations as speeding (even slightly over the limit), failure to signal, window tinting, or a dangling air freshener supposedly blocking the driver’s view. “The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” declared a sheriff’s deputy in that state. (There’s no reason to think that Texas is an outlier among states when it comes to traffic law complexity.)

Law enforcement can’t search a person’s car under the Constitution without either permission or probable cause on the officer’s part to believe that the car contains evidence of a crime, but in reality intimidated drivers often give such permission, or officers use bogus dog sniffs to obtain probable cause. The AP also reported that the authorities “often” used the American policing profession’s corrupt and abusive practice of civil asset forfeiture, in which police seize cash and vehicles without proof of wrongdoing. That forces drivers to engage in expensive legal battles to regain their property; often they’re never able.

A secretive system hidden from Americans

Do Americans want their government engaging in this kind of activity? That’s doubtful, but they haven’t even been able to make a judgment because these agencies have been keeping it largely secret. According to the AP,

The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.

This stratagem is known as evidence laundering or “parallel construction.” It was so-named by the DEA, which used it to hide leads that it was obtaining from NSA surveillance that was carried out without a warrant, under the justification that it was purely for national security purposes rather than for criminal law enforcement. “It's just like laundering money — you work it backwards to make it clean,” a former agent told Reuters of the DEA program.

The signs appeared in late October across the Southwest Side, which was heavily targeted under President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation effort dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz” that began in early September.

Sarita Hernandez and Selva Zafiro, co-founders of Marimacha Monarca Press in McKinley Park, were working at a community art event when members of the Southwest Rapid Response team — part of the immigrant coalition — approached them with an idea.

The response team sought the art collective’s help to ensure the gravity of the unprecedented surge in immigration arrests isn’t forgotten.

The signs intentionally resemble the temporary no parking or tow zone signs familiar to Chicagoans.

“It serves as a made-you-look kind of intervention, but then what it actually is doing is documenting something that permanently has impacted many of our communities, has permanently changed people’s lives, has permanently ripped apart families,” Hernandez said.

Marimacha Monarca Press has printed at least 100 signs and plans to keep printing more until rapid response teams no longer request them.

Dozens of signs have been placed throughout Archer Heights, Back of the Yards and Brighton Park, said Karina Martinez with the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, which is part of Southwest Rapid Response.

Other artists have caught on to the effort and designed similar signs that have appeared in some North and Northwest Side neighborhoods. Those signs are headed with a Chicago flag and the word “Emergency” and below read “ICE abducted someone here,” along with a date and time, and the same phone number.

The feds have scaled back “Operation Midway Blitz,” which brought about 250 immigration agents to Chicago. U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and 150 agents left town this month after eight weeks of chaotic arrests that led to agents routinely using tear gas and pepper balls against protesters.

The Department of Homeland Security has not released a full account of how many people were detained during its increased activity between early September and mid-November. A DHS spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A lawyer for the National Immigrant Justice Center has said more than 3,000 people were arrested. The exact number of people who have been released, deported or remain in custody is unclear.

A Chicago federal appeals court recently put a temporary hold on a judge’s order that would have released up to 615 people detained by immigration authorities this year. Those detainees come from a list of about 1,800 people arrested by ICE in the Chicago area between June 11 and Oct. 7, according to Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center.

Despite the feds’ curtailment, Martinez said there were still plenty the community is sorting through.

“This project was not necessarily to make people feel that there’s a danger in being outside but making sure that we’re making space to remember folks,” Martinez said.

“Let’s remember that there’s actual people who are impacted by these policies and these are families that are being impacted. This is someone’s dad, someone’s mom, someone’s child. And their presence being lacked in their community has an impact,” she said.

The signs appear similar to other remembrance sites throughout history, like the Stolpersteine stones across Europe that memorialize victims of the Holocaust at their last-known residence. The Chicago Race Riot of 1919 Commemoration Project has been installing brick-shaped glass memorials in sidewalks throughout Chicago where those killings a century ago occurred, as reported recently by the Sun-Times.

“That kind of public sign posting of injustice — that occurs to me as a parallel in Germany to what these people who are putting up these signs are trying to get people to notice,” said Peter Hayes, a history professor at Northwestern University who studies Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.

Martinez, with the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, says the endeavor to tag spots where ICE has taken people was inspired by similar efforts in other cities, including Portland and Washington, D.C.

They started posting them around Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead.

“I think it was very intentional for us to take up space and bring awareness to people who have been taken and recognize that families are missing their loved ones,” Martinez said. “Maybe not in similar ways in that they have passed, but they are no longer together with their family.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6b1fc9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x585+0+49/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F58%2Fa7%2F2c9c42434e91a494c06691a0490c%2Ficesigns-112025-05.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 12:57:18.724677

“This government got elected promising to reject Trump-style politics, but Bill C-12 is the opposite of that.","OTTAWA – A broad coalition of groups from across Canada is sounding an urgent alarm in advance of a critical parliamentary vote on Bill C-12.

The bill would open the door to discrimination and violations of human rights and due process in Canada’s immigration system, authorize sharing of sensitive personal immigration information, and expand dangerous approaches to drug policy. Yet it is being pushed through parliament with minimal debate while those that will be impacted by its sweeping changes are locked out of the process.

“This deeply concerning and highly controversial legislation will put many refugees in danger, risking their return to persecution in violation of rights protected under the Charter and international law,” said Gauri Sreenivasan, Co-Executive Director of the Canadian Council of Refugees. “And yet the bill is moving at break neck speed through Parliament while those with expertise and lived experience who want to advise on its dangers are shut out of the process. Neither the law nor the public interest is being served.”

The bill will deny many refugees access to fair and independent assessment and full appeal of their claims by the Immigration and Refugee Board because of arbitrary time limits and exclusions. This approach will not streamline Canada’s processing of refugee claims, but will lead to lower quality decisions while shifting backlogs to our already overburdened Federal Courts and to IRCC.

The bill will also compound harm arising from the Canada-US Safe Third Country Agreement, which abandons many refugees to the U.S. immigration system at a time when well documented human rights violations have become the dominant feature of that system.

”Bill C-12 would deny protection to vulnerable people irrespective of changes to their personal circumstances or political conditions back home. So many people like me, who sought safety here and have made lives here, would be shut out by this Bill. This isn’t just policy, it’s people’s lives,” said Tonny Muzira, Co-Founder & Director of Advocacy and Partnerships Centre for Black Development Options Canada. “Canada cannot turn its back on those seeking safety.”

Under Bill C-12, the government will also be able to cancel or suspend immigration documents and applications based on an undefined assessment of the “public interest”. This power grants dangerous discretionary power to the government without any individualized assessment or procedural safeguards.

“The bill sets up open-ended powers with little thought to the consequences and inevitable abuse”, said Louis-Philippe Jannard, of the Table de concertation des organismes au service des personnes réfugiées et immigrantes (TCRI). “We haven’t seen such broad, discretionary powers in our immigration system since the 1970’s, when their abuse led to rampant discrimination and fatal decisions.”

Bill C-12 would also authorize the government to share highly sensitive immigration information with few limitations. This includes changes in gender identity and the status of any refugee claimants, exposing vulnerable people in Canada to severe risk.

“Broad dissemination of sensitive personal information can place migrants and refugees at significant risk of discrimination and persecution in Canada and abroad”, said Tamir Israel, Director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s Privacy, Surveillance and Technology Program. “Despite this significant potential for abuse, Bill C-12 lacks minimum safeguards like the need to ensure information sharing is necessary and proportionate.”

Bill C-12 also doubles down on prohibition-based drug policy that has demonstrably failed to protect public health and safety.

“Instead of funding affordable housing and other health and social supports, Canada is supporting U.S.-led militarized drug enforcement,” said Nick Boyce, from the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition. “If Canada follows this path, it will be complicit in violations of international human rights law.”

In disregard of the dire risks posed by this legislative proposal, the bill has been fast-tracked and received minimal consideration in Parliament. It is scheduled for a final vote by the Standing Committee on Public Safety tomorrow—just three weeks after its study of the bill began.

Despite the highly attenuated timeline, dozens of refugee and migrant groups, human rights groups, labour organizations, health advocacy groups, representatives of the Black community, gender based violence groups, legal professional bodies, drug policy groups and others requested to speak at committee hearings but were denied. They have also submitted briefs expressing concern regarding Bill C-12’s consequences.

These groups were largely absent from committee proceedings and MPs will not have the time to consider the long list of concerns raised by these submissions. In contrast, MPs heard repeatedly from border and policing agencies and officials. The end result is that the voices of those most impacted by Bill C-12 have not been heard.

“MPs and the public should be extremely concerned that the government is fast-tracking legislation that will only multiply the possibility of discrimination, exploitation, and violations of human rights,” said Karen Cocq of the Migrant Rights Network. “This government got elected promising to reject Trump-style politics, but Bill C-12 is the opposite of that. This bill cannot be fixed, it must be withdrawn.”",https://ccla.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/travelers-stand-in-line-at-customs-and-immigration-ST7UX75.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:57:18.301535

On Friday, Hoyle joined both of Oregon’s U.S. senators in sending a letter to the Coast Guard demanding answers.","On Nov. 12, a spot in Newport’s city council chambers was the hottest ticket in town.

An emergency meeting was set for 6 p.m. and the small chamber quickly swelled to capacity, packed with Newport residents waiting to hear how the council would react to what many saw as a dire threat.

“We’re going to do everything we can to fight this,” Mayor Jan Kaplan told his audience, to wild applause. “That’s where we stand.”

Days earlier, rumors had begun to blow through Newport like a stiff sea breeze. By the time of the meeting, many in the small coastal city were convinced: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was looking to build an immigrant detention center in town.

Evidence seemed to be growing by the day.

To start with, the U.S. Coast Guard helicopter that for decades stood ready to rescue imperiled crabbers and fishermen had disappeared from the city-owned airport. On the brink of a dangerous Dungeness crab season, the closest rescue aircraft was now 100 miles away.

“That ocean can get up on its hind legs and it can smack you down,” one man, a Navy veteran, testified at the emergency meeting. “We need that helicopter here.”

All signs of what might be on deck to replace the helicopter pointed in one direction.

On Nov. 4, a federal defense contractor wrote the city, asking to lease 4 acres of land at the local airport – right next to the base where the helicopter had lived.

Then other contractors popped up. One began asking about the cost of trucking thousands of gallons of human waste away from the airport every day. Another posted want ads for ICE detention officers in Newport.

The conclusion was inescapable to many residents: ICE was coming, and those who’d gathered in City Hall wanted none of it.

Some in the crowd wept when a teenage girl explained how frightening and sad her life had become since September, when her father was detained by ICE and sent to a detention center in Tacoma, Wash.

“No one deserves to get picked up,” the girl said. “My dad was my everything.”

With its scenic bayfront, popular aquarium and sizable commercial fishing fleet, Newport is an emblem of the Oregon coast – and, with 10,000 residents, one of its largest cities. But weeks after the meeting, the city finds itself in a sort of limbo.

Facing down twin crises – one over the wellbeing of its crabbers, the other over the wellbeing of its immigrant community – it’s still not sure when, or if, immigration agents might arrive.

ICE, the Coast Guard, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have declined to provide details to local officials, members of Congress and the press. ICE may have backed off in the face of public blowback. Or it might be regrouping.

“Nobody within the administration, within DHS, has treated this city with a modicum of respect or courtesy,” Kaplan told OPB. “It’s like, ‘We’re going to perch on your doorstep, and you only know it because maybe there’s a rumor.’”

Taunette Dixon thought helicopter drama was behind her.

In 2014, the Coast Guard announced it intended to close its air base in Newport to save money. Dixon was one of those who fought back.

A nonprofit she volunteers with, Newport Fishermen’s Wives, sued to block the closure, alongside the city of Newport and Lincoln County. Congress wound up finding money to keep the base open.

In the years since, Dixon says the Coast Guard had been communicative and helpful. Any time the helicopter needed to travel away from Newport, for any reason, officials would call the Fishermen’s Wives to explain.

But suddenly, history was repeating itself.

“I had somebody call me and say, ‘I am pretty sure that the Coast Guard has removed itself from the air station,’” Dixon said in an interview with OPB last week. “I’m like, I can’t believe that’s true. We worked so hard to keep the helicopter here.”

The timing could hardly have been worse.

In the self-proclaimed “Dungeness crab capital of the world,” the beginning of December is something of an early Christmas, Dixon says.

Crabbing boats are preparing to start the season with a two-week sprint that will dictate whether or not they are successful.

“If it’s not good seas, then that’s a very unsafe position for boats to be in – especially the small boats,” said Dixon, who co-owns a boat with her husband. “Between the ocean, between the tides, between the environment, it doesn’t take long to lose your life.”

A sturdy pavilion perched above the Pacific Ocean illustrates what’s at stake. The Newport Fishermen’s Memorial Sanctuary is a pew-lined structure in a local state park, where houseless residents sometimes seek shelter.

At the building’s heart is a monument bearing the names and pictures of local fishermen who have died at sea. The Newport Fishermen’s Wives keep the vigil and assist families when it adds a name.

“Almost every year, I’m making phone calls to families because we have lost a boat and somebody hasn’t survived,” said Dixon, who is part of a generations-old fishing family that has lost loved ones in the Pacific Ocean. “If anybody had to meet these families, I think they would have a better idea of how crucial it is to have this rescue helicopter here.”

But the Coast Guard has refused to explain its decision.

Dixon says the agency has rebuffed her efforts to learn more about the helicopter.

U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle, a Democrat who represents Newport, says the same.

A hearing is about to start in Abrego Garcia's civil case. I'll try to cover for @lawfaremedia.org . Colleague @annabower.bsky.social might be joining. Among other things, govt is seeking to dissolve Judge Xinis's preliminary injunction preventing Abrego from being removed immediately. /1

We've been a little swamped here at @lawfaremedia.org so I'll do best I can. Little less prepared than usual. Judge Xinis wants to hear testimony from John Cantú, an ICE official, who said in a sealed declaration that Costa Rica now won't accept Abrego. Govt wants Cantu's testimony sealed. ... /2

Parts of this hearing could be quite technical. Govt argues that Abrego's claims at this point should be handled in the DVD class action in Massachusetts, or are barred by various ""jurisdiction-stripping"" statutes that bar district courts from getting involved. /3

Judge Xinis now on bench. counsel give appearances. Cantu is present. Xinis says this is probably last hearing on Abrego's habeas. First she wants to rule on some pending motions to seal. /4

She'll take open court testimony from Cantu followed by sealed testimony if necessary. Then she'll hear the motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction. She's now deciding whether certain exhibits should remained sealed. Andrew Rossman, for Abrego, is not fighting sealing. /5

Judge Xinis concerned that there's often over-sealing. Thinks some of these docs can be redacted. But some are diplomatic notes or documents Secy of State Rubio prepared, which she understands should be sealed. She's taking the matter under advisement. Wants attys to try to redact. /6

DOJ atty Jonathan Guynn points out some sealed info is about Abrego's personal background which he might want sealed. Xinis now says she'll unseal Cantu's declaration. She doesn't see any privileged info in it, though it may reference such info. DOJ atty Molina says govt's okay with unsealing. /7

So ECF 75-16 (Exhibit S) will become public, I think. Turning to testimony from John Cantu DOJ atty Guynn will do a quick direct and turn John Cantu over for cross-examination by Abrego's attys. John Edward Cantú Guynn: where are you employed? C: US ICE Enforcement & removal operations (ERO) /8

C: we've done that before. couldn't give you a date. maybe in past 6-7 months. R: prior to that in your decades of experience? C: cannot recall one /45

His testimony is done. no redirect. no sealed testimony. Judge Xinis is going to take a 15 minute break and then hear oral argument. /46

Now resuming. Xinis back on bench for argument. will start with Andrew Rossman for Abrego. Rossman: 3/12/25 Abrego taken into custody & removed to El salvador where prote cted by court order against being removed to. imprisoned. beaten. 5 orders & 3 months to get him returned. /47

Govt came in and told hyou they were powerless to bring him back. since that time we first came into this court, there's been unrelenting cmapaign to deprive him of due prodcess. to retaliate against him for asserting his c'l rights. make him poster child for broader agenda Adm has /48

I'm going to talk about treatment of Abrego & treatment of this court. history shows bad faith. shows malice— Judge: this course maybe relevant to Abrego I case, but i'd like you to focus on 5 counts are your principal ones & why & whether this court has jurisdiction to provide relief /49

Rossman: a\nd that's where i'm going. due process claims of habeas have 3 parts Judge says thing she's really focused on ... the absence of an order of removal. there is none in the docket. R: we've not seen one. we've seen order of withholding. the 2019 order proceeds as if there'd been one. /50

J: that argument in my view guides this case. guides the jurisdictional arguments. legality of wht govt did and what it's trying to do now. how do i say removal is reasonably foreseeable if there's no removal order? R: that's right. critically important. due process rights accorded to all /51

Rossman ... includes right to be heard before removal to a 3d country -- JGG, for instance -- in 2019 there was only one country govt sought to remove abrego to. withholding blocked that path. govt made no effort to remove him to 3d country. no opportunity to raise hand and designate another /52

R: ... everything has to start with final order of removal. not overly fastidious of us to insist on J: govt has quietly said it's the withholding of remov al order. they cite that opinion. that's only one ever given. makes oblique reference to removal to guatemala R: yes glitch in opinion /53

Judge: what do you say to argument: can't have withholding without an order of removal? R: that assumes to much. in convention against torture case we cite ... Riley case: (phonetic) wasn't sufficient to reference it, need to reference final order of removal /54

Judge: clear in 4th Circuit that one cannot substitute for other. but i think govt will say, you can't make that call cause you don't have j.d. Statutes that deprive you of j.d. to review final orders of removal--what's your response. Rossman: first level of response-- Mr. Jonathan Cooper /55

R: ... will address more particular questions but YH certainly has j.d. over due process violations. if you want to pivot immediately to jursidictional questions i can give you mr. cooper J: so much pivots on whether there's an order of removal. there's also ""parole."" /56

J: i think i've got to answer that first. if i have j.d. to take judicial notice of record, and there's no order of removal, than at a minimum Abrego is entitled to certain relief. R: that's right. entire structure govt has built crumbles if there's no final order of removal /57

R: most of our brief is about--even if they have one, there's legions of reasons there are violations of due process. i can unpack that or we can focus on jurisdiction. J: let's unpack that R: relief--we think relief should be granting petition. Abrego should be released. at minimum, /58

R: ... he should be provided conditional release. Give govt short period to show they have c'l valid basis to remove him. if they want to put him on next plane to costa rica, [fine with us.] J: govt saying costa rica saying no. i dont have any evidence of that, frankly. R: that's the problem /59

R: if govt fails to prove Costa Rica is off the table, our perspective we got a triple hearsay affidavit with zero evidentiary value. you ordered to produce a knowledgeable witness. he was a nice witness. but no knowledge. J:i thought govt's 1st level point was: your time to choose C.R. was ... /60

Judge: ... 6 years ago. now it's too late. Rossman: that would have to imagine that it's consistent with due process to reqwuire client who having rec'd withholding to one and only country govt sought to remove him -- imagine Abrego would have crystal ball that he'd be asked one day to go /61

... to Uganda, or Eswatini, or Ghana, or Liberia & then designate a country where he was willing to go. Judge: if you have that conversation in first instance, because there is no order of removal -- how can we hold abrego responsible for not designating country then R: i wholeheartedly agree /62

Rossman: ... without that order, you dont have effective functioning of the statute. Abrego's deprived of protections congress afforded him to make a designation. the language is ""shall"" not may. mandatory. only override: country unwilling. there's been a failure of evidence on that. /63

R: only other exception: prejudice to the US. clearly doesn't apply since govt went to Costa Rica and got assurances when they were trying to get him to plead. to complete the menu, govt takes position, pursuant to 3/31/25 memo, that can send him to Liberia so long as their own official ... /64

Rossman: finds no reasonable fear. there has to be review by an immigration judge -- that's bear minimum on procedural level in terms of due process. primary request: release. you could condition it on govt providing c'l valid basis of removal. J: i dont understand R: if govt does not do X ... /65

... 2 within 3 days -- like agreement to take him to Costa Rica -- then he will be released. give govt one last clear chance to do it right way. J: if i find no order of removal on docket-- R: he should be released. J: conditional -- should be given 3 days to get an order R: well, i don't know /66

R: ... about that. J: I remember Reuveni telling me on first day--'you're not gonna like it but' he didn't have a document called an order of removal. R: that hasn't changed. ... could give govt one last chance -- 3 days -- to do it right way. alternative minimum: injunction prohibiting ... /67

R: ... removal without according him immigration review process before he can be removed. they way i'm thinking of it. you dont need to reach the alternative minimum grounds if he's released. But Rossman wants to consult with co-counsel. Judge: if i grant relief, no basis to enjoin further /68

Judge: ... i dont see ongoing vitality to injunction if i accord the kind of relief you're talking about R: not sure that's right. Maldonado in DNJ. different issue. but court granted writ, released petitioner, but still enjoined govt from rearresting the person under the contested portion of /69

R: ... statute [Rossman now consulting with co-counsel Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg about this.] Sandoval-Moshenberg will address court directly. S-M: relatively common in Zadvydas petition for court to order release with no re-detention unless such-and-such. /70

Judge: thing i'm stuck on is to have such a fundamental absence in the record. different posture to be in. no order of removal. until govt comes up with one. what if they do get one. S-M: if no removal order, habeas should be immediate. immediate release. 7 months of litigating. no need for more /71

Judge: in Abrego I my order was to restore Abrego to status quo ante. return to MD and have his immigration case continue in MD. you moved to reopen and it got transferred outside my j.d. so after immediate release, & a notice to appear [materializes] ... /72

S-M: the existence or non-existence of order of removal is something you have j.d. to enter. when his valid parole expires, or they revoke it, he could receive a new notice to appear. The other option govt has, if willing to concede error--they could file motion to re-open. /73

Judge: what's going on with immigration case -- S-M: motion to reopen we filed seeking asylum, that was denied by immigration judge. we filed appeal to bureau of immigration appeals. it's not yet issued order. /74

Rossman: I'd just say, putting aside absence of order of removal, we think we've won overwhelmingly on the 1231b2 claim. that merits a grant of the petition. would not have qualms with giving govt 3 days to remove him to costa rica, which would [moot the issue]. /75

Rossman passes lectern to Jonathan Cooper to discuss jurisdiction and DVD Cooper: govt reads 8 uSC 1252 to create a jurisdictional black hole that [gives aliens no rights against being removed to 3d countries]. 2 bedrock principles. strong presumption in favor of judicial review of agency acts /76

other is presumption in favor of providing habeas jurisdiction. SCOTUS has rejected this notion in cases like Reno v -- Judge: but govt ssaying a lot of what you're asking for is substantive review. particular country. really not in this court. idea was to eliminate habeas & have those ... /76

Judge: ... be determined by Court of Appeals (reviewing BIA and immigration judge). Cooper: Abrego challenges process. congress has never withdrawn review for those kinds of claims. that's what scotus said in Reno v AADC and [other cases]. /77

Cooper: you asked Rossman, is there j.d. to decide if there's a removal order in the record. question in DVD class is that there must be an order of removal. for him to be in that class, govt must produce order of removal. /78

J: they'll say order of withholding assumes & subsumes order of removal C: [yes, but it's telling that 7 months after Reuveni told you about that absence, govt has still not come up with one.] [he cites an 8th Circuit case he says requires an actual order.] /79

Cooper: with respect to DVD, we submit that it does not foreclose Abrego's claims 1. no final order of removal on record 2. his claims are very different. he raises challenges to his detention. 3. procedural challenges to 3d country removal process, including unique challenges ... /80

Cooper: ... the failure to comply with his designation of costa rica. unique procedural challenges not covered lby DVD 4. even if he were a member of the class, 4th Cir has held that class actions are exception to ""splitting"" concept. Also think Abrego would have mandatory right to opt out /81

Cooper: ... of the class. J: and govt has argued that the DVD class is an improper class Cooper: [yes] we cite to Philips Petroleum case ... members of class involving monetary claims have due process right to opt out. should be true if you're being deprived of life & liberty as well. /82

Cooper now addressing 5 USC 1252g. (One of the jurisdiction stripping provisions.) it's narrow. applies only to discretionary decisions by AG in 3 limited situations. commencing proceedings, adjudicating cases, executing removal orders. /83

Abrego is challenging detention & processes for 3d country removal. [He cites rulings to effect that such issues not barred by 1252g] Next govt goes to 8 USC 1252a5 and b9--idea that these issues need to be funneled to US Court of Appeals (after immigration court & BIA). /84

Cooper makes similar argument as to those--challenges to detention or 3d country removal processes not covered. next govt talks about 1252a4 and FARRA section 2242d. those are similar. talk about challenges to immigration judge's resolution of Convention Against Torture claim. /85

Cooper: Abrego not challenging a CAT decision. Judge: ... he's not getting enough process to even tee that question up Cooper: exactly. last j.d. bar: 1252a2b, about denials of dlscretionary relief. nothing he's seeking here is discretionary. /86

Cooper: for all those reasons, none of j.d.'l bars apply here. Drew Ensign for govt: start with final order of removal piece. there is one. Judge: there's 3 aspects of that order. none says order removed to any country. doesn't say order removed. Ensign: not in so many words. /87

Ensign: it says application to asylum is denied. J: i am just interested in finding the order of removal. not here to fight on whethe IJ was right. this doc says denying asylum because of time it took Abrego to bring it. E: correct, but context of order is imoprtant. he conceded removability /88

J: point me to the language that is the order of removal. E: the withholding order necessarily would only exist bercause he otherwise had been determined removable. final order would hvae issued, and did by operation of law by rejecting his only defense--asylum. /89

J: there's ample law that says you can't just consider withholding a removal order by operation of law. judge wilkinson said it well. in opining on imporatnce of this question in [missed it] 943 f3d 205 : ... /90

Judge: when IJ grants withholding of removal, an explicit order of removal must be included in the decision. for 2 reasons. matter of simple logic. [she reads from Judge wilkinson's decision] Judge: jurisdiction begins with the order. why should i do it differently here? /91

E: [makes same argument as before] he's adjudicated all issues and by operation of law, by adjudicating abrego's only defense, this is a final order of removal. J: you're argument is not that the document says that. you're saying by operation i should construe it that way. E: [yes] /92

E: [E saying that the order in total context leads to that conclusion] ... Judge & Ensign now having back-and-forth I can't follow. J: This doesn't look anything like an order of removal. doesn't designate the country. does it? E: it does not. /93

J: it granted withholding to Guatemala. let's not gloss over that. people make mistakes. but notably in conclusion, said DHS hasn't shown changted circumstances in Guatemala. he got the country wrong. so how do i say what country he's been removed to. E: [there are ways to fix these mistakes.] /94

J: i'm just here to determine if i have j.d. All these sections you're citing depend on existence of removal order. E: i dont think that premise is correct for all of them. 1252g would not apply--does presuppose execution of order of removal. b /95

E: but a5 and b9 are different clauses that funnel everything thru a court of appeals. b9 does refer to final orders of removal but a5 does not. J: wait. you could say anything in the record is an order and if you say it's an order i'm barred from reviewing it? E: no ... /96

J: i'm not opining on sufficiency of an order. i'm taking notice of a court file and this thing is missing. if no order, on what authority can abrego be detained for imminent removal. removal is predicated on an order. under zadvydas--i have authority to review legality of prolonged detention /97

E: we agree a9 and b5 not bar to challenging prolonged detention. ... Zadvydas--those claims are reviewable. but those fails on the merits. [Zadvydas is idea that he's being subjected to prolonged detention without a reasonable likelihood of being removed.] /98

J: it doesn't seem to imminent or reasonable foreseeable that he'll be removed because no final order of removal. E: if no order of removal, zadvydas doesn't apply. J: principle remains. if a person ... if not 1231 it's nothing right now. you may proceed with new removal order with new plan. /99

J: but as of today ... if you're being held by govt for removal purposes and removal is not reasonably foreseeable, you're entitlted to release. E: i dont believe that's the state of the law. ... he cites scotus ruling in Jennings. J: only basis to hold abrego is 1231. without valid order /100

J: ... of removal ... E: several reactions YH. [she laughs] E: could issue new NTA [notice to appear] which would allow detentino under 1225 and 1226. could potentially detain him under original NTA. J: you may be right. lot of questions mooted out. /101

J: where we are now is only basis for holding him is 1231. (that's the provision about how you remove an alien to a third country if he has an order of removal and can't go to his home country.) /103

J: [curiosity you won't send him to costa rica] E: that is not an open door J: no basis to say that. we've had 4 applicant countries. every time the govt gives me factual predicate. this witness said nothing today. i just want underlying info. /104

J: do you know why costa rica is not on table? E: [he wasn't privy to any of the discussions] J: you're saying CR has rescinded the offer it made in record. it wasn't conditional. i'd love to see evidence. & rest assure this isn't empty word salad of an affidavit. /105

judge is pressing Ensign on why won't the govt just send him to costa rica. yhou want me to make finding CR is no longer on the table, but you won't show me the work. not for public consumption. record's going to be cflosed as of today. in terms of future proceedings where i issue an order /106

on what the witness should be prepared on. it's not followed. 3 times. i issue an order to provide a witness prepared to testify on an issue. it's not followed. this was the worst yet. he didnt know the meaning of rthe words in his affidavit. E: defendants believe this is not reviewable. /107

E: DHS Secy has power to say removal to CR is prejudicial to US and that's not subjecto to judicial review. J: i hear you. [we go back to jurisdictional issues]. E: turn back to 1252g. execution of removal orders is squarely within it. /108

J: and procedural challenges also barred? E: correct. they've also implied that these claims are not covered because it's not discretionary--that's been rejected by courts of appeals. 243 F3d at 214. /109

E: ... challenge that Liberia would torture or persecute him--only fears he raises in his brief. He's really concerned about being sent back to El Salvador. US has rec'd assurances that won't happen. J: Maybe IJ would agree with asylum officer. doesn't mean he doesn't get review. /110

J: speaking of foregone conclusion--how is it after abrego won, when i ordered him to be returned and restored to status quo ante, how is it when he is restored & detained in Baltimore & petitioners move to reopen, case is assigned to IJ with no ties to this j.d. E: i dont specifically know /111

J: you don't know? why sent to Atlanta. petitioner raises disturbing statistic. IJ has very high rate of denial for asylum claims. would mr. Molina know? E: dont know why it ended up there. happy to try to find out. J: if you start process over, where would it start? E: dont know. /112

E: dont know how DHS would handle. dont know of a parallel case. J: Is IJ that had it before still on bench? E: dont think so. J: and no Baltimore IJ available so it went to Atlanta? E: dont know. ... there's docket management. Molina: i don't know why. /113

Molina: it's something we can look. into. J: if it's out of the ordinary, that's a problem. my order was to restore him to status quo ante. M: new immigration judge uses baltimore heading ... J: would still be 4th Circuit case? /114

M: that's correct. ... govt's perspective is: when case is assigned to Baltimore, that's location of hearing even if IJ is in Hawaii. no venue change. still a baltimore immigration case. J: thank you for that /115

Ensign turns to due process. He is saying courts can't review diplomatic assurances. Munif categorically precludes courts as matter of law from second guessing executive's determination regarding torture and related matters are credible. /116

[Judge Xinis likes to talk things out. I'm running out of steam here. I'm only going to pipe in more periodically from here on out.] /117

[Ensign saying Liberia has given explicit assurances that no refoulement--that is, re-deportation--to El Salvador will occur, and courts can't review dept of state's assessment that those reassurances are credible.] /118

[Ensign now arguing that unlawful admission limits due process rights, even for those who have been inside this country for years. Accordingly, he's not due any more process than what's provided by statute. Can't relay on due process clause to create additional procedures.] /119

DOJ's Ensign now rebutting idea that jurisdictional bars create a ""judicial black hole."" Says 1252g is broad but it's not a black hole. it channels those claims to different courts--immigration judge to bureau of immigration appeals (BIA) to US Court of Appeals. /120

Ensign says govt reads SCOTUS's DVD ruling more broadly than they do. J: we can have long debate about the infirmities of how the class was defined. it's very broad. why isn't it possible SCOTUS stayed injunction just on breadth of class definition. can't read more into it. /121

Ensign is done. Judge: if i grant relief on Zadvydas, and adjudicate the petition, what assurance do I get that govt won't just remove him to 3d country? E: too many permutations to answer that question. /122

J: what if it's based on prolonged detention because there's no order of removal. E: strongly suspect, if court holds no final order of removal, govt would take the position that additional injunction not needed. we'd disagree that j.d. exists for that. /123

J: well maybe i'll table the motion to dissolve the petition. if i deny petition, i'll dissolve injunction. if i grant petition, i'll see. maybe i'll do petition and then turn to the motion to dissolve. E: makes sense. decide the habeas first. Rossman agrees to table the injunction issue. /124

Rossman: Ensign cited Kaplan case. 1925 case. Detainee stopped at ellis island. was minor. middle of the war. didn't send back to russia. held him in constructive custody of an orphanage. had never crossed theshold into US. /125

Zadvydas 60 years later says after person enters country things change. same in clark v martinez, 7-2, by Scalia. zadvydas applies to inadmissible immigrants. once they're here, no question at all they're entitled to full measure of due process. govt trying to transport us back /126

... to a [different] century. ... on issue of status of my client would have in liberia--critical that liberia has only said it would be temporary. has not agreed to give him travel docs to stay permanently. ""assurance' we hear is that Liberia would not send him directly to El Salvador. /127

R: but what happens after his temporary status ends. he wouldn't have travel docs. naturally he'd be sent to his home country--el salvador. R: i dont see how Abrego, left to his own devices in Liberia, could engineer exit to Costa Rica or anywhere else. /128

R: govt's brief was telling in its callousness. ... Govt focuses on whether he'll experience persecution in Liberia. what happens outside liberia is not issue, per govt. but what happens when temporary status ends? /129

Rossman: there's a reason why there's an extraordinarily small fraction of people sent to 3d countries before this year. wherever you send someone, unless they have status, at risk directly or indirectly to refoulement. all i am saying, abrego entitled to is review by IJ to a final conclusion. /130

J: if you're asking for my than IJ review burden gets heavier under [federal due process standard]. There are regulations in expedited removal--get review but it stops at the IJ. it's odd to me, seems irrational, he wouldn't get that, but why unconstitutional? /131

R: in weighing the 3 Mathews v. Eldridge factors, have to weigh burden of providing procedure. when weighed against fundamental liberty interests of abrego it seems quite modest. won't halt machinery of govt to give him appeals. /132

Rossman's last substantive point is on Costa Rica. we've had 3 hearings. before we got to courtroom we took 3 depositions. supposed to provide us with witnesses with knowledge. mr giles, schwartz, cantu. no evidence at all that costa rica is unwilling to take my client. /133

R: you've given the govt every chance. Judge: if no order of removal -- govt may issue a new order. that will allow you to timely designate costa rica as your 3d country. *today was a zero in my view.* but i dont have to reach the import of it. /134

R: Ensign says Secy of HLS has right to choose 3d country designation. we don't think that's right. it's a ""shall"" when it comes to my client's designation of Costa rica. Can be overridden if 3d country won't take or Secy has determined it would prejudice US. [No showing of either.] /135

R: it's been a parade of less than memorable witnesses, YH. we're left with a plain winner for my client. Cooper now addressing some of the technical jurisdictional questions. He gives her some cases where courts have exercised jurisdiction when there was no order of removal. /136

Judge: I dont have any other questions. i consider the record and argument to be closed. will reach as quickly as I can. weighty issues. I'll likely not reach the motion to dissolve till I decide the petition ... /137",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-24 10:58:37.875064

“For real, I thought I was going to Jamaica,” Etoria told me.
“For the first three days, we ate only porridge, and I raised my hand real quick and said, ‘No more!’ ” Etoria told me.
Jim told me that he was trying to stay indoors, for fear of being detained or extorted by officials in Togo.
“They cried so helplessly, and they were scrambling and running for their lives,” Jim told me.","One Saturday morning in early September, I got a WhatsApp video call from eleven strangers locked inside a secretive detention camp in a forest in Ghana. Their faces looked glazed with sweat and stricken with fear. In the background, I could hear birdsong and the drone of insects. An armed guard watched over the group as they huddled around a shared cellphone.

“There are big snakes here, and scorpions!” a male voice with an American accent called out.

“My stomach is really hurting, and we have to beg for food,” another man said.

A third added, “We fear we’ll be tortured and killed.”

One of the men, a car salesman and a real-estate agent from Miami, whom I’ll call Jim, gave me a tour of the scene: an open-air military complex known as Bundase Training Camp, some forty miles from Accra. “I have five U.S.-citizen children, and they don’t know where their father is,” Jim said.

Just months earlier, one of these men had a job with UPS in Chicago. Another had lived in Houston, where he worked for his mother’s catering business, composed R. & B. music, and babysat his little brothers. Some had lived in the U.S. from an early age. Jim, a political refugee, had come to Miami from Liberia in the early nineties, when he was twenty-three, after his parents were murdered for their tribal and political affiliations during the country’s civil war. Others, including a twenty-one-year-old woman who had fled Togo fearing genital mutilation, had arrived in the U.S. recently, seeking asylum.

All of them had been taken from the United States against their will. Nearly all had been granted forms of legal relief that bar the government from deporting them to their home countries. At the heart of the protections they’d received was one of the most basic and sacrosanct concepts in both U.S. and international law: non-refoulement. This principle means that no nation should intentionally deport or expel people to a place where they are likely to face torture, persecution, death, or other grave harms.

The forest detainees had got my number from an Atlanta-based immigration attorney named Meredyth Yoon, who works as a litigation director for a nonprofit called Asian Americans Advancing Justice. “Traditionally, we focus a lot on immigration detention, and we engage in advocacy on issues affecting Asian American and Pacific Islander communities,” she told me. But, in recent months, Yoon has had to repeatedly reimagine her work, racing to help community members whose loved ones were seized in large-scale ICE raids and working to defend lawful immigrants from unlawful deportations. This spring, she’d agreed to represent Jim after learning that he’d been held in an ICE processing center in Folkston, Georgia, for more than two years. Jim had won asylum and become a lawful permanent resident of the U.S in the nineties. But, in 2011, he’d been convicted of bank fraud and, more than a decade later, ICE had initiated removal proceedings against him and detained him.

In late summer, Yoon learned that ICE had moved Jim to its Alexandria Staging Facility, in central Louisiana, from which detainees tend to get deported. Yoon contacted ICE to find out where the agency was planning to send him. ICE never answered her e-mails. At that point, Yoon told me, “more alarm bells started going off.”

Then, on the morning of September 8th, Jim called Yoon in a panic. “I’m in Ghana!” he cried out. Yoon scrambled to gather information on Jim and the other detainees who were being held with him. Four days later, she and her colleagues filed an urgent lawsuit, sketching the life-or-death fears of five of them. The next morning, I received the call from all eleven individuals held in Bundase Training Camp, who asked me to describe their plight. “They didn’t tell us where we were going,” Jim said that morning. “They just kidnapped us overnight and whisked us out.”

For months, I had been trying to document the Trump Administration’s secretive third-country removals. At first, getting access to any information was daunting. Some of the deportees were held in far-off prisons or detention sites; others had gone into hiding. Friends and relatives in the U.S. often felt terrified of speaking out, fearing retaliation. “I don’t know that the piece you’re contemplating is necessarily writable right now,” a leading lawyer on the topic, Anwen Hughes, of the advocacy group Human Rights First, wrote to me in late July.

Initially, I’d focussed on two groups of third-country deportees, known to human-rights lawyers as the South Sudan Eight and the Eswatini Five. The first group, from countries including Myanmar, Mexico, and Laos, had been deported, in early July, to South Sudan, a nation struggling to recover from a civil war. Days later, the second group—five men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen, all of whom had lived in the U.S. for many years—had been deported to the southern African nation of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland. There, they were detained in a maximum-security prison, without clear justification.

These deportees appeared to have been handpicked by the Trump Administration to test a new approach to mass deportation. According to the Department of Homeland Security, all of them had been convicted of serious crimes, including murder. Announcing the flight to Eswatini, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for D.H.S., had called the five deportees “so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,” a claim that at least one of the countries disavowed. Arguably the most surprising part of these early removals was also the least understood. It wasn’t just that these men were being sent to nations where they had no ties, and to places that were not safe. It was also that, in many cases, men who had completed their sentences in the U.S. years ago were now being subjected to indefinite detention abroad.

The wider strategy of forced third-country transfers had clear policy roots. On January 20th, the first day of Donald Trump’s second term, Trump issued an executive order called “Securing Our Borders,” which, among other things, declared an intention to expand the use of third-country deportations. On February 18th, D.H.S. issued an internal guidance memo, instructing immigration officers to “review for removal” all cases “on the non-detained docket”—meaning anyone with an immigration case who was not in ICE custody. As part of this review, D.H.S. officials would “determine the viability of removal to a third country”—and, if they found that third-country removal was viable, attempt to detain the person. The first large-scale third-country removals occurred that month and targeted newly arrived asylum seekers. Between February 12th and 15th, the U.S. sent two hundred and ninety-nine people—from countries such as Afghanistan, Cameroon, Somalia, and Iran—to Panama. On February 20th and 25th, the U.S. sent an additional two hundred people, including eighty-one children, to Costa Rica. Soon afterward came third-country-deportation flights to Uzbekistan and El Salvador, where more than two hundred and fifty non-Salvadoran immigrants were detained in the brutal Terrorism Confinement Center, also known by its Spanish acronym, CECOT. Some of the men held at CECOT were transferred there as part of another third-country-removal experiment: the President declared that the U.S. had been “invaded” by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, authorizing the removal of supposed gang members. (In June, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg found that the government had violated the rights of those men by not giving them an opportunity to challenge their deportations.)

In late March, a young, gay Guatemalan asylum seeker, known to the court as O.C.G., filed a class-action lawsuit with several other plaintiffs, challenging the new policy of deporting people to third countries without meaningful notice or a chance to contest their removal. According to the complaint, O.C.G. had fled Guatemala because of “multiple death threats on account of his sexuality.” An immigration judge barred his deportation to Guatemala. The Department of Homeland Security then placed him on a bus with some twenty other men and, without issuing a new removal order, deported the group to Mexico. O.C.G. was not able to protest that he also feared persecution and torture in Mexico, where he’d been held hostage and raped while on his journey to the U.S. The lawsuit, known in the courts as D.V.D. v. D.H.S., became the primary legal battlefront for an urgent question: Can the government deport people to third countries without giving them an opportunity to claim that they could be tortured or killed there?

In April, a Massachusetts federal judge, Brian E. Murphy, issued a preliminary injunction, saying that the government must grant people at least fifteen days to challenge third-country deportations. But two months later the Supreme Court granted a stay, reversing Murphy’s order. (Using the so-called shadow docket, the Court offered no public explanation of its reasoning.) The result is that, for now, D.H.S. can deport people to countries not listed on their removal orders without giving them any notice. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, decrying the government’s “flagrantly unlawful conduct.” Sotomayor wrote, “In matters of life and death, it is best to proceed with caution.”

McLaughlin, the D.H.S. spokesperson, had a different response: “Fire up the deportation planes.” Shortly after the ruling came down, ICE deported the South Sudan Eight and the Eswatini Five. Among those sent to Eswatini was Orville Etoria, a sixty-two-year-old man who’d lived in New York for nearly fifty years.

In late August, I met with Etoria’s aunt Margaret McKen at her home in Canarsie, Brooklyn. A professor at Hunter College’s School of Education, McKen confessed that she was reluctant to talk with me. (I agreed to use her maiden name.) “I’ve been a naturalized citizen for thirty years, and I don’t even have a parking ticket, but you never know what they can do to you,” she said. “I’ve started to have a phobia that ICE will come and break down my door.”

Still, McKen felt that the public ought to know what had happened to her nephew, and who he was. Born in Jamaica, Etoria came to Brooklyn at the age of twelve, in 1976. He lived with his mother in Crown Heights, where she worked at a day-care center. As a young adult, Etoria suffered from psychiatric problems. In 1997, he was convicted of second-degree murder, for shooting a man in a leather-goods store, and received a sentence of twenty-five years to life. Eventually, an immigration judge issued an order of removal against him, meaning that he could be deported once he got out of prison.

Etoria had been convicted of a serious crime, but, McKen said, he had evolved as a person. While incarcerated, Etoria had earned a bachelor’s degree in behavioral science and worked toward a master’s in divinity. After his release, in 2021, he got a job at a homeless shelter in Queens, helping to get health care and housing for men who needed support, as he once had. He lived in a three-story brownstone, which he shared with his mother and one of his two adult sons.

They were a close-knit family, McKen told me, noting that, upon his release, Etoria had cared for his mother through a terminal illness. “When Orville was in prison, his mom was like the mailman—rain, sleet, or snow, she’d always travel to see him,” McKen said. “When he came home, he eased his mother’s burden, cleaning the house, buying groceries, and cooking her oxtail and salmon.” More recently, McKen recalled, “He got a car, and he told me, ‘I’m paying my own water bill!’ ”

At a routine ICE check-in this past spring, an agent told Etoria that he had ninety days to prepare his Jamaican passport. Shortly after he reported back to ICE, in June, McKen got a call from one of Etoria’s sons, saying, “They detained him and he’s not coming home!” She tracked Etoria’s whereabouts, using ICE’s online locator, as he was transferred from Manhattan’s Federal Plaza to Orange County, New York, and then back to Manhattan. She arranged for relatives in Jamaica to prepare a place for him to stay, in case he was sent back there.

Then Etoria vanished from the ICE tracker. McKen panicked. “God, are you going to send us a message?” she asked. He had been missing for more than two weeks when, one morning, McKen looked at her phone and saw an image that made her jump: Etoria’s face, in an online news dispatch. McKen clicked on the story. She found her way to McLaughlin’s announcement that Orville and four other “barbaric” men had been deported to Eswatini.

“Orville isn’t a monster,” McKen told me. “We get it—we know what he did was wrong. We raised our children to respect that there are consequences. But, if you paid for those consequences once already, why a second time? It’s a political ploy, to keep us in line. It’s them saying, ‘I have the power to destroy you.’ ”

McKen called the office of Jamaica’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade and learned that the country had not declined to take Etoria back. The minister implied online that the government had not even been asked. McKen couldn’t reach Etoria in Eswatini. “We are wondering if we will ever see him alive again,” she said.

McKen wondered, too, who else the Trump Administration might deport this way. It had started off its third-country removals with men like Etoria, who had served out criminal sentences. But soon she saw more third-country removals unfolding in the news, affecting a broader group. Less than a week after our conversation, news broke about the third-country deportations to Ghana, which included men and women who’d never been charged with any crime.

On September 12th, Meredyth Yoon and her colleagues filed their lawsuit on behalf of five of the people who’d been sent to Ghana. The attorneys pleaded that their clients were “now in immediate danger of being sent on, within hours, to their countries of origin,” despite the fact that immigration judges acknowledged that they would likely face persecution or torture there.

Late that night, I spoke to Yoon. She told me, “It’s absolutely shocking and illegal. And it fits this Administration’s general pattern—draconian, cruel processes that create a spectacle and coerce people into leaving of their own accord.” She added, “I hope we can do something. I hope we can stop this train.”

The next morning, I received the call from Yoon’s clients in the Ghanaian military camp. “Here, it’s all bushes and forest,” Jim told me. He wanted to start his story back in Louisiana, where a violent removal operation had taken place in the dark on September 5th. “They came to our cell,” he said, “and woke us in the middle of the night.”

Jim had asked the agents where they were taking him. They refused to answer. “I need to talk to my attorney,” Jim said, adding, as Yoon had advised, “I fear for my life if sent back to Liberia.” An agent called over a group of colleagues. “They punched me—I have bruises right now from it—and they kicked me,” Jim told me. “Then they put me on the ground, handcuffed me, and put me in a straitjacket.” He’d wept as they dragged him through the dark onto a tarmac. Other men in full-body restraints and chains were also being forced onto the flight, screaming and crying.

“Sir, all I asked is to speak to an attorney because I fear for my life,” Jim repeated. At that point, he told me, the agents carried him “like cargo” onto the military plane. “That’s what you get for not coöperating,” one of the agents said, according to Jim.

As Jim spoke, other men crowded around the phone, calling out similar stories. A heavyset Chicago resident, T.L., confirmed the violence of ICE’s initial removal. “They beat me up and punched me to the ground,” T.L. told me. He’d come to the U.S. years ago, fleeing political persecution in Nigeria. He made a good life for himself in Chicago, and had children; he found work as a cleaner in a hospital and at UPS. But, in 2022, he was sentenced to two and a half years in federal prison, for bank fraud. When he got out, he said, ICE agents instantly detained him.

T.L. fought his deportation, and a judge granted him relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), agreeing that T.L. was “more likely than not” to face torture in Nigeria and barring the government from sending him back there. Protection by way of CAT—and a similar status known as “withholding of removal”—doesn’t include the full benefits of asylum, such as a path to citizenship. But typically, under both Republican and Democratic Administrations, people granted these forms of relief have been allowed to keep living in the U.S. Technically, they could be deported to a country where they did not have credible fears of torture or persecution, but that rarely happened, and, when it did, it required a series of careful steps. (The American Immigration Council has attested that a mere 1.6 per cent of people who were granted withholding of removal in 2017 were deported to a third country that year.) Clear due-process rights governed such removals. “But then, when the ICE agents came for me,” T.L. said, “no laws worked.”

T.L. told me that he refused to board the ICE flight on September 5th without speaking to his attorney. He said that he’d also been placed in full-body restraints and dragged onto the plane by ICE agents. T.L. and Jim both told me that the agents had said, “Either you go the easy way or you go the hard way.” Trump used similar phrasing earlier this year, in a promotional video for a new Customs and Border Protection app that allows immigrants to declare their intent to self-deport, saying, “People in our country illegally can self-deport the easy way or they can get deported the hard way, and that’s not pleasant.”

In a statement to The New Yorker, McLaughlin, the D.H.S. spokesperson, said, “Any claim that ICE personnel ‘beat,’ ‘kick,’ or ‘drag’ detainees or use ‘straitjackets’ is categorically false.” She also wrote, “Every single detainee receives due process. Get a grip.” Of the people who were sent to Ghana, she added, “Many of these were heinous criminals with rap sheets that included injury to a child, robbery, aggravated assault, and fraud.”

But the group in Bundase Training Camp also included people such as D.A., a Nigerian human-rights advocate who’d never been convicted of a crime. In Nigeria, his work on behalf of tribal groups facing displacement by the government had led to death threats. Eventually, he’d sought asylum in the U.S., and an immigration judge granted D.A. protection from deportation to Nigeria through CAT, affirming his fear of torture. But, on September 5th, he said, he was beaten and forced onto the flight. D.A. recalled an ICE agent telling him, “Your ass is getting on the plane.” He responded, “You’re abusing your badge.”

As we spoke, D.A. looked terrified. “I did everything possible to try to do the right thing,” he told me, emphasizing that he’d followed U.S. asylum law. He is married to a U.S. citizen from Texas. “Today, they brought a Nigerian officer from the consulate to see me!” he said. “I want the people of the United States to know my life is in danger—not just back home in Nigeria but also in Ghana.”

As D.A. and others panned the camera across the camp, I noticed several women standing in the group. I asked if they, too, wished to speak. A woman whom I’ll call Miriam stepped forward. She had lived in Lomé, the capital city of Togo, where, she explained, in a warm, gentle voice, she’d studied marketing, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees, and hoped for a career in the import-export business.

But, when Miriam was in her twenties, her life took a turn. Her relatives expected her to return to her father’s ancestral village, to submit to ritual genital mutilation. She refused and escaped to Ghana, where, she said, an uncle offered her protection but raped her instead. She tried hiding in another city in Togo, she recounted, but relatives found her there and tortured her for days. Finally, Miriam fled to the U.S., taking a flight to Brazil and trekking across more than a dozen borders to reach Texas. “I fought as best I could,” she told me. An immigration judge in Arizona granted her withholding of removal. She assumed this meant safety. “But instead they just deported us,” she said.

Miriam ushered forward the youngest person in the group, a slender woman with braids who stood there putting on a brave face. “She’s only twenty-one years old,” Miriam said, of the woman, who was also from Togo.

The twenty-one-year-old waved. She did not speak English, but others interpreted. She’d arrived in the U.S. seeking asylum last November. An immigration judge granted her withholding of removal. I later obtained her account in writing, translated by another detainee. “I was forced to go through female genital mutilation for them to give me to an old man for a marriage which I refused,” it read. “I ran to the U.S. to save my life.”

One result of the surge in third-country deportations has been the creation of a detective agency of sorts, comprising attorneys, human-rights groups, and flight-tracking experts. Together, they’ve been trying to solve the mystery of who is being deported, and to where, and when.

The flight trackers are often the first to warn that a deportation is afoot. Their digging originated with the work of a retired JPMorgan Chase executive named Tom Cartwright, who, in 2020, took up a new volunteer effort: using publicly available aviation data to track ICE flights. Human Rights First has formalized and expanded Cartwright’s log, tallying more than seventeen hundred deportation flights in the first nine months of the second Trump Administration. “Just keeping up has been a monumental effort,” Savitri Arvey, a refugee-protection expert working on the project, told me.

Arvey gave me an example. “Late Wednesday night, there was a flight out of J.F.K. with all the characteristics of a third-country removal to Uzbekistan,” she told me. “It wasn’t the normal flight number for flights to Uzbekistan, and we saw that the plane was parked on the tarmac, not at the gate, and it left six hours late,” she said. “The stars align with a repatriation, but we’re digging to get confirmation, since it’s all been a mystery.” Unless a person on a deportation flight calls someone in the U.S., Arvey said, that person’s fate remains “a total black hole.”

The State Department declined to comment on the details of its diplomatic communications with other governments. But the U.S. has reportedly sought third-country-deportation agreements with nations including Ukraine, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Uganda, and Kosovo, sometimes threatening countries with economic or diplomatic consequences if they don’t oblige. In court, ICE has invoked agreements for which no records were apparent. I obtained a sworn declaration from an ICE officer which stated that “the U.S. Department of State currently has a valid agreement with Bolivia to accept third country removals.” The officer attested that ICE had served a young Colombian woman with “notice of removal to Bolivia” and that D.H.S. had scheduled her flight. But the woman’s lawyer told me that she could find no public reports or evidence of such a deal. The lawyer won her client’s release after an ICE official admitted in court that the woman could not, in fact, be sent to Bolivia.

The financial incentives driving these agreements have also been hidden from public view. Last March, the Trump Administration paid El Salvador more than four million dollars to imprison non-Salvadoran deportees. But in most places the numbers remain undisclosed. I obtained a copy of the “memorandum of understanding” that the U.S. government signed with Eswatini, revealing that the U.S. had agreed to pay the country more than five million dollars in exchange for accepting up to a hundred and sixty foreign-national deportees. I also reviewed a copy of the deal struck with Rwanda: in that instance, the U.S. pledged $7.5 million in exchange for taking up to two hundred and fifty deportees. Both Eswatini and Rwanda made a commitment to “prevention of refoulement.” In June, two activist groups, the National Immigration Litigation Alliance and Refugees International, sued the State Department, seeking the release of deportation agreements with a half-dozen countries. In the lawsuit, which is ongoing, the groups argue that the government shirked its duty to fulfill their Freedom of Information Act requests, leaving critical information “shrouded from public view.”

In Eswatini, where Orville Etoria and four other men had been detained, Etoria’s family and a group of U.S. advocates found a local lawyer named Sibusiso Magnificent Nhlabatsi to take up their cause. “These men haven’t committed any crime in Swaziland, and they finished their sentence in the U.S., so under what circumstances are they being detained without access to counsel?” Nhlabatsi asked me in September. “It’s a textbook case of kidnapping and human trafficking, at the center of which is the United States, with Swaziland as an active accomplice.”

When Nhlabatsi first went to visit the men, he told me, “I thought I’d walk into the prison, see these men, help out, and that would be the end of the matter.” But the prison deputy denied him access to them, saying that they hadn’t yet had a chance to reach their families. Nhlabatsi returned the following week, and was told to come back the next day. When he returned again, he was informed that the men had refused to see him. Later in the day, Etoria and the others called home, and all said that they had not been told of such a visit.

On July 31st, Nhlabatsi filed a habeas petition in a court in Eswatini, asserting the men’s right to legal counsel. “The right to legal representation is not a privilege to be granted at the convenience of the correctional services, but a non-negotiable right that attaches from the moment of detention,” he wrote. But, on multiple occasions, the government ignored its legal deadline to respond to the case. When Nhlabatsi was slated to appear in court in mid-September, the court went into recess without informing him. “These men have a right to a fair hearing, and the right to be presumed innocent, and the right to a speedy trial,” Nhlabatsi told me. “I cannot let this injustice go unchallenged.”

Nhlabatsi was frustrated. He knew, too, that he was risking his life to stand up for these men. In 2023, his mentor, a prominent human-rights lawyer and pro-democracy activist named Thulani Maseko, was shot dead in front of his wife and children, after years of advocating for an end to Eswatini’s monarchy. Now that Nhlabatsi was in the local press defending the U.S. deportees’ basic right to counsel, he was getting regular calls from friends. “They weren’t encouraging me,” Nhlabatsi told me. “They were saying, ‘Are you sure you’re safe?’ ”

Then, in late September, I got an update from Etoria’s lawyer in Brooklyn, Mia Unger, of the Legal Aid Society. He had just been released, and was the first person to make it out of Eswatini’s black site. He was nervous about speaking out—the Trump Administration had described him to the public as “barbaric,” and he worried about the repercussions for his family. But, eventually, he decided that he would talk to a journalist for the first time.

When I reached Etoria, I learned that he had been my near-neighbor in Brooklyn. We spent our weekends in the same parts of Prospect Park, enjoying the people-watching. “I love Eastern Parkway—just sitting on the benches under the trees in the summertime, watching kids go by on their bikes and families hanging out,” he told me. “New York is what I know.”

When Etoria showed up to his ICE check-in last June, he knew immediately that things had changed. “I gave my passport to the officer, and he said, ‘Step to the back wall,’ ” he told me. At 26 Federal Plaza, in lower Manhattan, he slept on the floor. “That place was too filthy for any human being to live,” he said. From there, he was punted between ICE facilities and finally taken to the El Paso Service Processing Center, in Texas.

The true shock came soon after. On July 14th, Etoria was called down to intake with a group of men of diverse nationalities. He assumed that they’d be deported to their respective countries. They walked onto the tarmac. “For real, I thought I was going to Jamaica,” Etoria told me. “Why would I think I was going anywhere else?”

The men boarded the ICE flight in shackles. The idea of returning to Jamaica felt, to Etoria, like “an unimaginable loss.” Someone asked, “Where are we going?” An agent replied, “The first flight is six hours, and then the second flight is eight hours.” Etoria felt his stomach drop. They stopped in Djibouti, where the men were transferred onto a military cargo plane. “It was like something you’d see in a movie, as if we were some notorious gangsters,” Etoria said. Roughly a half hour before that flight landed, the men learned their true destination. “The officer came around wanting us to sign a paper saying we agreed to go to Eswatini,” he told me. “I’d never even heard of Eswatini!” Panicked, he refused to sign.

“We all expressed the same disconnect from reality in that moment,” Etoria said. He told me that an ICE official had snapped paparazzi-style photographs as he stepped off the plane, still wearing chains. He felt like an unwilling prop in an ad for the Trump Administration. “You could tell it was a charade, all for show, so that they could use it and say, ‘Look what we did,’ ” he said.

“To be honest,” Etoria added, “it helped me imagine how the slaves might have felt, going to another land in shackles and chains—that loneliness, that disconnect, that sense of loss.”

Local guards shuttled the group to Matsapha Correctional Complex, a maximum-security prison. No one explained the grounds on which the men were being held. At first, Etoria said, the guards treated the U.S. deportees with suspicion. “They’d seen a military plane come onto their land—the kind of plane that drops bombs on people and takes troops to war—and they were told, ‘These five men are people to be afraid of.’ But, over time, we conversed with the guards, and they could see that they’d been lied to about who we really were.” Soon, the guards gave the men a chessboard. They fielded Etoria’s complaints about the food, although it hardly improved. “For the first three days, we ate only porridge, and I raised my hand real quick and said, ‘No more!’ ” Etoria told me.

The Eswatini Five had only occasional monitored calls to their families and little to no access to their lawyers in the U.S. Mostly, they spent time in their cells. “We looked up at the ceiling a lot, and we talked about our families,” Etoria said. “We tried to help each other release the thoughts that were inside of us that were screaming to come out, the things that meant the most to us, and family was the No. 1 thing. The second-biggest thing was realizing that our lives had meaning—that we weren’t the bad, bad people that society had told us we were.”

Weeks passed. One day in late summer, officials from the International Organization for Migration visited the group. They brought “mental-health” provisions: badminton equipment, a basketball, Ping-Pong paddles, and five novels. Etoria stressed that what he really needed for his mental health was freedom. Soon after, he said, I.O.M. informed him that he would soon be able to return to Jamaica. On September 21st, he boarded the first in a series of four commercial flights that brought him to the island. No one knows how much money the U.S. government spent on this elaborate detention detour to Africa.

In Jamaica, Etoria has wondered about the men left behind: the Eswatini Four. They remain imprisoned without explanation, and without clear paths to repatriation. Ten more people have been added to the group. “There is something sinister going on here, and something has been taken from my spirit that I might never get back,” Etoria said. In mid-October, his Cuban cellmate, Roberto Mosquera del Peral, began a monthlong hunger strike. “Roberto is an unbelievably kind dude, who likes to analyze stuff with a critical mind,” Etoria said. Mosquera del Peral’s attorney, Alma David, of Novo Legal Group, told me during the strike, “I’m very worried—he has been in pain and looks very thin.”

Eswatini has continued to rebuff Nhlabatsi’s attempts to meet with the detained people. He finally won his habeas case in front of a judge, only to have the government file an appeal. In response to Mosquera del Peral’s hunger strike, Eswatini issued a press release. “The third country national was found to be in good health and spirits,” it read. “He did, however, mention that he was currently fasting and praying because he was missing his family.”

When we spoke recently, Etoria was hunkered down without electricity in the home where he’s been living in Jamaica. His phone was dying, and Hurricane Melissa—a Category 5 storm—was headed toward the island. He worried about not having stocked up on groceries. “I’ll just rough it out,” he told me. Since landing in Jamaica, he said, he has felt completely lost. “I’m trying to catch up, trying to fit in, but, at my age, it’s not easy to get a job here,” he said.

Etoria hopes that, at some point, he can confront the U.S. government about his treatment. But, even more so, he wishes that he could speak to African leaders, as a Black man who feels he was sent across the Middle Passage in reverse. “I want to say, to all the African nations who are taking people into their country in chains and shackles, it’s not a good picture,” he said. “You’re hurting these people, spiritually and emotionally. I don’t just want Eswatini to hear it. I want Ghana to hear it. I want South Sudan to hear it. I want Rwanda and Uganda to hear it.” He paused. “Please,” Etoria said, “let the Trump Administration take care of its own dirty work.”

On a recent evening, I spoke again to Meredyth Yoon, who told me that another deportation flight from the U.S. to Ghana—she believed it to be the fourth—had just landed. Among the latest deportees was a Maryland nurse named Rabbiatu Kuyateh, who’d lived in the U.S. for roughly thirty years and has never faced criminal charges. Kuyateh had won withholding of removal, convincing an immigration judge that she’d likely face serious harm in her native Sierra Leone. Even so, she was shackled and sent to Ghana, where she and others were held under armed guard at a hotel near Accra. Yoon had been on the phone with Kuyateh and other detainees, she said, when Ghanaian officials came to the hotel and dragged Kuyateh away. They put her on a flight to Sierra Leone.

Since we’d first spoken, Yoon had been trying to defend the rights of dozens of people who’d been deported to Ghana. In mid-September, she and her colleagues had appeared in U.S. district court, where they argued that members of the first group of deportees should be returned, swiftly, to America. At the time, eleven men and women were still held at Bundase Training Camp; they were hearing rumors that at any moment they could be sent back to their home countries, from which the U.S. government had promised them protection. “There is still time to act,” Lee Gelernt, who had joined the case from the American Civil Liberties Union, had pleaded. “We would implore you to do some kind of relief now.”

The Justice Department attorney, Elianis Perez, did not contest the basic fact of the removals. Instead, she insisted that the U.S. had obtained “diplomatic assurances” that Ghana would comply with the Convention Against Torture and other safeguards. Yet one member of the group—a bisexual Gambian man who had been granted protection under CAT by a U.S. immigration judge—had already been returned to his home country.

“How is that O.K.?” the judge, Tanya Chutkan, asked.

“Your Honor, the United States is not saying that this is O.K.,” Perez replied. “What the government has been trying to explain to the court is that the United States does not have the power to tell Ghana what to do.”

Two days later, Chutkan issued her decision. The deportations “appear to be part of a pattern and widespread effort to evade the government’s legal obligations by doing indirectly what it cannot do directly,” she wrote. Even so, she concluded, her “hands are tied.” The court lacked the jurisdiction to prevent Yoon and Gelernt’s clients from being deported by Ghana to their home countries. The resulting policy, Gelernt told me, is “unprecedented and wholly at odds with the humane discretion exercised by past Administrations of both parties.”

I wondered what would become of the terrified men and women I’d talked to in Bundase Training Camp. I soon found out. When I got hold of Jim, in early October, he and nine of the other people I’d spoken with had been placed in vehicles and driven out of the camp, to the border of Togo. Among them was Miriam, who feared torture or death if she was forced to return there, and the twenty-one-year-old Togolese woman who had also fled genital mutilation.

“Right now, we’re in Togo illegally!” Jim told me. He explained that Ghanaian immigration officials had left the group with Togolese officials who, rather than affording them proper documentation, had pushed them quietly across the border. “They passed us through the back door into Togo, but we aren’t invisible, and we’re an easy target for the cops,” he said. “We don’t speak the language here, and we have no money.” His family had tried to send him funds through Western Union. But he couldn’t easily obtain them, he said, because the U.S. government had confiscated his I.D. He and others in the group had to beg strangers to get the funds, for a cut of the cash.

Jim told me that he was trying to stay indoors, for fear of being detained or extorted by officials in Togo. But, on occasion, he’d been sneaking out to the ocean, to listen to the waves. He worried most about the Togolese women in their group. “They cried so helplessly, and they were scrambling and running for their lives,” Jim told me. “They’ve gone underground.”

A few days later, I spoke to Miriam, who was hiding in a boarding room. A local journalist had learned Miriam’s real name and published it on social media. Soon afterward, her cousin began receiving ominous calls from strangers, asking, “Where is Miriam?” She sobbed as we spoke.

“This morning, I drank a porridge, and it’s the only food I’ve had,” she told me. In her hiding place, she’d been rehashing her trajectory. She’d been shipped like cargo “from Arizona to Louisiana, and then Louisiana to Ghana, and then Ghana to Togo,” she said. “ICE treated us like animals, handcuffed us, and wouldn’t let us eat—just bread and water.”

At Bundase Training Camp, “they didn’t tell us that they would take us to Togo,” Miriam continued. She had tried to confront the Ghanaian officials as they shoved her group across the border. “Why are you doing this? You’re supposed to protect us, as a third country!” Miriam pleaded. An officer, she told me, said, “Shut up. We have to respect the orders we were given.” Some of the detained men were told they’d be shot if they tried to escape.

Back in May, Miriam told me, she’d been elated to receive protection from a U.S. immigration judge. She thought that this offer of refuge was what defined the United States. It was true, I told her. After the last British ship left New York Harbor in 1783, George Washington and his officers famously made a toast: “May America be an Asylum to the persecuted of the earth!”

“As I’m talking to you right now, I don’t know what will happen to me,” Miriam said. But, for the moment, she had one wish: “I need other people to know that this is my true condition. I am not free.” ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691e1c444e8e8117138da09d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/r47863_rd.jpg",N,,2025-11-24 11:57:21.933118

In response to President Trump’s April 23, 2025 executive order, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is scaling back (though not entirely abandoning) its enforcement of disparate impact discrimination claims. Disparate impact discrimination claims refer to those which allege that a facially neutral employment policy disproportionately harms a protected group or groups. The U.S. Supreme Court first recognized the theory of disparate impact liability under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. in 1971. The Court there ruled that an employer’s policy requiring employees in its highest-paying departments to attain a particular level of education or pass an internal test as a condition for employment was unlawful because the policy had a disparate impact on racial minorities. The EEOC will no longer pursue such claims, standing alone. Only those disparate impact claims which are accompanied by an intentional discrimination claim, otherwise known as a disparate treatment claim, may continue. Importantly, however, even under Trump’s executive order, Title VII and Griggs still provide grounds for private individuals to pursue disparate impact claims directly.

An Ideological Shift At The EEOC

According to a recent internal memorandum, the EEOC has directed its staff members to close most pending disparate impact investigations and begin issuing right-to-sue letters to the charging parties, permitting them to file private claims in federal court. The intention was to conclude those cases by September 30, 2025, and issue letters to affected parties by October 31, 2025. The issuance of right-to-sue letters may have been delayed due to the recently ended government shutdown. The change in the EEOC’s enforcement policies is a direct response to the Executive Order’s mandate, and it is likely to create a surge in private litigation as individuals and advocacy groups seek to pursue claims in court where agency enforcement is lacking.

The EEOC has already begun to withdraw disparate impact lawsuits initiated by the Commission in response to President Trump’s April 2025 executive order. In response, plaintiffs are continuing to pursue the claims in federal court, serving as an example of the path we can expect many similarly situated claimants to follow. The Commission’s decision to stop the investigation of disparate impact claims in the absence of an intentional discrimination claim has also resulted in litigation against the Commission. Recently, a claimant filed a lawsuit against the EEOC after the Commission stopped investigating the claimant’s unintentional discrimination charge. In that lawsuit, the claimant alleges that the Commission violated its statutory obligation to investigate discrimination complaints, including ones that involved disparate impact. The claimant also alleges the Commission exceeded its authority under the Administrative Procedures Act by issuing its disparate impact directive. The case, Cross v. EEOC (No. 1:25-cv-03702), was filed on October 20, 2025, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

The October 27, 2025 swearing in of Republican Brittany Panuccio as an EEOC Commissioner formally created the three-member quorum and restored the agency’s ability to vote on major policy changes and litigation for the first time since January. With the government reopening, this development will allow the new EEOC leadership to carry out its agenda which, under Acting Chair Lucas, will include initiating litigation, challenging DEI programs and targeting religious discrimination in the workplace.

Moving Forward

Despite the executive order, legislative avenues remain open. Congress retains the authority to amend statutes explicitly to restrict or define the scope of disparate impact liability. As legal challenges and court decisions unfold, the landscape remains fluid. Courts are likely to grapple with the tension between statutory rights, Supreme Court precedent and the executive branch’s policy directives. Employers and federal contractors must adapt to this evolving environment. In the short term, they should:

Conduct comprehensive audits of employment practices, testing and selection procedures to ensure compliance with current legal standards.

Monitor regulatory guidance and administrative agency positions, especially regarding the use of disparate impact analysis and anti-harassment guidance.

Continue to implement fair, inclusive practices that focus on merit and individualized assessments, avoiding quotas or race-based decision-making.

In the longer term, employers should prepare for potential shifts in litigation patterns. While federal agencies may exercise restraint, private plaintiffs, state agencies and advocacy groups can continue to pursue disparate impact claims. State laws, such as California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act, New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination and New York’s Human Rights Law, remain active avenues for systemic discrimination claims. While the legal foundations remain intact, the administrative enforcement landscape is shifting, with federal agencies deprioritizing such claims and courts potentially seeing an increase in private litigation.",https://www.bipc.com/assets/images/thumbnails/post-social-L_and_E-eeoc-issues-directive-to-close-all-pending-charges-alleging-only-disparate-impact-in-the-wake-of-trump’s-april-23-executive-order.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:57:34.344303

But first: The latest installment of our “America at 250” series.

Immigration is arguably the defining issue of our age. Its social, economic, and cultural effects are vast—and the subject of some of our most bitter debates. The discontent it has generated has powered political revolutions across the West, including Donald Trump’s improbable rise (and stunning return). Now, with Trump’s administration aiming to deport a million people a year, immigration is becoming the most contentious issue of his second term.

Immigration is also something that goes to the heart of American identity. We are, as the cliché has it, “a nation of immigrants,” and home to more immigrants than any other country. From the Mayflower on, waves of new arrivals have defined what it means to be American, while the Statue of Liberty urges us to “Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”

Lofty principles are one thing; the messy reality, with all its moral dilemmas and painful trade-offs, is another. We’ve reported a lot on that reality here at The Free Press, from the tragic consequences of Biden’s extremely lax border policy to how Trump’s crackdown has upended the daily lives of migrants across the country.

This week, for the latest chapter of our yearlong America at 250 project (read all about that here), we’re building on that reporting and going deeper on immigration. Today, we start with the politics of it. We’re bringing you two of the sharpest minds we know—with different views of the issue—on the question of how immigration came to dominate our politics.

Tyler Cowen supports immigration, but he argues that too many of those he agrees with fail to see the quandary at the heart of the issue. Tyler says it explains why immigration restrictions have to “become more oppressive and more unpleasant as time passes” and turn the liberals into illiberals. Read his essay to understand why “humane” immigration policy ends in cruelty.

For two periods in American history, the country more or less halted the influx of migrants. Now, we are in the middle of what Christopher Caldwell calls the “third great slamming of the Golden Door.” For many Americans, this is a source of national shame, and a sign the country is “turning away from its good ‘welcoming’ side and toward its low-class ‘xenophobic’ side.” That’s not the case, argues Christopher. Read his essay to learn why.

Last year, a video went viral of Warren Smith, then a high school teacher, speaking with an off-camera student. In it, Warren responds to his student’s claim that J.K. Rowling is a bigot by posing a series of calm, logic-driven questions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Warren’s employer was less enthusiastic about this conversation, and he lost his teaching job as a result. Today, Coleman Hughes sits down with Smith to discuss his cancellation, why so many institutions continue to struggle with balancing open inquiry against mounting social pressures, and what it will take to build a better future for American students.

You can watch the full conversation here, and listen to below:

Ukraine and many of its key European allies met in Geneva Sunday to discuss a new U.S. peace plan. President Trump has given Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky until Thursday to accept the deal, otherwise he can “continue to fight his little heart out.”

Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced Friday that she will resign from Congress. After clashing with President Trump in recent weeks, Greene said that she didn’t want her district “to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for.”

The Israeli military struck Beirut on Sunday in a targeted attack against Hezbollah’s chief of staff. It is the first strike on the Lebanese capital since June. “We will continue to act forcefully to prevent any threat to the residents of the north and the state of Israel,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.

The State Department announced on X that they will require all U.S. embassies to produce reports on the human rights implications and public safety impacts of mass migration. In the post, the department called mass migration “an existential threat to Western civilization” that “undermines the stability of key American allies.”

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has officially been disbanded, with 8 months remaining on its charter. When asked about the department’s status, Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor answered, “That doesn’t exist.” (Read Joe Nocera on “Why DOGE Failed.”)

Saudi Arabia is beginning to loosen their drinking restrictions. According to sources familiar with the matter, the Gulf nation will reportedly allow non-Muslim visitors with “special residency status” to purchase alcohol from a store previously reserved for foreign diplomats, as the country continues to court Western influence.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oyQa!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7c4518b-d648-4909-8c63-f912a7aea977_1250x703.png",N,,2025-11-24 11:57:26.421686

As of Friday, the four Sudanese men, whose habeas cases are pending, remained detained in Louisiana, according to ICE’s detainee locator.
Now, those immigrants are asking for bond through habeas petitions, he said, adding that some federal judges have disagreed with the Hurtado decision.","As President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively pursues its mass deportation campaign, the number of immigrants challenging the legality of their detention at ICE facilities in Louisiana – a state that has become a major detention hub in recent years – has surged.

In the roughly 10 months before Trump took office in January, 23 habeas petitions – a type of lawsuit that claims a person is being illegally detained – were filed in federal courts in the state.

Between Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration and Nov. 1, that number soared, with at least 95 Louisiana ICE detainees challenging their detention here, a review of federal court records found.

Among the petitioners are a Pakistani man with an American wife and kids who took a wrong turn after visiting Niagara Falls and ended up at the Canadian border, where he was detained; a Ukrainian truck driver who was detained when he made a delivery at a military base in Texas; and a Russian who opposed the war in Ukraine and spent a year and a half in detention while his asylum claim was processed.

The lawsuits illustrate how the Trump administration's push to detain and deport immigrants in record numbers is sweeping up many people who previously would not have been targeted. And critics argue it shows how those efforts are sometimes crossing legal lines.

“Any insinuation that the Trump administration is detaining people illegally is another smear peddled by the media,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, said in a statement.

McLaughlin argues the spike in habeas petitions is a natural result of increased detention and deportations.

""President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing the law and arresting illegal aliens who have no right to be in our country and reversed Biden's catch and release policy,” McLaughlin continued, referring to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. “We are applying the law as written. If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them. Period.”

Meanwhile, immigration attorneys say the Trump administration’s fierce deportation tactics, which include a push to send immigrants to third countries, and recent decisions from the Board of Immigration Appeals have set the stage for a surge in habeas petitions.

Louisiana has the second most ICE detainees behind Texas. ICE has nine holding facilities in the state, which advocates say house over 7,000 detainees. It also has a staging area by an airfield in Alexandria that has become a hub for deportation flights.

In records filed with the habeas petitions, Louisiana detainees expressed frustration with ICE for failing to provide answers about when they will be released or deported, making their detention feel indefinite. In some cases, they begged to be sent to another country because they did not want to remain in ICE custody.

“I gonna go crazy and die in here,” an Afghan contractor who worked with the U.S. military and fled the country after the Taliban retook power wrote in a September letter filed in court. “please Release me or deport me to Latin American countries instead of Afghanistan.”

As of Nov. 20, the man, who said he was detained in May 2024 and ordered removed in late January, remained in custody in Louisiana, according to ICE’s detainee locator.

A push for third country removals

ICE has detained four Sudanese men for months after they won court orders blocking their deportations because they were at risk of persecution, the men’s habeas petitions say. Sudan is in the middle of a civil war, and images of genocide there have recently shocked the world.

The men were detained in August of 2024, according to their petitions, which show judges blocked their removal orders within the first few months of the Trump administration. The government has not appealed those orders, according to the Executive Office of Immigration Review’s case database.

Their cases are an example of a pattern immigration advocates say is becoming more common under Trump: ICE is less frequently releasing people who are under final removal orders but cannot be deported to their home countries, often as the government tries to send them to third countries.

Though third country deportations occasionally occurred before Trump took office, his administration is pursuing them far more aggressively.

“ICE is detaining all these people that have won their cases, won protection to not be deported to a certain country, and then they’re like, ‘Let’s try to send them to a third country,’” said Jeremy Jong, an immigration attorney based in New Orleans. “Before, those people were, for the most part, released.”

The Sudanese men, like many other habeas petitioners, are using a 2001 Supreme Court case called Zadvydas v. Davis to challenge their confinement. Though it is not a hard and fast rule, that case set a precedent that ICE cannot hold an immigrant for more than six months after a final removal order without a significant likelihood that the immigrant will be deported in the foreseeable future.

In one court filing, the Trump administration argued that the possibility of third country removal allowed them to legally detain an immigrant for longer by increasing the likelihood of his deportation.

Immigrants and lawyers are fighting that notion, sometimes describing cases where people have already been rejected by multiple countries.

The Sudanese men filed petitions more than six months after they received their final, deferred removal orders. ICE has attempted to send at least two of them to third countries, court filings show

“Sir, why I’m still here? If you want to deport me which country you try on it? And if release when?” one of the men asked ICE in September through a communications form.

“Your case is in HQ for 3rd country guidance and assistance,” an ICE officer wrote back. “Please be patient your case/response is in progress.”

ICE has denied release requests for the men, deeming them “flight risks,” according to court records.

Like many detainees who filed petitions, the men are representing themselves.

Not all the challenges filed in Louisiana have held up in court, and many remain pending. In at least two cases, judges have dismissed habeas petitions as premature. Other cases have been dismissed for procedural reasons.

As of Friday, the four Sudanese men, whose habeas cases are pending, remained detained in Louisiana, according to ICE’s detainee locator.

New immigration court precedents

As DHS uses the threat of detention to pressure people into giving up on their immigration cases, a recent Board of Immigration Appeals decision has made it even harder for some detainees to be released on bond.

In the Matter of Yajure Hurtado, the board ruled that immigration judges could not hear bond requests from people who had entered the country illegally but lived here for at least two years without being apprehended.

That decision upended how bond proceedings had been conducted for 40 years, denying bond hearings to a large group of people who were previously eligible, said Homero López, the managing attorney of Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy in New Orleans.

Now, those immigrants are asking for bond through habeas petitions, he said, adding that some federal judges have disagreed with the Hurtado decision.

The Hurtado ruling is part of a flurry of BIA rulings that have generally made it more difficult for immigrants to win their cases or be released on bond, López said, describing the board as being in “lockstep” with Trump’s deportation agenda.

“The Executive Office for Immigration Review is restoring integrity to the immigration adjudication system, and Board of Immigration Appeals decisions reflect straightforward interpretations of clear statutory language,” a spokesperson for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the BIA, said in a statement.

A long wait for asylum

A physician and former police officer, Azat Garaev arrived at a U.S. border checkpoint in California in April of 2024 to apply for asylum during President Joe Biden’s administration. He left Russia after he defied mobilization orders to join the war against Ukraine and encouraged soldiers to resist fighting in a war he considered illegal, an immigration judge later wrote.

Garaev had to leave his wife and children behind because he felt that was safer for everyone, his sister said in a letter to the Western District Court of Louisiana.

Upon his arrival in the U.S., authorities immediately detained Garaev, who was left to wait for his asylum case to unfold. Two months later, a judge granted him asylum, but the government twice appealed the decision, once under the Biden administration and once under Trump.

Once the second appeal was dismissed, Garaev was finally released — after having spent roughly a year and a half at River Correctional Center, an ICE facility in Ferriday.

“What truly breaks you is the uncertainty — not knowing what’s ahead, or how long you’ll be trapped in it. That kind of waiting eats away at you,” he said through a family member who helped translate. “I found myself sinking deeper into depression, drifting between hopelessness and anger.”

His sister requested his release numerous times, to no avail, she said. Garaev himself requested parole at least twice and was denied both times, once because ICE deemed him a “flight risk,” an ICE official said in a statement filed in the Western District Court of Louisiana as part of Garaev’s habeas case.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/12/212a5162-2b63-4e9e-a221-b92e5ae10231/69222fc87ec36.preview.jpg?crop=1819%2C955%2C0%2C92&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-24 10:58:27.629521

“They feel the lack of their father now,” said Dadfar’s wife, speaking with the help of a translation app.
Dadfar, his wife said, was a security officer with the Afghan military and moved around the country with U.S. troops.
Because he had helped the U.S. military, Dadfar was targeted by the Taliban, his wife said.
Indiana State Police held Dadfar for five hours without providing a reason or a warrant, according to the lawsuit.","The younger children of Mohammad Ali Dadfar believe their father is away, working. That’s what they’ve been told.

Only the oldest, an 11-year-old girl, and Dadfar’s wife know the truth.

The father of four, an immigrant from Afghanistan who helped the U.S. military fight the Taliban, is in a Springfield, Missouri, jail — held with other immigrants picked up in nationwide sweeps.

Dadfar is 37 and an asylum-seeker with work authorization and a job as an over-the-road trucker.

He’s been held in the Greene County Jail since early October and fears being sent back to Afghanistan.

“They feel the lack of their father now,” said Dadfar’s wife, speaking with the help of a translation app. “And every time their question is, ‘When will father come home?’“

The Beacon is not naming her due to privacy concerns for the minor children.

A Kansas City-based immigration attorney has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Dadfar’s warrantless arrest and detention as unlawful.

Dadfar’s case is among a spate of federal lawsuits contesting warrantless arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and is part of continued legal attempts to hold the Trump administration accountable to a 2022 consent decree.

The Department of Homeland Security can arrest people without a warrant, but only in limited circumstances, such as when there is a fear that the person will escape before a warrant can be obtained.

Dadfar, the lawsuit argues, was not a flight risk.

Dadfar is represented by Rekha Sharma-Crawford in the case, which alleges that his detention is a violation of the 2022 Castañon Nava federal consent decree.

Dadfar’s case was filed Oct. 12 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.

Named as defendants in the complaint are Greene County Sheriff Jim C. Arnott, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and ICE’s Chicago Field Office Director Samuel Olson.

The Greene County sheriff’s office was not aware of the filing and declined to comment further.

The Department of Homeland Security did not reply to a request for comment.

The Trump administration says it wants to remove dangerous immigrant criminals from the country, what officials often call “the worst of the worst.”

But 97% of the more than 600 undocumented immigrants arrested during the recent Operation Midway Blitz around Chicago had no criminal record, according to reporting by NPR, citing the Department of Homeland Security’s records submitted in ongoing cases involving the consent decree.

The lawsuit also asks that Dadfar not be transferred out of the jurisdiction of ICE’s Kansas City field office.

“Despite over 100 courts having determined that the government’s interpretation of law is incorrect, and the government not appealing those cases, people continue to be unlawfully denied due process and denied their freedom,” Sharma-Crawford said. “It’s un-American.”

Fighting the Taliban

Dadfar is among thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. military during the 20-year war in Afghanistan, the longest war in U.S. history.

The U.S. entered Afghanistan in retaliation after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Afghans helped as part of the Afghan military, as translators, drivers and intelligence operatives and helped with logistics and understanding the country’s culture.

Dadfar, his wife said, was a security officer with the Afghan military and moved around the country with U.S. troops.

Ultimately, the U.S. and allied efforts failed and the Taliban retook the capital of Kabul in 2021.

Dadfar was left behind in the highly criticized, chaotic final withdrawal of U.S. troops under the Biden administration.

Because he had helped the U.S. military, Dadfar was targeted by the Taliban, his wife said.

Subsequent years were treacherous for Dadfar, his wife and their children, who are all under the age of 12.

Their journey to the U.S. took three years, with stays in Iran and Brazil.

A toddler daughter nearly drowned as the family crossed the roadless jungle of the Darien Gap, a dangerous passage between Colombia and Panama.

In June 2024, Dadfar and his family made it to the U.S. southern border. They had an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, made through an app set up by the Department of Homeland Security.

At the border, they began the process to apply for asylum.

Dadfar was released on a parole that is valid until June 17, 2026.

Dadfar’s work permit is also valid through June 17, 2026, according to the lawsuit.

Operations Guardian and Midway Blitz

Dadfar’s Oct. 10 arrest at an Indiana weigh station came just three days after ICE had been found in violation of the original consent decree.

He was stopped there as part of his route as a commercial driver.

On Oct. 7, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, ruled in favor of a group of immigrant workers, including 11 employees who had been apprehended during a raid at a Mexican restaurant in Liberty earlier this year.

The Liberty workers were already out on bond. But their cases were part of a class action challenge to how ICE is operating under the Trump administration.

The judge also agreed that immigration officials were concocting details for warrants after they had made arrests, rather than having the necessary warrants ahead of actions.

The 2022 consent decree is named for one of the original plaintiffs, Margarito Castañon-Nava, and covers six states — Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Kentucky.

Additional rulings by the same judge have ordered the government to release more than 400 immigrants it is holding under warrantless arrests or probable cause, placing the detainees on monitoring programs.

A stay on the order was issued by an appeals court on Nov. 20, and a hearing will be held in early December.

Dadfar might have come under scrutiny through Operation Guardian, an effort by ICE to target undocumented immigrants working as truckers.

A trucker from Uzbekistan, accused in his native country of being a member of a terrorist organization, was arrested Nov. 17 as he drove in Kansas, according to DHS. The man was living in Pennsylvania.

Operation Midway Blitz targeted immigrants in the Chicago area, an effort that coincided with Dadfar’s detainment.

Indiana State Police held Dadfar for five hours without providing a reason or a warrant, according to the lawsuit.

He then was sent to Chicago and held by ICE officials there for two days, again without reason, the suit said.

DHS paperwork filed with the lawsuit said Dadfar was detained without bond and would be held in ICE custody pending his immigration proceedings.

His next hearing before an Denver immigration judge on the asylum application is Feb. 3, 2026.

The lawsuit alleges: “Mr. Dadfar was present … under his valid grant of parole, and there existed no justification for his detention or arrest during a routine matter. He was paroled into the U.S. for the purpose of seeking asylum, which he did timely. He was awaiting his court hearing and was not a flight risk.”

Sharma-Crawford said that she had spoken with Dadfar by phone.

He is represented in his asylum case by a Colorado immigration law firm.

The Missouri suit also questions Homeland Security paperwork that states Dadfar denied having a fear of being deported to Afghanistan.

But Dadfar was never asked by immigration officials about his fear of returning to Afghanistan, Sharma-Crawford said.

Attempts to help Afghans who were left stranded after the U.S. withdrawal are ongoing and increasingly difficult.

Thousands have a claim that they aided our military. And some were separated from their families as they tried to board planes after Kabul fell to the Taliban.

President Donald Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program shortly after taking office, leaving immigrants who had already been approved for travel without a route to enter the U.S. And the State Department suspended funding to help resettle Afghan refugees already in the U.S.

Dadfar’s wife said she is grateful and prayerful for the many people who have stepped forward to help her family resettle and, now, to challenge her husband’s detention.

But as time passes, the family’s distress builds.

“Every time Ali calls, he tells them (the younger children) that he is at work and that he is trying to finish work as soon as possible and return home,” she said.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Dadfar.png,N,,2025-11-24 10:58:45.286910

Political theater is alive and well, a jarring backdrop to the careless brutality of immigration policy under Noem and Trump.
And while one failure won’t derail this out-of-control president or the blatant lies and hypocrisy that pervade his administration, it would be a start.","THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S lying-to-Congress case against former FBI director James Comey is a comedy of legal errors that could move offstage soon. But it has highlighted the plain fact that American life and America itself are now being shaped—in terrible, even tragic ways—by people who really did mislead and outright lie to Congress under oath.

Let’s start at the top. Not just once but twice, Donald Trump put his hand on a Bible and swore to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” He’s been violating that oath, and lying nonstop in all conceivable venues, ever since.

Right below Trump on the organizational chart is the problem wreaking daily havoc on the country: that so many of these havoc perpetrators were less than forthright when they were trying to get their jobs.

For instance, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., founder of an anti-vaccine nonprofit, is a notorious spreader of medical misinformation—he even captured the “top superspreader” title in a 2021 study of COVID-19 misinformation reshares on Twitter. This year he told the Senate Finance Committee under oath that he is not anti-vaccine and would do nothing as health secretary “that makes it difficult or discourages people” from taking vaccines. He also made several commitments to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician, to win his support in the closely divided Senate, then went on to break them.

Among these was a promise to keep language on the Centers for Disease Control website that says vaccines do not cause autism. Kennedy personally broke that one last Wednesday, the latest of the many ways he has undermined and restricted vaccines since becoming health secretary in February, even amid ongoing measles outbreaks. And the misinformation avalanche has not abated. Last month, the man in charge of U.S. public health asserted without evidence that Tylenol and circumcision cause autism.

Then there’s the defense secretary (or, as prefers, war secretary), Pete Hegseth, who has derided the idea of women in the military and in combat. “What do you have to say to the almost 400,000 women who are serving today about your position on whether they should be capable to rise through the highest ranks?” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen asked him at his January confirmation hearing.

Hegseth said he’d tell them he’d be “honored to serve alongside you, shoulder to shoulder, men and women, black, white, all backgrounds with a shared purpose . . . and you will be treated fairly.” But by February he had fired the black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and ousted all four women who were four-star generals. Last month he said he’d hold the military to “the highest male standard” for combat positions—which would likely result in large numbers of women removed from combat roles. “So be it,” he said.

Peak political theater

Kristi Noem, under oath at her confirmation hearing to be homeland security secretary, assured senators that “under President Trump’s administration, disaster and emergency relief will not be handed out with political bias. Every American will be responded to and treated equally.” But that is not what’s happening. She also said Trump has been “very clear that his priority is going to be deporting criminals.” That’s not happening, either.

The crackdowns at workplaces, streets, parks, homes, and courthouses across the country have swept up citizens, legal residents, applicants for legal status, a daycare teacher with a work permit, and even a teenage intern for a judge. They’ve broken up families and destroyed tourism. As of mid-November, nearly three quarters of over 65,000 ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which said “many of those convicted” had committed minor offenses such as traffic violations.

The shows of force by immigration agents and even military troops are designed to terrify communities—the height of performative politics, and it’s working. This after Noem agreed under questioning that immigration policy would be driven by “facts and information,” not “political theater.” Still, as secretary, she quickly earned the nickname ICE Barbie “for her love of dressing up for PR opportunities,” as Daily Beast writer Tom Latchem put it.

Noem “brought her hair extensions to El Salvador,” one headline said, where she posed for a glam shot in front of caged prisoners at CECOT. In other publicity photos, she rides on horseback with the border patrol. She’s usually among men in uniform, often holding a gun, wearing a cowboy hat, a baseball cap with official insignia, whatever headwear fits the cosplay at hand. Political theater is alive and well, a jarring backdrop to the careless brutality of immigration policy under Noem and Trump.

Tense hearings for Trump’s Justice Department picks elicited some whoppers. FBI Director Kash Patel, pressed during his confirmation hearing by Sen. Richard Blumenthal to say he’d protect federal prosecutors who worked on the January 6th case, said under oath that “every FBI employee will be held to the absolute same standard, and no one will be terminated for case assignments.” Pressed further, he added, “All FBI employees will be protected against political retribution.” A few months later, Blumenthal told Patel: “I’m not going to mince words: You lied to us.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi made a similar commitment—in her confirmation hearing’s opening statement, no less. “Most importantly, if confirmed, I will fight every day to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,” she said under oath. “The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.”

Since her promises, and Patel’s, many prosecutors have been fired, forced out, or moved to resign in protest. Among the lawsuits so far are one from Comey’s daughter, former federal prosecutor Maurene Comey, claiming she was fired for unconstitutional political reasons, and one from several ousted agents in part over a demand that the FBI hand over a list of prosecutors who worked on the January 6th case. On top of that, Trump has issued pardons or commutations to hundreds of allies, including 17 politicians and nearly 1,600 who were prosecuted in connection with the January 6th Capitol riot, while urging Bondi to prosecute his enemies—Comey included—as quickly as possible.

A ridiculous case against a hapless foe

Did Comey lie to Congress and obstruct justice? In May 2017 testimony under oath, eight days before Trump fired him, he said he had not been an anonymous source regarding the FBI’s investigations into Trump and Hillary Clinton, nor had he authorized someone else “at the FBI” to be an anonymous source. In 2020 he told senators that he stood by his earlier testimony. The person prosecutors say they’re talking about, Comey friend and adviser Daniel Richman, was not “at the FBI” during the time period in question, according to a Lawfare analysis, and the evidence does not show he was an anonymous source before Comey’s 2017 testimony. Beyond that, the question posed to Comey in 2020 seemed to refer to his deputy, Andrew McCabe—not Richman.

I’m no fan of Comey, whose grave 2016 misjudgments on his Clinton and Trump investigations set us up for the existential crisis we face today. But the case against him is so weak that Erik Siebert, the interim U.S. attorney, declined to prosecute and was then forced out of his job. The episode has grown increasingly surreal under his interim successor, friend-of-Trump and former insurance lawyer Lindsey Halligan.

One judge alone listed eleven findings that “establish a reasonable basis” for a defense challenge, ranging from the painfully inexperienced Halligan seeming to mislead the grand jury on crucial (and far from esoteric) matters of law, to an apparent gap in the record of grand jury proceedings, to an FBI agent exposed to possibly privileged material who “chose to testify before the grand jury” rather than “contain any further exposure to privileged information and limit any prejudice to Mr. Comey.”

Also: Halligan may have been improperly appointed (we’ll likely get a ruling on that question by Thanksgiving). This may be a vindictive prosecution. (Ya think?) On Wednesday, we learned that the grand jury did not see or vote on the final two-count indictment—and by Friday, Comey had filed for dismissal due to these “fundamental errors.”

The whole flimsy, incompetent attempt to punish Comey seems doomed. And while one failure won’t derail this out-of-control president or the blatant lies and hypocrisy that pervade his administration, it would be a start.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NGal!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F790edc73-2ee0-4544-ab6e-20560ac41c62_3546x2364.jpeg",N,,2025-11-24 11:57:13.457192

TOP TALKER

HOMETOWN BOY: Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego returned Friday to the Chicago streets where he grew up, bringing with him a warning for Republicans: The federal immigration enforcement tactics deployed this year in Illinois — particularly in Little Village — will cost them at the ballot box.

On the ground: The Democratic senator shared the prediction in an interview after touring the Chicago neighborhood, where he met with shopkeepers to discuss the aggressive raids carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents under “Operation Midway Blitz.”

A battle-tested veteran: “I fought in urban combat, and the tactics they were using in Little Village, they were treating it like a war zone,” he said, reflecting on his service in the U.S. Marines. “These men were dressed in battle fatigues with automatic weapons in an area that just doesn’t need it.”

His backstory: Gallego serves on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees such matters. He also reports receiving daily updates from his sisters and other family members who live in Illinois.

Seeing red: Reflecting on Latino voters who drifted toward the GOP in 2024, Gallego said “it was frustrating” to see the key voting bloc shift right because he believed Donald Trump “was not going to care about working class people once he got in” and that adviser Stephen Miller would push for “racial profiling and mass deportations.”

Counter-raid: Gallego said many Latino voters initially believed the president intended to target only criminals. But after witnessing the aftermath of the raids in his hometown and hearing from residents, he argued they now see that “that’s not the case.”

He also offered a warning for Democrats. While the party may benefit from growing frustration among Latinos, he said it cannot take that shift for granted. “I don’t think we can just assume that Latinos are going to vote for Democrats if we don’t actually talk to their needs,” he said, adding that Democrats must deliver on economic priorities and immigration reform. “You promised that multiple times. You guys have never done it. So, this is definitely a lesson learned for us.”

Gallego’s visit to Chicago was also sentimental. Walking along 26th Street with Ald. Gilbert “Gil” Villegas — who, like Gallego, served in the Marines — he pointed out restaurants and businesses his family frequented during his youth.

Everywhere he went — the bakery, the grocery store, the quinceañera shop — he said he heard the same concern. “Fear,” Gallego said. “Their own government came and brought fear onto them.”

More on his Chicago visit, from the Tribune’s Andrew Carter.

THE BUZZ

President Donald Trump renewed his push for federal action to curb violence in Chicago after shootings Friday left a 14-year-old dead and eight teens injured.

The shootings happened downtown on the heels of the city’s annual tree-lighting ceremony. Block Club has details.

Mayor Brandon Johnson acknowledged the “emotional whiplash” of the “peaceful” tree-lighting and the shootings that followed. “When we have a setback like this, it just reminds us of the long road that we have to build the city that we all want to live in,” he said Saturday in a press conference to address the shootings.

Trump referenced the incidents in a social-media message posted Saturday. “Massive crime and rioting in the Chicago Loop area,” he wrote. “Governor Pritzker and the Low IQ Mayor of Chicago are refusing Federal Government help for a situation that could be quickly remedied. The people are chanting, BRING IN TRUMP!!!,’ via his Truth social network.

It’s a familiar refrain by Trump who has often characterized Chicago as “a mess.”

So, no surprise, Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker didn’t comment on Trump’s post.

Abigail Spanberger was elected to serve as Virginia’s next governor, leading a wave of wins for Democratic candidates and giving the party a legislative trifecta entering this winter’s General Assembly session.

Amidst the backdrop of change in Richmond, including 13 seats changing parties in the House of Delegates, legislators began prefiling bills for the January session on Nov. 17.

While still in the early stages, and with the session not opening for several more weeks, the Legislature is expecting to take up several issues that could impact lawyers and the legal community at large.

Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, anticipated that the Legislature would take up a variety of issues impacting several areas of law practice.

“In terms of subject matter areas, the big ones are criminal, family law, personal injury, trusts and estates and commercial litigation,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Virginia State Bar has petitioned the Supreme Court of Virginia to engage in legislative activity on several issues in the 2026 session, including bar dues paid by Virginia attorneys.

Bar activity

In September, the Supreme Court of Virginia approved a VSB petition requesting approval to engage in legislative activity to amend Va. Code § 54.1-3912, which governs the cap on bar dues.

The statutory cap on annual bar dues is $250, which has been unchanged since 1995. Annual dues have not been raised since 2000, which the VSB said in its petition to the court makes Virginia’s dues among the lowest in the country.

But rising costs, statutory inflexibility and a drop in new attorneys have led to financial challenges for the bar, which has used reserve savings to supplement a deficit in operating revenue.

Per a news release from the VSB earlier this year, a dues increase “will avoid VSB insolvency by [fiscal year] 2029.”

Representatives of the VSB have not commented beyond what has been made public, including a March release requesting public comment stating that dues would increase “no more than 20 percent [from] the current $250 dues assessment” should the General Assembly amend the code.

A dues increase would also not be automatic, as the VSB has to get approval from the Supreme Court of Virginia for any increase, regardless of the cap.

Earlier this month, the VSB also began soliciting public comment on proposed legislative action to support an increase in pay for guardians ad litem.

The current rate of pay for a guardian ad litem is $57.50 per hour for time spent out of court and $78.85 for time spent in court. A 2025 report by the Office of the Children’s Ombudsman said that “low hourly rate and insufficiency of the recent pay increase” is an underlying reason for a decrease in GALs, with some regions seeing as much as a 37% reduction.

“State leaders should consider providing a more reasonably rate of compensation for the attorneys advocating for Virginia’s children,” the report stated, suggesting a 13.5% increase to $65 per hour out of court and $90 per hour in court.

Glen Allen attorney Joshua Farmer, who focuses his practice on family law and is a guardian ad litem, said the compensation is not what convinces attorneys to do such work.

“I don’t know a single GAL who does the job for the money,” he said. “There’s none to be had. Doing it right requires a significant time commitment.”

Farmer said the low pay is leading to some firms not allowing attorneys to accept GAL appointments, leaving much of that work to solo practitioners and small firm lawyers “who don’t have to explain to a boss why we just spent the whole day on a case that we bill at one-fifth of our normal hourly rate.”

“I do the work because I still find it personally satisfying, but it doesn’t pay the bills,” he added.

Reconsidered measures

During his term, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed more than 400 bills, more than any governor in Virginia history. The bulk of the vetoes came during the last two years of his term, when Democrats controlled both chambers of the General Assembly.

Among the pieces of legislation vetoed or otherwise left behind from prior sessions that Surovell expects to be reintroduced in 2026 are bills on creating a vehicle for class action lawsuits in state courts, the medical malpractice cap, sovereign immunity and the retail sale of cannabis.

Criminal law related topics Surovell said might be addressed range from the “boyfriend loophole” for firearm possession to rules on criminal discovery.

“There’s some bills that Youngkin has been vetoing for the last two years that are definitely going to be on the table this year,” he said.

While its early, it’s expected that some pieces of legislation vetoed by Youngkin could have an easier time being enacted once Spanberger takes office in January.

As of press time, only a handful of bills had been filed for the 2026 session. Among those were two bills that have been referred to the Senate Courts of Justice Committee.

Senate Bill 23 proposes prohibiting plea agreements and court orders from containing provisions waiving a defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights and providing for a right to file a petition requesting police and court record expungement and a right to sealing of criminal history record information.

Senate Bill 24, if passed, would require the Commonwealth to copy or photograph discovery materials that an accused person is permitted to inspect or review upon request. Those materials could include relevant police reports, criminal records and police body-camera footage.

Criminal justice reform not expected

One bill from the 2025 session that will not be refiled is the “Virginia Access to Justice Act,” a sprawling criminal justice reform measure that was left in the Senate Appropriations Committee last session.

The proposal would have established a public defender’s office in each judicial circuit as well as an appellate defender’s office to represent indigent persons in appeals of convictions, raised the limitation on fees that per-hour court-appointed counsel can receive, required commonwealth’s attorneys prosecute misdemeanors that are jailable offenses, and expanded the Virginia Victims Fund to provide financial relief to more victims.

But the bill had a price tag of more than $100 million, which lawmakers and stakeholders balked at.

Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, the bill’s patron, told Virginia Lawyers Weekly he would not reintroduce the act in 2026.

“While it is the right thing to do and sound public policy, this is not the year because of the current fiscal climate,” Deeds said via email.

Surovell said that budget concerns will be an issue in the upcoming session, with lost revenue creating “very little money for new programs or increasing spending.” He added that a recent analysis showed a potential loss of billions of dollars of revenue over the next two years.

“The amount of money that we pay for court-appointed counsel and GALs should be offensive to everybody, and we’re working hard to try to come up with more money,” Surovell said. “But there is very little.”",https://valawyersweekly.com/files/2023/12/Richmond-VA-State-Capitol.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 16:57:48.927755

Investigations and lawsuits The number of lawsuits triggered by the crackdown is growing, including on agents' use of force and conditions at the Broadview center.","CHICAGO — Chicago has entered what many consider a new uneasy phase of a Trump administration immigration crackdown that has already led to thousands of arrests.

While a U.S. Border Patrol commander known for leading intense and controversial surges moved on to North Carolina, federal agents are still arresting immigrants across the nation's third-largest city and suburbs.

A growing number of lawsuits stemming from the crackdown are winding through the courts. Authorities are investigating agents' actions, including a fatal shooting. Activists say they are not letting their guard down in case things ramp up again, while many residents in the Democratic stronghold where few welcomed the crackdown remain anxious.

""I feel a sense of paranoia over when they might be back,"" said Santani Silva, an employee at a vintage store in the predominantly Mexican neighborhood of Pilsen. ""People are still afraid.""

Intensity slows, but arrests continue

For more than two months, the Chicago area was the focus of an aggressive operation led by Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol commander behind similar efforts in Los Angeles and soon Louisiana.

Armed and masked agents used unmarked SUVs and helicopters throughout the city of 2.7 million and its suburbs to target suspected criminals and immigration violators. Arrests often led to intense standoffs with bystanders, from wealthy neighborhoods to working-class suburbs.

While the intensity has died down in the week since Bovino left, reports of arrests still pop up. Activists tracking immigration agents said they confirmed 142 daily sightings at the height of the operation last month. The number is now roughly six a day.

""It's not over,"" said Brandon Lee with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. ""I don't think it will be over.""

Suburb under siege

Bearing the brunt of the operation has been Broadview, a Chicago suburb of roughly 8,000 people that has housed a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center for years.

Protests outside the facility have grown increasingly tense as federal agents used chemical agents that area neighbors felt. Broadview police also launched three criminal investigations into federal agents' tactics.

Community leaders took the unusual step of declaring a civil emergency last week, after Bovino left the area, and moving public meetings online.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said the community has faced bomb threats, death threats and violent protests because of the crackdown.

""I will not allow threats of violence or intimidation to disrupt the essential functions of our government,"" Thompson said.

Questionable arrests and detentions

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has touted more than 3,000 arrests, but the agency has provided details on only a few cases where immigrants without legal permission to live in the country also had a criminal history.

The Trump administration takes to social media to post photos of supposed violent criminals apprehended in immigration operations, but the federal government's own data paints a different picture.

Of 614 immigrants arrested and detained in recent months around Chicago, only 16, less than 3%, had criminal records representing a ""high public safety risk,"" according to federal government data submitted to the court as part of a 2022 consent decree about ICE arrests. Those records included domestic battery and drunken driving.

A judge in the cases said hundreds of immigrant detainees qualify to be released on bond, though an appeals court has paused their release. Attorneys say many more cases will follow as they get details from the government about arrests.

""None of this has quite added up,"" said Ed Yohnka with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, which has been involved in several lawsuits. ""What was this all about? What did this serve? What did any of this do?""

Investigations and lawsuits

The number of lawsuits triggered by the crackdown is growing, including on agents' use of force and conditions at the Broadview center. In recent days, clergy members filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging they were being blocked from ministering inside a facility.

Federal prosecutors have also repeatedly dropped charges against protesters and other bystanders, including dismissing charges against a woman who was shot several times by a Border Patrol agent last month.

Meanwhile, federal agents are also under investigation in connection with the death of a suburban man fatally shot by ICE agents during a traffic stop. Mexico's president has called for a thorough investigation, while ICE has said it did not use excessive force.

An autopsy report, obtained recently by The Associated Press, showed Silverio Villegas González died of a gunshot wound fired at ""close range"" to his neck. The death was declared a homicide.

In October, the body of the 38-year-old father who spent two decades in the U.S. was buried in the western Mexico state of Michoacan.

A chilling effect

Many of the once bustling business corridors in the Chicago area's largely immigrant communities that had quieted down were seeing a buzz again with some street vendors slowly returning to their usual posts.

Andrea Melendez, the owner of Pink Flores Bakery and Cafe, said she has seen an increase in sales this week after struggling for months.

""As a new business, I was a bit scared when we saw sales drop,"" she said. ""But this week I'm feeling a bit more hope that things may get better.""

Eleanor Lara, 52, has spent months avoiding unnecessary trips outside her Chicago home, fearful that an encounter with immigration agents could have dire consequences.

Even as a U.S. citizen, she is afraid and carries her birth certificate. She is married to a Venezuelan man whose legal status is in limbo.

""We're still sticking home,"" she said.",https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/rockcms/2025-11/251124-chicago-immigration-mb-1356-57fd93.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:57:41.785626

One of many features attributable to that hearty band of 74 men and 28 women was the first Thanksgiving a year later in 1621.

Now, 404 years later, as Minnesotans join the rest of the country in celebrating the feast (and football) this Thursday, the nation is struggling with issues surrounding immigration, including the deportation of undocumented aliens, a fundamental feature of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration. During the past 10 months during Trump’s second term, there have been an average of 1,500 daily procedures officially known as “removals,” and the numbers are ballooning, aided by the $76 billion allocated to immigration enforcement over the next four years in the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

A series of concurrent rulings of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and another one this summer upheld four of them, rejecting claims to allow them to remain in the country.

The concurrent ones involved different factual settings for immigrants from three different countries. But they shared common features: In each, the immigrants sought asylum in this country and avoidance of removal from it; in each, their requests were denied by immigration judges and by the Board of Immigration Appeals in administrative proceedings; and in each of them the 8th Circuit in per curiam rulings upheld the denial of their petitions for relief.

The prevalence of the topics of immigration and deportation these days as Thanksgiving approaches provides an opportune occasion to review the trio of cases.

But the 8th Circuit, without discussing the underlying circumstances, upheld the administrative determination that the immigrant did not prove a “well-founded fear of future persecution” and that the “generalized” condition of violence or crime did not warrant relief.

The claim under the Torture Treaty also did not prevail because there was no evidence of torture for “reasons unrelated” to her asylum claim.

Guatemalan group

Another Guatemalan had her application for asylum and ban to removal rejected in De Martinez v. Bondi, 2025 WL 2092391 (8th Cir. July 25, 2025) (per curiam). The asylum seeker, a woman fearing gangs in her country, claimed to have been assaulted twice there by men before joining her husband in this country. But her concern of future harm failed because she did not seek law enforcement assistance after the attacks because of her unwarranted assumption that the local authorities would not help her.

But the key to the appellate affirmation of the administrative decision was that the woman did not belong to a cognizable “social group” entitling her to asylum. That she was living with a brother-in-law when attacked precluded classification as “living alone” for purposes of asylum protection.

Reopening refusal

The 8th Circuit also upheld refusal by the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen an asylum proceeding on behalf of an Indonesian woman who overstayed her non-immigrant visitor status in Tan v. Bondi, 2025 WL 2083117 (8th Cir. July 24, 2025) (per curiam).

The attempt to remain here failed because she did not show a “particularized persecution” based upon her religion or ethnicity in her homeland. Her effort to reopen the asylum case was rejected because the deportation ruling occurred two decades after her original proceedings, and there had not been any “material change” in conditions in her homeland since that time.

A couple of weeks later, the Circuit Court upheld denial of a petition for asylum by another Guatemalan who failed to establish a high level of past persecution in her homeland so that the authorities there were “unwilling or unable” to protect her and her family in Rodriguez v. Bondi, 2025 WL 2254129 (8th Cir. August 7, 2025) (per curiam). The challenge to the BIA determination failed because the alleged persecution was attributable to “private individuals,” and the petition did not establish that the government “could not or would not” control their behavior.

This quartet of cases reflect how President Trump has wished to “get cooperation from the courts” in requiring undocumented immigrants with scant judicial process. “Trump Says Undocumented Immigrants Shouldn’t Get Trials before Deportation,” April 22, 2025, edition of The New York Times.

Lack of independence limits immigration court’s authority Almost from the outset, immigration courts were plagued by a lack of resources, authority and judicial independence.
“We were a legal Cinderella,” said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career.","The government lawyer knew what was coming as she stood inside a courtroom and texted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent waiting in a corridor a few feet away.

“I can’t do this,” the lawyer said in a text message as she looked at her docket of cases. “This is a new emotional load.”

“I understand,” the agent responded. “Hopefully we meet again in a better situation.”

Nearby, a Cuban man who had lived in the United States for years stepped from an elevator and into the courtroom where the government lawyer was waiting for what the man thought was a routine hearing.

The man was doing what the law required, and brought along his wife, a legal resident, and their 7-month-old infant.

Then the lawyer quickly moved to have the man’s asylum claim dismissed and a judge agreed, making the man eligible for “expedited removal.” As he left the courtroom, the man was swarmed by plainclothes immigration agents who had been surveilling him. A struggle ensued and the wife’s shouts could be heard from the hallway as the lawyer moved on to the next case.

The agent replied four minutes later: “Got him.”

Similar scenes of courthouse arrests, part of a makeover of the immigration courts under President Donald Trump, are playing out across the United States as his call for mass deportations of migrants is executed with unusually aggressive tactics.

Trump’s pledge during his 2024 campaign to impose hard-line immigration policies was a major reason he won a second term. Now that Americans have seen how the plan is being implemented, there are signs that many think he has gone too far. About 57 percent of adults disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, according to a survey this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Over several months, reporters for The Associated Press observed immigration court proceedings in 21 cities. Hearings repeatedly ended with cases dismissed by the government, allowing plainclothes federal agents to carry out arrests in courthouse hallways in close coordination with attorneys from the Department of Homeland Security.

Screenshots of the text messages were obtained by The Associated Press from a government official who feared reprisal and provided them on condition of anonymity. The messages offer a rare look at how the nation’s 75 immigration courts are churning out rulings in an assembly-line like fashion and how, for many people, the courtrooms have become deportation traps.

Courthouse arrests coordinated days in advance

In a court system with a backlog of about 3.8 million asylum cases, families have been torn apart and lives upended. Due process seemingly is an afterthought.

“When Americans picture a courtroom, there are a few core expectations” of fairness, dignity and impartiality, said Ashley Tabaddor, a former immigration judge in Los Angeles and past president of the National Association of Immigration Judges.

“That’s what makes a court — not a room with a bench or person with a robe,” she said. “But what we have here is a vision completely turned on its head.”

Over the past nine months, the Trump administration has fired almost 90 immigration judges seen by Trump’s allies as too lenient, directed masked officers to handcuff migrants at closed asylum hearings and sent memos instructing judges to fall into line.

Unlike federal courts, where there are strict rules of procedure and judges have lifetime tenure, the Justice Department runs immigration courts and the attorney general can fire the judges with fewer restraints.

Nine current officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Most expressed deep misgivings about punishing people who had followed the rules and showed up for court hearings.

“As a government attorney, my duty is to uphold the law and protect the public interest — not to secure removal or detention outcomes by default,” a government lawyer wrote to the American Bar Association seeking professional guidance.

But that is not how cases are often unfolding.

Courthouse arrests are coordinated days in advance to meet quotas with little regard for the particulars of a case, according to several of the U.S. officials.

According to one official, Homeland Security lawyers note on a spreadsheet which cases are “amenable” to dismissal, allowing an asylum-seeker to be immediately rearrested and placed in expedited removal proceedings. Most of those detained are men without lawyers who entered the U.S. alone and are expected to appear in court in person. Contrary to Trump’s claims that he is targeting the “worst of the worst,” most don’t have a criminal conviction, according to a Cato Institute analysis of ICE data.

ICE reviews the spreadsheet and selects which people it wants to pursue if cases are dismissed. On the hearing date, federal agents communicate directly with DHS lawyers, who act as prosecutors in immigration courts. The lawyer often provides near verbatim updates of the proceedings over text message to agents waiting outside the courtroom.

“Black shirt? Let me know if the judge dismissed,” an ICE agent texted during one hearing.

Lack of independence limits immigration court’s authority

Almost from the outset, immigration courts were plagued by a lack of resources, authority and judicial independence.

The courts were established in 1952, but it was not until 1973 that “special inquiry officers” were given the “judge” title and allowed to wear judicial robes. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, was created in 1983. But that agency remained a part of the Justice Department, giving the attorney general authority to override decisions.

“We were a legal Cinderella,” said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career. “No other court in the nation functions like this.”

The first Trump administration undertook a series of changes to reduce the case backlog, including instructing judges to deny entire categories of asylum claims such as for victims of gang or domestic violence.

It also set up a dashboard that would become the bane of many judges: Red, yellow and green gauges measure each judge’s performance on goals ranging from completed cases — a minimum of 700 annually, regardless of complexity — to how many custody cases were decided on their first hearings.

To meet the metrics, judges must race through dockets, sometimes devoting mere minutes to evaluate asylum-seekers’ claims.

“It’s like deciding death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” Marks said.

Administration refers to immigration judges as ‘inferior officers’

When Trump returned to the White House in January, his allies took direct aim at the court.

Since then, the Justice Department has issued 52 policy memos — more than the previous six years combined — making it easier to hire and fire judges and warning against pro-migrant bias.

The memos highlight the courts’ weakened status by referring to judges as “inferior officers” — a rarely used term taken from the Constitution.

In early September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would lend 600 military lawyers to the immigration courts, about equal to the current number of judges. The goal, according to the administration, is to more effectively reduce caseloads by widening the pool of potential judges to include people already steeped in administrative law. But many migrant advocates are concerned the incoming judges lack the necessary experience to decide asylum cases.

“It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement,” said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

The administration has pushed back against criticism it is co-opting the courts to accelerate its deportation goals. In a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said DHS decides whether to arrest migrants and that most judges consider it an “honor rather than an insult” to be called an inferior officer empowered by the Constitution and serving at the will of the attorney general.

Baldassarre likened a record surge of asylum-seekers during the Biden administration to an “improper conspiracy between DHS and the Immigration Courts to effectuate an unlawful amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.” The Justice Department, she said, had “restored the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the Courts.”

DHS did not respond to repeated email and phone requests for comment.

Government attorneys fear harassment, haunted by arrests

For some inside the courts, work has become a stressful, lonesome grind. Fear prevails. Resumes are being updated.

One DHS lawyer described being haunted at night by the sound of jangling shackles of migrants the lawyer helped arrest. The lawyer joined the government after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, believing that protecting America’s borders was a patriotic duty.

The lawyer still cherishes a signed copy of Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel’s memoir “Night,” which was handed out at a work seminar. “Think higher, feel deeper,” reads the author’s inscription of the book, which is marked DHS “Training Material.”

Today, its message torments.

“This isn’t what any of us signed up for,” the lawyer said.

After a turbulent summer, the courthouses are starting to look lonely, too. With word spreading that a trap had been laid, many migrants, fearing arrest, are asking to appear online or are skipping hearings altogether.

Meanwhile, ambitious managers are publicly upbraiding those who raise doubts about the legality of locking up migrants with no criminal record in packed facilities. In a recent town hall with DHS principal legal adviser Charles Wall, several lawyers complained about the pressure, confusing orders and lack of resources, according to notes from the meeting shared with AP.

Wall said the pace is likely to continue for years, the notes say. When one federal employee asked about bringing firearms to work for fear of harassment by activists inside courthouses, Wall said that judges should not hesitate to kick out the public. Wall could not be reached for comment.

‘I want to go back to my country’

The harsh tactics have had one effect the administration wants: Voluntary migrant departures have soared, with more than 14,000 people seeking court permission to self-deport in the first eight months of 2025, according to federal data collected by Mobile Pathways, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that pushes for transparency in migration proceedings. That is more than the previous five years combined. The number is almost certainly an undercount because most migrants do not withdraw their asylum claim before self-deporting.

At immigration court in Tacoma, the detainees came up one after the other with the same plea.

“I want to go back to my country,” a Venezuelan man told Judge Theresa Scala.

“I want to leave the country,” said a man from Mexico.

Immigrants know what they face: detention centers with ominous names — “Alligator Alcatraz,” “Louisiana Lockup” and “Speedway Slammer” — as well as workplace raids and neighborhood dragnets.

Fired judges targeted as too liberal

Tania Nemer believes she was cut out to be a judge. From the bench at immigration court in Cleveland, she prided herself on listening carefully to each person’s asylum claim.

“There’s a simplicity about it that I just loved,” she told the AP. “If you can provide justice in an efficient manner, you can really help a lot of people.”

The decision to apply to become an immigration judge in 2023 was deeply personal. Her father fled turmoil in Lebanon and arrived in Ohio at 16 with $6 in his pocket. He washed cars, learned English and eventually opened a namesake bar — Manny’s Pub — that allowed him to provide for his family. When Nemer married, her wedding gift was the unspent dollar bills, so she would never forget her roots.

But Nemer’s fondness for the law came crashing down Feb. 5. In the middle of a hearing, her supervisor opened the door of her packed courtroom and told her she needed to come with him.

“As soon as he said ‘Grab your ID,’ I knew I was being terminated,” she said.

Still in shock, she was handed a two-paragraph letter, digitally signed by Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It said she was being removed because the agency “has determined that retaining you is not appropriate, and we thank you for your service.”

No justification was given. But she thinks she knows some of the reasons: her Arab-sounding name, a history of previously representing migrants and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, course work from Cornell University. She filed a discrimination claim with the Justice Department to find out why she was fired; the complaint was dismissed.

Nemer was the first judge fired after Trump returned to the White House. But 86 have been sacked since. Dozens more took the Department of Government Efficiency’s “Fork in the Road” resignation offer.

The majority were hired under Democratic President Joe Biden and are still serving two-year probationary periods, according to a list of the fired judges obtained by the AP.

It is unclear who ordered the firings or how they were selected. But those removed granted asylum at markedly higher rates than their peers — in about half of all cases since August 2023 compared with 34 percent nationwide, according to Mobile Pathways.

Among those purged were all 10 that appeared on the DHS Bureaucrat Watch List, a website created last year with funding from The Heritage Foundation, whose Project 2025 was a blueprint for the Trump administration’s policies and personnel decisions.

The list includes names, Facebook photos, salaries and campaign donations for what it calls “America’s most subversive immigration bureaucrats.” One target was Emmett Soper, a judge in northern Virginia who worked at EOIR headquarters during the Biden administration.

“As soon as I saw that, I knew the rules were changing, that I was under some kind of microscope that didn’t exist before,” he said.

Tom Jones, the conservative creator of the website, declined to be interviewed.

Baldassarre, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said the department is not targeting specific individuals for firing but does continually evaluate all judges.

“All judges have a legal, ethical, and professional obligation to be impartial and neutral in adjudicating cases,” Baldassarre said. “If a judge violates that obligation by demonstrating a systematic bias in favor of or against either party, EOIR is obligated to take action to preserve the integrity of its system.”

The wave of firings and new directives from the Justice Department has had a chilling effect. Denial of motions to appear for hearings online tripled after a March memo repealing Biden-era guidelines instructing judges to generally grant such requests, according to Mobile Pathways data. Denial of continuances, which allow migrants extra time to seek legal counsel, have also spiked as have the number of cases classified as abandoned.

Nemer returned to immigration court in October for the first time since being fired to represent a Mexican client she has known for 20 years and who was picked up by unidentified agents. While the man was jailed, his girlfriend, who was five months pregnant, miscarried.

Word of the former judge’s return quickly spread and a stream of former colleagues came to the courtroom to hug her and express their dismay over her firing.

“By the third hug I couldn’t hold it in and just started crying,” she said.

Legal assistance for migrants dries up after Trump budget cuts

Bug spray, sunscreen, fans and umbrellas compete with legal binders in the bed of a Toyota pickup across the street from immigration court in San Antonio.

This is the new office of American Gateways.

In April, the administration eliminated programs worth $30 million to provide free legal assistance to migrants, the vast majority of whom represent themselves in court.

The flood of claims threatens to clog the already crowded federal docket, which has little authority in immigration cases.

“The administration is attempting to press the gas at such an unreasonable speed without considering due process,” said Annelise Araujo, a Boston-based immigration attorney.

One petition, filed in Miami, was from a Cuban man detained the same day he and his American wife and 10-month-old daughter were moving into their first home. Several petitioners said they had survived torture at the hands of gangs in Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela.

Another legal challenge was introduced by an HIV-positive man from Brazil taken into custody four days after his husband died of a heart attack. With the body of Frederico Abreu’s husband still at the funeral home, ICE officials knocked on his door stating they had documents belonging to the deceased man.

A father pulled away from his sobbing family

Those unable to afford a lawyer so they can sue in federal court have little recourse.

One was a man from Honduras who showed up at the northern Virginia immigration court with his wife and their infant baby. Another child, a son, unable to walk, pushed himself in a wheelchair studded with flashing, colorful lights. The family, fearful of further immigration problems, did not want to be identified.

The judge denied a government request to deport the man. But seconds later, as the family stepped from the courtroom, they were stopped by four ICE agents.

The wife sobbed, hanging on her husband’s arm as she pleaded: “Por favor, Por favor.”

The husband clutched the sleeping infant’s carrier. Their son sat playing with a cell phone.

“I need you to go ahead and say goodbye,” an agent told the man. Crying, the man knelt to hug his son, who clung to his father, yelling repeatedly: “Papa! Papa!”

Finally, the father managed to pull himself away and started to leave with the ICE officers.

The boy tried to chase them. But the ICE agent was holding the back of the wheelchair as the boy futilely pumped his arms.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed his July arrest. The family said he was later deported. Homeland Security said he voluntarily agreed to leave the country and returned to Honduras on Oct. 8 after three months in detention.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Immigration_Court_Takeover_00070-384de.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:58:50.504652

The revisions to state law were made in response to residents’ concerns about federal immigration policy. Divided along party lines, state Democrats have worked to address immigrants’ assertions that they are living in fear.

Here’s what you need to know about what ICE can do in Connecticut.

What changes were made in the latest state legislation?

In November’s special session, state lawmakers passed House Bill 8004 which included sections that limit ICE from making arrests at courthouses. The bill prohibits representatives of a local, state or federal law enforcement authority from arresting people inside state courthouses without a judicial warrant. ICE agents are also not allowed to wear masks on courthouse grounds without a medical requirement.

There are also measures to protect immigrants’ personal information. State agencies are not allowed to share personal information such as dates and times of court hearings and appointments, home addresses, and workplaces.

Gov. Ned Lamont signed the bill into law shortly after the special session.

Can Connecticut law enforcement turn immigrants over to ICE?

In 2019, Connecticut lawmakers passed the Trust Act, which specified the grounds on which local and state officials are allowed to turn over unauthorized migrants to ICE. The Act prohibits state law enforcement from arresting individuals solely on the basis of detainers — requests from ICE to hold someone for up to 48 hours so agents can then pick them up.

Law enforcement officers may comply with detainers only if ICE has a judicial warrant to make an arrest, or if the individual in their custody has been convicted of a class A or B felony, or identified on a terrorist watch list. Class A or B felonies include murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, and first-degree manslaughter.

The Trust Act was modified in May of this year. Now, individuals can sue cities and towns if the Act is violated. Further, the circumstances under which law enforcement must comply with ICE requests for detainment were expanded to include 13 more crimes and broaden who is considered a law enforcement official.

What happens when ICE makes an arrest?

While the recent laws intended to make courthouses safer for immigrants in Connecticut, ICE agents can still make arrests in other public areas without a warrant if they have a reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual they are targeting is an unauthorized migrant, as per the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Further, aside from courthouse grounds, there are no laws requiring ICE agents to show their face, or prohibiting masks. This means that ICE agents may still approach an individual in a mask and make an arrest, without a warrant.

How does the state recommend state agencies respond to ICE visits?

In a document from Lamont’s office issued in January, the state provides guidance on how state agencies should handle visits from ICE to comply with state and federal laws while also protecting individuals’ privacy rights.

The guide instructs state officials to request information on why the ICE agent is making a visit, notify legal counsel, and refrain from sharing any personal information or documents such as immigration status until a legal counsel reviews the request.

ICE also has limited access to non-public areas. They are prohibited from accessing non-public areas of a state agency building without a judicial warrant. But there is no legislation to limit their movements in public premises of an establishment. For example, an ICE agent could make an unwarranted arrest on a sidewalk outside of the state facility.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP-ice-arrest.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 09:56:53.270155

While the job advertisements did not explicitly cite Alligator Alcatraz, it is the only detention facility in that location.
The office of CORE is intended to review complaints about human rights abuses by Canadian companies abroad in the oil and gas, garment, and mining sectors.
For Canadian companies, committing to them can offer the veneer of dedication to fair labour practices and environmental responsibility without much scrutiny.
“Maybe Canadian companies are a little bit cleaner than other companies in a global comparison,” he says.","On August 21, the Federal District Court in Miami ordered the closure of the Florida detention centre known as Alligator Alcatraz. Two weeks later, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled to pause that lower court decision. Alligator Alcatraz—and all the controversy surrounding it—was resurrected.

Built in just eight days in the Everglades wetlands, the facility was intended to hold up to 5,000 federal immigration detainees. In July, around 1,800 people were confined there in groups of thirty-two inside disaster-relief tents, where conditions reportedly swung between extreme cold and heat, with sewage hauled out and drinking water brought in. Speaking to the Associated Press, migrant detainees and their lawyers described worm-infested food, swarms of mosquitoes, windowless cells, flooded floors with fecal waste, and insufficient showers and toilets.

The centre faced lawsuits from the American Civil Liberties Union and others citing due-process violations. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe also challenged the site, arguing no environmental review was conducted before it was built. In her late-August ruling on the latter case, US district judge Kathleen M. Williams ruled that detainees must be relocated within sixty days, barred new transfers, and ordered much of the facility dismantled. The state appealed and asked the ruling be paused while their appeal was heard. The stay was granted, and detainees once again began to be transferred to the Everglades facility.

Among the companies contracted to provide services for Alligator Alcatraz are IRG Global Emergency Management—a US offshoot of ARS Global Emergency Management, a Toronto-based company also known as Access Restoration Services Ltd—and a US-based business unit of Quebec-based security operator GardaWorld. IRG Global Emergency Management was incorporated only this past February, yet it has received a total of $25.8 million (US) from the state of Florida so far this year—$6.2 million (US) of that in contracts to provide operational support to Alligator Alcatraz.

Headquartered in Virginia, GardaWorld’s US arm—GardaWorld Federal—has an $8 million (US) contract to provide services for the detention site. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson wrote that the company could not comment on a specific facility or service due to its contractual obligations with the Florida Department of Emergency Management.) In July, it was advertising vacancies for full-time positions based in a remote part of southern-central Florida for armed security guards and correctional officers, with a preference for candidates who were bilingual in English and Spanish.

While the job advertisements did not explicitly cite Alligator Alcatraz, it is the only detention facility in that location. The job descriptions indicated a potentially dangerous working environment, noting that “employees may be exposed to extreme cold or hot weather conditions, fumes, or airborne particles, toxic or caustic chemicals, and loud noise.” (According to a GardaWorld spokesperson, GardaWorld Federal is governed separately and the parent company does not have visibility on its hiring practices.) Such conditions are legal under Florida jurisdiction, says Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst and a spokesperson for the Florida Immigrant Coalition. “Unfortunately, Florida does not have any real meaningful labor laws,” he wrote in an email. “We live in a hellish state.”

While it may seem disturbing for any Canadian-linked entity to be involved in the operations of a detention centre accused of human rights abuses, they aren’t breaking the law. And that’s part of a bigger problem, says Aidan Gilchrist-Blackwood, network coordinator at the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability. “There is, unfortunately, a precedent of really serious abuses being documented and linked to the Canadian security sector around the world.” The CNCA, a coalition of forty-two civil society groups, fights to hold Canadian companies to account for human rights abuses and environmental destruction.

Whether IRG or GardaWorld are implicated in the allegations against the facility is not clear, and there may be no way to hold them responsible even if they are. “Right now,” says Gilchrist-Blackwood, “there really are not good mechanisms in Canada for accountability for abuses linked to Canadian companies outside of Canada.”

The Chaos Trump Unleashed Is Just Getting Started

Migrants Follow Risky Path into Canada as US Deportation Threats Grow

I’ve Visited Guantánamo 28 Times as a Reporter. It Still Defies Belief

In 2019, the federal government under then prime minister Justin Trudeau created the office of the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise. The office of CORE is intended to review complaints about human rights abuses by Canadian companies abroad in the oil and gas, garment, and mining sectors. The body reports to the minister of international trade.

But from the start, the office was criticized as toothless because it lacked the ability to compel witnesses and documents in its investigations. It was also limited in its scope, as businesses outside the sectors monitored could not be examined. Its first ombudsperson, Sheri Meyerhoffer, stepped down from her five-year term at the end of April 2024. An interim leader occupied the role until this past May. Meyerhoffer’s replacement hasn’t yet been appointed, and there has been no job application posted to fill the role.

The minister of international trade under Global Affairs issued a review of CORE at the time of Meyerhoffer stepping down, but that report has not been presented to Parliament. The CORE website still invites people to email or call to file complaints, but without an ombudsperson appointed, those complaints cannot be investigated. (A recent CTV report noted that the newly released federal budget does not specify whether this role will be filled.)

Even if CORE were fully staffed and its mandate extended to cover the security sector, it would most likely not apply to the Canadian companies whose US affiliates have contracts with Alligator Alcatraz. “There’s really nothing to stop a Canadian company from going out anywhere in the world and getting involved in serious human rights abuses,” said James Yap, a Toronto-based lawyer specializing in business and human rights. “And it extends far beyond the US.”

This gap in oversight points to a larger trend: the steady outsourcing of state functions to private operators. Beginning in the 1980s in the US and 1990s in Canada, governments started to reduce state services and embrace privatization for certain nationally run institutions, such as prisons, as a way to trim bureaucracies and cut costs. Many private security companies then further honed their expertise during the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, setting up and then managing the daily operations of military bases. Security operators “have the gear at the ready in their storage houses, and it’s great for the government because it doesn’t have to worry,” says Aaron Ettinger, associate professor of political science at Carleton University. “But moving fast often means making a lot of mistakes, and that is certainly what is happening in Florida right now.”

In January 2023, Florida governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in the state, citing a crisis due to the influx of illegal migrants. This state of emergency has been extended multiple times—most recently in late September of this year—and grants the government extraordinary powers. DeSantis and the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) are able to award contracts without the usual regulatory oversight and bypassing procurement and competitive bidding rules. And no audit has been completed of this spending. (DeSantis’s office and FDEM did not respond to interview requests.)

Both the US-based entity of ARS and IRG have enmeshed themselves in Florida state affairs to varying degrees. The Orlando Weekly and other outlets have reported that, in 2022, Access Restoration Services US, Inc. made a $99,980 (US) donation to the governor’s political action committee at the time, Friends of Ron DeSantis. The donation was made several days before DeSantis was re-elected. The company donated a further $99,980 (US) to the Republican Party of Florida in 2023 and $50,000 in 2024, plus an additional $75,000 to former Florida attorney general Ashley Moody. While reporting varies, the total contributions amount to at least around $325,000 (US). In 2023, the company also hired Tallahassee-based Ballard Partners to lobby on its behalf; the group’s lobbyists include former DeSantis administration officials, and head Brian Ballard is a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump.

ARS USA landed an open-ended contract in 2023 to transport unauthorized migrants, and in July of that year, it received the first state payment for $6 million (US). Subsequent contracts came from the US federal government and at state level to do rescue operations in Israel and Haiti, as well as hurricane disaster relief in North Carolina and Florida.

That year, a Houston law firm in which ARS had previously invested $3 million (US) was alleged to have engaged in insurance fraud concerning hurricane damages in multiple states. According to reporting by WGCU, an NPR and PBS affiliate for Southwest Florida, ARS also faced lawsuits and accusations that it had inflated its restoration costs. (ARS reportedly broke ties with and sued the law firm and has denied all allegations against the company.)

This involvement did not seem to harm its reputation in the eyes of the US government. The Orlando Weekly and the Miami Herald reported that, this past June, ARS offshoot IRG Global Emergency Management received its initial two contracts. The first was for $19,678,600 (US) to transport Israeli evacuees from Cyprus. And the second was for $1,180,000 (US) for operational support services for “migration efforts.” This second contract was granted on June 24, the same day IRG made a $10,000 (US) donation to the Republican Party of Florida. Later, IRG signed a further two contracts worth $2.2 million (US) and $2.9 million (US) to provide onsite emergency services, site shuttles, and arms management for the facility.

“All of this is basically a legalized form of bribery: it’s favour-buying from elected officials.”

According to a newsletter from ARS Responds Canada, a company that shares the same Toronto business address as ARS Global Emergency Management, chief executive officer Joseph Gagliano is based in Toronto, where his family founded the company in 1959. In July of this year, the CEO of IRG was listed as Giuseppe Gagliano, and the president was Robbie Meek. As of October, Meek is now listed as CEO and president on the company’s website. Only weeks after IRG was formed, Meek and the company donated a total of $6,000 (US) to the campaign account of Florida attorney general James Uthmeier, a key figure spearheading the plans for Alligator Alcatraz. The Orlando Sentinel reported that IRG donated another $3,000 (US) to Uthmeier in June.

“All of this is basically a legalized form of bribery: it’s favour-buying from elected officials. It’s also standard procedure and entirely out in the open,” says Ettinger, who notes that while campaign donation rules vary by state, they are porous enough in the US that corporations can often donate without significant limitations. “It undermines the public’s interest in government contracting based on merit because it introduces quid pro quo motives into the mix. It’s good for business, not good for democracy or efficient market-based government contracting.”

When reached for comment on this story, ARS emailed that “ARS USA is not affiliated with ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ in any capacity,” that it is a “completely separate and independent entity from IRG Global Emergency Management,” and that it “does not hold, manage, or participate in any contracts related to” the Florida site. The spokesperson referred further questions to the Canada-based office, which offered a similar clarification, saying that it “delivers emergency response and restoration services for the insurance and property management sectors” and “operates as a wholly independent entity, and is in no way associated with the operations of ARS USA or IRG USA.” IRG Global Emergency Management did not respond to interview requests.

“There is no enforceable due diligence responsibility that companies would have to monitor what their foreign subsidiaries do,” says Burkard Eberlein, professor of public policy and sustainability at Schulich School of Business. “Under Canadian corporate law, these are separate legal entities, so a subsidiary would be a separate legal entity, and there’s no automatic responsibility.”

Some companies and industries may have their own code of conduct—like the Mining Association of Canada’s Towards Sustainable Mining Protocol—but such codes are voluntary. “Those standards, if they exist, what can they do?” says Eberlein. “There’s definitely a difference between mining, where there’s at least an attempt to have those standards and implement them, versus the private security business.”

Canada also lacks supply chain–tracking regulations, which would require subsidiary companies to ensure materials sourced from abroad meet domestic standards. There is nothing here comparable to European Union supply traceability mechanisms like the EU Deforestation Regulation, which mandates that companies of a certain size demonstrate that products such as coffee, cocoa, and rubber are produced in compliance with the laws of their country of origin and have not contributed to deforestation before they can be sold in the EU.

The federal government’s fall 2024 economic update indicated that the Canadian government would introduce legislation that would hold Canadian companies responsible if any component of their supply chains involves forced labour or child labour. But there have been no updates on any such legislation since then.

To Eberlein, all of these voluntary codes and standards are about reputation management. For Canadian companies, committing to them can offer the veneer of dedication to fair labour practices and environmental responsibility without much scrutiny. “Maybe Canadian companies are a little bit cleaner than other companies in a global comparison,” he says. “Is that good enough? No, but if you want to do more, it would shake up the whole sector and be quite costly.”

Founded by Canadian Stéphan Crétier in 1995, GardaWorld operates globally, offering services such as private armed guards, bank security, armoured trucks, and airport security screening. (The Canadian branch of the multinational business is headquartered in Montreal, while Crétier resides in Dubai.)

GardaWorld’s financial contributions in Florida seem relatively minor; the Miami Herald reported that GardaWorld Cash—a subsidiary of GardaWorld—donated $5,000 (US) to a DeSantis PAC in 2018. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson wrote that the company’s “political activities, if any, comply with applicable laws and are disclosed through public reporting channels. Beyond that, we do not comment on specific contributions made by our business units.”)

Yet the firm has courted its own share of controversy. Four GardaWorld staff were killed in Iraq after they were kidnapped in 2007; the company reportedly never confirmed if it attempted to pay a ransom. A GardaWorld spokesperson wrote they were not authorized to comment on the incident, but that the description “does not accurately reflect what transpired.” The spokesperson added that “this tragedy continues to pain all of the team, and our sympathies remain firmly with the families and colleagues of those team members.”

In 2012, two GardaWorld staff in Afghanistan, where the company provided security work for the US government, were found with stockpiles of unlicensed assault rifles. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson stated that the weapons “were being taken to be tested at a firing range before being purchased and properly licensed by GardaWorld,” and that it had complied with all Afghan laws and regulations in its operations in the country.)

Two years later, Afghan officials detained GardaWorld’s country manager and accused him of holding unlicensed rifles and radios. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson described the incident as “the result of an administrative misunderstanding” which was resolved, and added that GardaWorld “continued to operate in the country, uninterrupted.”) In 2020, a former GardaWorld employee sued the company, accusing it in part of falsifying the training records of staff heading to Afghanistan. Some of the accusations were dismissed, while others were allowed to go forward. The company denied the allegations in court, and it settled the case with the former employee in 2024.

In 2023, the city of Denver opted not to contract GardaWorld, operating as Aegis Defense Services LLC, to run its migrant centres after the non-profit American Friends Service Committee released a report linking the company to unsafe conditions at other detention facilities where it was contracted. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson wrote that the report “mischaracterizes GardaWorld Federal’s activities” and that it “incorrectly attributes activities or vendor roles to GardaWorld.”)

Those facilities include a centre in Fort Bliss, Texas, where the report noted that GardaWorld was contracted with the federal government to provide services to migrants who had crossed the border as unaccompanied minors. In 2022, an internal report from the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General detailed poor living conditions and administration of services at the facility. (GardaWorld Federal is not mentioned in the government report. In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson wrote that GardaWorld Federal’s “primary role at the facility was to provide medical care for unaccompanied children waiting to be reunited with their families.”)

In a separate investigation, the Tampa Bay Times found that GardaWorld’s armoured truck business often used drivers with insufficient training and failed to maintain their trucks, putting them at risk for accidents. GardaWorld has disputed these findings, and a spokesperson wrote in an email that the claims against the company “have long been dismissed without any finding against GardaWorld Cash.”

GardaWorld’s revenue amounted to around $4 billion in 2021. In 2022, the Quebec government invested $300 million into GardaWorld through Investissement Québec, purchasing preferred shares at market conditions. “Anyone who owns a $300 million chunk of any company [this size] has significant influence in the operations of that company,” says Yap. The office of Christine Fréchette, Quebec’s minister of economy, innovation, and energy, has not responded to interview requests.

Québec solidaire’s Andrés Fontecilla, member of the National Assembly of Quebec for Laurier-Dorion, has been critical of the provincial government’s handling of this issue. “We denounce the fact that government money is being used to finance, even indirectly, concentration camps for migrants whose only crime is being illegal immigrants,” Fontecilla wrote in a statement over email.

The MNA explained that the Quebec government–granted financial assistance takes the form of preferred shares, a financial tool halfway between equity and a loan. The government will adjust the interest rate paid by GardaWorld based on the number of jobs created. Fontecilla points out that since the 2022 loan from the government is tied to subsidies for increasing jobs, it could be possible that Alligator Alcatraz contracts count toward those job increases, in which case government money is entangled in the detention centre. (In an email, a GardaWorld spokesperson wrote that the GardaWorld Federal “would not be the recipient of any funding from Canada-based government entities attributed to GardaWorld.”)

“Quebec should absolutely hold GardaWorld accountable for the investments it makes in various projects,” wrote Fontecilla. “Even if the government says that Quebec’s portion of funding did not go toward investments in Alligator Alcatraz, it remains a significant amount, and it’s not clear that the government actually has figures to demonstrate that no Quebec taxpayer money was used for this purpose.”

Amidst growing reporting on both companies’ involvement with Alligator Alcatraz, Ettinger believes the Canadian government has kept silent on this issue because making a statement condemning it could antagonize Trump and unsettle ongoing trade negotiations.

This would not be the first ethically messy entanglement between a federal Liberal government and a private corporation accused of wrongdoing. In 2019, a division of the Montreal-based engineering conglomerate SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. was alleged to have paid $47.7 million to Saadi Gaddafi, son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, for help in securing Libyan construction contracts. Ethics commissioner Mario Dion found four significant troubling attempts by then prime minister Justin Trudeau and his staff to influence attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to issue a deferred prosecution agreement, which would have allowed the company to dodge criminal charges. Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet member, Jane Philpott, resigned in protest, and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada ultimately found that SNC-Lavalin should stand trial.

“We don’t have these laws; we have these massive gaps in our regulation.”

Karen Hamilton, director of Above Ground—a group advocating for Canadian corporate accountability—is concerned about how the volatile US–Canada relations may be shaping the current federal government’s handling of corporate human rights concerns abroad.

“It’s a specific moment, there’s a threat to Canadian identity, there are concerns around tariffs, and that’s taking the immediate attention of the new government,” said Hamilton.

When reached for comment, John Babcock, a media relations spokesperson at Global Affairs Canada, wrote: “The Government of Canada expects Canadian companies operating abroad to abide by all relevant laws, to respect human rights in their operations, and to adopt best practices and internationally respected guidelines on responsible business conduct.” He noted that a new five-year strategy for Responsible Business Conduct abroad was launched in 2022. The strategy includes a focus on due diligence and accountability and applies to all Canadian companies active abroad, regardless of size, sector, or scope. These guidelines are, however, voluntary.

France passed legislation in 2017 requiring its multinational companies to guard against human rights abuses irrespective of whether they are operating on French soil or abroad. In June 2024, South Korea proposed its own such law. And the EU has been negotiating a similar legislative framework. Reflecting on GardaWorld, Hamilton noted, “We don’t have these laws; we have these massive gaps in our regulation.”

As of mid-November, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit’s ruling remains in place. The appellant court has halted Judge Williams’s verdict, siding with the federal and state governments’ petition asking to pause the lower court ruling to shut down the facility. In a 2–1 decision, the appellant court found that Alligator Alcatraz could not be considered to be a project of the federal government because Florida built and operates the facility with state money. And, as it is not a federal initiative, the demand for a mandatory environmental assessment study did not apply. Such assessments are obligatory under the National Environmental Policy Act for all federal projects.

“Florida will undoubtedly be harmed if it cannot ‘apply its own laws’ to respond to an immigration crisis and serve the public interest,” the majority appeals court ruling stated. Both judges who were in favour of the government—Judge Barbara Lagoa and Judge Elizabeth L. Branch—were nominated by Trump. Dissenting Judge Adalberto Jordan was nominated by former president Barack Obama. Judge Lagoa is married to lawyer Paul Huck of Florida firm Lawson Huck Gonzalez. According to WUSF, an NPR affiliate in Tampa Bay, the law firm has ties to the DeSantis administration and has secured over $10 million (US) in state contracts since its founding in 2023. The firm has no ties to Alligator Alcatraz.

The original appeal against Miami’s Federal District Court ruling will now go ahead, with the case being heard by a fresh slate of appellate judges. And this further ruling will determine whether to reinstate Judge Williams’s injunction to shut down Alligator Alcatraz or overrule the closure decision altogether. On October 10, the Department of Justice requested the appeal proceedings be paused, citing the federal government shutdown at the time.

Despite the uncertainty around the Everglades complex, the DeSantis government has opened a second immigration detention facility—currently given the moniker “Deportation Depot”—at a state prison west of Jacksonville. And plans are being discussed to open a third centre in the Florida Panhandle.

Five months into operations, both IRG Global Emergency Management and GardaWorld Federal continue to fulfill their contracts with Alligator Alcatraz. And according to the Globe and Mail, the US offshoot of GardaWorld has been shortlisted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), along with thirty-nine additional companies, to compete for further detention centre contracts.

“It’s always been very difficult and painful, but it’s never been this bad,” says Mich P. González, a lawyer at Sanctuary of the South. SOS is a group providing legal services to migrants and fostering sanctuary spaces, and it’s being represented by the ACLU, ACLU of Florida, and Americans for Immigrant Justice in a lawsuit against members of the Trump administration, De Santis, and other state officials over “the government’s attempts to prevent people detained in civil immigration custody at Alligator Alcatraz from communicating with legal counsel and from filing motions with the immigration court that could result in their release from detention.” (One count in the complaint was dismissed in August.) Based out of New Orleans, González is representing several clients being held at Alligator Alcatraz.

One of them, Michael Borrego Fernandez, is a lead plaintiff in SOS’s lawsuit. A Cuban national, he was arrested on June 10 for a parole violation and outstanding traffic violations. He was transferred to the detention centre on July 5, and he alleges that, while there, he had to have an emergency surgery due to excessive bleeding and did not have access to essential post-surgery medications.

His mother, Yaneisy Fernandez Silva, says she had no direct communication from immigration officials or staff at Alligator Alcatraz. Her son had access to a monitored phone. González attempted to visit Borrego Fernandez on July 30 but was turned away at the facility and told no visit would be possible until August 4. On August 1, Borrego Fernandez was transferred to another detention centre—the Krome facility in Miami—where González was able to see him in person without an appointment the following morning.

“It is not a place for human habitation, it’s a concentration camp.”

González describes a concerted effort to make Alligator Alcatraz’s operations clandestine. He notes that, while it is standard practice to have a hard time contacting authorities at migrant detention centres, Alligator Alcatraz has been exceptionally untransparent and difficult.

“There’s no clear source of authority over their custody that you can ask for help,” says González. “It took us forever just to get a good contact to request a legal virtual call. And there are no in-person legal visits—that is unheard of.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, has continually argued that it is not running Alligator Alcatraz. In early October, however, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursed the state of Florida $608 million (US) for its spending on Alligator Alcatraz and other immigration detention centres now operating within Florida. In the Court of Appeals ruling, the majority sided with Homeland Security and the other defendants, stating that even with such federal funding assistance, Alligator Alcatraz should not be considered to be federally managed.

Adding to an already murky chain of authority, under the 287(g) program—referring to section 287(g)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act—ICE can authorize state and local law enforcement to perform immigration officer duties. In this case, the state of Florida is detaining undocumented migrants at the centre. The majority of detainees held at Alligator Alcatraz do not appear on ICE’s public database, making it difficult to verify who is there at any given time. Immigrants held at such centres are also being transported via chartered flights run by private contractors to other detention facilities away from their families and legal representatives, often with little to no notice. At least twenty people have died this year while in ICE custody, including forty-nine-year-old Canadian Johnny Noviello, who died at a Miami detention facility in June. (ICE did not respond when contacted for this piece.)

For Fernandez Silva, fifty-one, the only thing that matters in the bureaucratic and moral mess of Alligator Alcatraz is her son. She says Borrego Fernandez was deported to Mexico in September, and she does not know why he was sent there. Asked what she would want Canadians to know about Alligator Alcatraz, she says, “It is not a place for human habitation, it’s a concentration camp. They should see for themselves the conditions of this concentration camp, and the total inhumanity of the people who are running it.”",https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Ladly_AlligatorAlcatraz_1800.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:57:54.965416

(KRON) — In North Hayward, messages on Cherryland Elementary School windows read, “Be kind,” and their marquee reads, “Be responsible, be respectful, and be safe.”

But on Friday, the community didn’t feel safe.

“Schools are just tender places that when families begin to lose trust and faith in their school to protect kids, that’s a problem,” said Hayward Mayor Mark Salinas.

Immigration legal advocates say ICE agents walked onto campus in the middle of the school day, asking administrators for information about a former student.

Advocates say the school immediately turned them away.

Monique Berlanga, the Executive Director of Centro Legal de la Raza, calls this unacceptable.

“I think it’s wildly inappropriate,” Berlanga said.

She says ICE agents even went door-to-door in the neighborhood, knocking and asking residents for information.

“Created a real chilling impact in our community, we had folks calling their hotline all day because they were afraid to pick up their children because they didn’t know what to do,” Berlanga said.

Salinas says city leaders still don’t know exactly what ICE agents were looking for on Friday.

“We’re the third largest city in the county, we are home to Latino immigrants,” Salinas said.

Municipal and local governments have no control over ICE. Immigration enforcement is a federal power.

However, Hayward is a sanctuary city.

This means Hayward has city ordinances in place to educate the community about immigration rights and connect them with agencies that can support them if they are detained.

“Hayward police, their mission first and foremost is to protect the city of Hayward. If it is an immigration warrant, the city of Hayward will not support and participate in providing aid to that,” Salinas said.

Mayor Salinas says county agencies and local officials, including himself, meet monthly to review ICE activity.

He says their most recent update showed Hayward and Oakland are the two cities seeing the most ice activity in the area.

“I hope that any time federal agents come to Hayward, they notify the police department because professionally,” Salinas said. “I think it’s the most appropriate thing to do, so there is no confusion out on the street.”

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said ICE has funding to hold up to 100,000 migrants on any given day under Mr. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Ms. McLaughlin said 70% of the illegal immigrants ICE has arrested have had criminal convictions or pending charges and that the administration is on pace for 600,000 deportations this year.","ICE is shattering records for immigration enforcement, setting new high-water marks for arrests, deportations and detention.

The agency reported holding more than 65,000 migrants as of Nov. 15, a record by far. It had fewer than 60,000 in late September, just before the government shutdown, and fewer than 40,000 in January when President Biden turned over power to President Trump.

Fueling the rise is a surge in arrests. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement averaged nearly 1,200 arrests daily since Oct. 1, a record pace.

ICE is deporting illegal immigrants at an even higher rate, more than 1,250 daily.

If that held for 12 months, it would exceed 450,000 for the entire year, surpassing the record set in 2012.

The number is still shy of the 1 million mark the administration has set.

“They need to ramp it up,” said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at the Immigration Accountability Project. “There’s a big population that should be easier to remove, and we need to get to those and remove them. Americans are willing to support mass deportation, but it has to be mass deportation.”

The numbers were released as part of a periodic update of ICE detention data. Releases were suspended during the government shutdown, so this was the first data for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.

From Oct. 1 to Nov. 15, the date the data was current, ICE reported that its personnel recorded 54,735 book-ins, which serves as a yardstick for overall arrests. Customs and Border Protection reported another 7,066 book-ins.

During the Biden administration, those numbers were reversed. CBP book-ins were dramatically higher than those of ICE.

The border chaos left ICE scrambling to deal with the migrants picked up by the Border Patrol and unable to focus on its arrests in the interior.

The vast majority of ICE activities were pickups of migrants from prisons and jails. Nearly 95% of ICE arrestees in detention in 2024 had either criminal convictions or pending charges.

That number has now dipped below 60%, fueling complaints that ICE is not focusing on the “criminal aliens” who Mr. Trump said were his priority.

Ms. Jenks said she wasn’t bothered by the decreased criminal ratio.

“I couldn’t care less how many of them have committed extra crimes. We need to deport all of them,” she said.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said ICE has funding to hold up to 100,000 migrants on any given day under Mr. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. She said the funding helps deportations.

“With innovative partnerships like Alligator Alcatraz, Speedway Slammer, Louisiana Lockup, and Cornhusker Clink, we’ve significantly expanded detention space. Despite a rapid number of injunctions, DHS is working rapidly to remove these aliens from detention centers to their final destination — home,” she said.

She also provided numbers that appear to differ from ICE’s published data.

Ms. McLaughlin said 70% of the illegal immigrants ICE has arrested have had criminal convictions or pending charges and that the administration is on pace for 600,000 deportations this year.

That 600,000 figure appears to include CBP border ousters, which are not part of ICE’s formal removal numbers.

It’s also still shy of the 1 million deportation mark.

When asked about that target, Homeland Security Department officials have cited “self-deportations” as a means of meeting that goal.

Ms. McLaughlin said the government estimates that 1.6 million illegal immigrants have returned to their home countries without formal removal.

Officials have been cagey about the source for that figure. Ms. Jenks said she is not sold without hard data.

“We need those numbers. If they’re not releasing them, then the assumption, logically, is they’re not good enough,” she said.

She said a major selling point of Mr. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer was an infusion of tens of billions of dollars to ICE to carry out mass deportations.

“We need to see a million removals a year,” she said. “I get they have to ramp up to that. I have been defending them on giving them a minute to ramp it up. But they have to ramp it up.”

The deportation push has fierce critics among immigrant rights groups and has sparked a strident resistance in some communities, where arrests are labeled “kidnappings.”

Still, polling shows the public largely backs deportations.

A Harvard CAPS-Harris survey this month found that 54% of respondents supported the deportations of “all immigrants who are here illegally.” When asked specifically about those who “have committed crimes,” 79% of respondents supported deportation.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/01/25/US-Immigration-Border_84213_c0-21-2000-1187_s1200x700.jpg?47b7c4f496188daa612ed15b1d86d9c404eb0b17,N,,2025-11-24 06:56:51.158189

Organizers began planning the chaperone program last year and saw “decent turnout” at training sessions, Toppins said.
But after union members “dispersed over the summer,” turnout has been waning, he added.
In addition to the chaperone program, union members have also begun working with the Deportation Defense Network, Lehrer said.
Along with the Defense Network, union organizers have hosted a series of “regular organizing meetings,” where attendees are trained “how to do outreach” and “how to spot ICE,” Lehrer said.","In response to recent federal immigration enforcement across Rhode Island, student labor organizers are joining local activists in efforts aimed at protecting community members from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions across the state, and more specifically, on College Hill.

The RIFT-AFT Local 6516 — which represents unionized student workers and postdocs at Brown — plans to launch a “walking chaperone” program that trains student volunteers to “escort noncitizens as needed between campus locations and nearby sites,” the union wrote in a Nov. 10 Instagram post.

According to Victoria Antonetti GS, the vice president of Local 6516, the organization’s chaperone program was “inspired by the work of the Deportation Defense Line” — a hotline run by members of the Deportation Defense Network of R.I.

The network is composed of several local organizations, including Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance, the Olneyville Neighborhood Association and the Party for Socialism and Liberation R.I.

Union leaders intend for the chaperone program to “fight against” ICE activity within the Brown community, said Maya Lehrer MAT’23, an organizer with the Deportation Defense Network.

EJ Toppin GS, the Graduate Labor Organization’s chair for social justice and accountability, told The Herald the organization plans to resume chaperone volunteer training sessions early next semester. “We are trying to get the word out,” he said.

Provided they recruit enough volunteers, the union plans to operate the chaperone program on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., he said.

Local 6516 Chair of Communications Adit Sabnis GS said that the organization “can’t prevent ICE from coming here,” but still hopes to make graduate student employees “less scared to go about their daily lives.” A large share of graduate workers, he noted, are not U.S. citizens.

Organizers began planning the chaperone program last year and saw “decent turnout” at training sessions, Toppins said. But after union members “dispersed over the summer,” turnout has been waning, he added.

In addition to the chaperone program, union members have also begun working with the Deportation Defense Network, Lehrer said. The network’s volunteer staff operate a handful of “neighborhood groups” across the Greater Providence area which patrol outside courthouses, The Herald previously reported.

The network’s courthouse outreach initiative came as a response to growing federal immigration enforcement operations near Rhode Island courts, Lehrer said. Volunteers with the initiative patrol near Providence courthouses, keeping an eye out for ICE presence.

The initiative “is designed to alert people” to possible ICE presence and to provide the number for the Defense Hotline to “people who are going into or out of the courts,” she explained.

Along with the Defense Network, union organizers have hosted a series of “regular organizing meetings,” where attendees are trained “how to do outreach” and “how to spot ICE,” Lehrer said. She estimated that over the course of the semester, 200 people have participated in training sessions across Providence.

On Nov. 20, ICE activity was identified by volunteers near the Rhode Island Superior Courthouse on College Hill.

“We had volunteers on the ground warning people coming in and out” of the courthouse, as well as “people on bikes and cars patrolling,” Yosan Alemu GS, a GLO steward, wrote in a message to The Herald.

Alemu added that ICE vehicles were parked near the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library, spurring a demonstration outside the Superior Court.

Around 100 people showed up at intersection of N. Mendenhall Rd. and Summer Ave. to voice their concerns about ICE in the city.

“Stay strong, we see them, we’re with them,” explained organizer Jose Salazar. “They’re not alone and we’re here with them.”

The protestors say ICE is tearing up immigrant families all over Memphis. They claim ICE is going into churches and neighborhoods making arrests.

While ICE can be seen in the city, the Memphis Safe Task Force stopped publicly announcing its ICE arrests, so it’s hard to tell how active they are.

The task force is releasing how many warrants have been cleared, how many missing children they’ve found, and their total arrests. They’ve stopped publicly releasing how many total ICE arrests have been made weeks ago.

On Nov.12th, the Memphis Safe Task Force announced they were responsible for 2,500 arrests, but didn’t specify how many were ICE arrests.

Protesters say regardless of how many ice arrests there have been in Memphis, one is too many.

Salazar explained why the protesters felt the need to come and voice their opinions.

“So that the immigrant community can say that they’re not alone and send all of these federal agencies that we’re not going to stay quiet and that we’re not going to take this any longer,” he said.

They say all immigrants are being targeted but tell WREG the Hispanic community has been hit the hardest.

Memphian Ashley Delgado, came out to show her support, saying since the Memphis Safe Task Force has been around the city hasn’t been the same.

“They walk around with big guns, that’s not necessary for people that aren’t criminals right, that affects your mental health, you know people are scared,” Delgado said. “Our city is like a ghost town now.”

While it is unclear how long ICE will be in Memphis, Salazar hopes local politicians focus on the city’s immigrant community and sees their importance to the local economy.

“The labor that they do when it comes to the money that they spend, I feel like if the economy’s are already bad and you’re coming after the immigrants, you’re pretty much kicking down the businesses,” he said.

WREG has reached to ICE for an updated number of the task force’s immigration-related arrests in Memphis and are still waiting to hear back.",https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/11/ICE-Protest-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-24 04:56:21.988595

Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, like the George Bushes, professed to want to enforce immigration laws.
Political parties that campaign for restrictions on immigration are treated as pariahs with which established parties must never allow in coalition governments.
But her 30-year-old deputy, Jordan Bartella, appears more popular than other parties’ leaders.
Excluding people with different cultures and attitudes from your country is not the moral equivalent of murdering all your Jews.","Whence cometh the conviction, in America and even more in Britain and Europe, that open borders is the only moral immigration policy? Of course, not everyone believes that, and many who do stop short of saying so. But, the contrast between the rhetoric and policies of the first two decades of the century and those that have prevailed since President Donald Trump’s election is unmistakable.

Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, like the George Bushes, professed to want to enforce immigration laws. They decried the flood of illegals that crested in the prosperous decade before the financial crisis, and afterward saw with relief that the flow of illegals slowed.

As I wrote recently, careful projections of the illegal population estimate that it peaked at about 12 million in 2007, fell to about 10.5 million in 2019, then increased by about 4 million during the Biden administration, which essentially opened the borders to the point of paying for illegals to live in New York’s Roosevelt Hotel, two short blocks from where Jamie Dimon’s JPMorganChase was constructing its $3 billion office tower.

The impetus for this policy came from something other than the usual elite economic argument that, as population growth is slowing, advanced countries need more workers to maintain economic growth. That something else can be summarized in the phrase “Orange Man Bad.” If Trump wants to stop people at the border, then we shouldn’t stop anyone there.

There is another element here, seen more prominently in Europe. And that is the conviction that barring people from your country who are different, in ancestry or customs, from the preexisting population is invidious discrimination.

Immigrants to the United States over the past half-century have come mostly from Latin America and Asia from countries that to varying degrees share religious orientations, market economic norms, and cultures of literacy and numeracy with most Americans.

It’s likely true that a flood of mostly illegal immigrants, like those welcomed by the Biden administration, will tend to have a higher proportion of violent migrants than among legal immigrants. And a higher proportion of arrivals with adversarial attitudes toward American mores, traditions and government.

But that is a problem orders of magnitude greater in Britain and Europe, where very much larger shares of immigrants, from Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, are Muslims. Many are quite ready to assimilate to European mores. But many — especially the floods welcome by former German Chancellor Angela Merkel starting in 2015 — are not. They want to impose their religion and their culture on the host society, and elite leaders of such nations have been willing to let them do so.

An example is the scandal of Britain’s “grooming gangs,” often long-settled immigrants from Pakistan and Afghanistan, who sexually abuse and enslave adolescent working-class English girls. For at least two decades, this oppression has been largely ignored by Britain’s political parties, local and national police forces, national press, and certainly by the TV-set-owner subsidized BBC.

This oppression of women and violation of human rights is virtually unknown to American liberals, as the liberal talk show host Bill Maher has pointed out with appropriate indignation. Nor are they aware, despite mention of the practice, that Britain has been arresting thousands of citizens for social media posts that are thought to hurt immigrants’ feelings.

European elites, in government and the press, have suppressed news of immigrant violence, even when directed at women and gays. Both center-right and center-left governments have professed themselves unable to reduce the flow of immigrants with cultural attitudes adversarial to European norms. They profess they must obey rulings by international courts and agencies whose personnel are immune to democratic checks.

Political parties that campaign for restrictions on immigration are treated as pariahs with which established parties must never allow in coalition governments. This includes Britain’s Reform party, which currently has huge poll leads, and France’s Rassemblement National, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, was blocked from running by a dubious court decision. But her 30-year-old deputy, Jordan Bartella, appears more popular than other parties’ leaders.

Germany’s AfD, which is currently tied in the polls, is treated with particular scorn by the two main parties, which, between them, capture less than 50% in polls. Within AfD’s ranks are some with nostalgia for Germany’s Nazi past, and the nation’s leading parties deserve respect for their longstanding commitment to renouncing Nazism and making reparations for the Holocaust.

But it’s not apparent that AfD’s policy of restricting the inflow of immigrants, or those of Eastern European democracies like Poland and Hungary, which are decried by unelected European Union leaders, is the moral equivalent of Nazism. Excluding people with different cultures and attitudes from your country is not the moral equivalent of murdering all your Jews.

Those leaders who treat the two as morally equivalent are captive to bad ideas. They have been taught to divide the world into oppressors and the oppressed, to cast immigrants as virtuous victims and their own citizens as culpable oppressors. They have been instructed to see colonialism not as a limited chapter in history but as its dominant theme, and to treat its harms as a kind of second Holocaust.

From these delusions, most ordinary Americans, including recent legal immigrants and their offspring, and large numbers of ordinary Britons and Europeans, seem happily immune. Perhaps in time, their common sense will dissuade the elites of their “luxury belief” in open borders.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.thealpenanews.com/images/2016/11/15143024/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 02:57:41.894768

It’s going to be easy to forget about local governments with the coming onslaught of articles about the Senate and House races in 2026.","Many Americans are — to massively understate — upset with Congress. The U.S. government went through the longest shutdown in American history for little gain, as the provisions in the shutdown deal are largely identical to what was proposed prior. The final bill also only funds the government until January, meaning we may very well get to go through all of this again. Deadlock in the legislative branch is certainly not new, but in the age of Trump, it’s made the experience all the more frustrating. Trump managed to halve the staff of the Department of Education and impose the totality of his tariff regime without Congressional approval. Our government is meant to be a collaborative act between multiple institutions representing the American people, but more and more it feels like a one-man show. Yet, there are thousands of government entities with the power to stand up to the executive when Congress sits down: state and local governments.

The cooperation of local governments is vital for the successful implementation of many federal laws and programs, and even more so for the current administration. As the Trump administration rapidly expands and contracts government agencies, policy implementation has relied on local government support. Take, as an example, the relationship between ICE and the country’s sheriffs. ICE has a major issue with its crackdown on immigrants: There isn’t enough space to detain them. The existing detention centers aren’t big enough to hold the record number of immigrants being detained. Instead, ICE has contracted with sheriff departments across the country to keep detainees in county jails. Some detainees are only in jail for a short period of time before being transferred to dedicated detention facilities, while others are held for longer. Most jails, however, aren’t equipped to meet the needs of those under ICE detention. Conditions vary widely. Facilities are often overcrowded, unsanitary and inhumane. Immigrants have recounted being denied mattresses, bedding, spoons or cups.

Not all sheriffs, though, are complying with the administration’s mass deportation campaign. In Indiana, Attorney General Todd Rokita has sued our very own St. Joseph County sheriff Bill Redman for alleged failure to cooperate federal immigration officials. Redman has characterized the lawsuit as an attempt to deputize law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws. Redman’s refusal to cooperate more than what the law requires may seem minuscule compared to the scale of mass deportations, but his actions have made undocumented immigrants in South Bend safer and put a hole in ICE’s network of sheriffs and county jails.

ICE is just a part of the Trump fallout facing localities. Our disemboweled federal bureaucracy will not be able to deliver the same quality of service with the skeleton crew that remains after the Trump purges. The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights — which investigates schools violating the rights of students — has closed 7 of its 12 regional offices. The Medicaid cuts mandated in the One Big Beautiful Bill will kick 7.5 million people off Medicaid and risks health coverage for one out of every five children enrolled in the program. If we want our children to receive quality health care and be respected and cared for, then state and local governments need to step up to the plate.

It’s going to be easy to forget about local governments with the coming onslaught of articles about the Senate and House races in 2026. Keep your eye on the ball. The success or failure of Trump’s project depends not just on Congress, but on sheriffs, treasurers and city councils across the country.

It was also great to be able to touch on fundamentals of trust in news, and discuss how places like advocacy marketer Public Narrative, the neutered Chicago Independent Media Alliance and Northwestern's non-journalism-accredited Medill School cause the same type of harm to trust in journalism and the news industry as manipulative rightward sources, dancing through a profitable masquerade of fraudulently presenting advocacy as journalism.
