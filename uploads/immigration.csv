The Turkish government should stop deporting Uyghurs to third countries and recognize them as refugees. Other governments should halt transferring Uyghurs to Türkiye and consider resettling Uyghur refugees from Türkiye.

(Istanbul) – Turkish authorities are increasingly restricting the legal residency of Uyghurs seeking safety from the Chinese government, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.

The 51-page report, “Protected No More: Uyghurs in Türkiye,” finds that Uyghurs’ previous access to international protection status, and indeed preferential treatment under the Turkish immigration system, is being nullified as authorities arbitrarily mark their police and immigration records with “restriction codes,” denoting them a “public security threat.” The government detains some Uyghurs in inhumane and degrading conditions, and coerces them to sign voluntary return forms, putting them at risk of removal to third countries that have extradition agreements with China.

“Until recently, Uyghurs who escaped repression at home felt safe in Türkiye, but as China-Türkiye relations warm, and the Erdoğan government cracks down on refugees and migrants, many are growing fearful,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Some Uyghurs say they don’t dare leave their homes for fear of arrests and being sent to deportation centers, while others are undertaking perilous journeys elsewhere in search of safety.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 13 Uyghurs, 6 lawyers, and a Turkish government official knowledgeable about the situation, and reviewed Turkish government policies and documents, such as deportation decisions, case records, and circular orders. Human Rights Watch also reviewed publicly available cases of 33 Uyghurs who were held in deportation centers between December 2018 and October 2025.

“Now, because I don’t have any legal documents, I cannot even go outside because of fear, even for groceries because I don't want to end up in the deportation center again.” said a Uyghur whose residence permit was arbitrarily canceled by Turkish authorities.

Under the immigration crackdown, Uyghurs, like other refugees and migrants in Türkiye, are often assigned “restriction codes” (typically code “G87”) that can lead to a cascade of negative and often devastating consequences. These include rejection of international protection applications or another status entitling an individual to residency, as well as denial of citizenship. Uyghurs have effectively become “irregular migrants” and some eventually are ordered deported. When they interact with a police or immigration officers for any reason, they can be sent to a deportation center.

The Uyghurs and their lawyers that were interviewed said that Uyghurs are subjected to ill-treatment in detention centers and often pressured to sign voluntary return forms, allowing them to be repatriated or sent to another country. At least three of the Uyghurs interviewed had signed the form, and one of them was deported to the United Arab Emirates, which has an extradition treaty with China.

Human Rights Watch wrote to the Migration Management President seeking comments on the report findings and information about Uyghurs in Türkiye on September 23, and again on October 27, 2025, and received no answer.

The assignment of restriction codes is linked to the implementation of Türkiye’s Law 6458 on Foreigners and International Protection. How and why restriction codes are assigned is unclear and in practice their use seems to reach far beyond what was intended under the law. They are often imposed without reasonable justification, concrete evidence, or a clear causal link to wrongdoing.

Under Turkish law, individuals can appeal deportation decisions.Human Rights Watch reviewed five court decisions from 2024 and 2025 concerning deportation order appeals by Uyghurs. In each case, the court upheld the deportation order without saying what the individuals had done that constituted the alleged threat to public security and order. Worryingly, in each case the court ruled that the prohibition of refoulement did not apply, contending that the applicant Uyghur had not established they would be at risk of ill-treatment and torture if sent to China. A lawyer who has lodged many such appeals said that judges can often issue “a negative decision [dismissing an appeal] when they see restriction codes, just to be safe.”

The Turkish government is obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture or other serious ill-treatment, a threat to life, or other comparable serious human rights violations.

A simple complaint from a neighbor or being ensnared in a criminal case—even though later acquitted—can result in decisions to apply the restriction codes. Turkish authorities also base these codes on intelligence provided by other governments. In some cases, the Chinese government submitted lists of people it brands as “terrorists,” a term it conflates with peaceful activism or expression of Uyghur identity in Xinjiang.

Since 2017, the Chinese government has subjected Uyghurs to severe human rights abuses that Human Rights Watch and independent legal experts have concluded amount to crimes against humanity. If returned to China, especially from a country such as Türkiye that the Chinese government deems “sensitive,” Uyghurs may face detention, interrogation, torture, and other cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment.

“The Turkish government should respect the principle of nonrefoulement, immediately stop all deportations of Uyghurs to third countries, and recognize Uyghurs as refugees on a prima facie basis,” Pearson said. “Other governments should halt transferring Uyghurs to Türkiye, as it can no longer be considered a safe third country for Uyghurs, and should consider resettling Uyghur refugees from Türkiye.”

Selected Quotes:

“I was treated as if I was guilty. I spent one year in detention.... I tried several times to renew my residence permit but failed. The immigration office told me I had 10 days to leave the country, after telling me that my latest residence permit application was rejected. Then, I decided to leave the country. I had my Chinese passport, so I booked a flight to a third country that would be a path for me to go to safety in Europe. Turkish authorities detained me at the airport and put me on a two-year entry ban.”

- A Uyghur who was arbitrarily detained by Turkish authorities because of a restriction code and left Türkiye afterwards, June 2025.

“The conditions were very poor. In one instance, the facility did not provide proper food for nine days straight. In one deportation center, I slept on the cement floor for a week where I shared a single blanket with two other people. There were 20 people in a small cell where there was no sense of hygiene. I witnessed people who got infested with lice.”

- A Uyghur who spent several months at various deportation centers, May 2025.

“In some instances, people who had a call with someone suspicious can get assigned a code. For example, there was a Uyghur who was detained on suspicion of “terrorism” but then released unconditionally, as there was a lack of evidence. However, during the investigation, everyone who had a phone call with this person got a G87 code.”

U.S. Senator Peter Welch (D-Vt.) released the following reaction to the report:

“The findings in this report are horrific, and they are doubly disturbing because the United States is directly implicated. It would not be an exaggeration to describe what is happening daily in CECOT as President Bukele’s Abu Ghraib.

“What happened to those 40 men is shocking, but it was not unique to them. The abuses and deprivations they describe are endemic inside the walls of CECOT. These men were forcibly disappeared, which is a crime in this country and a violation of international law. From their first day behind CECOT’s walls, each of them was subjected to near-daily beatings, food and medical deprivation, and other inhumane and appallingly degrading treatment.

“Nobody defends the heinous crimes and corruption perpetrated by Tren de Aragua and other violent criminal organizations. They have terrorized the people of Venezuela, El Salvador, and many other countries. Those who commit such atrocities should be brought to justice. President Bukele’s Kafkaesque response to these criminal gangs is a prison that the guards describe as ‘hell’ and where everyone, innocent or guilty, is labeled a terrorist. Criminal proceedings, if one can call them that, are conducted en masse and make a mockery of due process.

“President Trump has feted Bukele in Washington and praised his leadership. Bukele has called himself the world’s “coolest dictator”. There is one thing President Bukele should remember: President Trump’s term expires on January 20, 2028, after which he will no longer be there to turn a blind eye to Bukele’s role in presiding over the torture and denial of fundamental rights of tens of thousands of prisoners, many of whom have no affiliation with violent gangs. Sooner or later the law will catch up to President Bukele, and there will be accountability for what is happening in CECOT.

“Until then, or for as long as torture continues in El Salvador’s prisons, the Trump Administration must stop deportations to El Salvador. It is immoral for the United States to be paying Bukele to lock up deportees knowing they will be brutalized and denied due process.”

The 81-page report contains detailed, first-hand accounts of 40 Venezuelan prisoners in CECOT who were deported by the Department of Homeland Security and then returned to Venezuela in exchange for 10 American citizens or permanent residents who had been detained by President Maduro. Report investigators found no evidence that any of the Venezuelans in their report were members of the notorious Tren de Aragua gang, and the Trump Administration has never produced any evidence that they were. Almost none of them were ever convicted of any crime, in Venezuela or the United States.

At least 62 of the men in the Human Rights Watch-Cristosal report had fled Maduro’s repression or violence in Venezuela and had pending asylum cases in the United States, before they were arbitrarily rounded up and deported. According to the report, Department of Homeland Security agents lied to them about where they were being sent and refused their requests to contact their families. During the almost four months they were in CECOT, they had no access to lawyers or their families.

Excerpts from Human Rights Watch/Cristosal Report

“You Have Arrived in Hell”

Torture and Other Abuses Against Venezuelans in El Salvador’s Mega Prison

November 12, 2025

People held in CECOT said they were beaten from the moment they arrived in El Salvador and throughout their time in detention. Guards and riot police beat them in the hallways of the prison module and in a solitary confinement cell in a section of CECOT known as “the Island.” They beat them during daily cell searches for allegedly violating prison rules, such as speaking loudly with other detainees or showering at the wrong time, and sometimes for requesting medical treatment.

People held in CECOT said that many detainees were also beaten after US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s visit in March, following visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in May and June, and after two prison protests occurring in April and May.

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal concluded that the cases of torture and ill-treatment of Venezuelans in CECOT were not isolated incidents by rogue guards or riot police, but rather systematic violations that took place repeatedly during their detention. Every former detainee interviewed reported being subjected to serious physical and psychological abuse on a near-daily basis, throughout their entire time in detention.

These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and psychological suffering. Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.

Three people held in CECOT told Human Rights Watch and Cristosal that they were subjected to sexual violence. One of them said that guards took him to “the Island,” where they beat him. He said four guards sexually abused him and forced him to perform oral sex on one of them. “They played with their batons on my body.” People held in CECOT said sexual abuse affected more people, but victims were unlikely to speak about what they had suffered due to stigma.

The United States sent the 252 Venezuelans to CECOT despite credible prior reports that torture and other abuses were taking place in El Salvador’s prisons. This violates the principle of non-refoulement, established in the Convention against Torture, among others.

In at least 19 cases, people held in CECOT or their relatives said they fled Venezuela to escape threats, abuses, or persecution by state security forces, as well as threats posed by armed and criminal groups, including Tren de Aragua. Their allegations indicate that these individuals fled persecution and, in many instances, articulated strong claims for asylum.”

Human Rights Watch analyzed data on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations that ICE released in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request made by the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy. The data indicates that at least 48.8 percent of the Venezuelans deported to El Salvador on March 15, March 30, and April 12—the dates of flights Human Rights Watch confirmed transported Venezuelans to CECOT—had no criminal history in the United States. Only 8 (3.1 percent) had been convicted of a violent or potentially violent offense. The data only includes information on 226 of the 252 Venezuelan people who were held in CECOT.

Rogelio Bolufé told Source New Mexico in a phone interview in Spanish on Tuesday that an abruptly cancelled meeting with a legal aid group last week hobbled his chances at convincing an immigration judge to spare him deportation to Cuba, where he says he’ll face imprisonment and torture as a political dissident.

“If I go back to Cuba, my life will be in danger,” he said.

His allegations of denied access to lawyers and legal materials occur as the facility, one of three ICE lockups in the state, operates without a contract. It currently holds about 550 ICE detainees.

Amid a federal government shutdown, an inter-governmental services agreement between the county, ICE and private prison operator CoreCivic expired Oct. 31, and it remains unclear when it will be renewed.

U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) sent a letter to ICE on Friday demanding the agency answer what authority it has to continue detaining immigrants in Estancia and transfer ICE detainees out of the facility in the meantime.

Torrance County immigration detention center continues operating without ICE contract

“I reiterate my calls for ICE to close the facility, but if you will not, I urge you to transfer all ICE detainees out of TCDF immediately until such time that the contract between ICE and Torrance County is extended,” Heinrich wrote.

Innovation Law Lab, an organization of immigrant legal advocates who visit the jail weekly, have said ICE’s own policies require the agency to remove detainees and their equipment absent a contract.

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s inquiry Wednesday about Heinrich’s letter, which cites recent Source New Mexico reporting and public statements from ICE about its continued operations during the shutdown. Luis Soriano, Heinrich’s spokesperson, said Wednesday that ICE hadn’t responded to the senator’s office yet.

Bolufé, 43, told Source the contract’s expiration worsened a long practice of officials’ denying legal help to him or his fellow detainees, including a canceled meeting with legal advocates last Thursday. Bolufé documented that incident and others in a letter last week to Source signed by six other immigrant detainees.

Bolufé’s letter also cited poor quality telephone communication; jail staff disruptions to consultations with legal staff; and lack of access to the jail’s legal library.

“In practice, it is impossible to access the legal library,” Bolufé wrote, noting he made 30 requests through jail tablets for appointments at the legal library and received no response.

Torrance County’s ICE detention agreement set to expire in two days amid federal shutdown

Haymel de la Vega, Bolufé’s close friend and former fianceé, facilitated brief jail phone calls between Bolufé and Source this week and sent Source letters detailing his history in ICE custody. She wrote that she’s tried to send books and other legal materials to Bolufé at the facility without success.

“I have personally sent Rogelio several legal books and materials intended to support his preparation for court, but these have been withheld pending review and approval by the facility’s director, and as of today, they have not been delivered to him,” she wrote on Nov. 7.

Rubena Miranda, administrative supervisor at the facility, declined to comment Wednesday, and referred comment to public affairs officials at CoreCivic. CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin said the company would provide a response, but had not by publication. Source will update the story if it is received.

A long journey to NM

Bolufé arrived at the Torrance County jail about two months ago and, he says, has spent some of his time collecting testimony from inmates who, like him, spent time at “Alligator Alcatraz.”

According to Bolufé, he spent between seven and 10 days in “Alligator Alcatraz,” during which he was chained by his hands and feet for 24 to 36 hours at a time. The facility had freezing temperatures, inadequate blankets and the lights remained on permanently.

As a result of the treatment, he said he lost mobility in his left hand, as well as other pain, numbness and muscle weakness, and jail guards shouted racist slurs at him and other detainees.

Bolufé said the letters and accounts of abuse would help him plead his case to federal immigration Judge Brock E. Taylor, and bring the allegations about ICE’s treatment of detainees to the judge’s attention, but they are among the materials he has yet to receive, along with a character reference signed by 40 people. He also intends on Thursday to argue that he would be subject to political persecution upon being deported to Cuba.

Bolufé is seeking a Green Card under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, which allows Cubans a streamlined path to permanent residency. While he acknowledges and media reports confirm that he has long-standing ties to former Cuban President Fidel Castro and his sons, he also said he is waging a campaign to liberate the country from the Communist regime and supports President Donald Trump.

Bolufé said his Green Card application was pending when he was arrested in the Miami area in August, accused of possessing a small amount of cocaine. He denies the cocaine belonged to him, and the charges have since been dropped, according to court records. Prosecutors in Miami-Dade County did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request on Wednesday about the case.

Ahead of the court hearing Thursday, Bolufé said he is hoping for the best, but he said his case is just one of many of immigrants who have been subject to abuse, deprived of human rights and threatened with deportation without having committed crimes.

Mustapha Djemali is the founder and director of the Tunisian Council for Refugees (CTR). Abderrazek Krimi is a project manager with the same organization. Both have been held in arbitrary pre-trial detention since May 2024. They were arrested only because of their legitimate human rights work and for exercising their right to freedom of association.

The CTR, a Tunisian organization that works with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), provides vital support to refugees and asylum seekers in Tunisia.

Tunisian authorities must immediately release Mustapha Djemali and Abderrazek Krimi and drop all charges against them. They must also ensure that human rights defenders can continue their work freely and safely, without fear of reprisals.

Here’s what you can do:

Write to President of Tunisia urging the government to:

Ensure the immediate release of Mustapha Djemali and Abderrazek Krimi.

Drop all charges against them.

Stop targeting and arresting human rights defenders.

Guarantee that human rights defenders can do their work freely and safely, without fear of reprisals.

Crackdown on civil society and refugee rights

In early May 2024, the Tunisian government began a sweeping crackdown on refugees, migrants, and the organizations defending their rights.

On May 6, President Kais Saied made public remarks attacking groups working on migration issues. He accused them of trying to “settle” migrants in Tunisia and called them “traitors” and “foreign agents.” He claimed that “networks inside” Tunisia were linked to “networks abroad” and receiving money under the false claim of protecting migrants.

The next day, a Tunis prosecutor opened an investigation into associations accused of “abusing their mandate to provide financial support” to irregular migrants.

Widespread arrests and intimidation

Since then, authorities have summoned, arrested, and investigated leaders, staff, and members of at least 20 organizations. Ten human rights defenders, NGO workers, and local officials have been placed in arbitrary pre-trial detention on accusations of supporting irregular migrants or misusing NGO funds.

That same month, the government carried out forced evictions of refugees and migrants. Some landlords were convicted for renting apartments to people without regular status.

These actions mark one of the most severe escalations against refugee and migrant rights in Tunisia since February 2023. They are part of a broader pattern of racially discriminatory language and practices. Similar efforts to criminalize refugee and migrant rights defenders have also been observed in Europe and beyond.

The targeting of the Tunisian Council for Refugees

The Tunisian Council for Refugees (CTR), founded in 2016, was one of the first groups targeted. The CTR works with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)and Tunisian authorities to pre-register asylum seekers and provide essential support to refugees in need.

Its founder, Mustapha Djemali, is a former senior UNHCR official. On May 2, 2024, the CTR published a public tender for hotel accommodations to shelter refugees and asylum seekers in vulnerable situations. This was a routine part of its work and done in response to a request from the UNHCR and the region of Sfax.

Soon after, Tunisian media outlets and social media users spread screenshots of the tender. They accused civil society of conspiring to “settle” Africans or “illegal migrants” in Tunisia, using racist and xenophobic language.

Arrests and suspension of humanitarian work

On May 3, police raided the CTR office in Tunis and arrested Mustapha Djemali. The next day, they arrested Abderrazek Krimi, the CTR project manager.

Police questioned them about the organization’s funding, its support for irregular migrants, and the call for tenders. Following their arrests, the CTR suspended its activities. This led to serious disruptions in access to asylum procedures and essential services, including health care, shelter, and child protection.

Unfair detention and ongoing trial

On May 7, 2024, an investigating judge at the Tunis Court of First Instance ordered six months of pre-trial detention for both defenders. They were charged with “forming an alliance or organization” to “plan, assist, or organize” the irregular entry of people into Tunisia and with “providing them shelter.”

These charges are vague and unfounded. They do not include any evidence of material gain or exploitation; the elements that define human smuggling and trafficking under international law.

The judge extended their detention in October 2024 and again in February 2025, which should be the final extension allowed by law. Despite several requests, the court has rejected conditional release. Authorities also froze the personal bank accounts of both defenders and the CTR.

An independent expert report submitted in March 2025 found no financial irregularities. Yet, during a hearing on March 25, the judge told the defenders, “You brought Black people into Tunisia illegally and you feed and shelter them. Tunisian history and laws will make you pay for it.” This statement raises serious concerns about bias and fairness in the proceedings.

On April 30, 2025, the investigation was closed. On June 3, 2025, the indictment chamber decided to send the case to trial.",https://amnesty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mustapha-Djemali-UA.png,N,,2025-11-12 17:56:37.292953

“Notwithstanding, Respondents argue that detention can be maintained without any consideration of the Due Process Clause because of a legal fiction — the so-called ‘entry fiction doctrine’ — which disregards the objective reality of a non-citizen’s physical presence in the United States and instead pretends that the individual has been ‘stopped at the border’ and never permitted to enter. …

“But the Supreme Court has never applied the entry fiction doctrine to a case like this — to constitutionally justify the detention of a person living freely, for years, within the United States — and its expansion here cannot be justified. … Pretending that Petitioner never entered the United States not only subordinates fact to fiction, it disregards the plain meaning of the Due Process Clause, which promises its protection to every ‘person’ within the United States. …

“… Granting Petitioner a bond hearing does not ‘undermine’ Congress’s authority over his admission process. … After a bond hearing — which may or may not result in his release from detention — Petitioner will be subject to the same removal proceedings as before, with no new right to remain. A bond hearing is the very procedure laid out in statute and in regulation for closely situated individuals. It leaves the determination of whether Petitioner poses a flight risk or a danger to his community in the competent hands of the immigration court. In short, it is a minimal imposition to ensure that Petitioner’s detention remains tethered to its lawful purpose.

“Accordingly, for these reasons and for those stated below, the Court will grant the Petition in part and order that Petitioner receive a bond hearing to consider the merits of his release. …

“Without an on-point precedent, the Court turns to the three-part balancing test articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). …

“In sum, the Court finds that the Mathews factors weigh definitely in favor of relief, that Petitioner’s detention without a bond hearing violates his due-process rights, and that a bond hearing is an appropriate and minimally invasive additional procedure to ensure that right. …

“For the foregoing reasons, the Petition is granted in part. The Court orders that Petitioner receive a constitutionally adequate bond hearing to consider the merits of his release.”

The investigation also found that the U.S. government paid at least US $4.7 million to El Salvador in connection with detaining the migrants at CECOT.

Former detainees described daily beatings, sexual abuse, and starvation inside the ultra-secure Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, known as CECOT, which many of the migrants called “hell.” Most were accused—without trial—of belonging to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were held incommunicado for months, despite having no criminal record.

“The Trump administration paid El Salvador millions of dollars to arbitrarily detain Venezuelans, who were then subjected almost daily to brutal beatings by Salvadoran security forces,” said Juanita Goebertus, director of the Americas Division at Human Rights Watch in a press release. “The Trump administration has been complicit in torture, enforced disappearances, and other serious human rights violations, and it should stop sending people to El Salvador or any other country where they face the risk of being tortured.”

Prisoners reported overcrowded cells, poor ventilation, inadequate food, lack of medical care and prolonged solitary confinement. Every former detainee interviewed by the nonprofit organizations said he endured repeated physical and psychological abuse.

Some of those deported had fled persecution by the regime of Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro, which has forced nearly eight million people to flee the country. Human Rights Watch and Cristosal noted that some of the CECOT detainees who were later returned to Venezuela reported visits from government intelligence agents attempting to coerce statements about their treatment in the United States.

On July 18, following a prisoner exchange, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in return for the repatriation of more than 250 Venezuelan migrants who had been transferred from the U.S. to El Salvador months earlier under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Between March and September 2025, Human Rights Watch interviewed 150 people—including relatives, friends, employers, and lawyers of detainees in Venezuela, Colombia, and the U.S.—as well as 40 former detainees released from CECOT. Based on their accounts, the organizations documented 130 confirmed cases of Venezuelans transferred to the prison. Cristosal provided legal support to relatives of 76 detainees, filing habeas corpus petitions before El Salvador’s Supreme Court.

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal concluded that roughly half of those Venezuelans sent to CECOT had no criminal convictions, and only three percent had been convicted in the U.S. of a violent or potentially violent crime. Additional background checks revealed that many had not been convicted of any offense in Venezuela or other Latin American countries where they had lived.

Family members and attorneys said at least 62 Venezuelans were deported to El Salvador while their asylum cases in the United States were still pending, despite having passed an initial “credible fear” assessment entitling them to a full asylum hearing. Three others said they had entered the U.S. through the government’s Safe Mobility Offices program—implemented in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala—to offer legal pathways for eligible migrants and refugees.

The Miami Herald reported on March 27 about a 24-year-old Venezuelan father living in Tampa, who had an active asylum claim, who was deported to El Salvador after Homeland Security officials said he “may be a Tren de Aragua associate,” referring to the Venezuelan gang.

The human-rights groups’ findings also align with a March 21 Herald report documenting the case of a Venezuelan man who had been granted refugee status through the Safe Mobility Offices program in Colombia but was nonetheless deported to El Salvador. He was detained after flying into Houston from Colombia with his girlfriend after authorities noticed his tattoos. Despite having legal authorization to enter the United States and no criminal record, immigration officials concluded that his tattoos were sufficient to suspect he might be linked to the Tren de Aragua gang.

According to the report by the nonprofit organizations, an expert on the Tren de Aragua said in a sworn declaration that tattoos and hand gestures are not “reliable” or “credible” indicators of gang affiliation. The Herald previously reported that experts on the Venezuelan gang have found no evidence that tattoos or visible markings are used by the group to identify members. They said the gang—which originated in a notorious Venezuelan prison—does not use visible symbols, and that profiling individuals based on tattoos is likely to result in serious miscarriages of justice.

Investigators corroborated detainee testimonies through forensic analyses by the Independent Forensic Expert Group and open-source research by the Human Rights Center’s Investigations Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.

The report highlights the involvement of the U.S. government, noting that the Trump administration invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act and other mechanisms to deport Venezuelans under alleged gang or “terrorist” affiliations, while Salvadoran officials failed to provide oversight or accountability. The investigation also found that the U.S. government paid at least US $4.7 million to El Salvador in connection with detaining the migrants at CECOT.

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal called on the U.S. government to halt all deportations to El Salvador, disclose related bilateral agreements, rescind the March 2025 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act, suspend funding to Salvadoran security forces, and allow deported Venezuelans to resume asylum proceedings or receive Temporary Protected Status.

The organizations also urged Salvadoran authorities to investigate abuses, hold officials accountable, end incommunicado detention, improve prison conditions, and permit oversight access. Venezuelan authorities were called on to protect returnees from reprisals and provide medical, psychological and legal support.

The investigation placed the abuses within El Salvador’s broader prison system under President Nayib Bukele, whose tenure has been marked by mass incarcerations, limited transparency and recurring human rights violations. The human rights groups conclude that the torture and mistreatment at CECOT were not isolated incidents but part of a systematic pattern that raise grave concerns about the rule of law, migrant protections and U.S. complicity in transfers to facilities with little or no oversight.

“The United States government has not engaged in acts of systematic torture on this scale since Abu Ghraib and the network of secret prisons during the war on terror,” said Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal. “For a government to make people disappear while subjecting them to torture undermines the principles that have historically made the United States a nation of laws.”

November 11, 2025

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing Harris County for allocating county funds to programs that help undocumented people get access to legal support.

The county, home to Houston, created the Immigrant Legal Services Fund program in 2020 and last month appropriated an additional $1.3 million to keep it going. The program sends funds to five organizations that help people facing deportation get lawyers.

In a statement, Paxton called the program “evil and wicked,” as well as unconstitutional. This is the latest in a flurry of headline-grabbing lawsuits filed by Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, aimed at organizations that support immigrants.

The Harris County Jail leads the nation in ICE detainers — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to hold a person for deportation — as federal and state immigration enforcement has kicked into high gear under President Donald Trump.

The lawsuit was filed in Harris County District Court. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that the program was “perfectly legal” and his office would defend it in court.

“This lawsuit is a cheap political stunt,” he said. “At a time when the president has unleashed ICE agents to terrorize immigrant neighborhoods, deport U.S. citizens, and trample the law, it’s shameful that Republican state officials are joining in instead of standing up for Texans.”

The background: When Harris County started the Immigrant Legal Services Fund in 2020, it was the largest county in the United States without a program aimed at helping undocumented immigrants get legal counsel. Austin, Dallas and San Antonio already had similar programs.

County Judge Lina Hidalgo proposed the program, which passed on a party-line vote.

“When you have a family at a deportation hearing and they don’t have an attorney, they’re deported at a much higher rate, like 90 percent of the time, compared to like 5 percent of the time when they do have an attorney,” Hidalgo said at the time, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The program sends county dollars to five organizations: BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Justice for All Immigrants, KIND, Inc. and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service.

Why Texas is suing: Paxton argues in the lawsuit that these programs “serve no public purpose and instead constitute unconstitutional grants of public funds to private entities to subsidize individual deportation defenses.”

He is asking the judge to stop Harris County from disbursing funds to these organizations immediately, and bar them from doing so in the future.

Paxton has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Austin and San Antonio over their support of nonprofit organizations that help Texans access abortions. In June, the 15th Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, blocking San Antonio from using the funds the city had allocated to potentially help people who needed to travel out of the state for abortions.

What Harris County says: Menefee said his office would “fight back” against this lawsuit, calling it a “cheap political stunt.”

After the October vote to allocate funding for the legal defense program, Commissioner Rodney Ellis said in a statement that it was necessary because of the increase in immigration raids.

“Having access to legal representation not only improves case outcomes but helps keep families together,” he said in a statement, according to the Houston Chronicle. “In a county as diverse as ours, local government must step up to safeguard safety, justice, and the people we serve.”",http://media.iadsnetwork.com/facebookthumbnail/facebook.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 16:57:10.274249

The lawmakers noted that some states, including Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Washington recently restricted what kind of data ICE can access via Nlets, and reminded the governors that it is up to them to stop the practice at any time.","A group of Democratic lawmakers have sent letters to several state governors, including in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Wisconsin, warning that their states are inadvertently sharing drivers’ data with federal immigration authorities.

The letter, which was first reported by Reuters, told governors that their states are providing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies “with frictionless, self-service access to the personal data of all of your residents,” through a nonprofit managed by state police agencies called the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, or Nlets.

Nlets facilitates the sharing of state residents’ personal data, in this case driver license data, between state, local, and federal police agencies.

The lawmakers asked the group of governors to stop the practice and block access to ICE and “other federal agencies that are now acting as Trump’s shock troops.”

ICE and Nlets did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

For two decades, most states have made their residents’ data, such as drivers’ licenses and other information from each state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database, available for search and retrieval to approximately 18,000 federal and local law enforcement agencies across the U.S. and Canada. This practice allows those agencies to directly access residents’ data without the knowledge or involvement of any state employee, according to the letter.

The letter said that it’s possible that ICE is using drivers’ license photos for their facial recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which agents are using to identify people on the street and relies on 200 million photos.

According to the letter, Nlets facilitated “over 290 million queries for DMV data,” with more than 290,000 queries from ICE and some 600,000 from Homeland Security Investigations during the year before October 1, 2025.

“It is now abundantly clear that a major reason that so few states have locked down the data they share through Nlets is because of an information gap,” reads the letter. “Because of the technical complexity of Nlets’ system, few state government officials understand how their state is sharing their residents’ data with federal and out-of-state agencies,” read the letter.

The letter said blocking the agencies’ “unfettered access” would not prevent federal agencies obtaining information from states for solving serious crimes, but taking action would “increase accountability and reduce abuse” by allowing state employees to review data requests first.

The lawmakers noted that some states, including Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Washington recently restricted what kind of data ICE can access via Nlets, and reminded the governors that it is up to them to stop the practice at any time.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-ice-agent.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-11-12 17:56:45.196981

Judge Jeffrey Cummings sided with attorneys representing detainees who said DHS violated a consent decree that limits the ability of federal agents to conduct warrantless arrests. The judge has ordered the Trump administration to provide information about how many of the 615 migrants represented in the lawsuit are still in the country or have criminal records.

ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch

Migrants who have criminal records and pose a risk to the public would not be eligible for release. Those who are eligible for release could be monitored through alternative means like ankle monitors.

An American Civil Liberties Union spokesperson told ABC News that a judge ordered the release of an additional 13 migrants within the next two days who would not be placed in ankle monitors.

The consent decree is in effect until February 2026 and covers Illinois and five other neighboring states. Generally speaking (with some exceptions), under the agreement, federal immigration officials are restricted from conducting warrantless arrests unless they have reason to believe a person has committed an offense and would be likely to flee before they're able to be detained.

In a social media post, DHS said the judge's order puts Americans at risk.

""At every turn activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst. Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community,"" DHS said.

Last month, Judge Cummings ruled agents had violated a previously agreed-upon consent decree over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area known as the 2022 Castañon Nava settlement.

Since that ruling, attorneys on both sides of the case have been working to identify how many people arrested by immigration agents this year violated the previously agreed-upon consent decree.

Mark Fleming of the National Immigrant Justice Center believes cases like these are happening daily.

""As we're digging into it, we are very concerned that many, if not most [ of ICE arrests ] , are violations of our consent decree,"" Fleming told the I-Team.

Fleming said so far, the list of people arrested in violation of the consent decree has grown to more than 3,000 people.

""Our initial analysis is that it's over 3,000 arrests,"" Fleming told the I-Team. ""We've started to dig into the case file that they produced to us, and the vast majority are violations. If they did not have a prior order of removal, in almost all circumstances, they've been uniformly violating the consent decree.""

So far, Fleming said that ICE has produced a list of 3,800 people, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol has given a list of 1,200 people, but he stressed that there may be duplicate entries on both lists, so his team does not have a solid total figure yet. Also, those lists were only through the beginning of October, and do not include arrests in the last month.

Attorneys representing the Department of Homeland Security have argued that Congress stripped federal courts of their authority to grant parole to large groups of immigrants in ICE custody.

In their filings, government attorneys argue, ""Congress has vested the authority to grant parole solely with the Secretary of Homeland Security... Federal courts cannot order the Department of Homeland Security to release any aliens on parole because Congress has stripped them of that authority.""

In their review of people arrested by agents potentially in violation of the consent decree, Fleming said more than 1,000 people are no longer in the U.S., meaning they may have been deported already after signing voluntary removal orders.

""A lot of these folks have never had any interaction with law enforcement before, nor been subject to detention, and so it's horrifying,"" Fleming explained.

Fleming continued, ""What we've raised to the court is if you don't provide this interim relief, there will be no one left. At the end of this, we may find thousands of violations, but there may be no one left.""

It found that an IJ improperly terminated a “withholding only” case involving a Honduran national who reentered illegally after removal. The bigger questions are why Biden-era regulations even allow such terminations, and whether Trump II plans on scrapping those regulations.

“Limited Proceedings”

Aliens who are inadmissible under section 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) or deportable under section 237(a) of the INA usually have their removability determined and eligibility for “relief” from removal (like asylum) adjudicated in removal proceedings under section 240 of the INA.

But section 240 removal proceedings are just one way in which questions involving alien removals are considered.

Pursuant to regulation, certain aliens seeking asylum, “statutory withholding” under section 241(b)(3) of the INA, and protection under Article III of the Convention Against Torture (CAT) — collectively “humanitarian protection” — are not entitled to the protections accorded in section 240 removal proceedings, but may only have their claims heard in “asylum-only” proceedings.

Such proceedings are the only forum for consideration of humanitarian protection claims by certain alien crewmembers, stowaways, applicants for admission under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), VWP overstays, and a handful of other aliens with limited due process rights in this country.

Then, there are aliens who reenter illegally after deportation pursuant to removal orders.

Section 241(a)(5) of the INA permits DHS to reinstate such orders without placing those aliens into removal proceedings again, but that doesn’t mean they will be immediately removed.

That’s because if such alien “reentrants” claim a fear of persecution or torture, they must, by regulation, be referred to a USCIS asylum officer to determine whether they have a “reasonable fear” of return.

Illegal reentrants aren’t eligible for asylum, but if an asylum officer concludes that they have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, DHS must place them into “withholding-only” proceedings before IJs to seek statutory withholding or CAT protection.

Asylum-only and withholding-only proceedings are both “limited proceedings”: the only issue before the immigration court is whether the alien is eligible for the available humanitarian relief. Other forms of relief (like adjustment of status) are off the table, and aliens in limited proceedings are barred from claiming they aren’t removable.

J-A-N-M-

The respondent in the BIA case, J-A-N-M-, is a Honduran national who was initially removed from the United States in August 2006. He thereafter reentered illegally at an unspecified time and place, and after DHS found him, the department reinstated his prior removal order in July 2024.

J-A-N-M- claimed he’d be harmed if returned to Honduras, an asylum officer found he had a reasonable fear, and in October 2024, DHS placed him into withholding-only proceedings.

In those proceedings, the IJ — having concluded J-A-N-M- was not credible — denied his applications for statutory withholding and CAT.

Issues arose in the case, however, because J-A-N-M- apparently also claims to have been a victim of criminal activity, as the record shows he has an application for a nonimmigrant “U visa” pending.

J-A-N-M- asked the IJ to administratively close — that is, shelve his withholding-only case indefinitely — while USCIS considers that U visa application, but because he was detained, the IJ denied that request.

For reasons that are unexplained in the BIA’s opinion, however, even though the IJ denied J-A-N-M-‘s request for administrative closure, he granted the alien’s request for “discretionary termination” of his withholding-only case.

“Discretionary Termination”

IJs have only had regulatory authority to terminate cases involving facially removable aliens like J-A-N-M- since May 2024, when the Biden administration published a final rule titled “Efficient Case and Docket Management in Immigration Proceedings”.

Among other things, that rule amended a prior regulation first implemented in 1997 (later recodified at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18), which prior to amendment solely governed the scheduling of cases — not their closure or termination.

The Biden-era rule rebranded the regulation “Docket Management” and (among other things) amended it to expand the authority of IJs to administratively close or alternatively terminate immigration cases filed by DHS.

As currently written, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(d)(2)(ii), “Other Proceedings ... Discretionary Termination”, states, in pertinent part:

In proceedings other than removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings, immigration judges may, in the exercise of discretion, terminate the case upon the motion of a party where terminating the case is necessary or appropriate for the disposition or alternative resolution of the case. However, immigration judges may not terminate a case for purely humanitarian reasons, unless DHS expressly consents to such termination, joins in a motion to terminate, or affirmatively indicates its non-opposition to a noncitizen's motion.

That was the authority the IJ relied on in terminating J-A-N-M-‘s withholding-only proceeding, and notably, the IJ terminated that case over DHS’s objection.

Matter of J-A-N-M-

DHS appealed that termination order, teeing the matter up for the BIA’s precedent opinion in Matter of J-A-N-M-.

Briefly, the Board held the IJ erred by not reading the next subparagraph in that Biden-era regulation, § 1003.18(d)(2)(iii), which specifically bars terminations of, inter alia, withholding-only proceedings “where prohibited by another regulatory provision”.

The other provision in question here is 8 C.F.R. § 1208.2(c)(3)(i), under which “all parties are prohibited from raising or considering any other issues” in withholding-only proceedings aside from whether the alien is eligible for statutory withholding and CAT, “including but not limited to issues of admissibility, deportability, eligibility for waivers, and eligibility for any other form of relief”.

Thus, the regulation barred the IJ from considering whether J-A-N-M- may also be eligible for other forms of relief (like a U visa) that could be adjudicated by a third agency (like USCIS) after termination.

On that basis, the BIA reversed the IJ.

The Bigger Issues

Note that the Biden administration only expanded 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18 to allow IJs to close and terminate pending cases after it had issued guidance to DHS attorneys encouraging them to administratively close, terminate, and dismiss then-pending cases that didn’t fit within its anti-enforcement “priorities”.

That guidance took a major toll on our immigration system. As the House Judiciary Committee explained in October 2024: “Under the Biden-Harris Administration, more than 700,000 illegal aliens ... had their cases dismissed, terminated, or administratively closed, allowing those aliens to stay in the country indefinitely without facing immigration consequences.”

In any event, by granting IJs termination and closure authority, the regulation ignores 42 years of case law, beginning with the BIA’s 1982 opinion in Matter of Quintero, where the Board held IJs:

may neither terminate nor indefinitely adjourn the proceedings in order to delay an alien's deportation. ... Once deportation proceedings have been initiated by [now DHS], the immigration judge may not review the wisdom of the [now-DHS's] action, but must execute his duty to determine whether the deportation charge is sustained by the requisite evidence in an expeditious manner.

Despite that fact, the authors of the rule contended it “neither alters, impacts, nor diminishes DHS’s prosecutorial authority or discretion” — a questionable contention, at best.

Even if you accept the argument that Biden’s DHS had “prosecutorial discretion” to ignore Congress’s detention and removal mandates in the INA, no judge in our system of justice — immigration or otherwise — can also be a “prosecutor”, or be given discretion to terminate a validly filed immigration case for any reason aside from the government’s inability to sustain its removal charges.

But by allowing IJs to terminate and close pending cases involving facially removable aliens over the government’s objections, that’s exactly what this regulation does. True, the rule prevents IJ’s from terminating cases “for purely humanitarian reasons” (whatever that means) over the government’s objection, but all other cases are fair game.

Moreover, the drafters of the rule argued that it doesn’t “authorize immigration judges ... to unilaterally decline to adjudicate cases, as administratively closed cases still remain pending on EOIR’s docket”.

That ignores the fact that, as of the end of June, more than 9.5 percent of the nearly 3.8 million cases pending before IJs were administratively closed (almost 362,000 in total), and that the “average length of time a case has been administratively closed” before an IJ at that point was just about “16 years”.

To be fair, the median length of time cases before IJs were administratively closed in June was a more modest 11-plus years, but still, that’s a long time for any case to “remain pending on EOIR’s docket”.

In its efforts to restore credibility to our immigration system, the Trump administration might want to look at the expansive regulatory authority its predecessor gave IJs to terminate and close immigration cases. The Board of Immigration Appeals’ latest decision offers a good vantage point from which to begin.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/CourtJudgeSocial.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 15:57:08.758744

The county, home to Houston, created the Immigrant Legal Services Fund program in 2020 and last month appropriated an additional $1.3 million to keep it going.
The program sends funds to five organizations that help people facing deportation get lawyers.

The county, home to Houston, created the Immigrant Legal Services Fund program in 2020 and last month appropriated an additional $1.3 million to keep it going. The program sends funds to five organizations that help people facing deportation get lawyers.

In a statement, Paxton called the program “evil and wicked,” as well as unconstitutional. This is the latest in a flurry of headline-grabbing lawsuits filed by Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, aimed at organizations that support immigrants.

The Harris County Jail leads the nation in ICE detainers — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to hold a person for deportation — as federal and state immigration enforcement has kicked into high gear under President Donald Trump.

The lawsuit was filed in Harris County District Court. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that the program was “perfectly legal” and his office would defend it in court.

“This lawsuit is a cheap political stunt,” he said. “At a time when the president has unleashed ICE agents to terrorize immigrant neighborhoods, deport U.S. citizens, and trample the law, it’s shameful that Republican state officials are joining in instead of standing up for Texans.”

The background:

When Harris County started the Immigrant Legal Services Fund in 2020, it was the largest county in the United States without a program aimed at helping immigrants get legal counsel. Austin, Dallas and San Antonio already had similar programs.

County Judge Lina Hidalgo proposed the program, which passed on a party-line vote.

“When you have a family at a deportation hearing and they don’t have an attorney, they’re deported at a much higher rate, like 90% of the time, compared to like 5% of the time when they do have an attorney,” Hidalgo said at the time, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The program sends county dollars to five organizations: BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Justice for All Immigrants, KIND, Inc. and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service.

Why Texas is suing:

Paxton argues in the lawsuit that these programs “serve no public purpose and instead constitute unconstitutional grants of public funds to private entities to subsidize individual deportation defenses.”

He is asking the judge to stop Harris County from disbursing funds to these organizations immediately, and bar them from doing so in the future.

Paxton has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Austin and San Antonio over their support of nonprofit organizations that help Texans access abortions. In June, the 15th Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, blocking San Antonio from using the funds the city had allocated to potentially help people who needed to travel out of the state for abortions.

What Harris County says:

Menefee said his office would “fight back” against this lawsuit, calling it a “cheap political stunt.”

After the October vote to allocate funding for the legal defense program, Commissioner Rodney Ellis said in a statement that it was necessary because of the increase in immigration raids.

“Having access to legal representation not only improves case outcomes but helps keep families together,” he said in a statement, according to the Houston Chronicle. “In a county as diverse as ours, local government must step up to safeguard safety, justice, and the people we serve.”

Several Democratic states, as well as scores of counties and cities, put various levels of restriction on law enforcement cooperation with ICE.

In letters released on Nov. 12, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and 39 other Democratic lawmakers urged like-minded governors to ensure that their residents’ data was not being vacuumed up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has become the speartip of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program.

“We urge you to block ICE’s access,” the letters said. “This commonsense step will improve public safety and guard against Trump officials using your state’s data for unjustified, politicized actions, while still allowing continued collaboration on serious crimes.”

Drivers’ license data is shared between state, local, and federal police forces through a nonprofit organization called Nlets. ICE and another Department of Homeland Security body, Homeland Security Investigations, also have access to the system, the letter said, and the two agencies together accounted for nearly 900,000 queries against the database in the year prior to Oct. 1.

Several Democratic states, as well as scores of counties and cities, put various levels of restriction on law enforcement cooperation with ICE. But the letter said that only a handful of states — including New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Minnesota — had blocked ICE from accessing the data they shared via Nlets, in part because state government employees were not aware of where it was going.

“Because of the technical complexity of Nlets’ system, few state government officials understand how their state is sharing residents’ data with federal and out-of-state agencies,” the letter said.

ICE did not return messages seeking comment. Nlets, whose acronym harks back to an earlier name, the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, also did not return messages. Governors’ offices in the four states identified as having blocked ICE, as well as Washington state, which the letter said had recently barred ICE from its data, and Oregon, which the letter said was in the process of doing so, did not return messages.

The push to cut ICE off from state data is another example of how state and local officials are trying to thwart or slow Trump’s mass deportation effort.

But Ryan Shapiro, the executive director of the government transparency group Property of the People, said it was also an illustration of how data-swapping arrangements between state, local, and federal law enforcement bodies are often so complicated that officials do not understand what they are sharing about their citizens.

“State agencies are often far better at collecting information than they are at safeguarding it,” he said.

The BBC’s leadership is facing a looming deadline over how to reply to Trump’s legal threat to file a case in a Florida court.
It relates to an edition of Panorama broadcast last year, which spliced together clips of a Trump speech made on 6 January 2021.
Trump has doubled down on his legal threat, stating he felt he had “an obligation” to sue the BBC.
There is anger within the BBC over the Trump edit.","The BBC is prepared to formally apologise to Donald Trump as part of its efforts to resolve his billion-dollar legal threat over its editing of one of his speeches, the Guardian understands.

However, figures at the corporation are also minded to be robust in defending its journalism in the face of allegations from Trump that it made “false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements” about him.

The BBC’s leadership is facing a looming deadline over how to reply to Trump’s legal threat to file a case in a Florida court. It follows the editing of a Trump speech in an edition of Panorama, which was a significant factor in the resignation of director general Tim Davie and Deborah Turness, its head of news.

Beyond a fresh apology, a critical question remains how far the BBC goes in defending its reporting more generally in the US, given claims from Trump’s allies that it publishes “fake news” in relation to him.

Its legal team has been drawing up its response to the complaint. It relates to an edition of Panorama broadcast last year, which spliced together clips of a Trump speech made on 6 January 2021. It has been accused of making it appear that he directly encouraged the US Capitol attack later that day.

The spliced clip suggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.” The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.

The Guardian understands that given an apology for the edit has been made by the BBC’s chair, Samir Shah, senior figures see no reason why a more personal apology cannot be made to the president in its official response to the legal threat. The corporation has concluded that the edit “gave the impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action”.

People familiar with the discussions over how to respond also said the apology meant it could push back at any wider criticisms of its journalism of the US in relation to the coverage of Trump. A US congressional committee found that Trump failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol.

Should Trump pursue legal action, the BBC leadership faces an invidious choice over a public battle with the US president or making a payment that will be seen as politically toxic, given it is publicly funded through the licence fee.

The BBC does have insurance covering legal challenges to its journalism. However, insiders acknowledge that there is always a pressure on legal costs should litigation stretch on for months.

Trump has doubled down on his legal threat, stating he felt he had “an obligation” to sue the BBC. “I guess I have to,” he told Fox News. “They defrauded the public and they’ve admitted it. This is within one of our great allies, supposedly our great ally.”

He added: “They showed me the results of how they butchered it up. It was very dishonest and the head man quit and a lot of the other people quit.”

Legal experts have questioned the Trump team’s chances of victory in any court case, given Florida’s liberal libel laws and the fact the Panorama episode was not available in the state. The broadcast was too long ago to take legal action in the UK. Trump would also have to prove he was damaged by the programme.

Trump has regularly been using lawsuits to attack criticism in the media, with several major networks opting to settle claims with one eye on their commercial interests. Trump also has outstanding cases against the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

The edit was one of the criticisms of the BBC raised in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left the role in the summer.

There is anger within the BBC over the Trump edit. However, there is also concern over the political nature of the Prescott memo, which outlines a series of claims of liberal bias relating to issues emerging over several years. The BBC has said some of the issues are historical, while serious action has already been taken in relation to others.

Prescott has said he had no political motivations in raising his concerns.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/522a9d0a43d2ebc69afdb305e1a5a526931c4393/0_1855_3884_3109/master/3884.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=278abddad0b89b1097143bace9cb5885",N,,2025-11-12 14:57:33.504469

Attorneys with the National Immigrant Justice Center and ACLU of Illinois say federal agents have arrested thousands of people in Chicago and Illinois during Operation Midway Blitz without a warrant or probable cause.

Immigration advocates argue federal agents violated a court order issued in 2022. The Castañon Nava Consent Decree limits ICE from making arrests simply out of fear that a suspect might escape before a warrant can be obtained.

On Oct. 8, a federal court ruled to extend the consent decree until at least Feb. 2, 2026. In that ruling, the judge said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE have violated the decree repeatedly, and improperly told field offices over the summer the consent decree had been canceled when it had not.

At a Wednesday hearing, the U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings issued several orders that could possibly lead to the release of thousands of people in the comings weeks.

First, Cummings ordered that 13 people identified by the plaintiffs as being unlawfully detained, and which the government conceded were in violation of the consent decree, be released from detention by Friday. Attorneys said after court they are hopeful these 13 will be released from custody within the next 48 hours, if not today. They will be released without bond.

Second, Cummings ordered a group of 615 people detained by ICE between June 2 and Oct. 7 be released into the agency's Alternatives to Detention programs by next Friday, Nov. 21, on $1,500 bond while their immigration cases are pending.

Attorneys for the detainees said they are concerned that some of the people who are now subject to release have either self-deported or been deported by the government, and said that could comprise several hundred people. The exact number of people who have now been ordered released who are still in detention facilities is not yet known.

Judge Cummings also ordered the government to produce a list of all people who have been detained both by ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents — thought to be more than 3,000 people — through the present day by next Wednesday, Nov. 19. That list must include information, including names, countries of origin, arrest date and a risk assessment.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they will then go through the list to identify more people wrongfully arrested without warrants and probable cause and argue for their release from custody as well.

""I think it will show that this whole operation, for the last two months, the terrorizing of our neighborhoods, the brutalizing of people here, has all been unlawful. That's what it's going to show,"" said Mark Fleming, attorney for the National Immigration Justice Center. ""It's going to show that all of this — all of the tactics of Mr. Bovino, all of the tactics of ICE — have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests. That's what it's gonna show. So if they plan to come back, now they'll have to abide by these court orders going forward and they cannot do their enforcement in this way.""

The government will also identify people on the list who they believe are risks to public safety or flight risk, and argue for them remaining in detention. The judge said he will honor those requests as long as the list does not seem egregious. The government has already identified 12 people of the 615 ruled on today who they say are public safety or flight risks.

The judge also said that anyone released into ATD programs who is officially found to have been arrested in violation of the consent decree will have their bond refunded and will be considered completely released from immigration custody. Those in the ATD programs are still considered to be in custody, they are just not physically detained and must continue to appear for immigration check-ins and court hearings.

""This court does not sit in a position of making any policy for the government,"" Judge Cummings said as he ruled.

Instead, he said, his position is to ensure the consent decree is enforced.

She and an unnamed accomplice were convicted for allegedly beating a “victim with a stick and electrical cable before throwing the victim out of a ninth-floor window,” according to the Department of Homeland Security.

A statement issued by the DHS claimed that Sorocean was first arrested on January 10, 2020. After filing multiple appeals with the Board of Immigration Appeals, she was eventually released in 2022.

“It shocks the conscience that the Biden Administration released into America a cruel, violent illegal alien who tortured a human being, beat them with an electrical cable and a stick, and then threw her victim from a ninth-floor window,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an official statement. “These are the types of barbaric criminal illegal aliens ICE is targeting every single day.

“70% of all ICE arrests are of illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. This does not even include foreign fugitives like this convicted murderer.

“Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, the world’s criminals are no longer welcome in the U.S.”

The DHS released a picture of the Moldovan national in the backseat of a car. Sorocean can be seen in the photograph with her blonde hair tied back, as she clutches a water bottle and waits in the back of an ICE vehicle.

In her home country, she was convicted of intentional murder in 2013 and was set to be jailed for 17 years. Currently, Sorocean remains in ICE custody according to the DHS statement.

The arrest comes as the second Trump Administration pushes ahead with its controversial, hardline deportation program.

During an interview on the CBS News show 60 Minutes, Trump claimed that ICE raids “haven’t gone far enough,” despite a recent report from Politico finding that more than 100 federal judges have ruled against the massive deportation scheme.

The White House previously reported that it was on track to smash deportation records this year, after removing more than 515,000 people from the country. The administration has claimed that over 1.6 million undocumented people have self-deported this year.

However, Aaron Reichlin Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, has said that “these numbers are NOT trustworthy.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/12/13/01/Screenshot-2025-11-12-at-13-08-35.png?trim=0,10,0,9&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-12 16:57:00.235960

EXCLUSIVE: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said a member of Sen. Tammy Duckworth’s office misrepresented himself as the attorney of a detained illegal immigrant to facilitate their release.

According to a letter sent Wednesday to Duckworth, D-Ill., U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Acting Director Todd Lyons said the staffer told federal agents he was the attorney of Jose Ismeal Ayuzo Sandoval — a 40-year-old illegal immigrant previously deported four times to Mexico and who had a DUI conviction.

DHS CALLS OUT NBC AFFILIATE FOR HIDING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIME HISTORY IN ARREST STORY

The letter says the staffer entered an ICE facility in St. Louis, Illinois, on Oct. 29.

""At approximately 1:29 p.m., an individual identified as Edward York, who according to publicly available information, is employed as a Constituent Outreach Coordinator for your Senate office, entered the field office lobby, and in a discussion with a federal officer, claimed to be Mr. Ayuzo’s attorney. Mr. York demanded to speak with his ‘client,’"" the letter states.

""This staff member allegedly did so to gain access to the detainee and seek his release from custody, and he accomplished it by falsifying an official Department of Homeland Security (DHS) form.""

While at the facility, York successfully met with Ayuzo and got him to sign a G-28 form, the letter said. It allows an attorney to represent a client on immigration matters, empowering them to receive official correspondence, communicate with government agencies on their behalf and more.

After attaining a release order, the staffer then tried to submit the form without Sandoval’s signature, even after having completed the G-28 form in person, the letter said.

""Four days later, a Suarez Law Office in Collinsville, Illinois filed a G-28 electronically that did not have Mr. Ayuzo’s signature, even though Mr. York, who claimed to work for the law firm, had already obtained a signed form,"" the letter describes.

""It appears as if Mr. York may have collaborated with the firm to cover his misrepresentation.""

ICE said it could not verify that York was an attorney.

The agency further became suspicious of the picture when they discovered a post to Facebook describing the incident. The post, put up by the Montgomery County Illinois Democrats’ page, described that a staffer had gone to a field office with a packet of documents and a release order with the intention of misrepresenting himself to law enforcement, the letter said.

Lyons' letter requests a response from Duckworth’s office no later than Nov. 17, demanding answers surrounding York’s employment, whether he knowingly lied on government documents, and whether he acted with the knowledge of other members of Duckworth’s staff.

""I implore all members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, as well as their staff, to stop the political games that put law enforcement and detainees at risk,"" Lyons wrote.

""It is my sincere hope that you will advocate on behalf of your constituents who have been victimized by illegal alien crime and work with DHS to remove these criminals from the United States.""

Information recently released by Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) shows Smith subpoenaed the phone records of eight of his GOP colleagues: Sens.
Smith also sought the records of Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), but as a House member, he would not benefit from the bill.
This provision would not give any Americans other than U. S. Senators these rights,” Raskin wrote.
“If we believe that citizens should receive notice when the government subpoenas their phone bill, great!","The top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee slammed a Senate-approved plan to reopen the government that would also pave the way for eight GOP senators to earn significant sums from litigation challenging the search of their phone records related to Jan. 6.

Tucked into the GOP proposal, which eight Democratic senators also approved, the bill requires telecommunications companies to alert senators if their data has been obtained. But it also allows those whose phone records were seized as part of special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation to earn substantial sums from legal challenges stemming from the matter.

Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) called the provision “one of the most blatantly corrupt provisions for political self-dealing and the plunder of public resources ever proposed in Congress.”

The provision, which is retroactive to 2022, only applies to members of the Senate and would allow them to sue for $500,000 if data was sought without their being notified, as well as once it was obtained.

“That’s a cool one million per Senator,” Raskin said in a statement.

“There was no ‘phone tap’ or eavesdropping on the content of their conversations. The call records subpoenaed were the kind of information you see on a phone bill—a list of calls made and received,” he said, adding that the eight senators were “pathetically casting themselves as victims.”

Smith sought the phone records of eight senators as well as one member of the House during his investigation into Jan. 6, including those known to have spoken to President Trump during the riot at the Capitol.

Information recently released by Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) shows Smith subpoenaed the phone records of eight of his GOP colleagues: Sens. Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Bill Hagerty (Tenn.), Josh Hawley (Mo.), Ron Johnson (Wis.), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Dan Sullivan (Alaska) and Tommy Tuberville (Ala.).

Smith also sought the records of Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), but as a House member, he would not benefit from the bill.

Raskin said it would be inappropriate for lawmakers to earn a payday from routine law enforcement action.

“The Senators may not like being treated like the rest of America, but these phone-record subpoenas and non-disclosure orders are routine in grand jury investigations at the state and federal level. No one has an absolute right to be notified that their call records have been subpoenaed, much less the right to a million bucks if it happens. This provision would not give any Americans other than U. S. Senators these rights,” Raskin wrote.

“If we believe that citizens should receive notice when the government subpoenas their phone bill, great! Perhaps this revolutionary new policy—which civil liberties groups would probably support—should be the law. But then the law should protect the civil liberties of all 320 million Americans, as the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution demands, not just the 100 Americans in the Senate.”

The legislation does include some caveats. The Justice Department would not be required to alert a senator that their records were sought if the lawmaker was the target of the investigation, allowing a federal judge to delay any such notification requirements.

The legislation comes as Trump has also sought compensation from the Justice Department related to his own legal troubles, asking for a $230 million settlement related to the investigation conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller and from Smith’s classified documents probe.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/raskinjamie_093025gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-12 13:57:32.990908

In interviews, a man detained at Pine Prairie through June and a legal consultant for another man held there this summer described a crowded facility with scarce resources — men sleeping on floors due to an alleged lack of beds inside packed dormitories; detainees wearing the same uniforms for several days because they weren’t given a change of clothing (not even underwear), pleading with staff for hygiene products to keep themselves clean and denied access to medical care and other services.

“These kinds of conditions are deadly and they’re not tenable and they’re not fit for human life,” said Alexandra Smolyar, an attorney at Georgia-based nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice who consulted with the man detained at Pine Prairie over the Summer.

Pine Prairie, which is run by the private prison corporation the GEO Group, has a contract with ICE that calls for a maximum daily population of 500. But it has been operating well above its contractual capacity of 500 detainees since as early as mid-April, according to information from data research organization Transactional Records Access Clearing House (TRAC) at Syracuse University, or TRAC. While ICE reported that Pine Prairie had an average daily population of 788 on September 15, the most recent date for which a count is available, TRAC researchers have calculated the average population at that time at 915 people.

Since President Trump was sworn in for his second term — promising an unprecedented crackdown on undocumented immigrants, no matter whether they have criminal records or are considered dangerous — the number of people being held in immigration detention has skyrocketed by 69%, from just over 39,000 in December to about 66,000 today.

Complaints from immigrant rights advocates about poor conditions inside detention centers are not uncommon. In 2020 and 2021, federal oversight bodies received several complaints from advocates about lack of hygiene products and personal protective equipment inside Louisiana’s immigration detention facilities, including Pine Prairie, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As that detained population has grown in 2025, media reports and advocates have described cramped quarters where living conditions have gone from bad under the Biden Administration, to much worse under Trump.

Advocates told Verite News that Pine Prairie is a case in point. They said capacity issues are leading to worsening conditions at the facility, which already had a long history of complaints alleging human rights abuses and civil rights violations.

“This year it feels much worse,” said Tania Wolf, an advocacy manager at the National Immigration Project, who has gone on frequent visits to ICE detention centers in Louisiana. “It feels like things are getting to a point where things are gonna boil over in terms of conditions.”

A ‘horrible pressure point’

Lenin, a Honduran citizen who was detained at Pine Prairie from October 2024 until he was deported in June, said in an interview last week that conditions at the facility were poor during the entirety of his stay. Lenin, who said he fled his birth country in 2015 after MS-13 gang members allegedly killed a close relative and threatened to kill him, asked Verite News to publish only his middle name because he fears for his safety since he has returned to Honduras.

Lenin said when he first arrived at Pine Prairie he was placed in a crowded dorm where some men slept on the floor. He said that he and other detainees had been given only one pair of underwear and one uniform, leaving them with no way of changing into clean clothes for days. They had difficulty getting hygiene items, including soap, shampoo, toothpaste and at times even toilet paper, Lenin said. The dorm was kept cold and staff would not respond to detainees’ requests to increase the temperature, he alleged, adding that staff often denied him visits to the medical unit to receive medication or treatment for anxiety and depression.

“They don’t treat us like humans,” Lenin said. “If you don’t speak English, you can’t have anything,”

In late July and in early August, attorney Alexandra Smolyar, at the Georgia-based nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice, sent emails to immigrant rights lawyers who work in Louisiana, including Wolf, alleging “absolutely abysmal” conditions inside Pine Prairie, relayed to her by a detainee with whom she had consulted.

The details laid out in her emails are similar to the conditions that Lenin described — inadequate clothing leading to detainees wearing the same clothes for days on end, guards shouting and using profanity when speaking to detainees, staff skipping nightly pill calls causing people to miss medications, detainees getting the wrong medication.

“Overcrowding is growing more dire by the day; medical care is severely lacking; there’s no access to a law library or mail,” she wrote in an August email. “The conditions are really harrowing.”

In a September interview, Smolyar said the Pine Prairie detainee she was in contact with, who has since been deported, described to her a packed intake area for people initially booked into the facility with one shower, one toilet and one sink and detainees sleeping on bare mattresses set on the floor of a holding cell. (Smolyar declined to identify the former Pine Prairie detainee she was in contact with, but she said he was deported in August.)

“It epitomized how the expansion of detention is coming to this horrible, horrible pressure point where people’s lives are in jeopardy every day,” Smolyar said.

Wolf said she had already become concerned about overcrowding at Pine Prairie in July, when she attended a standard tour of the detention center.

Wolf said she and others on the tour — which was approved by ICE officials — repeatedly asked staff and accompanying ICE agents for a count of detainees booked into the facility that day. In her notes, Wolf wrote that the group was never given a population count. The omission, she said, was very unusual.

When the tour got to the visitation area — a space where detainees often meet with attorneys — Wolf said it looked more run down than in previous visits she’d made to Pine Prairie.

“It just looked a little bit more — for lack of a better term — lived in,” Wolf said.

Wolf said detainees later told her that some of them had been sleeping in the visitation unit due to overcrowding. In a phone interview this week, Wolf said she’d never heard of a facility making detainees sleep in its visitation area before then.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the GEO Group, the company that operates Pine Prairie, denied claims of worsening living conditions at the facility.

“GEO strongly rejects these baseless claims, which are preposterous and bizarre,” wrote GEO Group Director of Corporate Relations Christopher Ferreira. “The Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center provides high quality support services that adhere to ICE’s detention standards and contract requirements, which provide for ample access to pre-scheduled recreation opportunities both indoors and outdoors. Individuals at the Center are in no way deprived of natural light nor are they subjected to excessive artificial light.”

In an emailed statement, ICE spokesperson Tamara Spicer, did not answer specific questions about conditions at Pine Prairie but said the agency is experiencing “unprecedented operational demands” due to “recent unlawful border crossings.”

“ICE has appropriately intensified enforcement operations to restore integrity to the system,” Spicer said. “The volume of apprehensions is not the result of ICE policy but the direct result of individuals choosing to break the law. ICE will not apologize for enforcing U.S. law.”

Problems with ICE’s average daily population figures

ICE provides bimonthly reports with “snapshots” of the total number of detainees in its custody in each state and overall. But, for individual facilities, the agency only reports the average daily population — pooling numbers from the start of the fiscal year (October 1) through the present day. The result is a skewed perception of how many people are detained at a facility at any given time.

In April, ICE reported that Pine Prairie detained an average of 689 people — though ICE records show the population reached as high as 923 on April 13, a number obtained by TRAC through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Data researchers have responded to the lack of consistent data on daily population counts by creating a new method to calculate the average daily populations that they say provides more accurate results for how many people are currently (or have recently been) detained at a facility. To find the “interval average daily populations,” as they call it, researchers compare the two most recently reported average daily populations and then compare that number to the total days between when those two average daily population numbers were reported.

Researchers publish the most recent interval average daily population figures for individual ICE detention centers on deportationreports.com, a directory with information about ICE facilities. According to the site, on Sept. 2, Pine Prairie’s interval daily population was 1,010 detainees, more than double its contractual capacity and 233 people and more than ICE’s reported average population for the same day of 783 people.

Overcrowding in ICE facilities began making headlines in March, when images and video from inside Krome detention center in Miami showed detainees sleeping on floors with cardboard boxes for makeshift mattresses.

According to data obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests and analyzed by researchers at TRAC, nearly half of all ICE facilities in the country were housing more detainees than their contracts with ICE allowed as early as April.

That data showed two other Louisiana facilities, Richwood Correctional Center and Winn Correctional Center, run by private prison company LaSalle Corrections, were operating over their contractual capacities by several dozen detainees.

LaSalle Corrections did not respond to emailed requests for comment on its facilities’ operating over capacity.

Backed up

Wolf said that on the tour at Pine Prairie, staff referred to the detention center as an “overflow” facility for ICE’s staging facility in Alexandria that sits on the tarmac of an international airport that is the Department of Homeland Security’s main deportation hub. Considered the final stop for many migrants before they are removed from the U.S., the staging facility is supposed to hold detainees for 72-hours or less, while ICE prepares for their deportation flights. However, in September, the Guardian reported that many detainees are being held at Alexandria for longer than three days.

“For the system to work … the people who are going to be funneled into the staging facility need to be somewhere else in the weeks preceding,” said Norah Ahmed, legal director at ACLU of Louisiana.

According to Ahmed, Pine Prairie appears to be operating as a pre-staging facility — holding detainees with orders of deportation who may have exhausted their options for legal ways to remain in the country while their deportation flights are being prepared. She said when flights don’t take off as planned, due to unforeseen circumstances, such as negotiation breakdowns between the U.S. and countries accepting deportees, sometimes people get returned to Pine Prairie after it has already accepted new residents to take their place, contributing to overcrowding.

Lenin spent roughly nine months at Pine Prairie. As the facility was growing more crowded, Lenin said, he was in solitary confinement. He said staff told him it was for his own safety after a confrontation with other detainees. He said he told staff members that isolation, inside a small room with no windows to the outside world and where the hallway lights were kept on continuously, might exacerbate his anxiety and depression. But he remained in segregation, he said until his deportation in June.

Smolyar, who works mainly with people detained in Georgia, said she fears that, in the months since the detainee she was consulting with at Pine Prairie was deported, things have gotten worse.

“We’re seeing incredibly high numbers of people being detained. They’re being pushed to a breaking point,” Smolyar said. “These kinds of conditions are deadly and they’re not tenable and they’re not fit for human life.”

The plans are preliminary and could change, the sources told ABC News. It is unclear if they would run at the same time or one city would go first.

Bovino has become the on-the-ground face of President Donald Trump's effort to surge federal law enforcement into blue states and cities regardless whether local official want them there -- First in Los Angeles, now in Chicago, where aggressive clashes with protesters have been at the core of ongoing litigation.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office, which serves Charlotte, told CNN that neither its office nor Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are involved in planning of federal operations and have not been in contact with government officials regarding the reported move.

The sheriff's office ""has not been contacted by any (Customs and Border Protection) representatives regarding any potential operations, nor have we been involved in any planning or conversations,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to continue operations in Chicago.

In a statement, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN, ""We aren't leaving Chicago,"" and cited a drop in street crime in the city since Operation Midway Blitz began.

The discussion of Bovino moving on from Chicago comes shortly after he was personally called out by a federal judge.

US District Court Judge Sara Ellis was angered that Bovino initially said he had lobbed tear gas at a group of protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault against him came after his use of force.

""Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,"" Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a preliminary injunction blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists, ""unless such force is objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat of the person causing serious bodily injury or death to another person.""

That order also requires agents to warn protesters at least twice before deploying tear gas and less-lethal munitions like pepper balls. The Trump administration is appealing the injunction and asking for its enforcement to be delayed while an appeals court panel considers the case.

The injunction from Judge Ellis came after Bovino sat for hours of videotaped testimony, clips of which were played in court. Those excerpts showed Bovino frequently butting heads with an attorney for the plaintiffs, arguing that protesters on the receiving end of riot control munitions were ""violent rioters and assaultive subjects.""

Bovino also denied tackling one protester, Scott Blackburn, saying the incident captured on camera did not count as a ""reportable use of force"" because he was in the process of arresting Blackburn.

Ellis was not impressed with the hair-splitting. ""In one of the videos, Defendant Bovino obviously attacks and tackles the declarant, Mr. Blackburn, to the ground,"" she said.

Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year that the administration was ""making a determination.""

""Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad?"" he said.

The answer, chilling, at least to me, is: Because my team and I spent decades at the Department of Justice making sure that such lawsuits would be dismissed, typically without trial, and often even without discovery.

For half a century, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents has been hailed as the primary safeguard against unconstitutional actions by federal officers. Bivens permitted victims of these actions to seek money damages from individual federal officers directly under the Constitution. These actions are often analogized to the far more common “Section 1983” claims available against state and local officials under the Civil Rights Act of 1871. But accountability under Bivens is far more constrained than many lawyers might assume. Certainly, if you ask the general public whether they think there is a way to file a civil suit and receive compensation—whether from individual officers or the United States more broadly—for constitutional violations such as excessive or deadly force by federal actors, the general belief is: of course. Yet constitutional violations hardly ever result in the payment of damages. The reality is the behemoth that was Bivens now no longer serves victims of constitutional harms, the federal workforce as a whole, individual officers in particular, or society at large. Those in the United States must look somewhere else for recompense, deterrence, settled litigation expectations, and institutional and jurisprudential order.

Here’s why.

In October, a certiorari petition was filed in Nielsen v. Watanabe—a case concerning a federal inmate (Kekai Watanabe) who suffered a fractured coccyx in a prison gang fight, causing chronic pain, but was not sent to the hospital. (Wantanabe’s counsel was granted an extension of time to respond until Jan. 5, 2026.) Buried at the end, the petitioner mused that the Supreme Court “may wish to consider whether it should dispense with Bivens altogether.”

To be clear, for many of the reasons petitioner raises, the case presented an exceedingly poor vehicle for individual-capacity remedy under any construction. Any failure in Watanabe’s medical treatment was likely institutional—in my three decades at Justice, I never encountered a scenario where a lengthy delay in carceral care was the product of malfeasance by an individual or rogue official. Certainly, only the United States could come close to satisfying the $3 million in damages sought by Watanabe. Nonetheless, a split panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a district court’s decision to dismiss the Bivens claim. And although rehearing and rehearing en banc were subsequently denied, permitting the Bivens claim to proceed, 11 judges dissented from that decision

On behalf of the Nielsen petitioner, Jeffrey Lamken and his colleagues correctly argue that under current Supreme Court precedent, the Ninth Circuit’s decision is flatly wrong. Lamken, former assistant to the solicitor general and frequent Supreme Court participant, is himself no stranger to Bivens litigation, having successfully argued Hasty/Ziglar v. Abbasi, a landmark 2017 Supreme Court Bivens case arising out of the post-9/11 era. (I worked on that case as well.) In light of Supreme Court decision after decision cutting back on Bivens, even in arenas that arguably on their face involve routine law enforcement operations, lower courts across the country continue to struggle to understand the question: What if anything is “left” of Bivens? To be fair to the judges in the panel majority in Nielsen, the Supreme Court has made it exceedingly difficult for lower courts to apply Bivens in the first instance, at least if they are to assume in good faith that there is anything left of implied constitutional tort remedies at all.

The Nielsen certiorari petition does a more than creditable job explaining (under every criterion imaginable) why the Supreme Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit. It soft-sells the revisit Bivens question itself, presumably because the attorneys who wrote it felt they owed it to their client to do so. But reversing the Ninth Circuit decision, and not Bivens itself, would simply perpetuate the immense problems surrounding the entire implied constitutional tort doctrine in the first instance—creating problems for judges, problems for litigants on all sides and across every gradient on the ideological spectrum, and problems for institutional and jurisprudential order.

The Court can—and legally should—reverse Bivens. The sooner the better.

When Bivens Had Teeth

When I joined the Justice Department in 1990, Bivens offered a modest but meaningful check on federal power. The Supreme Court had recognized that a citizen whose Fourth Amendment rights were violated by federal officers entering their home without a warrant could seek damages directly under the Constitution. Bivens itself was born of judicial fiction—a way for people to seek damages in federal court without a legislated remedy. The United States couldn’t be sued directly because of sovereign immunity. And while the United States might be sued under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for certain common law torts, such as negligence or a car accident where an on-duty federal employee was at fault and a private person would be liable under state law—those didn’t typically have the breadth or gravitas of a constitutional claim. As the Bivens Court itself noted, “the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own.” The FTCA, and its pre-suit administrative remedies, can provide meaningful tort recovery. Its waiver, however, contains substantial limitations when compared against traditional civil litigation: It does not provide for punitive damages; cases are tried to a judge, not a jury; and a number of exceptions apply to exclude liability for particular torts, such as for malicious prosecution by prosecutors, or more significantly the discretionary function exception, are often a substantial barrier to recovery.

Despite the potential for some overlapping recovery for common law claims under the FTCA, Bivens and its early progeny allowed plaintiffs to recover damages from individual federal officers directly for constitutional torts. When it created the Bivens remedy, the Supreme Court strongly suggested it would be narrow. Justice John Marshall Harlan’s concurrence famously intoned, “For people in Bivens’ shoes, it is damages or nothing.” At that time, courts generally considered Bivens confined to narrow search and seizure contexts, a limitation that made practical sense. Potential Fourth Amendment violations tend to be the most “hands on.” Due to the dangerous and rapidly unfolding circumstances in which they often occur, unreasonable searches and seizures risk death and serious injury in a way that could not be remedied through traditional forms of equitable relief or other post-deprivation processes. And at least in the days before cell phones or body cams, they often occurred beyond the public eye. This all paved the way for lawsuits that were essentially high-stakes swearing matches. Unscrupulous plaintiffs (or unscrupulous officers) could perjure their way to a jury (or out of accountability) and hope for the best. Such litigation imposed heavy and at times unpredictable litigation burdens on both the parties and the courts.

Over time, with the Supreme Court’s imprimatur, the reach of Bivens grew—in 1979 to Fifth Amendment substantive due process claims for gender discrimination and in 1980, to Eighth Amendment failure to provide medical care to a federal prisoner having an acute asthma attack, causing his death.

Over the years, lower courts extended it further—to procedural due process, First Amendment expression, retaliation, and religion claims, and beyond. Eventually, nearly every conceivable action by the federal government with some constitutional hook, regardless of context, became a feeding ground for litigation against federal employees personally. And systemic litigation burdens grew accordingly.

I represented—or advised on the representation of—clients of all ranks, from all agencies, and across administrations and ideologies. Over the years, every sort of federal employee became a Bivens defendant: Janet Reno, Donald Rumsfeld, John Ashcroft, John Yoo, Stephen Miller, William Barr, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump. Admirals and generals. Drone operators, line-level FBI and ICE agents, prison wardens, chaplains, and guards. The list goes on. Judges eager to vindicate constitutional rights assumed that if there were an alleged wrong, there must be a personal-capacity remedy, even though Congress never created the federal equivalent to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (the aforementioned Section 1983 claims).

Such an expansive view of Bivens chilled decision-making, making federal service a calculated risk. Imagine every policy decision inviting suit against a cabinet secretary and those carrying out policy mandates? Yet decades of Bivens litigation proceeded on that assumption. For line federal employees and their families, the costs of Bivens were stark and personal. Few if any expected to be sued for doing their jobs. But process servers appeared at their homes. Their assets, even their children’s education, were at stake. Many faced reputational damage and years, even decades, of litigation. Even mere exposure to suit forced disclosure on mortgage or other applications—essentially a scarlet letter for doing your job. Meritless suits—from pro se litigants or claimants with a political ax to grind—were common.

Still today, federal employees aren’t even guaranteed Justice Department representation—those decisions remain discretionary. And federal officials have never had an entitlement to indemnification. Each individual federal agency determines when, if ever, it will indemnify its officers. For instance, for Justice Department officers, such as FBI agents, indemnification is discretionary; the department “may” indemnify where it is in the United States’s interests to do so, and pre-judgment indemnification (for example, settlement) is prohibited absent “exceptional circumstances.” These discretionary administrative determinations are generally unreviewable by courts.

State or local officials, by contrast (and precisely because of the potential reach of Section 1983 liability), tend in most circumstances to benefit from automatic representation and guaranteed indemnification. With respect to the balance to be struck between having the federal government waive its liability for constitutional torts and preserving Bivens suits against individuals, Congress debated various proposals. Congress ultimately passed the Westfall Act in 1988—excluding constitutional torts from the exclusivity provisions that apply to common law torts under the FTCA (which can proceed against only the government and not the individual). In this process, some civil rights advocates, perhaps hoping for big jury awards akin to Section 1983 in Bivens actions, and worried about other limits on the United States’s FTCA liability, opposed broad immunity for federal employees and the substitution of the United States in their shoes. But even in its headiest days, Bivens was a sorry substitute for Section 1983, other forms of tort liability such as the FTCA, or any real make-whole relief. There was no entity liability and no attorneys’ fees for substantially prevailing, and individual indemnification was limited or nonexistent.

Meanwhile, courts and litigants expended enormous resources parsing Bivens’s boundaries without legislative guidance and in the face of a vacillating Supreme Court. Jury verdicts, the handful of times they happened, almost never converted to real recovery. Agents lacked resources, and, still, indemnification was not guaranteed. Moreover (as with civil rights claims under Section 1983), even with a jury verdict in hand, qualified immunity—barring recovery even where a constitutional violation occurred if the officer did not violate “clearly established” law—could intervene on appeal when the question was a legal one for the court, not the jury. Bivens’s claws cut deep.

Caging the Beast: Special Factors Doctrine

At the Justice Department, I was one of the principal architects of what became known as the “special factors” doctrine. This judicially created exception to Bivens was first applied modestly by the Supreme Court in 1988 in Schweiker v. Chilicky, a case in which plaintiffs’ Social Security disability benefits were wrongfully withheld. Though the benefits themselves had been reinstated, the plaintiffs sued under Bivens for emotional distress and other damages for the period they were denied. Relying on a line in Bivens itself, the Court refused to recognize a remedy given “special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.”

For nearly 10 years, while Chilicky was on the books, “special factors” went nowhere. It was certainly not the term of art it is today. When I first proposed the argument that “special factors” should bar a constitutional tort suit—in a case involving Agriculture Department officials in Arkansas accused of racial discrimination in distributing farm subsidies—my bosses were more than a little skeptical.

But we ran with it—and won, both in district court and at the Eighth Circuit.

For a young attorney, convinced of the argument’s legal soundness, and determined to vindicate her clients, that victory was elemental. Areas in which we made the argument began to expand (due primarily to the expansion of contexts in which plaintiffs began to pursue cases against federal officers). The governmental response, many would say over-response, to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks proved groundbreaking. Civil rights litigators sought to remedy every infirmity in the United States’s response to 9/11—including those most appropriately addressed through political processes—through Bivens. In the early days we lost some cases, cases clearly inappropriate for ad hoc, judge-made law. But eventually the sense in the arguments began to take hold and courts listened. And brick by brick, case by case, we caged Bivens, limiting it to a handful of contexts.

Many folks, even some within the Justice Department, understandably questioned the bona fides of pushing the bounds of special factors. Didn’t its logical extension mean nothing was left of Bivens? And how did that square with Supreme Court precedent and stare decisis? Over time, though, that is exactly where the Supreme Court moved, increasingly recognizing limits on Bivens, including separation-of-powers considerations, national and border security, alternative processes, and policy discretion.

So, what’s the takeaway for anyone—including U.S. citizens—injured in that Chicago immigration raid? Based on a trinity of more recent Supreme Court rulings, the Court has green-lighted the argument that no damages remedy exists. In Ziglar v. Abbasi, the Court rejected a Bivens remedy to challenge confinement conditions, including strip searches and abuse claims, on detainees in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. In Hernandez v. Mesa, the Court held there was no damages remedy for the use of deadly force by a border patrol agent standing in the United States that resulted in the death of a teenager on the Mexican side of the border. And in Egbert v. Boule, the Court refused to extend an implied remedy against a border patrol agent for excessive force and First Amendment retaliation claims by a U.S. citizen operating a business near a port of entry along the Canadian border. The Court’s “test,” on whether to imply a constitutional tort remedy, now boils down to a single question: Is there any reason to think that Congress might be better equipped to create a damages remedy? The practical consequence is that lower courts’ attempts to expand Bivens are no longer good law, and it is unclear whether even the narrow categories in which the Supreme Court recognized a remedy, including Bivens itself, would survive scrutiny under the modern analysis. As the Nielsen petition notes, Bivens is a “zombie,” dead on arrival in all but a scant handful of cases (of which, at the end of the day, and however the Supreme Court manages it, Nielsen is unlikely to be one).

When False Judicial Promise Meets Fading Executive Accountability

Perhaps that is as it should be. Congress never created a cause of action, and courts have long proved ill-suited to fashion one. Bivens was, from the start, a judicial workaround and, as it turns out, not an especially effective one, regardless of whose perspective is being considered: civil rights plaintiffs, civil rights defendants, or the bench. Bivens is a false promise of the very worst sort.

Moreover, as the Court has reminded us in declining to recognize Bivens remedies, there have traditionally been other checks on federal misconduct: inspectors general, internal investigations, and—where warranted—criminal prosecutions. Federal actors are more visible, more supervised, and more accountable than local law enforcement. They have traditionally been better trained and more rigorously screened, and bad behavior has traditionally been met with stern executive and congressional oversight.

When the horrors of Abu Ghraib—another failed Bivens context—surfaced, Congress intervened swiftly to prohibit waterboarding and limit interrogation practices. Congress has at other times acted when tort systems prove unworkable or ill-suited to address injuries that fairness and public opinion demand be remedied: Consider the Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. These measures—including several recent amendments and extensions—illustrate that with enough motivation, Congress can design targeted tort and quasi-tort remedies that balance victim interests, public accountability and institutional stability all while insulating putative defendants who carry out vital federal functions.

But what happens when the internal checks and balances are removed? When the public doesn't trust federal officials to investigate wrongdoing and ensure accountability? When Congress abdicates oversight? When the government lowers its standards, cuts training, and sends poorly prepared agents into communities as ad hoc police? What happens when officers deploy in masks without badges, when their actions are shielded from scrutiny, and complaints can’t even be filed? When the United States fires career Justice Department prosecutors and enlists self-styled “patriots” to mete out “justice”?

That’s neither hyperbole nor hypothetical.

By executive order, on the second anniversary of the murder of George Floyd, the Biden administration established the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database (NLEAD), a central repository documenting instances of misconduct as well as commendations and awards for law enforcement officers. It was designed to strengthen hiring practices and increase transparency and accountability. While not without its challenges and critics, the NLEAD was regarded as a positive step by a diverse coalition of federal agencies and advocacy and human rights organizations. On the day of his inauguration, however, President Trump rescinded Biden’s order.

With no civil liability (for officers or the entity), with weakening internal oversight, and in the face of congressional silence, the United States now effectively has a system where federal power is nearly immune from accountability in any form other than political—and where the institutional checks meant to replace it are failing in real time.

Should Bivens, or Some Comparable Creature of Personal Liability, Be Unleashed?

Maybe so, some say. James E. Pfander and Rex N. Alley, for example, put forth the restoration of common law intentional tort claims against individual federal officers as worth considering. The answer to this question is certainly not open and shut: There is some intuitive appeal to the notion that a weak Bivens is better than no Bivens at all. What is clear is that the current Court has zero interest in resurrecting Bivens, and a majority has been happy to write it out of existence altogether.

Is it true that without individual-capacity liability, there is no genuine individual deterrence for bad conduct? While reasonable minds can differ, in a system with robust checks and balances, that’s not my experience. In my three decades at the Department of Justice, I examined the conduct of federal officials in every conceivable factual scenario to determine whether or not federal representation would be authorized in their Bivens suits. I advised the alphabet soup of federal agencies about constitutional practices and directly represented and oversaw the representation of hundreds upon hundreds of clients in individual cases. I can count on one hand the number of times some truly rogue federal officer violated the Constitution. And news flash: Truly bad actors aren’t modifying their conduct because they think they might be tagged with Bivens liability!

Federal officers who are well screened, hired, and trained, including those in the immigration, law enforcement, and carceral settings, are—almost down to a person—hardworking, dedicated, competent folks. They may occasionally make mistakes, but they try their best to carry out their mission of public trust, especially where internal checks, balances, and recognition for doing a good job are robust. Again in my experience—and my former office considered almost every Bivens case filed throughout the country for purposes of determining federal represetation—in the rare case where a federal constitutional violation occurred, it was almost always because of a decision by higher-up policymakers in exceedingly difficult times who because of time or other factors did not necessarily understand the operational nuances involved, or where an agency culture lacking accountability and internal checks and balances prevailed.

Regardless, without a legislative remedy, any Bivens-type liability will fall prey to the same slings and arrows that cut it down this time around. The systemic costs of courts trying to reinvent Bivens (or its doppelganger), its unpredictable litigation burdens, and its failure to provide a meaningful remedy even at the best of times “counsel against” resurrecting it. But they also counsel against the status quo, that is, the Supreme Court continuing to gnaw at Bivens’s edges without grappling with its fundamental problems.

If the Supreme Court grants certiorari in Nielsen (as legally it should)—it should not simply write around the core problems of the 1971 relic. Rather it should call out Bivens’s false promise and reverse it. Overruling Bivens would preserve constitutional separation-of-powers and improve institutional order. Any “rule of law” it now represents, moreover, fails completely to protect the litigation expectations of either plaintiffs or defendants. If Bivens is left on the books, judicial integrity is threatened as lower courts struggle to assume a remedy that Supreme Court logic precludes. And absent that step, there is little incentive for Congress to craft or amend thoughtful, context-specific accountability measures.

When federal hands violate the Constitution, it makes good sense for the government itself—not some random officer—to pay the price. And not simply the political price—the actual taxpayer dollars-and-cents cost of government abuse. No lone federal agent could possibly remedy any unconstitutional conduct at the South Street Apartments, or anywhere else federal agents may “run amok.” With respect to Chicago, at least some members of Congress seem to have an appetite for oversight. And when government abuse escalates without accountability, or where government programs result in individual harms, history (such as Abu Ghraib, like radiation exposure from nuclear testing, like the passage of the Vaccine Act, or the FTCA itself) suggests that public outcry can fuel actual congressional oversight.

If the Supreme Court closes the Bivens gate permanently, as it can do in Nielsen, it may open the door for Congress to consider principled, reliable legislative options. The easiest fix, and the one most palatable to diverse equity holders, may be a simple adjustment to provide FTCA-type liability for constitutional torts. That’s obviously not the only option. Again, some observers suggest looking back to the past to try and restore individual liability as a matter of common law. Others argue for broadening Section 1983 to include federal conduct. Others, like myself, favor various ways to broaden the FTCA. When Congress gets to the point of discussing legislative options, there no doubt will be vigorous debate.

This much is clear: Bivens is serving no one, and the fix is long overdue.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/cbp-agent-(1)484cdf74-bf59-4bc6-92bf-80fda450f3bd.jpg?sfvrsn=1edd4d89_3,N,,2025-11-12 12:56:56.603070

It is the standard stencil of measures taken when societal temperatures reach an uncomfortable degree in the interest of restoring order to brewing chaos. What that order is, and what apparent chaos threatens it have, historically, varied in answer and consequence—each landing on either end of the moral spectrum. Such is the nature of United States history, carved from the test and trials of human rights with each outcome shaping the image of our country in its laws, norms, and privileges. We could surmise that the positioning factor on this proposed spectrum ultimately comes down to a question of humanity: Where does the balance lie in maintaining security and upholding human rights, and at what point do we justify sacrificing our rights as citizens and as humans in the name of national security?

The very purpose of declared human rights is to remind governing powers and their legislature of our humanity. That is what the United Nations endeavored in 1948 through their “Universal Declaration of Human Rights”, which consists of thirty articles that define what constitutes “universally protected rights” regardless of race, religion, sex, country of origin, et cetera (un.org Universal Declaration of Human Rights). The power of these articles exists as universal boundaries intended to protect people from government overreach and to cultivate the optimal human experience in an equitable fashion across the globe. Ideally, this intersects with national security in the shared interest of ensuring the sanctity of humanity through established agencies, legislations, or governances. The U.S. Constitution is one such example of this synergy as a living document purposed to hold accountable the comprising powers of the United States to its constituents. In recent months, this dual support has been strained and faltered in the misuse of power displayed by one of our own national security agencies: Immigration Customs and Enforcement.

Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are one of the many departments in the United States with the goal of safeguarding our nation’s security through a few avenues; Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) which involve human trafficking, smuggling, transnational threats, among other threats, and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) which involves the identification and removal of undocumented immigrants (ice.gov/mission). Thus far, of the thirty articles mentioned in the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights”, there are at least three that, by their definition, have been violated in ICE’s recent ERO activities over the past few months: Articles 3, 9, and 20. The commonality that these three articles share is their explicit safeguard against direct and deliberate maltreatment towards a person by a governing entity. Article 3 addresses this with a declared right to “life, liberty, and security of person”—which, if the first two rights sound familiar, it is because they also exist in the Declaration of Independence (un.org Universal Declaration of Rights; Declaration of Independence: A Transcription). “Security of person” is a unique term when considering its wide-ranging definition that encompasses physical protection from bodily abuse, mental protection from psychological abuse, legal protection from abuse of law and legislative oppression, and material protection from undue or arbitrary seizure of property (liberty.org Security of Person). Article 3’s widespread nature overlaps several of the articles mentioned in the “Universal Declaration,” including those mentioned in this article.

Generally, ICE’s protocols regarding use of force and restraints follow a strict “in case of emergency” criteria, where the detainee presents a danger to themselves, others, or surrounding property (2025 National Detention Standards, 44). Even then, this is solely after all attempts at communication—approaching the detainee “in a language or manner that [they] understand”—have been attempted to no avail (2025 National Detention Standards, 44). These protocols have been mishandled or bypassed altogether in recent attempts at detainment with U.S. citizens becoming a target.

Against Article 9’s prohibition of “arbitrary arrest, detention or exile”, ICE’s endowed power to detain violators of immigration law has overextended to include citizens like Amanda Trebach, who was one of many to record masked ICE agents as they detained undocumented immigrants (un.org Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Tozeman and Wong, ‘There’s no due process’). Her actions were met with handcuffs and a seat in the back of a black van where she was detained without due process and released hours later (Tozeman and Wong, ‘There’s no due process’). Ms. Trebach is not alone in this situation, with one George Retes suffering the same issue after he was caught between a protest and an ICE raid (Tozeman and Wong, ‘There’s no due process’).

The Department of Homeland Security’s official website has issued an official statement to debunk this claim, implying that the Retes was obstructing the officers’ route and “refusing to move his vehicle” (DHS Debunks New York Times False Reporting: DHS Does NOT Deport U.S. Citizens). However, the visual timestamps of their interaction with Retes show a brief conversation happening shortly after the 50-minute mark before ICE advances. A gas cannister is deployed approximately twenty seconds after ICE begins advancing, requiring the car to reverse. At 51 minutes and 35 seconds, Mr. Retes’ car is entirely engulfed in gas with cars to the front and side of him, effectively blocking his vision and mobility (Fox 11, ICE agents, protesters clash during raid at Ventura County farm). In the span of four minutes since his arrival on the scene, Mr. Retes is encased in tear gas where, he recounts, being subjected to escalated violence, arrest, and detainment (Tozeman and Wong, ‘There’s no due process’).

True to history, the people have spoken out against these violations through assembling in peaceful protest. Article 20 of the United Declaration of Human Rights protects the right “peaceful assembly” which, also true to history, has been met with varying levels of forceful opposition (un.org). On October 24th, a video during one of the Chicago protests shows senior ICE officer Gregory Bovino throwing what is believed to be a tear gas cannister, despite the tactic being prohibited (NBC News, Border Patrol commander appears to throw tear gas at protestors, 0:16). Just over a month prior shows a pastor among other protestors in the same city briefly collapse after being “shot in the head with a pepper ball” by an ICE agent (Fox32, Video shows federal agent shoot Chicago pastor in head with pepper ball during Broadview ICE protest). Nevertheless, these violations have not been the dissuading force we can only imagine they were intended to be, but have only served to further embolden citizens to act upon their rights. In a distant way, the practice draws a certain parallel to past protests in the name of human rights—albeit trading freshly-pressed suits for inflatable frog costumes—where protesters collectively endeavored to set the narrative of presenting themselves as non-threatening, despite authoritative publications dictating otherwise (Best, Anti-ICE protester’s frog costume gains a reach well beyond the small Portland pond; DHS Debunks New York Times).

Even so, the effects of these violations can still reverberate through the best of intentions. Calling back to the definition of “security of person” including psychological factors, one apparent effect of these violations is fear. Fear, when left unchecked, can make a monster out of anyone—and a person strained with it may be encouraged take drastic measures. Joshua Jahn took his fears to the extreme when, on the 26th of September, he opened fire on ICE agents during a detainment process. His recorded intention was to instill the same fear that they brought to the Dallas community, yet his actions instead created a deeper anxiety of retribution against the immigrant communities at the hands of ICE authorities (Santucci et. al 2025).

The extremes that unfettered fear can bring out in a society are what spurred President Franklin Roosevelt to detail the “freedom from fear” in his 1941 State of the Union Address (President Franklin Roosevelt’s Annual Message (Four Freedoms) to Congress (1941)). The “Four Freedoms Speech”, which would later inspire the foundational rights in the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights”, were born during the time of great uncertainty: The Great Depression and the second World War. The post-war world he idealized was not one that required or used greater force to maintain power and stability. He looked toward a world where, among other freedoms, men and women were unbound by the weight of a looming threat—be it economical or physical. Most of all, he dreamed of the freedom born when human rights stand at the forefront of society. How that relates globally in today’s world is not the purpose of this article; how our government has allowed the current directive of ICE to abuse the people under the guise of national security is.

This article mentioned earlier the importance of human rights as a reminder to governing powers of our humanity. When our humanity is forgotten or abandoned, fear sets in. This blind attribution of power to one agency has generated a currency of fear that leaves those who deal in it broken. Human rights are not to be treated as inconsequential. Their existence sets a precedent for governments and their respective societies to build and improve upon, and fosters accountability in cases of abuse or negligence. That is why delegitimizing their authority through contradictory actions is dangerous. A rhetoric of violence does not create the trust and unity that a government desires in its constituents; instead, it breeds fear, discord, and collectively undoes the bonds that bring us together. The banner of national security should not be waved to permit the existence of this cruelty against humanity, but to ensure the safety and sanctity of it.

“I came around the corner and saw the vests and realized that I was witnessing what appeared to be an ICE arrest,” Mink told Bethesda Today in a phone interview.
According to Mink, the two men who approached her in the video were both involved with a different, earlier immigration arrest she filmed.
Mink’s encounter on Monday raises questions about the rights of bystanders when observing or filming presumed immigration enforcement actions.
Department of Homeland Security representatives have publicly described filming ICE agents and posting the videos online as “doxing” and suggested that the practice may not be legal.","Montgomery County Councilmember Kristin Mink said Tuesday she was “grabbed” by a man Monday morning as she tried to film what she believed to be an immigration enforcement action in Prince George’s County.

Mink (D-Dist. 5) posted a video of the interaction to her social media page Tuesday. In the video, a group of at least five people can be seen gathering in the parking lot of Tick Tock Liquors on University Boulevard East just south of Mink’s council district.

“I came around the corner and saw the vests and realized that I was witnessing what appeared to be an ICE arrest,” Mink told Bethesda Today in a phone interview.

As Mink films from a distance, a man wearing a black face mask appears to beckon her toward him. He walks closer to her, points at her and says, “you need to go.”

“Mind your own business,” the man in the black mask can be heard saying.

A second man wearing a camouflage tactical vest, a leg holster with a gun and a badge attached enters the frame saying, “you got to go.” He can be seen putting a hand on Mink’s arm and pulling her in the opposite direction from where she was filming.

“Don’t touch me,” Mink can be heard saying. “Don’t grab my phone.”

Mink continues filming as the people she was filming get into vehicles – some without front license plates – and drive away. The incident was first reported by Montgomery Perspective.

Mink told Bethesda Today she believed the people in the video were Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents because she recognized some of their faces from previous encounters in the area.

She said she could tell from the license plate that one of the vehicles at the scene Monday was the same one that had been spotted near New Hampshire Estates Elementary School in Silver Spring during morning drop-off.

According to Mink, the two men who approached her in the video were both involved with a different, earlier immigration arrest she filmed. In that instance, they both yelled at her, but none had ever touched her before Tuesday, she said.

Spokespeople for ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Bethesda Today on Tuesday afternoon about whether the people in Mink’s video are affiliated with ICE.

Mink’s encounter on Monday raises questions about the rights of bystanders when observing or filming presumed immigration enforcement actions.

A growing number of federal courts have ruled that the First Amendment protects people’s right to record government officials in public, but that right may be subject to some restrictions, according to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

Department of Homeland Security representatives have publicly described filming ICE agents and posting the videos online as “doxing” and suggested that the practice may not be legal.

Mink said she decided to share the video of Monday’s incident because it is “important to raise awareness that we are seeing increased aggression, not just towards me but towards the public in general.”

“Clearly, they want to keep what they are doing in the shadows as much as is possible,” Mink said of the ICE agents. “I think that was evident from their reaction to me.”",https://assets.bethesdamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2193881177-e1762907537909.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:57:15.058050

Lopez said that at least nine of the people detained were farmworkers. She said the arrests will have an impact on area growers who rely on migrant labor.

All of the people detained were immigrants, according to an Oregon for All release, but their identities — let alone each individual's immigration status — could not be immediately confirmed.

The brief video, captured by Jesse Ashton, shows several men wearing bullet-resistant vests surrounding a car near a downtown Olympia intersection. The clip, which quickly spread on social media, captures passers-by honking and shouting, “We don’t want you in our community.”

“I had an idea it was ICE,” Ashton said. “When they boxed him in, I immediately knew.”

Olympia police confirmed that the arrest was a federal immigration operation, but said their department was not notified or involved. Interim Police Chief Shelby Parker reaffirmed Olympia’s sanctuary-city status in a statement, writing that, “federal immigration authorities do not have access to OPD systems or data, including the Flock Safety camera network.”

Her assurance comes as a University of Washington Center for Human Rights study raised new doubts about how federal agents may obtain information from local surveillance tools. The report, published in October, found ICE and other federal agencies had accessed Flock license plate data from several Washington state law enforcement agencies, potentially in violation of state privacy and immigration-limitation laws.

The city of Redmond has since disabled its Flock cameras after ICE reportedly arrested two men near one of its devices last week. Olympia, by contrast, has defended its program, saying it operates with “the strictest data privacy” settings. City officials point to a contract amendment signed in May 2025 that bars Flock Safety from disclosing any data without written authorization from the city or a valid court order.

In a new statement on Tuesday, Assistant City Manager Stacey Ray reassured residents again about Flock data protections:

“The City of Olympia, like other communities in the region, is hearing from community members with concerns about the use of Flock cameras. The City Council will hold a study session with Interim Chief Shelby Parker on Dec. 2 at 6:00 p.m., during which Chief Parker will provide a briefing on the City’s use of Flock cameras and respond to questions from Council members. City council study sessions are open to the public to attend in person or virtually; public comment is not accepted during study sessions.

The Olympia Police Department is deeply committed to protecting community member privacy and public safety. The department proactively addressed early concerns about Flock cameras in May 2025, amending our contract with the vendor to strengthen privacy and legal safeguards regarding data use and disclosure. The agreement makes it legally impossible for Flock to disclose Olympia’s data without the City’s express consent or a valid legal mandate, ensuring the highest data ownership and oversight available under state and federal law.

Additionally, every search performed by Olympia personnel or an approved Washington state law enforcement agency is permanently logged with a reason for the search. Our Flock administrator conducts regular internal audits to ensure full compliance with state law, department policy, and the City’s contractual protections.

We publish monthly reports on the use of the City’s Flock system on our City website, Flock Safety, to help community members stay informed on when and how the cameras are being used to solve crimes in our community.

Our safeguards exceed state requirements and the standards recommended by both Flock Safety and the Washington State Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs (WASPC). In an October 2025 study done by the University of Washington, researchers found that the City of Olympia was one of only a handful of departments in the state for which an audit in 2025 did not contain any searches. This independent finding confirms that Olympia’s restrictive configuration functions exactly as intended, protecting community data while maintaining essential investigative capabilities.”

Still, some residents are unconvinced. Sebastian, with the anti-surveillance group Deflock Olympia, said the city’s assurances ring hollow.

“Whether or not they believe what they’re saying, there’s no way to safely put those cameras up and not expect other agencies, anyone with even just a phone — to get into them,” he said.

Ashton, the witness, said he filmed the arrest to make the incident public. “I feel sad for people who have to go through this,” he said. “I can’t imagine how their kids feel when their dad or mom doesn’t come home.”

Olympia police said they will brief the public next month during a city council study session on how the department uses Flock cameras. That meeting is on Dec. 2, but doesn't allow for public comment. Deflock Olympia said it plans to rally outside that meeting.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/07def219-4498-42e7-88cb-f7e63268c85b/20251112T023026/07def219-4498-42e7-88cb-f7e63268c85b_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 12:56:52.142074

The language appears to allow GOP senators to sue over steps that the Justice Department took during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Trump related to the 2020 election. In October, Senate Republicans revealed an FBI document that showed investigators had obtained phone record data from eight senators and one congressman for calls they made in the days before and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The records were obtained pursuant to a subpoena in 2023, and the new legislation covers alleged violations dating back to 2022.

The revelation that their call records were obtained infuriated the lawmakers, who accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Justice Department to target Republicans.

""The FBI's actions were an unconstitutional breach, and Attorney General Bondi and Director Patel need to hold accountable those involved in this serious wrongdoing,"" said GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said the Biden administration's actions were ""arguably worse than Watergate."" A spokesperson for Grassley did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new legislation.

The document said the FBI collected ""limited toll records,"" which include information about which numbers participated in a call and how long it lasted, but not the contents of the conversation themselves.

In a letter to lawmakers on Oct. 21, attorneys for Smith defended his investigative steps as ""entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy.""

According to the indictment of President Trump in connection with the 2020 election, part of Smith's investigation into the Jan. 6 attack focused on Mr. Trump's alleged attempts to call senators and representatives to pressure them into delaying certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory. Smith's lawyers have said he is eager to testify publicly about the two Trump probes he oversaw.

The language in the new legislation requires service providers to alert Senate offices and the Senate sergeant at arms if federal law enforcement requests senators' data, and says a court cannot delay the notification unless the senator is the target of a criminal investigation.

The bill further states: ""Any Senator whose Senate data, or the Senate data of whose Senate office, has been acquired, subpoenaed, searched, accessed, or disclosed in violation of this section may bring a civil action against the United States if the violation was committed by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States or of any Federal department or agency.""

The bill says senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation of the notification provisions, and it prevents the government from invoking several types of immunity to rebut the claims. Suits can be brought up to five years after a senator is first made aware of a violation, and allows senators to bring suits for any instances that occurred after January 2022. The FBI analyzed the senators' call records in 2023, meaning they could bring lawsuits under the legislation.

The government can defend against a suit by asserting that a senator was a target of a criminal investigation and by showing that a required notification about the records being pursued was delayed under a court order.

The lawmakers whose records were obtained in 2023, according to the FBI document, were Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/11/308b0ff3-730d-419c-8b54-c22fbbb65cbd/thumbnail/1200x630g2/29edfd7c7d0682513796f2c6cec45aa4/gettyimages-2239226193.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:58:17.024316

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

The United Kingdom has stopped sharing intelligence with the United States about suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean because it believes that the U.S. military strikes violate international law, sources told CNN. The sources also said that while Canada intends to continue its partnership with the U.S. Coast Guard, it has made clear to the United States that it does not want its intelligence being used to help target boats for deadly strikes. Colombian President Gustavo Petro said yesterday that he had ordered Colombia’s security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with U.S. security agencies until the strikes stop. Natasha Bertrand reports.

The USS Gerald R. Ford yesterday entered the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, according to a U.S. Navy statement. The statement described the Ford as being in the Western Atlantic, but a senior military official specified that the Ford and its accompanying vessels had moved into the Caribbean region. Eric Schmitt reports for the New York Times.

Venezuela is deploying weapons and planning to mount a guerrilla-style resistance in the event of a U.S. air or ground attack, according to sources and planning documents seen by Reuters. Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López said yesterday, “The aggression will be responded to with national unity… we are ready here, we don’t want war.” However, a source close to the government said, “We wouldn’t last two hours in a conventional war.” Another source said that Venezuela was not “prepared or professionalized for conflict.” Reuters reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israel has destroyed more than 1,500 buildings in areas of Gaza under its control since the ceasefire began on October 10, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show. The actual number of destroyed buildings is likely much higher, as satellite imagery is not available in some areas. BBC News reports.

Israel reopened the Zikim Crossing north of Gaza City to allow humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza today, according to COGAT, the Israeli army unit responsible for facilitating aid to Gaza. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the crossing was shut on September 12. Israel’s military did not provide reasons for the closure. Jana Choukeir reports for Reuters.

UNICEF said yesterday that Israel is blocking the entry of 1.6 million vaccines and solar-powered fridges to store the vaccine vials into Gaza, adding that the syringes have awaited customs clearance since August. “Both the syringes and the… refrigerators are considered dual-use by Israel, and these items we’re finding very hard to get through clearances and inspections, yet they are urgent,” a UNICEF spokesperson said. Olivia Le Poidevin reports for Reuters.

Internal U.S. documents linked to President Trump’s Gaza peace plan, obtained by POLITICO, depict major implementation challenges, including uncertainty about whether an International Stabilization Force can be deployed. The compendium of documents was presented last month during a two-day symposium for U.S. Central Command and Civil-Military Coordination Center members. Dasha Burns, Felicia Schwartz, Nahal Toosi, and Paul McLeary report.

The Israeli parliament on Monday advanced a bill that would mandate the death penalty for Palestinians convicted of killing Israeli citizens. In the first vote, the bill passed with 39 in favour and 16 against, out of 120 lawmakers. Several key political parties boycotted the initial vote. Alexander Cornwell and Steven Sheer report for Reuters.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

Dozens of masked Israeli settlers yesterday attacked two Palestinian villages in the occupied West Bank, setting fire to vehicles and other property, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials. Israeli police said that four Israelis were arrested during the assault, which they described as “acts of extremist violence.” The Israeli military said that four Palestinians were wounded. Josef Federman, Shlomo Mor, and Melanie Lidman report for AP News; Aaron Boxerman reports for the New York Times.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

“The situation has significantly worsened” in parts of the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, where “the enemy advanced in fierce fighting and captured three settlements,” Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief for the armed forces Oleksandr Syrski said yesterday. Ron Popeski and Oleksandr Kozhukhar report for Reuters.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

“Despite the rising need, humanitarian operations [in Sudan’s North Darfur region] are now on the brink of collapse,” the U.N. International Organization for Migration said yesterday, adding “warehouses are nearly empty, aid convoys face significant insecurity, and access restrictions continue to prevent the delivery of sufficient aid.” IOM said that nearly 90,000 people have left El Fasher and surrounding villages since the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary’s recent capture. Noha Elhennawy reports for AP News.

Women fleeing El Fasher have reported killing, rape, and disappearance of their children following its capture by the RSF, the U.N. agency for women said yesterday. “There is mounting evidence that rape is being deliberately and systematically used as a weapon of war,” U.N. Women Regional Director for East and Southern Africa Anna Mutavati said. Olivia Le Poidevin reports for Reuters.

The Trump administration is planning to deploy the U.S. Border Patrol to Charlotte, N.C., and New Orleans, according to a government document and a federal official. Plans for the operation are still being finalized. Dana Goldstein and Hamed Aleaziz report for the New York Times.

The “highly unusual payment [of $7.5 million]– to one of the most corrupt governments in the world [Equatorial Guinea] – raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of the American taxpayer dollars,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) said in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday. The $7.5 million is the largest payment the Trump administration is known to have made to another government to take deportees from the United States. Shaheen noted that Transparency International ranked Equatorial Guinea 173 out of 180 countries for corruption. Edward Wong reports for the New York Times.

Dozens of Venezuelans deported from the United States to a prison in El Salvador earlier this year were subjected to torture and other serious abuse, including sexual violence, according to a report published today by Human Rights Watch and Cristosal.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Israeli President Isaac Herzog received a letter from Trump urging him to consider granting a pardon to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Herzog’s office announced today. “While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that this ‘case’ against Bibi, who has fought alongside me for a long time […] is a political, unjustified prosecution,” Trump said in the letter. Herzog’s office said that anyone seeking a presidential pardon must submit a formal request as per established procedures. Tala Ramadan and Steven Scheer report for Reuters.

Earlier this month, German State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Finance Steffen Meyer raised concerns about the financial burden on Germany caused by the U.S. government shutdown with U.S. diplomat Alan Meltzer, according to a State Department cable obtained by POLITICO. Meyer stressed that the offer to cover the salaries of 11,000 employees working on U.S. military bases in Germany was an “exceptional measure.” Meltzer did not speculate on the duration of the shutdown, but confirmed that the United States would repay the German government for the salaries paid out.

""An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,"" Johnson told the United Nations Human Rights Council last week.","Mayor Brandon Johnson is preaching a message of unity on immigration issues, putting him again at odds with some other leaders in the Black community.

Why it matters: President Trump's ""Operation Midway Blitz"" has resurfaced tensions between Chicago's Black and Brown communities that flared during the 2022-24 migrant crisis, when $300 million spent on new arrivals left resentment in underinvested Black communities.

The big picture: While some Black leaders are leaning into the divisions, others are urging cooperation. Johnson told the United Nations last week that Trump's immigration operation is an ""assault on the dignity of all Chicagoans.""

What they're saying: ""We love [the ICE raids] because this is what we've been asking for,"" Chicago Flips Red co-founder Danielle Carter-Walters told the ""Awake Illinois"" podcast last week.

Organizer and former mayoral candidate Jaymal Green said on Instagram, ""All the Black people that are getting mad at ICE and Donald Trump alone — you got to get mad at the politicians right here locally … [They] decided to dump the migrant issue on the Black community like they do every single time.""

The other side: ""The divisions between Black and Latino people are significant and there are valid concerns, but at this moment, it's suicidal to not be unified,"" said actor and rapper Vic Mensa in a social post last month.

""The same agents of the state are attacking, abducting and killing us both at the same time, and they're relying on our separation right now.""

Mensa also warned about the dangers of these divisions in an October essay for the New York Times.

Zoom out: ""The sentiment in the Black community is extremely mixed,"" Cornel Darden, chair of the Greater Chicagoland Black Chamber of Commerce, told Axios.

""We do know Jaymal Green very well and follow his views, which we think definitely represent a large segment of the Black community.""

Yes, but: Black owners of landscaping, construction and food businesses are losing employees in the ICE raids, and Black real estate businesses have made money providing shelter to migrants, Darden said.

Between the lines: Rapper and Chicago School Board member Che ""Rhymefest"" Smith told Axios, ""I see both sides of the debate, but at the end of it all, we have to stand on the side of humanity. We need to use this opportunity to all link arms, otherwise we're missing out on a chance to truly fight back in a robust, effective way.""

The bottom line: Just as he did during the migrant crisis, Johnson finds himself fighting battles with outsiders and some inside the Black community. But he's not backing away.

Among issues the former detainee and others cited in courtroom testimony about conditions at the facility were overflowing toilets, no way to clean themselves and nothing to eat beyond half-frozen Subway sandwiches. A federal judge out of the Northern District of Illinois responded on Nov. 5 by ordering the Department of Homeland Security to improve conditions.

Now, on Nov. 13, another judge is set to visit the facility in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb 12 miles west of the city, to ensure court orders are being followed.

On Nov. 7, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura K. McNally authorized attorneys who filed a lawsuit to visit the site. McNally also plans to visit, according to court filings.

""No one should be subjected to the treatment and conditions that individuals at Broadview are currently experiencing,"" civil rights attorney Alexa Van Brunt said in a statement. The MacArthur Justice Center Illinois office director is representing Moreno Gonzalez and other detainees. ""These are urgent and necessary measures to protect these detainees and preserve their basic human rights. Our democracy is no place for inhumane, unsafe detention conditions.""

Van Brunt, attorneys with the ACLU of Illinois and others filed a lawsuit over conditions on behalf of Moreno Gonzalez and former detainee Felipe Agustin Zamacona. In response to testimony and court filings, U.S. District Judge Robert W. Gettleman issued a temporary restraining order compelling immigration authorities to make improvements.

""It’s a disturbing record. We don't want to treat people the way I've heard today people are being treated,"" Gettleman said after hearing hours of testimony. ""These are not convicted felons, these are civil detainees.""

Homeland Security says reports of poor conditions are 'FALSE'

Homeland Security officials defend conditions at the facility: ""All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers. No one is denied access to proper medical care. Any claims there are subprime conditions at the Broadview ICE facility are FALSE.""

Jana Brady, an attorney for the defendants, acknowledged the site is operating beyond its normal capacity but said ""it's a learning curve"" and authorities are working to improve conditions, citing that officials are providing wipes to detainees so they can clean themselves.

In court filings from Nov. 10, Homeland Security lawyers say improvements at the site include ""lights out"" overnight and access to attorneys for detainees.

Detainees testified previously that lights were kept on overnight at the facility. Their lawyers say they still have trouble speaking with clients and have not been able to verify there is a ""lights out"" period or whether other court-mandated improvements have been implemented.

ICE facility at the heart of Midway Blitz crackdown

The facility is an immigration enforcement processing center where detainees are brought before being moved out of state. The site has become a focal point of immigration enforcement activity amid President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz crackdown.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin has said over ""3,000 illegal aliens, including rapists, murderers, and gang members"" have been arrested in connection with the blitz. USA TODAY has not been able to independently verify the criminal background or immigration status of detainees.

The site was designed to hold people for no more than 12 hours but witnesses testified in court that detainees are being held for as long as 12 days.

Gettleman, the judge presiding over the case, said from the bench on Nov. 4 that the facility ""has really become a prison.""

Anti-immigration enforcement protesters have targeted the site and called for it to be shut down following reports of poor conditions. Federal agents have deployed chemical agents on protesters and a Democratic Congressional candidate was indicted in connection with the protests.

Illinois State Police took over crowd control outside the site in early October. Dozens have been arrested at protests outside the facility since then, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/06/USAT/87114980007-20251102-t-042720-z-135743320-rc-2-znhashkxm-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpchicago.JPG?crop=5472,3078,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-12 06:57:17.106235

The Department of Homeland Security suddenly moved up the implementation of a rule change that gives the Federal Protective Service, the agency charged with protecting federal buildings, more power to charge people with crimes for a variety of activities on or near federal property.

The regulation, which went into effect on Nov. 5, prohibits a wide range of activities, including creating a loud or unusual noise, distributing informational materials and flying drones. It makes it illegal for people to wear masks to conceal their identities if they break any federal or state law or local ordinance. It forbids obstructing access to federal property or impeding operations there and specifically calls out photography and videography.

More from Capital & Main

Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee’s U.S./Mexico Border Program, said he’s concerned that vague definitions in the regulations will give officers too much discretion.

“It seems overly broad and would provide federal agents flexibility to determine broadly how the new regulations are being violated,” Rios said.

Though the proposed rule was introduced on Jan. 15, just days before President Donald Trump took office, current DHS Secretary Kristi Noem decided to move up the timeline because of the administration’s concerns about anti-ICE activities, according to a press release from the department. The rule was set to take effect in January 2026.

“DHS is using every tool possible to protect the lives of our law enforcement as they face a surge in violence and lawlessness at many of our federal facilities. We’ve seen rampant violence against law enforcement including our officers shot at, rammed by vehicles, assaulted and threatened,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

“Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, we will not tolerate violence perpetuated by Antifa and other domestic extremists who are targeting federal property and law enforcement. Law and order will prevail.”

Videos of interactions between the public and ICE officials have raised questions about at least some of the agency’s claims of aggression against its staff.

Volunteers who have been monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests on federal property are worried that the new rules will affect their ability to document the agency’s actions, including potential human and civil rights violations during arrests.

“I question as to why they would move towards preventing people from documenting what’s happening inside,” Rios said.

He worried that the government would use the rules to cover up misconduct by ICE.

Since May, volunteers with several San Diego groups, including Detention Resistance, have monitored arrests in the immigration court hallways and at the ICE offices where people go periodically to check in or pick up paperwork. Whenever ICE makes an arrest, the volunteers film with their phones.

That included a video of ICE officers arresting Sayed Naser, an Afghan man who previously worked with the U.S. military in his country and who had shown up for a court hearing as part of his asylum case. Because of the video, veterans have rallied to support other Afghan allies with upcoming immigration court hearings.

On Wednesday, the first day of the new regulations, faith leaders and Detention Resistance volunteers stood in the brown hallways on the second floor of the Edward J. Schwartz Federal Building in downtown San Diego. That’s where ICE has offices for people who are required to check in periodically with its officers.

One faith leader stood praying with a family outside the waiting room for the check-in appointments. Another stood near the elevators that lead to the basement holding cells—the route that ICE officers typically use when they arrest someone at a check-in.

Around 10 a.m., two of the family members walked out of the waiting room, their faces distraught. They spoke briefly with the faith leader who had prayed with them before leaving quietly. A few moments after they left, two ICE officers led a woman—their other family member—to the elevators, her mascara wet on her face.

The volunteers sprung into action, filming and following from a distance to capture the interaction. One volunteer softly offered words of support, referring to the woman as compa, or friend, the word that volunteers use for everyone with hearings or check-ins. In less than a minute, the woman was gone.

Rios is also worried that the new regulations could affect protesters in the plaza outside the federal building.

“The way it reads, they would prevent people from expressing themselves in ways that would be criticizing the administration or its policies,” Rios said.

As he spoke, he stood watching a weekly demonstration organized by San Diego labor leaders. Last week, the Thursday morning protest featured mariachi, ballet folklorico and dozens of people marching around the plaza.

At one point, organizers called on Rios to address the crowd. As he described ICE arresting a mother shortly after she dropped her children off at school, the crowd yelled, “Shame!”

Rios said that the administration appears poised to put Border Patrol agents in charge of certain ICE operations, causing concerns that the already violent arrests around the country will grow more so. Rios said that those in border regions, including San Diego, already know the difficulties and risks of living under the thumb of Border Patrol.

A student from the University of California, San Diego, told the crowd that international students on campus are afraid to go to class because of ICE’s actions.

Once the speeches finished, the demonstrators walked in a circle around the large, triangular sculpture in the plaza, and the mariachi band played. Some members of the crowd danced as the crowd chanted for justice for immigrants.",https://i0.wp.com/prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cap-and-Main-111225.jpg?fit=2121%2C1414&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-12 06:57:04.534983

They are also demanding the Trump administration stop deporting third-country nationals to El Salvador.
“We reached the conclusion that the Trump administration is complicit in systematic torture and enforced disappearances of the Venezuelans sent to El Salvador,” said Juanita Goebertus, HRW’s Americas director.
“People held in Cecot said they were beaten from the moment they arrived in El Salvador and throughout their time in detention.
“With Kristi Noem visiting directly and recording that video, the US government is very clearly complicit in the very serious and systematic torture that Venezuelans faced,” she said.","More than 252 Venezuelans expelled to El Salvador under Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy suffered systematic and prolonged torture and abuse, including sexual assault, during their detention, according to a report published on Wednesday.

The report, compiled jointly by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Cristosal – a group investigating violations in Central America – says conditions at El Salvador’s sprawling “terrorist continent center” (Cecot) breached the UN’s standard minimal rules for the treatment of prisoners. It cites “inhumane prison conditions, including prolonged incommunicado detention, inadequate food” and other shortcomings.

The groups accuse the Trump administration of willful complicity in the suffering deportees endured after being flown to El Salvador in March and April, insisting that it ordered the men’s deportation while fully aware that they would be mistreated or even face threats to their lives.

They are calling an “independent investigation” by the US justice department, although they admit the prospect is unlikely. They are also demanding the Trump administration stop deporting third-country nationals to El Salvador.

US connivance in what is depicted as a systematic pattern of torture and human rights abuses evokes comparison with the scandal at Bahghdad’s Abu Ghraib facility during the “war on terror”, they say.

“We reached the conclusion that the Trump administration is complicit in systematic torture and enforced disappearances of the Venezuelans sent to El Salvador,” said Juanita Goebertus, HRW’s Americas director.

Citing previous state department reports recording harsh prison conditions in El Salvador, she added: “The administration knew that they were sending people to a place where they could be tortured and could be facing life-threatening risks.”

The Trump administration paid the Salvadorian regime of President Nayyib Bukele – who has styled himself as “the world coolest dictator” – $4.7m to cover the costs of the detention, the report says.

Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal – which was recently forced to suspend its operations in El Salvador – accused the Trump administration of “hir[ing] the Salvadorian prison system as a prop in a theatre of cruelty”.

“They wanted to demonstrate and send a message of brutality,” he said. “But I don’t know if they knew how far it would go and how terrible the horrors of torture are.”

The 81-page report paints a harrowing picture of the conditions suffered by the Venenzuelans, many of them asylum seekers from the authoritarian regime of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and roughly half having no criminal record, despite official accusations that the deportees were “terrorist” members of Tren de Aragua, an organized crime gang. Only 3% had been convicted in the US of a violent crime, according to the report.

“Detainees were subjected to constant beatings and other forms of ill-treatment, including some cases of sexual violence,” it says.

“Many of these abuses constitute torture under international human rights law.

“People held in Cecot said they were beaten from the moment they arrived in El Salvador and throughout their time in detention.

“These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and psychological suffering. Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.”

According to one former inmate, identified in the report as Gonzalo Y, the facility’s director had a chilling for the new arrivals after their deportation from the US. “You have arrived in hell,” he told them, a sentence used as the report’s title.

The report, based on more than 200 interviews and “forensic” corroboration of the interviewees’ testimonies, details beatings being administered for minor infractions, such as talking too loudly, showering at the wrong time, or even asking for medical treatment.

Some inmates recounted being beaten following a visit by the International Committee of the Red Cross and on another occasion, after a visit by Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, who posted a video of herself standing outside a prison cell in which the incarcerated deportees were crammed.

The beatings following Noem’s visit were inflicted after the prisoners shouted demands to be freed on the grounds that they were not criminals or terrorists, according to Goebertus, who said Noem’s high-profile visit proved the administration’s awareness of the abuses occurring at Cecot.

“With Kristi Noem visiting directly and recording that video, the US government is very clearly complicit in the very serious and systematic torture that Venezuelans faced,” she said.

Three prisoners also recorded being sexually abused, with one man saying he was forced to perform oral sex on a guard. The report said sexual assaults were more widespread but were not reported due to the social stigma.

The men were freed in July as part of a deal with Maduro’s regime that included the release of 10 Americans and US residents who were being held in Venezuela.

Bullock said the Venezuelans’ treatment reflected “a broader pattern in Salvadorian prisons” that has seen 90,000 Salvadorians arbitrarily detained, disappeared and systematically tortured in the past three years.

“It’s caused the deaths of at least 420 people, according to our investigations, although we think it’s probably many more,” he said.

“There’s a large and very credible body of evidence that demonstrates that in Salvadorian prisons, the El Salvador government itself could be committing crimes against humanity – and that’s the prison system that the United States contracted to disappear the migrants into.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3069f559bae5cc2d8658115e65fc3f8564adcd12/341_0_3407_2726/master/3407.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b97153f5a79bb6629ccce3bbae8bbd65",N,,2025-11-12 06:57:08.511611

Democrats have for weeks insisted that any measure to fund the government include an extension of tax credits for Affordable Care Act health plans, which were created under Joe Biden and due to expire at the end of the year, sending premiums for enrollees higher.

With Donald Trump’s encouragement, Congress’s Republican leaders refused, sparking a spending standoff that resulted in the longest government shutdown in US history. But the Democrats’ resolve cracked earlier this week, when a splinter group in the Senate joined with the GOP to craft a compromise bill that reauthorizes government funding through January, without extending the tax credits.

The Senate passed that legislation on Monday evening, and the House of Representatives is expected to vote on it on Wednesday afternoon. The House rules committee will consider the bill on Tuesday evening, setting the stage for it to come to the House floor on Wednesday.

Top House Democrats oppose it, with the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, calling it a “partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people.

“It’s our expectation that the House will vote at some point tomorrow and House Democrats will strongly oppose any legislation that does not decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis,” Jeffries told CNN on Tuesday.

The House’s largest ideological caucus, the centrist New Democrat Coalition, has announced its opposition to the measure.

“While New Dems always seek common ground, our coalition remains united in opposition to legislation that sacrifices the wellbeing of the constituents we’re sworn to serve,” chair Brad Schneider said.

“Unfortunately, the Senate-passed bill fails to address our constituents’ top priorities, doing nothing to protect their access to healthcare, lower their costs or curb the administration’s extreme agenda.”

The sentiment appears much the same in the Congressional Progressive caucus, where chair Greg Casar called the measure “a betrayal of millions of Americans counting on Democrats to fight for them”.

The Democratic opposition threatens to make for a tight vote for the Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, who has kept the House out of session for more than 50 days in an attempt to pressure Senate Democrats into caving to the GOP’s demands.

With a 219-member majority assuming full attendance, Johnson can only afford to lose two votes on the bill, and the Kentucky representative Thomas Massie is likely to vote no.

But Democrats may have their own defectors. Maine’s Jared Golden, who last week announced he would not seek another term representing a district that voted for Trump last year, was the only Democrat in September to vote for a Republican funding bill that did not extend the tax credit. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, whose Washington state district is similarly friendly to the president, also expressed her support for that bill.

Both lawmakers’ offices did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how they would vote on the Senate’s compromise.

The compromise bill cleared the Senate on Monday evening by 60 votes, the minimum it needed to overcome the chamber’s thresholds for advancement. All Republicans supported the measure’s passage except for Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with eight moderate members of the Democratic caucus, several of whom were recently re-elected, or serving their final terms in office.

That group was composed of Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Dick Durbin of Illinois, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the party.

While they did not win an extension of the tax credits, the group claimed credit for getting the Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune, to agree to hold a vote by mid-December on extending the subsidies. However, it remains to be seen if enough Republicans will support its passage, and Johnson has not agreed to put the issue to a vote in the House.

Though the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, did not back the bill publicly, Shaheen told Fox News on Monday that the group “kept leadership informed throughout” their talks. Progressive organizations who backed Schumer’s strategy during the shutdown have now turned on him, for allowing the compromise to come together.

Indivisible announced plans to support Democratic candidates in primaries who oppose Schumer remaining as the party’s leader, and MoveOn joined in the calls for him to bow out.

“It is time for Senator Schumer to step aside as minority leader to make room for those who are willing to fight fire with fire when the basic needs of working people are on the line,” MoveOn Political Action’s executive director, Katie Bethell, said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5112ae09b7200a07299c11593e962bfea390c981/643_0_4640_3712/master/4640.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d0bcf142df45fe02d54c923d41ef4e20",N,,2025-11-12 06:56:59.550722

Pritzker signed Senate Bill 2487, amending the Illinois Human Rights Act (""IHRA"") to make two key changes of which Illinois employers should be aware. The new law takes effect January 1, 2026, and applies to all charges filed or pending on or after August 15, 2025.

Fact-Finding Conferences Are No Longer Mandatory

Previously, every charge filed with the Illinois Department of Human Rights (""IDHR"") required a fact-finding conference—a meeting in which both parties appeared and responded to questions from an IDHR investigator.

Following the amendment, fact-finding conferences will be discretionary. A conference will only occur if:

Both the complainant and the respondent submit a written request within 90 days after the charge is filed; and

The parties agree in writing to grant the IDHR an additional 120 days to complete its investigation.

If the IDHR issues its investigative report before both requests are received, no fact-finding conference will take place. The IDHR also retains discretion to require a conference even if neither party requests one, but such conferences are expected to occur far less frequently going forward.

The amendment gives employers and complainants a new strategic choice at the outset of an IDHR investigation—whether to request a fact-finding conference or proceed without one. Skipping the conference may reduce costs and time commitments involved in dealing with an IDHR charge; however, participation in a fact-finding conference has its utility, as the conference may help clarify the factual issues alleged by the employee or encourage early resolution. Employers should consult counsel promptly after receiving a charge to evaluate the best approach.

New Civil Penalties Authorized

The amendment also gives the Illinois Human Rights Commission (""IHRC"") new authority to impose civil penalties ""to vindicate the public interest"" for each act that constitutes a civil rights violation under the IHRA.

Although both the IDHR and the IHRC enforce the IHRA, they serve different functions. The IDHR investigates charges of discrimination and issues findings on whether substantial evidence supports a violation. If the IDHR finds substantial evidence and the matter is not resolved, the case may proceed to the IHRC, which serves as the adjudicative body. The IHRC conducts hearings and issues final decisions on liability—and the new civil penalties apply only at that stage, after a finding of a violation.

The maximum penalty depends on the employer's history of prior violations:

Up to $16,000 per act per aggrieved party for a first violation;

Up to $42,500 for a second violation within five years; and

Up to $70,000 for two or more violations within seven years.

If the same individual committed both the current and prior violation, the higher penalty levels may apply even if the prior violation occurred outside those timeframes.

The addition of these penalties increases the potential financial exposure in cases brought under the IHRA. Employers must remain vigilant: robust anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies, training, documentation, and consistent enforcement are more important than ever.

What Employers Should Do Now

Review internal procedures for responding to claims of discrimination or harassment, including IDHR charges.

Engage counsel early to make informed, strategic decisions about whether to request a fact-finding conference.

Monitor IDHR guidance on how it will exercise discretion to require or decline conferences.

Reinforce anti-harassment and anti-discrimination compliance measures in light of the new penalty structure.

Takeaways

Illinois has moved from a mandatory to a discretionary model for fact-finding conferences, giving employers greater flexibility in responding to discrimination charges. At the same time, the addition of new civil penalties raises the stakes for compliance. Early engagement with counsel and proactive workplace training and policies remain the best way to manage risk.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.13376_2834.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 06:57:13.203665

Rectifying the damages caused by false pleadings is a costly endeavor and should be strategized with care.","A single error in the date and manner in which a plaintiff purchased avocado oil led to extreme sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel in a consumer class action case.

Last week, the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Golikov v. Walmart Inc. found that Class counsel acted in subjective bad faith by recklessly raising a frivolous argument and unreasonably multiplying proceedings after failing to correct a single erroneous allegation.

In Golikov, Plaintiff’s Complaint alleged that the plaintiff purchased a product from a brick-and-mortar store instead of truthfully disclosing that the purchase was made on the defendant’s website. The Complaint did not reveal that to make a website purchase, Plaintiff was required to enter into a binding arbitration agreement and waive the right to pursue a class action.

The Court did not agree that Plaintiff’s counsel’s efforts to point to subordinates for the “error” amounted to inadvertence, holding “recklessness can be established when a leading attorney fails to check a subordinate’s work and independently verify the facts and law.” Plaintiff’s counsel also argued that the error was inconsequential because Plaintiff made both in-store and online purchases. The Court was not persuaded stating “Plaintiff’s in-store purchases still do not change the fact that the Complaint and the FAC make a claim that Plaintiff purchased a bottle ... on November 14, 2021 from a … store, when she actually did not do so. Accordingly, the action was based on an argument advanced without factual merit.” (emphasis added.)

Moreover, the Court also concluded that Plaintiff’s counsel failed to correct the error and continued to advance their frivolous position in opposition to both a Motion to Compel Arbitration and a Motion to Decertify the Class, unreasonably multiplying proceedings in violation of the duty to “correct or withdraw litigation positions after it becomes obvious that they are meritless.” In short order: a class was certified, discovery undertaken, the Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings was granted, and the Motion to Decertify the Class and the Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to 28 USC Section 1927 were briefed. The Court ordered Defendants to brief the appropriate attorney’s fees as sanctions for Plaintiff’s counsel’s conduct. Defendants will likely seek significant attorney’s fees as sanctions due to the volume of work that the frivolous allegation created.

Lessons For All

“Inadvertence” is not a free pass when an error is determined to have been made in bad faith and recklessly. All counsel must take caution to review and verify the work of their subordinates. Further, in the Federal Courts, should counsel learn that an allegation of fact is not accurate, or an argument or position is no longer supported or justified, they must work to correct the error and minimize legal proceedings. Rectifying the damages caused by false pleadings is a costly endeavor and should be strategized with care.",https://www.cdflaborlaw.com/_images/content/CDF-OG-logo.png,N,,2025-11-12 10:58:30.451319

El Paso County Sheriff Joseph Roybal petitioned the justices last month after the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Darlene Griffith, a transgender inmate who has challenged being detained with men.

The 10th Circuit reasoned that the prison’s decision to identify Griffith by biological sex ran afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, which protects against discrimination on the basis of sex or race.

Sheriff Roybal appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lower courts have ruled differently on the topic and the justices need to settle the matter.

“The consequences are severe,” Sheriff Roybal’s filing reads. “Hundreds of cases now flood federal courts, with prison officials facing litigation from all sides: transgender inmates demanding classification by gender identity; female inmates challenging housing decisions that require them to sleep, live, and bathe with biological males who identify as female; inmates objecting to searches by certain officers; and staff asserting dignity concerns about cross-sex searches. Courts admit ‘there is little uniformity to be found among their decisions.’”

His petition asks the justices to rule that the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment “does not require treating the fluid, subjective concept of transgender identity as a sex-based or stand-alone constitutional class.”

“For over two centuries, American prisons and jails have classified and housed inmates and detainees based on biological sex. This long-standing practice advances institutional security, prevents sexual violence, and preserves the privacy and dignity of those in custody and of staff,” the petition states.

“By transforming an inmate’s subjective gender identity — of which there are over 70 — into a sex-based constitutional classification triggering heightened scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit has subordinated prison security and the privacy interests of all to the preference of one in contravention of this Court’s prison-administration precedents,” the petition said.

The 10th Circuit decision allows for barring male officers from searching inmates who are transgender women.

“Such a rule is constitutionally absurd. And it disregards administrative expertise, creates dignity and safety concerns, and ignores the operational realities of running detention facilities like county jails,” the sheriff’s petition argues.

Griffith has taken hormones. The inmate has complained about being denied feminine products like lipstick, panties and a bra because those items are not allowed in male facilities.

Sheriff Roybal argues that allowing transgender detainees to have feminine products makes them vulnerable to harassment and violence.

Griffith’s filing urges the justices not to take up the case. According to the court records, Griffith has been living as a woman for more than 20 years and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria before entering the El Paso County Jail in 2020.

The inmate’s filing says that being treated as a male has led Griffith to suffer emotional distress and attempt self-castration.

“During her time at the Jail, Ms. Griffith experienced anxiety and exacerbated symptoms of gender dysphoria,” the filing reads. “She filed numerous grievances in which she described these issues, and repeatedly requested exceptions from the Jail policies. Ms. Griffith specifically informed the Jail that she ‘had previously been housed in female units in other correctional facilities,’ but was informed that she would continue to be housed in a male unit at the Jail pursuant to County policy. The County’s policies caused Ms. Griffith to suffer significant emotional distress, which led her to attempt self-castration.”

It would take four justices to vote in favor of hearing the dispute for oral arguments to be granted later this term.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/18/Supreme_Court_Transgender_Health_51425_c0-199-4788-2992_s1200x700.jpg?745ca6165c42a86c96336a0e12dbdd365db74e4a,N,,2025-11-11 22:01:21.102149

SNAP BENEFITS: The Supreme Court this evening extended a freeze on a federal judge’s ruling that would require the Trump administration to fully fund the SNAP food program in November. That pause could be moot if the bill to reopen the government, which includes full SNAP benefits through September, is signed into law in the next couple of days.

Bipartisan funding bill would allow senators to sue over government searches of their phone records

A provision tucked into the the funding package that the Senate passed last night as a part of a bipartisan deal to reopen the government would allow senators to sue the federal government for potentially millions of dollars if their data is obtained without being notified.

The legislative language would uniquely benefit eight Republican senators who were recently found to have had their phone records — but not the contents of their calls or messages — accessed as a part of the investigation that led to former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

While the bill does not explicitly mention Smith’s probe, the language would retroactively apply to data requests that were made on or after Jan. 1, 2022, meaning the request of the Republican senators’ data, which was made on Sept. 27, 2023, would be susceptible to a lawsuit.

The eight senators who had their phone records accessed are: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee.

Trump: H-1B visas help 'bring in talent' that the U.S. lacks

Trump defended H-1B visas during part of a Fox News interview that aired tonight, even as his administration has moved to make the visas costlier for qualified workers from abroad to obtain.

Asked whether his administration would prioritize the visas, Trump said the U.S. has to ""bring in talent.""

When pressed by Fox News host Laura Ingraham about existing talent in the U.S., Trump responded: ""No, you don't have — you don't have certain talents. And you have to — people have to learn.""

Trump has at times offered contradictory remarks on immigration. While he often suggests that immigration has allowed ""criminals"" into the country, other times he has acknowledged the role it plays in economic growth and innovation.

Trump signed a proclamation in September requiring companies to pay a $100,000 fee to obtain H-1B worker visas in a move that marked a win for immigration hardliners on Capitol Hill, but that posed a costlier hurtle to tech executives seeking qualified workers from abroad.

JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and other CEOs set to visit the White House tomorrow

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and other CEOs will visit the White House tomorrow for a dinner with Trump, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News.

The dinner would be the latest in a series of high-profile events that Trump has held with top business executives.

In September, he hosted a dinner that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Apple CEO Tim Cook.

The White House said that discussion ""centered on harnessing artificial intelligence to propel the U.S. to the forefront of global innovation.""

To influence Trump on Colombia, Sen. Bernie Moreno brought a fake image of the country’s president

When Trump hosted Republican senators for lunch at the White House on Oct. 21, Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, came prepared.

Moreno, who was born in Colombia, has become a key voice on policy involving the Latin American nation — and one that’s deeply critical of the current left-wing president, Gustavo Petro.

Two days before the lunch, Trump, at odds with Petro for months, posted on social media that Petro was “an illegal drug leader strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs” in Colombia. Trump said he was stopping all U.S. aid to the country and told reporters he would soon announce new tariffs on Colombia.

Moreno wanted to encourage Trump to take a more targeted approach — directly aimed at Petro. To do so, the senator brought along a document titled “The Trump Doctrine For Colombia and the Western Hemisphere.” In addition to five policy ideas, the one-page outline featured large images of Petro and Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela, in orange prison jumpsuits. The images appear to be generated by artificial intelligence. NBC News obtained the memo from a person familiar with the episode.

Supreme Court extends temporary pause on $4 billion in SNAP payments for November

With a potential end to the government shutdown in sight, the Supreme Court tonight extended a freeze on a federal judge’s ruling that would require the Trump administration to fully fund the SNAP food program in November.

The decision means the government, for now, does not have to distribute about $4 billion in additional SNAP funding as required by Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John McConnell. The Supreme Court block remains in place until midnight on Thursday.

The case would likely become moot if the shutdown ends, as the bipartisan bill to reopen the government would fully fund the SNAP program through September of next year. The House is expected to vote tomorrow on the Senate-passed measure to end the record-long shutdown.

Nearly 42 million people rely on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.

Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva to be sworn in tomorrow

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is scheduled to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva tomorrow — nearly two months after the Arizona Democrat won her late father’s seat in a special election.

Johnson has consistently said he would administer the oath of office to Grijalva when Democrats vote to reopen the government. The Senate passed a bipartisan measure to do just that last night, with the House expected to vote on the legislation tomorrow.

When Grijalva is sworn in, the House breakdown will be 219 Republicans to 214 Democrats.

Grijalva is expected to be the 218th signature on the discharge petition to force a House floor vote requiring the Justice Department to publicly release all the files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. There is still an additional waiting period of seven legislative days before any of the signers of the petition can force a vote on it. The House speaker then has two legislative days before he must call up the measure for a vote on the floor.

Trump calls for a salary cap for NCAA sports. One already exists.

During a phone interview today on ESPN's ""Pat McAfee Show,"" Trump suggested that ""colleges are all going to go out of business, no matter how rich they are"" unless ""very powerful caps"" are created to limit the salaries of collegiate athletes.

A type of salary cap already exists in the NCAA, however.

In June, a judge approved the landmark House settlement between the NCAA and Division I athletes that allows universities to share revenue gained from athletics and directly pay their athletes for the first time. Universities can disburse up to $20.5 million during the 2025-26 school year. That cap will increase by an estimated 4% annually over the lifespan of the decade-long deal.

The payments are on top of scholarships and other financial benefits the athletes can receive. Schools that have elected to pay athletes under the revenue-sharing cap have devised different models for dividing the payments. Of the $20.5 million this year, Texas Tech University projected sharing 74% with players on its football team. The University of Missouri, by comparison, has reportedly elected to spend a smaller percentage on football, while paying out more to its men's basketball and baseball teams.

Trump said he was concerned that the payouts would lead schools to eliminating ""lesser sports.""

“It is a very serious problem because even football, when they give quarterbacks $12 million, $13 million, $14 million, I read a couple of them, and all of a sudden you’re going to see it’s going to be out of control, and even rich colleges are going to go bust,"" Trump said.

The rules panel is a necessary step before the legislation can make it to the House floor. The committee will create a rule that will dictate how floor debate goes tomorrow, including how long it takes.

Trump administration tells judge that CFPB will run out of funding early next year

The Justice Department today notified U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who oversaw the lawsuit on the dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that the independent agency may be out of money as soon as early 2026.

“The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026,” DOJ attorneys wrote. They cited an Office of Legal Counsel opinion out this week that says beyond Dec. 31, 2025, “there are no funds available from CFPB’s congressionally authorized source of funding.”

“Because the only lawful source of funding from the Federal Reserve has dried up, the proper method for additional funds is to request them from Congress pursuant to the Appropriations Cause, not to draw from the Federal Reserve without a congressional appropriation,” T. Elliot Gaiser of the Office of Legal Counsel wrote this week.

In light of the Office of Legal Counsel opinion, the DOJ writes, “the Acting Director of the Bureau anticipates preparing a report to the President and to congressional appropriations committees, as statutorily required, identifying the funding needs of the Bureau.”

“The Bureau does not know whether and the extent to which Congress will appropriate funding to pay the expenses of the Bureau,” the Justice Department added.

Trump lauds Department of Veterans Affairs' efforts to cut benefits backlog

Trump claimed in his remarks at Arlington National Cemetery today that his administration has made headway in addressing a yearslong backlog of veterans' benefit requests, saying the department has reduced unprocessed claims by half since he took office in January.

""That’s a big achievement, and Doug is going to get it down to zero,"" Trump said, referring to Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins.

Trump vowed to eliminate ""100% of that backlog. We’re moving at that pace, and already we processed more than 3 million backlog claims,"" he said.

In August, the VA said that it had processed about 2.5 million claims this fiscal year and was ""completing them 17.8% faster"" than in fiscal 2024 despite what it said was a 10% uptick in claims.

Asked for more recent figures, VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz shared a graph that he said supports Trump's claim. Kasperowicz said there were 264,717 claims still not processed at the end of the Biden administration. While the graph shows that figure is down to 134,000, Kasperowicz said the graph lags the latest number, which he said is now less than 120,000.

USS Gerald R. Ford joins U.S. military operations against drug cartels

The aircraft carrier strike group that the Defense Department deployed as part of the administration's military actions against drug cartels has arrived in the Latin American region.

Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement today that the enhanced presence in the region ""will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to move last month from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean to support Trump's efforts to dismantle alleged drug-carrying operations.

The strike group's area of responsibility is known as SOUTHCOM, which encompasses Latin America south of Mexico, the waters next to Central and South America, and the Caribbean, according to the Pentagon.

Republicans demand tougher abortion restrictions to extend Obamacare funds

Senate Republicans say they’re open to extending a pot of Affordable Care Act funds that will expire at the end of the year — but only if Democrats acquiesce to stricter abortion restrictions on insurance plans.

The demand presents a significant hurdle to reaching a bipartisan deal to extend ACA funding, designed to avoid major premium hikes next year for more than 20 million Americans, as Democrats are adamant that existing abortion guardrails under Obamacare are sufficient.

What to expect after the House comes back tomorrow

For the first time since Sept. 19, the House will be in session and holding votes tomorrow.

In order to reopen the government, the House needs to pass the same legislation that the Senate passed last night. This package extends government funding through Jan. 30 and also includes a “minibus” of three full-year appropriations bills and fully funds SNAP benefits through the end of next September.

Members of the House were notified last night to return to D.C. for votes as early as 4 p.m. tomorrow. Here’s what will happen next:

The Rules Committee will meet at some point, likely this evening. to approve the short-term funding bill and pass a rule that will dictate floor debate. As of this writing, the committee has not finalized its meeting time.

Tomorrow, the House is expected to convene at 12 p.m. ET. House Speaker Mike Johnson told Republicans that the first order of business will be swearing in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz. The House will take up the bill sometime after that.

After she is sworn in, the House breakdown will be 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats. This means a majority is 217, so Republicans can only afford to lose two of their own on a party-line vote.

When the House passed the measure in September, the vote was 217-212 with two Republicans opposing it: Rep. Tom Massie and Rep. Victoria Spartz. Only one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, supported the measure.

Trump touts actions to reduce veteran homelessness

Trump touted his administration's efforts to reduce veteran homelessness, including his executive order in May to establish the National Center for Warrior Independence, which provides housing, job training and substance abuse services to veterans in the Los Angeles area.

He also highlighted his signing of the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act in July, which aims to help veterans avoid foreclosures.

Trump pointed to veteran unemployment rates, which fell from 4.2% in January to 3.1% in August, the last month of available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Trump notes other countries celebrate 'Victory Day,' but 'we’re the one that won the wars'

In his remarks, Trump noted that several countries hold annual celebrations to commemorate the victories in World War I and World War II while the U.S. typically did not participate in similar celebrations.

""They were all celebrating, we're the one that won the wars,"" Trump said, calling out France in particular.

Shortly after, he mentioned the United Kingdom and Russia as well.

""When I see other countries celebrating Victory Day — I watched it. I watched U.K., I watched Russia, they were celebrating Victory Day in World War II, and I said, 'We got to have a Victory Day,'"" Trump said. ""Nobody even talked about it in our country. But from now on, we're going to be celebrating Victory Day.""

Cabinet members attend Trump's Veterans Day speech

Trump pointed out several members of the Cabinet who are at his Veterans Day speech.

The speech appeared to be attended by Secretaries Doug Collins, Pete Hegseth, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Doug Burgum, Chris Wright, Linda McMahon and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Trump also shouted out to Budget Director Russ Vought, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

Watchdog group files ethics complaints against Lindsey Halligan

The watchdog group Campaign for Accountability has filed formal complaints with the Florida and Virginia bar associations against the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan.

The left-leaning group accuses Halligan, a former Trump personal attorney who has brought criminal cases against his political adversaries James Comey and Letitia James, of violating multiple rules of professional conduct, including the prohibition of the prosecution of a charge the prosecutor knows is not supported by evidence.

""Ms. Halligan’s actions appear to constitute an abuse of power and serve to undermine the integrity of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and erode public confidence in the legal profession and the fair administration of justice,"" the complaint says.

The complaint does not seek any specific penalty against Halligan, but calls for the bar associations to investigate her and “impose appropriate disciplinary measures” if they find any ethical violations occurred.

Halligan's conduct ""undoubtedly will erode public trust in the legal system if permitted without consequence,” the complaint says.

Halligan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

White House responds to reports about backlash to top House official over 50-year mortgage remarks

A White House spokesman responded to reporting that White House officials are “furious” with Bill Pulte, who runs the Federal Housing Finance Agency, for pitching Trump on a 50-year mortgage plan.

“President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply, and lowering costs,"" White House spokesman Davis Ingle said. ""The White House and the entire Trump administration are appreciative of Mr. Pulte’s efforts, and everyone is working together to implement the President’s policies.""

Politico reported that the White House was “blindsided” by the move and is dealing with backlash from allies and lawmakers after Trump posted a message on Truth Social over the weekend that showed an image of “Great American Presidents,” with a photo of President Franklin Roosevelt under the words “30-year mortgage” alongside Trump and “50-year mortgage.”

Pulte later replied: “Thanks to President Trump, we are indeed working on The 50 year Mortgage — a complete game changer.”

Trump also discussed the idea in an interview with Fox News that aired yesterday.

A White House official told NBC News: “President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans. Any official policy changes will be announced by the White House.”

FBI director visits China for talks on fentanyl and more

FBI Director Kash Patel visited China last week to discuss fentanyl and law enforcement issues, arriving in Beijing on Friday and holding talks with Chinese officials Saturday, according to a source familiar with the visit.

His visit was first reported by Reuters.

During talks with Trump last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to intensify China’s efforts to stem the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals. In exchange, Trump reduced his fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods to 10% from 20%.

Yesterday, China announced new restrictions on the export of 13 precursor chemicals to the United States, Canada and Mexico, including those used to produce the synthetic opioid that is blamed for tens of thousands of U.S. overdose deaths each year.

Janet Mills hits Susan Collins for ‘betrayal’ after she rejects ACA funding extension

Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat who is vying to challenge Republican Sen. Susan Collins next year, criticized the Republican senator for joining her party to vote down a one-year extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies in the run-up to passage of the government funding bill.

“Susan Collins just voted against extending the ACA subsidies. This vote is a betrayal of Maine people, and it will send health care costs through the roof,” Mills said on X. “While I have fought to expand health care and to make it more affordable, Senator Collins and Republicans in Washington are doing the opposite.”

In response, Collins campaign spokesperson Shawn Roderick told NBC News the senator wants income-based restrictions on the ACA funds in order to renew them.

“Susan Collins has been clear that she supports extending the ACA subsidies, but believes there should be an income cap so wealthy people are not eligible for subsidies that are intended for people who are struggling to afford their insurance,” Roderick said. “Janet Mills’ position seems to be that wealthy Mainers making $300,000 a year should receive taxpayer funded health care subsidies.”

Trump requests Supreme Court overturn verdict in E. Jean Carroll sexual abuse and defamation case

Trump asked the Supreme Court yesterday to review a $5 million civil judgment that found him liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.

A jury in 2023 awarded the judgment after it found Trump liable of sexual abuse, following Carroll’s allegations that Trump assaulted her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store in 1996 and later defamed her during his first term by referring to her allegations as a “hoax” and a “con job.”

Utah judge rejects GOP redistricting effort, approving new map with a Democratic-leaning seat

A Utah judge late last night rejected new congressional district lines drawn by Republican state lawmakers, instead approving a new map drawing a solidly Democratic seat with voters from Salt Lake City that’s likely to flip in next year’s midterms.

The ruling is a blow for Republicans, who had designed a map to protect the state’s all-GOP congressional delegation, and a big win for Democrats who have struggled to find places to respond in kind to Republicans’ mid-decade redistricting efforts and win control of the House.

House vote to reopen the government could take place as early as tomorrow afternoon

House lawmakers were notified last night that votes on the Senate-passed legislation to reopen the government could start as soon as 4 p.m. tomorrow, according to a whip notice.

The notice indicates that multiple vote series are likely. The House Rules Committee will need to approve a rule that the full House must adopt before debate and a vote on the legislation itself.

The House last held votes Sept. 19.

Trump addresses financial concerns of air traffic controllers working without pay for more than 40 days

Trump repeated criticism last night of air traffic controllers who have been absent during parts of the record-long government shutdown, when they’re required to work without pay.

During a Fox News interview, Trump discussed the employees who in some cases have had to take on second jobs to pay their bills amid a funding lapse that will hit the six-week mark today.

“You know, a lot of people who showed up also had a second job. They took a second job temporarily. But they all know the money’s coming, and the money was coming,” Trump told host Laura Ingraham.

Steve Kornacki: Republicans took a political hit in the shutdown. How long will it last

With the government shutdown now poised to end, it’s clear Republicans are in worse shape politically now than when it started. The question is whether that will prove to be temporary — as has been the case with past funding showdowns — or if the political atmosphere has been reset in a way that will linger into next year’s midterm elections.

As the six-week shutdown played out, Trump’s job approval rating ebbed to the lowest point of his second term, with a majority of voters pinning the blame on him and Republicans in Congress. Democrats opened up a wide lead in the generic congressional ballot — 8 points in our NBC News poll, a level last seen in the run-up to the “blue wave” in the 2018 midterms.

And then there was last Tuesday, when Democrats posted an unexpected landslide in New Jersey, a state where both parties saw the gubernatorial contest as competitive and recent elections had suggested Republican momentum. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s victory was so staggering that it lifted a host of downballot Democrats and gave the party its largest state Assembly majority in a half-century. The Democratic rout was even bigger in Virginia: The party’s deeply flawed candidate for attorney general, Jay Jones, coasted easily on the coattails of Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger.

Off-year election losses spark Republican concerns about redistricting

Trump is confident that he drew the right battle lines when he launched a nationwide redistricting fight to try to preserve the Republican House majority, GOP strategists familiar with the White House’s thinking say — even after last Tuesday’s election results gave Democrats openings to counterstrike in California and Virginia.

But two other Republicans close to the White House told NBC News that there are growing concerns in the party that the political war is not going as planned — that the juice may not have been worth the squeeze and could, in a nightmare scenario, result in a net gain for Democrats. And within broader GOP circles, misgivings about the strategy heightened last week after California voters overwhelmingly approved Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts in a manner that Democrats hope will flip five House seats in their direction.

Democrats rebel after 8 senators cut a deal to end the shutdown without ACA funds

Many Democrats are fuming after a breakaway group of eight senators teamed up with Republicans to strike a deal to reopen the government without extending health care subsidies, backing off on the demand that led to the shutdown.

The agreement, which cleared a key procedural hurdle late Sunday by a vote of 60-40, sparked heavy criticism from congressional candidates, progressive activists and Democratic lawmakers. That includes some members with higher ambitions, who said it shows party leaders are not up to the task of marshaling effective opposition to Trump.

TARA GOODARZI: Yeah, so everybody has a different risk tolerance in Chicago, so there’s a different way to contribute and chip in for everybody.
AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you for being with us.","AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman in New York. Juan González is in Chicago, where protests are continuing over the Trump administration’s massive immigration raids. Over the weekend, federal immigration agents reportedly pepper sprayed a father and his 1-year-old daughter at close range in the parking lot of a grocery store in the Chicago suburb of Cicero. On Friday, police arrested 14 mothers who were protesting outside the Broadview Immigration Jail.

PROTESTOR: There aren’t enough people speaking up. There are people protesting here at this Broadview ICE facility every Friday, but not enough. We are in our communities being terrorized by ICE and Border Patrol. They are tear gassing neighborhoods for fun. We saw that in court this week, video of them saying, “Have fun,” as they threw tear gas canisters at a residential neighborhood.

They ran in this week to a daycare center and pulled the teacher out in front of toddlers, who were screaming and crying. In my school, at the elementary school, we have to walk children to and from school because their immigrant parents are afraid to leave the house. Our entire community in Chicago and across the suburbs are being terrorized by ICE and Border Patrol. We are moms, we are mad, we are coming together to say that families should not be torn apart, immigrants should not be targeted.

AMY GOODMAN: The Broadview protests came days after a shocking video went viral showing armed ICE agents in black vests dragging a teacher out of a Spanish immersion daycare and preschool in front of the children and parents. Diana Santillana Galeano at the Rayito del Sol Spanish immersion early learning center, community members, including Democratic Congressmember Delia Ramirez, have denounced her arrest.

CONGRESSMEMBER RAMIREZ: They didn’t just walk in chasing one person. They went into multiple rooms asking and looking for teachers, while children were present. This is an agency that has gone rogue, and it’s an agency that believes in as long as they can cover their face, they can get away with anything.

It is why this immediate press conference was so important and why all of us are here with the parents, with teachers, with someone who I just talked to an hour ago, and she said, “Delia, I don’t think I can go back to work tomorrow. I don’t know that I’m safe.”

AMY GOODMAN: We go now to Chicago, where we’re joined by Tara Goodarzi, a parent of a 3-year-old who attends Rayito del Sol where Diana Santillana Galeano was detained by ICE on November 5 in front of parents and the young kids. Tara, thanks so much for being with us. You came right after this happened. Can you describe what everyone described? Of course, we see this woman being taken out, the teacher at the daycare center. Explain what the kids and the parents saw.

TARA GOODARZI: Hi, good morning, Amy. Thanks so much for having me. Yeah, I was on my way to drop off my son to school when I started getting a bunch of calls and texts about the situation at the school. My son was super excited to start his normal day at his favorite place and see all his friends. And when we arrived, it was just a shocking scene. There were crowds of parents and teachers huddled together and crying, kids were crying, some were in corners, like, being shielded by their teachers, almost as if they were hiding. It was a devastating scene. And my son quickly became emotionally affected by it as well.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Tara, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson claimed on X that individuals were attempting to barricade themselves inside the daycare center. What do you know actually happened when these agents arrived?

TARA GOODARZI: My understanding is that the teacher was just trying to get to work to start her normal day. She is a beloved member of our community. We want her to be there teaching our children. And she was followed in to the school. Our school has security measures in place, such as signs outside that say that it’s a private establishment for authorized personnel only, we have locked inner doors that prevent people from just walking in, and so Diana was allowed in to start her normal day. She is absolutely a teacher there. My understanding is she was just trying to get to work that day.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And how have you and the other parents began to process what happened to the children of the daycare center?

TARA GOODARZI: Yeah, we have really banded together as a community as part of the larger efforts of resistance that have been happening in Chicago for months now. So, mirroring those efforts, we have started our own parent patrols outside of the school with whistles. Our whistles are kind of the only thing we have right now in Chicago to protect ourselves and our communities from these agents.

We’ve started meal trains, we’ve started ride-share programs for the teachers who are maybe too scared to drive themselves to work every day or even to go to their assigned court dates for some immigration hearings.

So, we have safe passage escort programs for them, we’ve also started legal defense funds, and we’re working on, like, master lists of readily available immigration counsel that can be of help to any educators that are in need. So, it’s really brought an awareness and a heightened sense of community to our neighborhood and our city in an effort to heal from the trauma that we faced last week and that we have been facing for months now, since the onset of Operation Midway Blitz.

AMY GOODMAN: GoFundMe has just exploded, supporting the teacher. Also, can you talk about the mutual aid networks that are providing ride-shares and groceries for neighbors who are too afraid to leave their homes now?

TARA GOODARZI: Yeah, so everybody has a different risk tolerance in Chicago, so there’s a different way to contribute and chip in for everybody. If you want to be a little bit more low-profile, there are mutual aid networks everywhere. In every neighborhood, a lot of organizations are starting their own, a lot of schools are starting their own.

There are food pantries that are constantly up and running, looking for volunteers to take shifts. People pack groceries, people sign up for delivery shifts all over the city. There’s just been an explosion, like you said, of opportunities to contribute to our immigrant communities. They are deeply, deeply important to us in Chicago, and right now, we just want to do everything we can to support them.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And do you think, Tara, that the institutions, the local institutions in this city, the police, the mayor, and the other elected officials are doing enough to assure the safety and tranquility of not only your daycare center, but of immigrants and folks throughout the city right now?

TARA GOODARZI: Yeah, I’m fully supportive of Mayor Johnson’s executive order that he signed a little while ago, which prohibited ICE from utilizing public spaces for any operations. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like that’s being adhered to. So, I think we really do need to reevaluate what else can be done to protect us from these federal agents.

Unfortunately, I have been at Broadview myself. I have seen Illinois State Police acting in a violent way towards peaceful protestors. And over the weekend, I saw Chicago Police officers doing similar activities. So, we are starting to get increasingly concerned about some of the state police activity that’s been happening, and I do think this is an issue that needs to be addressed with both the governor and the mayor.

AMY GOODMAN: And if you could finally, Tara, talk about how your little boy, 3-year-old, who came right after, but all the other kids terrorized and the parents, how are these kids dealing with what they saw, their teacher being dragged out? And she, herself, this Spanish immersion teacher of preschoolers, has two kids herself.

TARA GOODARZI: Yeah, she is a mother, and she’s actually an infant teacher. So, we entrust Diana with our youngest kids at this school, babies. That’s how much we love and support her. People send their new babies, as young as four months, I believe, to be in her care every day. The kids have been so confused. The kids have been saying things like, “Are they going to take me next? If I speak Spanish outside, am I going to get taken from my mom? Where is my teacher? I miss Ms. Diana. I’m afraid.”

These are things that our children have said to us. My son was completely – like, he shut down emotionally after this happened. Kids process things differently, and he was just, like, so shocked by the state that his school and his safe place had transformed into. And we really need to start working on how to talk to our kids about these issues.

I’m personally working on some know-your-rights materials that can be, like, transferred to little kids, so we can start having these conversations with them as well as showing them, like, age-appropriate books about how to interact with our neighbors and our community and learn about what it means to be undocumented in Chicago, just so they can all start learning, unfortunately, from an early age what this has done to our city.

Isolated from family, denied clear information, and eventually forced to confront the possible reality of not coming back home.
That silence my family faced when my cousin went missing is not unique.
But more often, it’s detective work: calling ICE detention centers where staff often won’t answer basic questions.
I followed every step: using the ICE locator system, searching federal prison databases, and calling local field offices.","For the past three months, I’ve been working as a detention documentation specialist at AFSC. I document human rights violations committed by immigration enforcement agencies and help locate individuals who’ve been detained. I never imagined that my work would overlap so directly with my own family’s story. But in many ways, that’s the reality of immigration in this country—a line between professional responsibility and personal experience can blur in hard, unexpected ways.

I have a cousin who lived in Los Angeles. He had immigrated to the U.S. from a small village on the coast of Guatemala. Growing up, I’d visit him there, where family friends looked after me, while my parents stayed behind as they worked to resolve their own immigration cases.

One day, my cousin messaged me a photo from Universal Studios. I learned he had been in L.A. with his uncle. Both worked long days painting houses, the kind of jobs that keep neighborhoods running but rarely get acknowledged.

But one afternoon in March of this year, my cousin never came home. Our family started calling, texting, checking in with neighbors. Hours passed.

It was through neighbors that we learned what had happened. ICE agents had picked them up in unmarked cars at their worksite that day. They wore masks, making them nearly indistinguishable from kidnappers. Because of his line of work, my cousin was caught in the Trump administration’s efforts to detain and deport millions of immigrants from the U.S. My family had no information, no phone call, no official notice. Just silence, panic, and, eventually, anger.

A few weeks later, I learned that he had been transferred to a detention facility where he would remain in limbo for months. Isolated from family, denied clear information, and eventually forced to confront the possible reality of not coming back home. Ultimately, he was deported back to Guatemala.

That silence my family faced when my cousin went missing is not unique. Every day, people across the country wake up to find loved ones gone, swept into a system designed to disorient and create fear.

This is where my work with AFSC comes in. I help track people who are detained, piecing together information from our staff and other local organizers. Sometimes, it’s as straightforward as confirming someone’s name in ICE’s online locator system. But more often, it’s detective work: calling ICE detention centers where staff often won’t answer basic questions. It’s hours of checking databases that aren’t updated. All bureaucratic hurdles designed to exhaust.

As I scrambled for information about my cousin, I realized how closely this mirrored what I do as part of my role at AFSC: investigating disappearances, gathering evidence, and reconstructing the stories of people who suddenly vanish into detention.

What I’ve learned is that accurate documentation is not just about data—it’s about power. When we know where someone is, when we’ve recorded the details of how they were taken, when we can track patterns across ICE raids and facilities, we are building evidence. This evidence can support legal defense, inform advocacy campaigns, and give families a foothold in a process meant to overwhelm them.

The challenges are constant: misinformation, unanswered phone calls, bureaucratic resistance, and the emotional weight of the unknown. In one recent case, for example, I worked helped track a missing person picked up by ICE in New Jersey. He had been on his way to do landscaping work at around 6:45 in the morning.

I followed every step: using the ICE locator system, searching federal prison databases, and calling local field offices. After logging 20 unanswered calls to the ICE office in Newark, we finally confirmed that the community member had been transferred to a detention facility in Elizabeth and deported to Guatemala. The entire process had stretched over six days.

But the goal of our work is clear— to resist erasure. To ensure that people don’t slip through the cracks. To affirm that immigrants are not simply statistics but vital members of our communities. Each has agency, dignity, and stories that matter. They have family and friends who love them and rely on them. My cousin’s story is one of thousands, but each story is also evidence in a larger case for stopping detention and deportation that tears apart families and communities.

And yet, alongside this despair, it's important to acknowledge all the resilience and endurance I’ve seen. In New Jersey and around the U.S., AFSC supports individuals and organizations working every day to protect community members. Nationwide, volunteers are staffing hotlines to report ICE and forming rapid response networks to show up at detention centers, court hearings, and workplaces. Neighbors are organizing watch groups to warn each other when ICE is nearby and document what happens. Everyday people are rejecting government raids as normal.

Working on these cases, I'm often confronted with the reminder of my own helplessness. But I also remember the strength that comes from connecting with others who refuse to look away.

That’s the work I carry with me now: helping locate those who've gone missing—and also finding the threads of strength and solidarity that endure in the face of detention cruelty.

Immigration has and always will remain relevant to both my professional and personal life. Throughout these years, one truth has become clear: an immigration system built on detention and deportation cannot be fixed—it must be fundamentally transformed.

This means finding our collective strength, our shared humanity, and the power of community organizing. It means stories being told in full, not just as moments of suffering but as calls to action. Because to me, resistance now looks like ordinary people refusing to let fear dictate how they live.",https://afsc.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/pb_122454_elizabeth-detention-center-scr.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 21:01:53.744147

An email sent to the mayor and city council mentioned these reports, but did not confirm any details.

It emphasized that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has no role in federal immigration enforcement.

Councilman Ed Driggs stated that CMPD and the sheriff’s office have not indicated any coordination or communication from ICE, leaving them with little knowledge of the situation.

Councilman Driggs expressed concerns about the prospect of border patrol agents operating in Charlotte, stating, “I think the borders should be controlled, but when you have people kinda prowling the streets or whatever it is they plan to do here, that is disquieting.”

“We have issues that we’re confronting since the Iryna Zarutska killing,” Driggs said, “but I don’t think we need ICE here.”

Immigration attorney Jamilah Espinosa noted that non-profit organizations and community organizers are planning meetings to instruct migrants on their rights and what to do if detained.

“We want to make sure that they vet, that they really ensure that it’s ICE,” Espinosa said.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden requested that Customs and Border Patrol inform his office and local law enforcement of any enforcement actions in advance to ensure safety.

Non-profit organizations and attorneys supporting immigrants are mobilizing in response to the potential arrival of ICE in Charlotte.

They are organizing meetings to educate migrants on their rights and how to handle encounters with immigration officials.

Espinosa emphasized the importance of peaceful protests if ICE conducts operations in Charlotte, contrasting with the violent clashes seen in Chicago.

She advised allies of the immigrant community to share their voices rather than engage in confrontations with immigration officials.

Several local and state officials — including members of the Charlotte City Council, the Mecklenburg County Commission, the CMS Board, and the General Assembly — issued a joint statement reassuring immigrant communities amid reports of possible federal immigration enforcement in Charlotte.

They emphasized that immigrants are valued members of the community and should not feel alone or unwelcome. The officials pledged to ensure accurate information, open communication, and the protection of all residents’ safety and dignity.

The statement also clarified that federal immigration actions are directed by the Department of Homeland Security through ICE and CBP — not by local or state governments — and that CMPD does not enforce immigration laws or participate in federal immigration operations.

Surrounded by protesters, attendees gradually exited, some yelling back and engaging in arguments.
The protest wrapped up a little after 9:30 p.m. By the end of the protest, four people had been arrested, according to Mogulof.","A few hundred feet apart, yet worlds away politically, furious students at UC Berkeley protested the final stop of the conservative organization Turning Point USA’s “American Comeback Tour,” hosted Monday night on what is known as the nation’s most liberal campus.

The event drew many older attendees who at various moments danced to “YMCA,” laughed, and held moments of silence for the late TPUSA leader Charlie Kirk.

Outside the event, students, most of them far younger than the attendees inside, faced off with police in riot gear, with physical fights prompting arrests. One man was taken to a hospital after being struck in the head.

On Tuesday morning, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon announced the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division would investigate the event. Attorney General Pam Bondi also tweeted that the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force would be launching a full investigation of what she called “violent riots at UC Berkeley.”

In a statement, UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof said the university is conducting a “full investigation” and “intends to fully cooperate” with the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force to identify “the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt last night’s TPUSA event.”

During the event, a large police presence held back protesters several hundred feet away and held up batons and projectile weapons. The UC Police Department, private security, and law enforcement from Alameda County and San Francisco were staged at Lower Sproul, a plaza in front of Zellerbach. The event was strictly monitored, with bags, food, beverages, signs and flags prohibited.

Law enforcement had already begun in the early morning, with the UC Police Department arresting four students at midnight for felony vandalism for trying to attach a giant cardboard bug to Sather Gate at the campus entrance as a protest against the TPUSA event, as reported by the Daily Californian.

The event occurred exactly two months to the day after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the founder of TPUSA, who was shot on a Utah university campus while he debated students about his political viewpoints.

Two student reporters for CalMatters were at the event. Here’s what they saw both outside and in.

Outside, 4:30 p.m.

Protests were just beginning in Sproul Plaza, a central area on campus, while Lower Sproul Plaza, the area in front of Zellerbach Hall, was entirely barricaded by law enforcement. Surrounding campus buildings had closed as early at 12:45 p.m., causing student group meetings to be cancelled or moved to Zoom.

Unable to walk straight to Zellerbach Hall, the hundreds of protesters moved down Bancroft Way toward the campus’s Student Union, where event attendees lined up to enter the barricaded space in front of Zellerbach. A fight broke out between two men, one of whom was selling “Freedom” shirts. Their altercation and subsequent arrest briefly shut down the street.

Inside, 5:30 p.m.

Inside the event, attendees, most of whom were not students, filed in wearing red MAGA hats and “Freedom” shirts. As they took their seats, they danced to “Born in the USA,” “YMCA” and “Here Comes the Sun.”

Outside, 5:30 p.m.

A panic briefly ran through the crowd when a car on Bancroft Way began to backfire, mimicking the sound of gunshots, causing some attendees to duck and run as smoke filled the air. No one was injured, and the majority of protesters continued to chant and bang on the barricades in front of almost 20 UCPD officers holding up their batons.

Inside, 6:30 p.m.

Jobob Taeleifi, a comedian and friend of Kirk’s, kicked off the event, followed by John Paul Leon, UC Berkeley’s Turning Point USA chapter president, who announced the entrance of Christian apologist and Kirk mentor Frank Turek.

“When a bullet soared through the air, an assassin took the life of a courageous man,” Leon told the crowd. “The sad truth is, the left are not your friends. They will mock and dehumanize you just so they can laugh at your corpse … To all those protesters outside, I have one thing to say: It is clear to us which side is winning when your side becomes the violent agitators.”

Taeleifi, Leon and Turek all focused much of their speeches on criticizing the protests outside. Turek called Kirk a “martyr” and recounted his experience watching Kirk die.

“I’m never going to forget Charlie’s lifeless eyes looking back right past me,” Turek said.

Comedian Rob Schneider, who spoke after Turek, thanked “antifa” for their “welcome.” Schneider spoke about his experience at the Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary event, did impressions of God and said, “God said Trump’s my guy.”

“There is an attack on Western civilization and the United States is the last bastion of hope,” Schneider said. “As Charlie Kirk said, if you do not assimilate, it is an invasion, and that is what we’re experiencing.”

Outside, 6:30 p.m.

Two people who were arguing began to fight. One was detained by the police.

The protest mostly congregated around one barricaded entrance to the event. Some were there in response to calls put out by UC Berkeley student activist groups like Students Organizing for Liberation, Young Democratic Socialists of America and Jewish Voice for Peace. In addition to the large number of students, protesters also included people who did not attend UC Berkeley – groups like SF Bay Activists held a “dance party” protest.

Away from the epicenter of the shouts and chants in front of police, many hung back just to watch and observe.

One student protester, Asha Genett, said she attended because she disagreed with Turning Point’s support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, which she called “human rights abuses.”

“I think that conversation between conservatives and liberals or leftists is important,” Genett said. “I don’t think the way that TPUSA strives to engage in that is productive or helpful. I think it’s inflammatory.”

Chants varied between condemnations of TPUSA’s conservative ideals, to calls for them to leave campus. Protesters shouted, “Fascists out of Berkeley,” “Trump must go now,” and “F— Charlie Kirk.”

Protester Court Freund, a UC Berkeley master’s student who identifies as a Democrat and libertarian, said he disagreed with TPUSA on everything but free speech.

“My perspective is that TPUSA and other organizations I strongly disagree with, as long as they’re not espousing direct harm to someone on campus, they should be here and have a right to be here,” he said.

“By closing them out from our campus, which is supposed to be a hub for intellectual debate, so many progressives just want to shut out the other side,” Freund said. “By doing that, they automatically lose a large percentage of people.”

According to Mogulof, a 45-year-old male attendee of the TPUSA event was struck in the head with a glass bottle, and was transported to a nearby hospital for a laceration to his head.

Inside, 8:10 p.m.

A line of attendees filled the entirety of the aisle waiting for their chance to ask a question as Schneider hosted a Q&A with Turek, author Andrew Doyle and philosopher Peter Boghossian to conclude the event.

Jackie Jones, a student and comedy club co-president, asked Schneider if there are things comedians shouldn’t joke about, to which Schneider replied that it is a comedian’s job to “challenge” people and push boundaries. He also praised Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct allegations in 2017, calling him a “genius.”

Outside, 8:45 p.m.

Protesters circled Lower Sproul to block exits, facing off with police behind barricades as attendees left the event. Surrounded by protesters, attendees gradually exited, some yelling back and engaging in arguments. The protest wrapped up a little after 9:30 p.m. By the end of the protest, four people had been arrested, according to Mogulof.

“These people can’t be negotiated with,” said student and event attendee Matthew Edgar of the protesters outside. “They would celebrate if I died. It’s nonsensical. I’m going to walk out of here, and I’ll probably have virtually no friends coming out of Berkeley.”

As international law enforcement becomes increasingly interconnected, INTERPOL — the International Criminal Police Organization — now plays a significant role in immigration and security screening worldwide. Its 195 member countries share millions of records each year, including Red Notices and Diffusions that alert governments to individuals wanted for arrest or questioning.

For foreign nationals applying for asylum, visas, green cards, or U.S. citizenship, these alerts can have serious consequences: detention at the border, visa denial, rejection of naturalization, or even deportation. Yet not every notice is legitimate. Authoritarian governments have been known to exploit INTERPOL’s system to target political dissidents, journalists, and business competitors under the guise of criminal charges.

Recognizing and challenging such abuse is critical. A clear understanding of how INTERPOL works—and how it can be misused—can make the difference between a fair hearing and an unjust removal.

I. Overview of INTERPOL Notices

II. When Global Policing Collides with Immigration Law

The International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) maintains the world’s largest cross-border criminal database, linking 195 member countries in real time. Its “notices” — particularly Red Notices and Diffusions — were originally meant to help locate fugitives wanted for extradition.

In practice, however, these tools are increasingly misused by authoritarian governments to target political opponents, journalists, or business rivals living abroad. When such alerts surface in U.S. systems — like the FBI’s NCIC, DHS TECS, or the State Department’s CLASS database — they can trigger serious but unwarranted immigration consequences: visa refusals, citizenship delays, or even detention, despite the fact that these notices carry no judicial authority.

By INTERPOL’s own definition, a Red Notice or Diffusion is merely “a request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.” It is not an arrest warrant, not a criminal charge, and not evidence of guilt.

These notices are administrative communications, not judicial findings. They are often issued before any formal indictment — or even in the absence of a valid arrest warrant in the requesting country.

Under U.S. law, INTERPOL notices hold no evidentiary value in immigration or asylum proceedings unless supported by credible, independent proof of criminal conduct.

III. Legal Nature of INTERPOL Notices: Not a Criminal Charge or Conviction

1. Core Legal Principle

● INTERPOL’s own definition: A Red Notice is “a request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.”

● It is not an international arrest warrant, not a criminal charge, and not proof of guilt or conviction.

● Both Red Notices and Diffusions are administrative alerts—essentially information-sharing tools — often issued before any formal indictment or without judicial oversight in the requesting country.

● Under U.S. law, these notices carry no binding legal effect and no evidentiary weight unless backed by credible, independently verified evidence of criminal conduct.

2. U.S. Judicial and Administrative Decisions

● Matter of W–E–R–B–, 27 I&N Dec. 795 (BIA 2020) —

The Board of Immigration Appeals held that a Red Notice alone cannot establish probable cause or guilt. DHS must produce independent, corroborating evidence to substantiate criminal conduct.

● Khalikov v. Garland, 20 F.4th 568 (9th Cir. 2022) —

The Ninth Circuit found that an INTERPOL notice issued by Uzbekistan was politically motivated and could not justify asylum denial or be treated as proof of criminality. ● Doe v. Holder, 736 F.3d 871 (9th Cir. 2013) —

The Court ruled that foreign criminal allegations lacking due process protections cannot form a valid basis for inadmissibility or removal under the INA.

● Qatanani v. Att’y Gen., 637 F.3d 408 (3d Cir. 2011) —

The Court held that foreign convictions rendered under coercive or unfair procedures cannot be used to deny immigration benefits or naturalization.

● Gonzalez v. INS, 996 F.2d 804 (6th Cir. 1993) —

The Court concluded that police reports, hearsay, or unverified accusations from abroad are insufficient to establish removability or criminal inadmissibility under U.S. law.

● In re Extradition of Drayer, 190 F.3d 410 (6th Cir. 1999) —

The Sixth Circuit clarified that an INTERPOL Red Notice does not authorize arrest or extradition within the United States absent a formal treaty-based request through judicial process.

● Benitez v. Garcia, 495 F.3d 640 (9th Cir. 2007) —

The Court stated that a Red Notice is merely a police communication from abroad and does not carry the evidentiary weight of a valid judicial warrant.

● United States v. Demjanjuk, 367 F.3d 623 (6th Cir. 2004) —

The Court warned that foreign data transmitted through INTERPOL must be independently verified and cannot serve as proof of guilt without corroboration.

● Gonzalez-Castillo v. Garland (9th Cir. 2022) —

The Court reaffirmed that a Red Notice alone does not establish probable cause that a crime has been committed; additional evidence is required.

3. Federal Policy and Agency Guidance

● DOJ Criminal Resource Manual § 611 (INTERPOL Red Notices)

States that a Red Notice “is not a substitute for a U.S. arrest warrant” and cannot justify detention or extradition absent formal proceedings.

● ICE Directive 15006.1 (August 2023) —

Explicitly declares: “A Red Notice or Wanted Person Diffusion is not an international arrest warrant and conveys no legal authority to arrest, detain, or remove a person.”

● DOJ Office of International Affairs – Extradition Manual (2021)

Confirms that Red Notices are non-binding communications, and U.S. arrests must be based on judicial warrants or extradition requests through diplomatic channels.

Together, these authorities firmly establish that:

● INTERPOL Red Notices are not proof of criminal conduct;

● USCIS and DHS must rely on verified judicial evidence, not foreign police data; and

● Federal courts consistently reject attempts to equate Red Notices with convictions, indictments, or probable cause.

IV. INTERPOL Notices vs. U.S. Law

V. Misuse by Authoritarian States and USCIS Overreach 1. Authoritarian Misuse

Countries including Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Venezuela, Egypt, and Belarus routinely issue politically motivated Red or Diffusion Notices.

a) Russia

● Targets: opposition leaders, journalists, and business rivals.

● Cases: Bill Browder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Yevgeny Chichvarkin.

● The CCF has deleted dozens of Russian requests as violations of Article 3 of the INTERPOL Constitution.

b) China

● Campaigns: “Fox Hunt” and “Sky Net” to repatriate political exiles.

● Victims: Uyghur activists (Dolkun Isa), lawyers, and entrepreneurs accused of “economic crimes.”

c) Turkey

● Post-2016 coup, more than 60 000 notices filed against perceived Gülenists.

● Rejected en masse by INTERPOL for overt political character.

d) Venezuela

● Red or Diffusion Notices against opposition deputies and journalists labeled as “terrorists.”

● Many annulled by the CCF for lack of judicial independence.

e) Iran, Egypt, Belarus, and Central Asia

● Charges such as “blasphemy,” “economic sabotage,” or “subversion” used to persecute dissidents abroad.

● U.N. Special Rapporteurs have criticized the pattern as transnational repression.

The Commission for the Control of INTERPOL’s Files (CCF) has deleted hundreds of such notices for violating Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution, which prohibits political, religious, or military interference.

2. Case Studies Illustrating INTERPOL Misuse

1. Russian Entrepreneur (N-400 Denial Reversed) — USCIS denied naturalization citing “international tax charges.” Court ordered approval after CCF deletion and W–E–R–B– citation.

2. Venezuelan Journalist (Asylum Granted) — IJ ruled Red Notice corroborated persecution; asylum approved.

3. Chinese Investor (EB-5 Hold Released) — “Economic crime” Red Notice deleted; USCIS approved I-526.

4. Turkish Academic (H-1B Extension) — Red Notice labeled him “terrorist”; approval followed CCF confirmation and Khalikov reference.

5. Iranian Dissident Couple (Refugee Travel) — Detained at JFK; released after proof of CCF deletion.

6. Belarusian Tech Executive (Adjustment Approved) — USCIS withdrew NOID after evidence of political retaliation.

7. Kazakh Banker (Extradition Refused) — Federal court found Red Notice fabricated; ICE ended removal proceedings.

8. Egyptian Lawyer (Asylum Appeal) — BIA reversed IJ for reliance on INTERPOL data without due process.

9. Russian-American Dual Citizen (Judicial Review) — District Court granted N-400 under §1421(c); USCIS erred by equating Red Notice with charge.

10. Iranian Scientist (J-1 Reinstatement) — Red Notice alleging espionage deleted; Embassy issued visa after citing Doe v. Holder.

3. USCIS Misinterpretation and Common Errors

Even though U.S. courts have repeatedly clarified that INTERPOL data has no independent legal weight, USCIS continues to misuse Red Notices in ways that conflict with basic principles of due process.

Common errors include:

● Treating Red or Diffusion Notices as if they were pending criminal charges;

● Issuing Notices of Intent to Deny (NOIDs) or outright denials without verifying the authenticity or current status of the notice;

● Failing to distinguish between police communications and judicial convictions;

● Disregarding CCF decisions confirming that a notice has been deleted or that the individual has been exonerated.

This kind of administrative overreach has drawn judicial criticism and prompted federal lawsuits under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), challenging USCIS for arbitrary and unsupported decision-making.

4. U.S. Immigration Contexts and Remedies

VI. The Commission for the Control of INTERPOL’s Files (CCF) Remedy

Individuals who are wrongfully listed in INTERPOL databases can petition for deletion or correction of their data.

A complete application typically includes:

● Proof of identity;

● A legal brief citing Article 3 (political or discriminatory nature) and Article 12 (accuracy and relevance);

● Supporting evidence such as court dismissals, NGO or human-rights reports, or official findings of abuse.

The process usually takes 8 to 12 months and concludes with a written decision confirming either deletion or modification of the record — a document that can be vital in proceedings before USCIS, EOIR, or the Department of State.

It is essential to understand that an INTERPOL Red or Diffusion Notice is not a criminal charge, not a conviction, and not reliable proof of wrongdoing.

When such notices are misused — whether by authoritarian governments or, at times, by U.S. immigration authorities — they erode the principle of due process that underpins the American legal system.

Compliance and risk management: Consider steps to prepare for possible changes in the legal landscape regarding compelled disclosure and state investigatory powers.","On December 2, 2025, the United States Supreme Court will hear oral argument in First Choice Women's Resource Centers, Inc. v. Platkin,[1] a case with significant implications for nonprofit donor privacy, First Amendment rights, and the ability of advocacy organizations to challenge state investigatory actions in federal court.

Case background

First Choice Women’s Resource Centers, Inc. (First Choice) is a faith-based nonprofit operating pregnancy centers in New Jersey. In 2023, New Jersey Attorney General (AG) Matthew Platkin issued an administrative subpoena under the authority of state law demanding, among other things, the names of nearly 5,000 donors and extensive records about the organization’s operations, advertisements, and personnel over a ten-year period. The stated concern was the potential misleading of donors and clients, but the subpoena did not cite any specific complaints or evidence of wrongdoing.

First Choice challenged the subpoena in federal court before the subpoena return date had passed and argued that it violated its First Amendment rights – specifically, the rights to free speech and free association, including donor privacy. The district court dismissed the case as unripe because it concluded that only a state court has the power to enforce or quash a subpoena issued under state law, requiring First Choice to litigate its constitutional claims in state court first.[2] In a divided opinion, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed and concluded that First Choice “can continue to assert its constitutional claims in state court as that litigation unfolds.[3] The result is that First Choice must risk enforcement and possible criminal penalties before federal courts will hear its constitutional claims.

The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve whether, where the subject of a state investigatory demand has established a reasonably objective chill of its First Amendment rights, a federal court in a first-filed action is deprived of jurisdiction because those rights must be adjudicated in state court.

Key legal issues

First Amendment rights: Does compelled disclosure of donor identities and internal documents by a faith-based nonprofit violate the right to free speech and association?

Federal versus state jurisdiction: Must federal courts defer to state courts in adjudicating constitutional claims arising from state investigatory actions, especially when federal rights are at risk of immediate harm?

Potential implications

If the Supreme Court sides with First Choice:

Strengthening donor privacy: A ruling for First Choice could reinforce the right of nonprofits – especially those engaged in advocacy or controversial issues – to protect donor identities from compelled disclosure by state authorities.

Federal forum access: It could clarify that parties facing a credible chill of First Amendment rights have immediate access to federal courts, rather than being forced to exhaust state remedies first.

Limits on state investigatory powers: States may face new limits on their ability to use subpoenas or investigatory demands to obtain sensitive information from advocacy organizations.

If the Supreme Court sides with the state:

Expanded state authority: States could have greater latitude to investigate nonprofits and compel disclosure of donor and operational information, subject to later federal review only after state proceedings are complete.

Potential chilling effect: Advocacy groups may be deterred from engaging in controversial speech or association if they fear compelled disclosure and lack immediate federal recourse.

Forum-shopping and litigation strategy: The decision could affect where and how constitutional claims are litigated, with possible increases in state court litigation over federal rights.

Key considerations for organizations

Nonprofits and advocacy groups: Organizations are encouraged to review their donor privacy policies and be aware of the potential for increased state scrutiny and investigatory demands.

Litigation strategy: Consider the risks and benefits of challenging state actions in federal versus state court and monitor developments for guidance on jurisdictional strategy.

Compliance and risk management: Consider steps to prepare for possible changes in the legal landscape regarding compelled disclosure and state investigatory powers.

State administrative subpoenas: If an organization is facing a state administrative subpoena, prompt and strategic action is key. Organizations are encouraged to work with counsel to assess the subpoena’s scope and to engage with the state agency, including, if necessary, challenging the validity of the subpoena in court.

In October, the city of Center Line entered into a new agreement with ICE, giving local police officers the power to act as immigration agents. Known as the 287(g) Task Force Model, it also comes with the potential of additional federal funding for the participating communities.

""This carries so much legal liability for the municipality.

Center Line's public safety director later announced the city would be withdrawing its agreement, putting out a statement saying, the city ""had no intent to participate in any ICE enforcement activities in direct partnership with ICE agents, such as raids on businesses or resident's homes, as the city does not have the resources for that sort of activity.""

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which operates under the DHS, enacted the policy in February to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes: male and female.

end of list

The Associated Press (AP) news agency obtained internal documents explaining the policy change from four independent sources, including one current and two former TSA workers.

Those documents explain that “transgender officers will no longer engage in pat-down duties, which are conducted based on both the traveller’s and officer’s biological sex. In addition, transgender officers will no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveller elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area”.

Until February, the TSA assigned officers work consistent with their gender identity, based on a 2021 management directive. The agency told the AP that it rescinded this directive to comply with Trump’s January 20 executive order.

Although transgender officers “shall continue to be eligible to perform all other security screening functions consistent with their certifications” and must attend all required training, they will not be allowed to demonstrate how to conduct pat-downs as part of their training or while training others, according to the internal documents.

A transgender officer at Dulles international airport, Danielle Mittereder, alleged in her lawsuit filed on Friday that the new policy, which also bars her from using TSA facility restrooms that align with her gender identity, violates civil rights law.

“Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits Plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialised certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities, and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday,” the complaint says.

Mittereder declined to speak with the AP, but her lawyer, Jonathan Puth, called the TSA policy “terribly demeaning and 100 percent illegal”.

TSA spokesperson Russell Read declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But he said the new policy directs that “male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers, and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs”.

The legal battle comes amid mounting reports of workplace discrimination against transgender federal employees during Trump’s second administration. It is also happening at a time when the TSA’s ranks are already stretched thin due to the ongoing government shutdown that has left thousands of agents working without pay.

Other transgender officers describe similar challenges to Mittereder.

Kai Regan worked for six years at Harry Reid international airport in Las Vegas before leaving in July, in large part because of the new policy.

Worried that he would be fired for his gender identity, he retired earlier than planned rather than “waiting for the bomb to drop”.

Regan, who is not involved in the Virginia case, transitioned from female to male in 2021. He said he had conducted pat-downs on men without issue until the policy change.

“It made me feel inadequate at my job, not because I can’t physically do it but because they put that on me,” said the 61-year-old.

Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organisation that has repeatedly challenged the second Trump administration in court, called the TSA policy “arbitrary and discriminatory”.

“There’s no evidence or data we’re aware of to suggest that a person can’t perform their duties satisfactorily as a TSA agent based on their gender identity,” Perryman said.

The DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that its policy is discriminatory.

“Does the AP want female travellers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin asked in a written response to questions by the AP. “What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritise mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travellers.”

Airport security expert and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor Sheldon H Jacobson, whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck, said that the practice of matching the officer’s sex to the passenger’s is aimed at minimising passenger discomfort during screening.

Travellers can generally request another officer if they prefer, he added.

Deciding where transgender officers fit into this practice “creates a little bit of uncertainty”, Jacobson said. But because transgender officers likely make up a small percent of the TSA’s workforce, he said the new policy is unlikely to cause major delays.

“It could be a bit of an inconvenience, but it would not inhibit the operation of the airport security checkpoint,” Jacobson said.

The TSA’s policy for passengers is that they be screened based on physical appearance as judged by an officer, according to internal documents. If a passenger corrects an officer’s assumption, “the traveller should be patted down based on his/her declared sex”.

For passengers who tell an officer “that they are neither a male nor female”, the policy says officers must advise “that pat-down screening must be conducted by an officer of the same sex” and contact a supervisor if concerns persist.

The documents also say that transgender officers “will not be adversely affected” in pay, promotions or awards, and that the TSA “is committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination and retaliation”.

But the lawsuit argues otherwise, saying the policy impedes Mittereder’s career prospects because “all paths toward advancement require that she be able to perform pat-downs and train others to do so”, Puth said.

According to the lawsuit, Mittereder started in her role in June 2024 and never received complaints related to her job performance, including pat-down responsibilities. Supervisors awarded her the highest-available performance rating, and “have praised her professionalism, skills, knowledge, and rapport with fellow officers and the public”, the lawsuit said.

“This is somebody who is really dedicated to her job and wants to make a career at TSA,” Puth said. “And while her gender identity was never an issue for her in the past, all of a sudden, it’s something that has to be confronted every single day.”

Being unable to perform her full job duties has caused Mittereder to suffer fear, anxiety and depression, as well as embarrassment and humiliation by forcing her to disclose her gender identity to co-workers, the complaint says.

It adds that the ban places an additional burden on already-outnumbered female officers who have to pick up Mittereder’s pat-down duties.

American Federation of Government Employees national president Everett Kelley urged the TSA leadership to reconsider the policy “for the good of its workforce and the flying public”.

“This policy does nothing to improve airport security,” Kelley said, “and in fact could lead to delays in the screening of airline passengers since it means there will be fewer officers available to perform pat-down searches”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101027125245133833_20.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-11-11 21:02:37.524729

In her letter, Ms. Shaheen noted that the $7.5 million payment to Equatorial Guinea was staggering compared to previous foreign assistance given to the country.
The ruling family of Equatorial Guinea, a West African nation that has abundant oil and natural gas reserves, has been widely accused of corruption.","A Democratic senator has criticized Secretary of State Marco Rubio for paying $7.5 million to the government of Equatorial Guinea to agree to take deportees from the United States who are not its citizens.

The senator, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter to Mr. Rubio on Monday saying that the “highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.”

The $7.5 million is by far the largest payment the Trump administration is known to have made to another government to take deportees who are not its citizens.

Ms. Shaheen noted that Transparency International, a research group, ranked Equatorial Guinea 173 out of 180 countries for corruption. And the State Department itself said in its 2023 human rights report that the country’s “president and members of his inner circle continued to amass personal fortunes from the revenues associated with monopolies on all domestic commercial ventures” and that “corruption at all levels of government was a severe problem.”

A State Department report from 2025 on human trafficking pointed to multiple “credible sources” who had said government officials were involved in trafficking, including for sex.

“I have serious concerns over whether, without appropriate oversight mechanisms and guardrails, a direct payment to Equatorial Guinea’s government could be used to facilitate human trafficking,” Ms. Shaheen wrote. “I am also concerned about what protections are in place to ensure that third-country nationals removed to Equatorial Guinea are themselves not vulnerable to human trafficking, smuggling or human rights abuses.”

When asked about Ms. Shaheen’s statements, the State Department declined to comment on its arrangement with Equatorial Guinea, saying it did not want to reveal details of “diplomatic communications with other governments.”

“Implementing the Trump administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State,” it said in a statement. “As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”

In one of its most contentious policies, the Trump administration has aggressively tried to deport a wide range of immigrants from the United States. Mr. Rubio has ordered diplomats to try to forge agreements with other nations to take deportees who are not their citizens.

A New York Times investigation that was based mostly on reviews of U.S. diplomatic cables and other federal documents found that, as of June, American officials had approached at least 58 governments about this effort. Many of the nations that were asked to take deportees had records of persistent human rights abuses and torture. Equatorial Guinea was one of them.

The State Department has agreed to make large payments in some cases. It paid Rwanda $100,000 to take an Iraqi man and was discussing further arrangements with the country. Most notably, it agreed to pay El Salvador $4.76 million to take up to 300 deportees whom the Trump administration accused of being members of a Venezuelan gang, according to a court filing.

The men, at least some of whom had no clear ties to any gang, were put into a notorious prison. The Times found many suffered physical and mental abuse there.

In her letter, Ms. Shaheen noted that the $7.5 million payment to Equatorial Guinea was staggering compared to previous foreign assistance given to the country. Over the past two administrations, the most aid money the United States ever gave to the country was $2 million in a year. The most given in one year by the first Trump administration was $780,000. The current amount given exceeds the sum of the past eight years of payments.

And in previous years, the United States did not give the aid directly to the government, with the exception of limited medical supplies. It sent the assistance to vetted partners that included nongovernmental organizations and the United Nations.

The $7.5 million payment is from a fund set up by Congress for the U.S. government to help with migrant and refugee issues, and specifically to help resettle those in need.

The ruling family of Equatorial Guinea, a West African nation that has abundant oil and natural gas reserves, has been widely accused of corruption.

Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of the president and a vice president who is the expected successor, was convicted by a French court in 2017 of embezzling millions of dollars of public money that allowed him to lead a lavish lifestyle in Paris. The court imposed a suspended prison sentence of three years and a suspended fine of 30 million euros, or about $35 million.

On Sept. 29, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, met with Mr. Obiang Mangue in Washington after the State Department had given him a waiver on corruption sanctions to travel to the United States during the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York. The State Department said the two officials “reaffirmed joint commitments to deepen commercial and economic ties, combat illegal immigration and advance security cooperation.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/11/multimedia/11dc-rubio-deportations-qcph/11dc-rubio-deportations-qcph-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 19:57:09.023612

ICE did not respond to a request for comment from the Statesman Journal.

“These were Oregonians taken from the heart of Salem’s close-knit Latino community,” said Reyna Lopez, president and executive director of PCUN, Oregon’s farmworker union. “This is where I grew up. It's a vibrant and strong Latino community. We are heartbroken today.""

Lopez said that at least nine of the detainees were farmworkers. Oregon for All said witnesses also reported that ICE rammed one car on Ward Drive.

ICE activity in the Mid-Willamette Valley has ramped up in recent weeks as the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration continues.

Oregon for All said more than 300 people across Oregon were detained in October. At least 35 people were arrested in Woodburn on Oct. 30. The number represents only the arrests confirmed and tracked directly through advocates' Rapid Response Network.

Salem City Councilor Mai Vang posted on Facebook about the activity in Ward 6. Vang encouraged residents to report ICE activity to the PIRC hotline (888-622-1510) and to reach out to the Equity Corps of Oregon for legal assistance relating to immigration.

""Salem Police Chief Trevor Womack has affirmed that Salem Police Department do not work to assist ICE. To do so is unlawful in Oregon,"" Vang wrote. ""I disavow the numerous ways this federal presence creates terror and chaos in our community. Please be vigilant and look out for our neighbors today.""

Salem Police Sgt. and spokesperson Jonathan Hardy said the agency was aware of two incidents involving ICE on Nov. 11.

Hardy said officers responded to a call at Portland Road and Ward Drive NE involving an unoccupied vehicle in the roadway. The car was towed, and Salem Police later confirmed it was connected to ICE activity.

Hardy said the second incident involved a report after the fact by federal agents about a disturbance near the 4500 block of Portland Road NE. Hardy said federal agents turned in a set of keys and a wallet belonging to a woman involved with the disturbance. Officers have made attempts to return the items to her, he said.

A video posted on social media by Erika Villa, who goes by La Vakerita online, seemed to show the disturbance. Villa, livestreaming herself following ICE agents as they drove through the area, said she had received reports of ICE activity and traveled to Salem to document any arrests.

""I just didn't want to see another person getting stopped and pulled over for no reason and getting arrested,"" Villa told the Statesman Journal.

Villa said she followed one vehicle she suspected belonged to ICE agents after asking them to identify themselves when she spotted them at a McDonald's.

After following the Dodge Charger with California plates, both vehicles stopped on Portland Road.

Villa recorded as one man, wearing a black baseball cap and black hoodie, exited the car she had been following and reached into the vehicle, removed a firearm, and walked toward her.

Villa, outside her vehicle, backs away and yells at him and another man, who was wearing a tan jacket and blue baseball cap, who exited the same vehicle.

The other man is briefly seen reaching inside her vehicle and appears to remove keys from her ignition. Villa begins to scream that the agents have taken her wallet and keys and yells for others to call the police. Both men returned to the Dodge and left.

Questions to ICE and the U.S Department of Homeland Security about the disturbance were not immediately answered.","https://www.statesmanjournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/11/PSAL/87219888007-salem-ice-009.jpg?crop=6620,3725,x0,y320&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-11 19:57:22.103910

After the ruling was partially upheld by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump filed an emergency appeal of the lower court block to the Supreme Court.
As in Chicago, Trump never attempted to send regular armed forces to Portland before he announced a deployment of the Guard.
The ruling marked the first time a federal judge permanently blocked one of Trump’s military interventions in a major Democratic-led city.
The block to Trump’s Chicago deployment will likely remain in place over the coming days.","President Donald Trump has broad unreviewable powers to flood U.S. cities with National Guard troops, the Department of Justice (DOJ) argued in an expansive new filing to the Supreme Court.

The letter, filed by Solicitor General D. John Sauer late Monday, marked the latest step in Trump’s authoritarian effort to militarize cities and to integrate soldiers into routine policing.

The filing was made as part of the Supreme Court’s request for additional briefing on the legality of Trump’s attempted military deployment in Chicago. Trump attempted to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard troops and deploy them into Chicago earlier this year, claiming they were needed to protect federal agents conducting immigration enforcement operations in the city as part of this mass deportation agenda.

The aggressive raids have ignited widespread but largely peaceful protests from residents, particularly outside of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb around 12 miles west of Chicago.

A district court temporarily halted Trump’s Windy City deployment last month. After the ruling was partially upheld by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump filed an emergency appeal of the lower court block to the Supreme Court.

In a surprise move, the high court said before it acted on Trump’s appeal that it needed more information on 10 U.S.C. 12406 (Title 10), the archaic law the president has repeatedly invoked this year to take control of thousands Guard soldiers.

The rarely used statute allows the president to federalize Guard troops — which are normally under state control — when the country faces foreign invasion, when the U.S. government faces rebellion or, operative here to the Supreme Court’s inquiry, when the president is unable to execute laws with “regular forces.”

The Supreme Court asked Trump and Illinois, which is challenging the Chicago deployment, to answer whether “regular forces” in the relevant clause refers to the traditional forces of the U.S. military — such as members of the Army, Navy and Air Force.

The court’s question appeared to be prompted by Martin Lederman, a former DOJ deputy assistant attorney general who’s now a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. Lederman argued in an amicus brief that throughout U.S. history, and the specific legal history of Title 10, the phrase “regular forces” has always referred to the armed forces.

Filing on behalf of Trump Monday, Sauer asserted that the phrase does not refer to the standing military but instead to the “civilian forces that regularly ‘execute the laws’ at issue but are ‘unable’ to do so in present circumstances.”

While Sauer claimed that traditional armed forces generally cannot enforce federal law, he at the same time contended that the president has broad authority to deploy the formal military domestically.

“To be sure, the standing military was undoubtedly an available option to quash the violent resistance to federal immigration enforcement,” Sauer claimed of protests in Chicago, without specifying what authority Trump would have used to do so.

Trump, Sauer claimed, may have chosen not to deploy the formal military to Chicago because doing so “would result in even more strident resistance” from residents.

Sauer also claimed that Guard troops, with their “greater local knowledge, ties to the community, and domestic focus,” are likely better suited than traditional soldiers to suppressing “violent resistance on the streets of American cities.” That argument, however, is hard to square with Trump’s attempt to send hundreds of federalized Texas National Guard troops to Chicago.

A large part of Sauer’s letter wasn’t devoted to addressing the Supreme Court’s regular forces question but instead arguing that courts have no authority to question the president’s ability to deploy troops domestically.

“The President’s determination to call up the National Guard is a core exercise of his power as Commander in Chief over military affairs, based on an explicit delegation from Congress,” Sauer said. “That determination is not judicially reviewable at all; at minimum, it is entitled to extremely deferential review, under which it should be upheld.”

The DOJ has repeatedly claimed courts cannot review Trump’s deployments — even after a panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument in a ruling on his military intervention in Los Angeles earlier this year.

In its brief, Illinois adopted Lederman’s argument that “regular forces” refers to the normal armed forces. Because he never attempted to use traditional soldiers to assist or protect federal immigration agents in Chicago, Trump couldn’t have determined that he was unable to execute federal law and therefore lacked the authority to federalize the Guard, the state argued in its letter.

“Because ‘the regular forces’ refers to the full-time, professional military, the President may federalize and deploy the National Guard under [Title 10] only in circumstances where he is unable to execute federal law with the military,” Illinois said.

“These circumstances are not met here,” it added while asking the court to deny Trump’s emergency request.

If the Supreme Court ultimately adopts Illinois’ argument, legal experts have noted it could undermine Trump’s Chicago deployment, as well as his attempt to send Guard troops to Portland, Oregon.

As in Chicago, Trump never attempted to send regular armed forces to Portland before he announced a deployment of the Guard.

A district court judge permanently blocked Trump’s Portland deployment last week after finding that it violated both the U.S. Constitution and Title 10. The ruling marked the first time a federal judge permanently blocked one of Trump’s military interventions in a major Democratic-led city.

Only in Los Angeles did Trump dispatch members of the traditional armed forces. He sent around 200 Marines in response to protests against immigration raids, but he did so while simultaneously deploying thousands of federalized members of the California Guard.

Alongside Sauer’s and Illinois’ letters, several groups asked the Supreme Court in briefs to deny Trump’s emergency appeal.

In one brief, the ACLU, the Knight First Amendment Institute and other civil rights organizations said Trump’s decision to deploy troops in response to demonstrations against the government were “incompatible with our nation’s ideals and threaten to suppress countless Americans’ exercise of First Amendment rights.”

In another, two dozen former federal judges supported a rejection of Trump’s appeal in order to preserve the judiciary’s authority to determine when a president has exceeded his constitutional and statutory authority.

The block to Trump’s Chicago deployment will likely remain in place over the coming days. The court gave Trump and Illinois until Nov. 17 to file reply briefs, and it likely will not rule on its regular forces question until those are submitted.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2239825292-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 18:02:01.211370

In June, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it was terminating humanitarian parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.
Immigration officials said they were targeting immigrants who were given commercial driver’s licenses by “sanctuary states,” including Illinois.
In immigration court in Denver, “he had already complied with all of his obligations,” Guevara said.
An ICE spokesperson, contacted via email, said immigration officials had read The Sun’s initial story about Dadfar and “have nothing to add.” They provided no other comment.","Colorado Democrats are calling on federal immigration authorities to release an Afghan immigrant who helped U.S. troops fight the Taliban before moving to Boulder County, calling his treatment “cruel and inhumane.”

Mohammad Ali Dadfar, who worked in the Afghan Army for 14 years and provided security for U.S. soldiers, was detained during an ICE sting in Indiana as he drove through the Midwest while working as a long-haul truck driver. He has been in a Missouri detention center for nearly a month.

Dadfar had been granted humanitarian parole because it was too dangerous for him to return to his home country and he was seeking asylum through regular appearances in immigration court, according to his Longmont attorney, Tiago Guevara.

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includes Boulder County, called the actions of federal immigration officials “deplorable.” Neguse’s office has spoken to Dadfar’s attorney and will help try to secure his release, he said.

“The detainment of Mohammad Dadfar — an Afghan ally who risked his life alongside American troops to fight the Taliban — is a disgrace, and yet another example of this administration’s draconian immigration policies,” Neguse said in an emailed statement. “My office is in touch directly with Mr. Dadfar’s legal counsel, and we are committed to taking all legal steps to ensure his safety and secure his release.”

U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat who is a former Army Ranger and who served in Afghanistan, said he “might not be here today” without the Afghans who served alongside him during combat tours in Afghanistan.

“After the war, we promised we’d have their back,” he said via email. “Our word must be our bond, but Donald Trump is threatening to break it once again. When America breaks our promises, especially to our friends, it makes us less safe.”

Crow last summer reintroduced the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would create a pathway for lawful permanent status for tens of thousands of Afghans who are currently in the United States.

Dadfar fled Afghanistan in 2021, after U.S. troops had withdrawn and the Taliban returned to power. Fearing for his life, he traveled with his wife and four children first to Iran, and then to Brazil when the Brazilian government offered visas to Afghan refugees. After about a year in South America, the family made a treacherous journey through the jungle of the Darien Gap to reach the U.S. border.

They arrived at the border in the summer of 2024 and were allowed to enter the country based on their claims for asylum. They settled in Louisville, where Dadfar’s brother already lived.

Dadfar had received humanitarian parole, a temporary immigration status that allows people facing urgent humanitarian crises to enter the country legally. The status was granted to 30,000 people from Hungary in the 1950s after the Soviet Union crushed Hungary’s anti-Communist revolution. It has been given to people fleeing persecution in Cuba and Vietnam, and more recently, to Ukrainians after the Russian invasion and Afghans after Kabul fell back into the hands of the Taliban in 2021.

In June, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it was terminating humanitarian parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans. That followed a U.S. Supreme Court decision in May granting an emergency request from the Trump administration to terminate parole for more than 530,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who entered the country under the Biden administration.

Dadfar, who had been working as a truck driver for only a few weeks, was caught up in what ICE officials are calling “Operation Midway Blitz,” a Chicago-based effort to prevent “alien threats to public safety.”

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said 223 people were taken into custody in a “successful operation” with the Indiana State Police targeting truck drivers near the Illinois state line. Immigration officials said they were targeting immigrants who were given commercial driver’s licenses by “sanctuary states,” including Illinois.

Dadfar has not been accused of a crime. He had a permit that authorized him to work in the United States, his attorney said.

In immigration court in Denver, “he had already complied with all of his obligations,” Guevara said. “He was just waiting for a final hearing date.”

Guevara has asked the court to transfer Dadfar’s new immigration case from Missouri to Denver so he can be closer to his family and lawyer. He is awaiting a judge’s ruling.

An ICE spokesperson, contacted via email, said immigration officials had read The Sun’s initial story about Dadfar and “have nothing to add.” They provided no other comment.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9535.jpeg,N,,2025-11-11 19:57:29.149006

The rule Calling it a “national emergency,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an interim final rule in late September to get a handle on states issuing non-domiciled CDLs to foreign drivers.
The rule, which took effect immediately, made it so that an Employee Authorization Document (EAD) was no longer enough to obtain a non-domiciled CDL.
FMCSA estimated that the changes would take 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders out of the trucking industry.
“OOIDA and truckers across America support the Trump administration’s action to restore integrity to the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs,” OOIDA President Todd Spencer said.","An emergency interim final rule to clean up the non-domiciled CDL system has been paused by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

On Monday, Nov. 10, the court ordered that the rule, which was expected to remove about 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders out of the trucking industry, be “administratively stayed” pending further order of the court.

“The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motions for stay pending review and should not be construed in any way as ruling on the merits of those motions,” the court wrote on Nov. 10.

The rule

Calling it a “national emergency,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an interim final rule in late September to get a handle on states issuing non-domiciled CDLs to foreign drivers. Following an audit, Duffy said the DOT determined that many of these CDLs were issued to drivers who were in the country illegally or for a period exceeding the time they were authorized to work in the United States.

The rule, which took effect immediately, made it so that an Employee Authorization Document (EAD) was no longer enough to obtain a non-domiciled CDL. Additionally, asylum seekers, asylees, refugees and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients would be excluded from eligibility. FMCSA estimated that the changes would take 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders out of the trucking industry. At the same time, many of those same individuals would remain eligible for other employment in the U.S.

Although the rule was made effective immediately, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is continuing to accept comments through Nov. 28. As of Nov. 11, nearly 4,900 comments had been submitted.

The lawsuit

In October, a lawsuit was filed, saying that the rule would have “devastating consequences” for hundreds of thousands of CDL holders.

The lawsuit was filed on Oct. 20 by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

“This unlawful rule seems intended to put people authorized to work in the United States out of work, solely because of the prejudices of the Trump administration,” Wendy Liu, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group, said in a news release. “We are asking the court to promptly invalidate the rule to prevent devastating consequences for our clients and the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who depend on commercial driver’s licenses for their livelihoods.”

On Oct. 24, the groups filed an emergency motion to stay the rule while the litigation is ongoing.

The plaintiffs said that FMCSA did not justify its decision to make the rule effective before going through a typical rulemaking process.

“FMCSA does not meaningfully contest that the factual evidence it cited does not demonstrate an emergency,” the plaintiffs wrote. “And FMCSA has expressly disclaimed ‘a direct link between immigration status and a driver’s ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle.’”

The agency argued that much of the danger surrounding issuing non-domiciled CDLs to foreign drivers is that there is no way to review their driving records.

“Without a verified driving record, there is a serious risk that unsafe or high-risk drivers – who may have prior violations, suspensions or a history of crashes in foreign jurisdictions – could be granted non-domiciled CDLs and operate large trucks and buses on U.S. roadways,” attorneys for FMCSA wrote in the Oct. 31 response brief. “Thus, limiting the eligibility of classes of potential applicants whose driving history cannot be ascertained will increase safety by appreciably reducing the number of non-domiciled CDL drivers with unknown driver safety records on the nation’s highways.”

Reaction

The FMCSA did not immediately respond to Land Line’s request for comment.

The Public Citizen Litigation Group offered the following statement:

“The court’s order gives drivers across the country a chance to continue working and supporting their families and communities,” Liu wrote. “We understand that FMCSA will inform state licensing agencies tomorrow morning about the stay, so that they know that FMCSA’s rule is not in effect and should not be applied. We are glad that the court put FMCSA’s unlawful rule on hold temporarily, and we hope that the court will continue to put the rule on hold while the lawsuit proceeds.”

The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association said it supports FMCSA’s efforts to close loopholes in the non-domiciled CDL program.

“OOIDA and truckers across America support the Trump administration’s action to restore integrity to the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs,” OOIDA President Todd Spencer said. “For too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk.”

The Association added that the lawsuit over how the rule was issued is reason to support Rep. David Rouzer’s Non-Domiciled CDL Integrity Act, which would codify the interim final rule into law.

Nearly 2 million residents of the Gaza strip are crammed into tent camps in the sections controlled by Hamas.","The U.S. federal government shutdown has entered its 42nd day. On Monday night, a group of seven democratic senators ratified a deal with republican senators to approve a bill to reopen the government and end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The bill notably does not include an extension of the affordable care act subsidies, though Senate majority leader John Thune has agreed to a separate vote on them. The measure now heads to the House, which has not been in session since mid-September. The House vote on the spending package could come as early as Wednesday afternoon. Independent senator Bernie Sanders called the vote a “horrific mistake.” Meanwhile, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries vowed to stand firm on the issue of healthcare subsidies.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries: “We’re not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people. And we’re going to continue the fight to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And if it doesn’t happen this week, next week, this month, next month, then it’s the fault of Donald Trump, House and Senate Republicans who continue to make life more expensive for the American people.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration again informed the Supreme Court that it wants to prevent a lower court ruling requiring full food benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to be disbursed in November. 1 in 8 people in the U.S. rely on SNAP for food assistance. This is Toni Miller, at a food bank in Phoenix, Arizona.

Toni Miller: “Trump is a joke. He’s a joke. I work hard, but those little stamps that we get? It helps out, and he’s starving the American people. I know he had lost a lot of supporters. He’s a joke.”

Syria’s President Ahmed Al-Sharaa met with President Trump at the White House yesterday. It was the first visit by a Syrian President to Washington in history, and it comes just days after the U.S. said Al-Sharaa was no longer a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist.” Al-Sharaa once had a $10 million bounty on his head, and was jailed by U.S. forces as an insurgent in Iraq from 2005-2011. He was also the leader of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which was formerly al-Qaeda’s official wing in Syria before breaking off in 2016. In the Oval Office, President Trump promised sanctions relief for Syria and commented on the historic nature of his meeting with Al-Sharaa.

President Trump: “We want to see Syria become a country that’s very successful and I think this leader can do it. I really do. I think this leader can do it. And people said he’s had a rough past. We’ve all had rough pasts, but he has had a rough past. And I think, frankly, if you didn’t have a rough past, you wouldn’t have a chance.”

European officials speaking to Reuters have expressed concern that the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal was effectively stalled and that reconstruction was increasingly unlikely. It comes as Israel continues to violate the U.S.-brokered truce, killing at least 242 Palestinians and injuring 622 since the deal came into effect on October 10th. Under the agreement, the Israeli military currently controls a little over half of the Gaza strip, including the southern city of Rafah and parts of Gaza City. Nearly 2 million residents of the Gaza strip are crammed into tent camps in the sections controlled by Hamas. This is Hamas’s spokesperson Hazem Qassam calling for the reconstruction phase to begin.

Hamas Spokesperson Hazem Qasem: “We are clearly saying that Hamas won’t be in the picture of ruling the Gaza Strip during the next day, and this has been agreed upon. There will be a social support committee from independent people which will rule everything in the strip. Therefore, we are working on removing all the excuses put by all sides to prevent reconstruction. All the regions of Gaza deserve reconstruction equally. Hamas is ready to hand in power from now, in a way that the process of the Gaza Strip’s reconstruction starts, and this is a right of the people of the Gaza Strip.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced yesterday that the U.S. military killed six people on Sunday in two more strikes on boats in the eastern Pacific. Since early September, the Pentagon has claimed responsibility for 19 attacks on boats the U.S. has said, without evidence, are carrying drugs in the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, killing 76 people. The strikes come as the Pentagon is deploying its largest warship, the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, to join a buildup of U.S. forces in the Caribbean this week.

In more Supreme Court news, the private prison company Geo Group is seeking immunity from a lawsuit filed by more than 30,000 former detainees of an ICE jail in Colorado who say they were coerced into participating in a $1-a-day detainee work program. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Monday in the case, with several Supreme Court justices appearing skeptical of Geo Group’s position. Geo Group is claiming “sovereign immunity”–the protection provided to the government from lawsuits–because it was operating under a government contract. The Geo Group is opening more detention centers nationwide, and received more than half of its $2.4 billion revenue from federal contracts.

British journalist and political commentator Sami Hamdi is set to be released from ICE custody according to his lawyer. Hamdi was detained by ICE agents last month at San Francisco International Airport while he was on a speaking tour in the U.S on a valid visitor visa. His visa was later revoked without his knowledge.Hamdi is an outspoken advocate for Palestinian rights. The CEO of CAIR-California, Hussam Ayloush said, “Sami’s case shows how quickly our government officials are willing to sacrifice our First Amendment and free press when a journalist uses his platform to dare put America first before Israel.”

A whistleblower has told House Democrats on the Judiciary Committee that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell is seeking a commutation of her 20-year sentence from President Trump. That’s according to Maxwell’s email to her attorney reviewed by NBC News, with the subject line “commutation application.” The whistleblower also reportedly detailed Maxwell’s “concierge-style” treatment at the minimum security prison camp that she was transferred to. In response, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jamie Raskin wrote a letter to President Trump quote, “You should not grant any form of clemency to this convicted and unrepentant sex offender. Your Administration should not be providing her with room service, with puppies to play with, with federal law enforcement officials waiting on her every need, or with any special treatment or institutional privilege at all.”

In Pakistan, at least 12 people were killed and several injured after a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of a busy judicial complex in Islamabad. Government officials are investigating it as a suicide attack. Pakistan’s Defense Minister said on X Pakistan is in a “state of war.” Witnesses of the bombing described the chaotic scene.

Eyewitness Rustam Malik: “It was 30 to 35 minutes since we parked our vehicles and entered the gate, then there was a loud explosion. It was a big blast. There was fire all over. Body parts were strewn. There was chaos. Then police and security personnel came. It was a big explosion. It looked like a bomb blast.”

In Ecuador, at least 31 people were found dead in a prison in the city of Machala, including over two dozen prisoners who had been hanged. This came just hours after prison guards found another four people killed. Authorities have blamed the deaths on clashes between gangs, as human rights groups sound the alarm on overcrowded and dangerous conditions inside Ecuadoran prisons, causing a series of recent deadly attacks and riots. Meanwhile relatives of those inside have repeatedly urged authorities to step up security and to detain rival gangs separately.

“What’s happening in Cottage Grove is happening all around the country, and it is up to us to not back down.
A Cottage Grove resident, he said he was surprised to hear about the ICE arrests in his community.
What’s next?” Ruth Seeger, 65, said she traveled from Eugene to attend the candlelight vigil after hearing from friends in Cottage Grove about the event.
Questions from Lookout Eugene-Springfield to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson about enforcement activity in Cottage Grove and Eugene were not answered Monday.","A crowd of about 150 gathered in Cottage Grove on Monday, Nov. 10, to show support at a candlelight vigil for those affected by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity last week.

Cottage Grove Friends of Democracy organized the event.

Abelio Carrillo, with the Rural Organizing Project, told the crowd at Coiner Park of nine ICE detentions in Cottage Grove last Wednesday.

“They are fathers, breadwinners and family members, and the agents descended before daybreak to catch people heading to work to support their families,” Carrillo said.

The statewide Rural Organizing Project has a main office in Cottage Grove for its leadership training. It seeks to “advance democracy and defend human dignity,” according to the organization’s website, which now includes a fundraiser to support families in Lane County affected by the recent ICE detentions.

Carrillo said his organization continues to hear from other community members.

“They’re constantly calling us, asking us, ‘Is it safe to send my kids to school?’ That’s not right, that shouldn’t be happening,” said Carrillo.

ICE agents last Wednesday also detained for a time Juanita Avila, a local business owner.

Avila’s daughter, Emely, told the crowd Monday about her mother’s ordeal. In an interview last week with Lookout Eugene-Springfield, Avila said she was pulled over, yanked from her minivan and then thrown to the street despite having permanent resident status.

Videos shared on social media showed Avila on the ground, yelling, and then her daughter arriving and frantically telling ICE officers of her mother’s legal status.

“My mother was not stopped because they were looking for a specific person, not because they had a warrant and not because they had reasonable suspicion, but because she was Latina and driving a van,” Emely Agustin said Monday.

Agustin told the crowd her mother was not interfering with ICE but “simply driving.”

“They were stopping people of color driving to work in vans and trucks. They didn’t identify themselves as ‘Immigration’ until after they threw her to the ground and were kneeling on top of her, putting her in handcuffs,” Agustin said.

Her mother actually had her “green card” in her pocket, but “they never once asked for it or her ID,” Agustin said. Permanent resident status, often referred to as having a “green card,” allows a person to live and work in the United States, though they are not U.S. citizens.

“After I insisted she was a legal resident, even then, they kept asking me if it was valid, expired or even real … They were trying to belittle me into giving up trying to get her released,” Agustin said.

“Every time we go out and we see a semi-suspicious vehicle, our hearts start racing. However, we consider ourselves lucky to be able to still be together as a family while others are separated and crying for the chance to see their loved ones again,” Agustin said, standing next to her mother.

Juanita Avila spoke briefly to thank the crowd for showing support and also her daughter.

“Because if she wasn’t there that day, they would have taken me, and I have a little one at home,” Avila said.

U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle also addressed the crowd.

“Juanita, we know, is part of our community. She is the best of the best, and never got the opportunity to show her ‘Green Card,’ which she had with her. Thank goodness, her daughter was there,” said Hoyle, a Democrat who represents the 4th Congressional District, which includes Cottage Grove.

She said her office would host “Know Your Rights” sessions to explain the legal rights of those stopped by ICE or otherwise encountering ICE agents.

“What’s happening in Cottage Grove is happening all around the country, and it is up to us to not back down. And it is scary, but it is less scary for us than it is for our immigrant neighbors,” Hoyle said.

In the mostly Anglo crowd, Chris Stuehm, 33, said he came to the vigil to show he doesn’t agree with the ICE tactics. A Cottage Grove resident, he said he was surprised to hear about the ICE arrests in his community.

“This is America,” Stuehm said, adding that people should feel welcome and have a path to citizenship.

“We shouldn’t just be taking people by the way they look, and arresting them and finding out that they’re legal and there’s no warrant for them, to let them go. What’s next?”

Ruth Seeger, 65, said she traveled from Eugene to attend the candlelight vigil after hearing from friends in Cottage Grove about the event.

Asked her thoughts on the ICE enforcement activity, Seeger said, “If it can happen in rural Cottage Grove, then no one is really safe.”

Carrillo last week told Lookout Eugene-Springfield that some of those detained by ICE in Cottage Grove had pending asylum applications, and he spoke to the crowd on Monday about seeking asylum as a “human right.”

The asylum application process is for those seeking protection in the United States because they fear persecution in their home countries.

“People have a right to escape violent regimes and criminal gangs in their lives and to seek safety in another country,” said Carrillo, who told the crowd he graduated from high school in 2019 after arriving in the United States from Guatemala as a teenager. His family went through the asylum process, he said.

This comes after a boat carrying 90 Rohingya refugees and migrants reportedly sank near the border between Thailand and Malaysia, with at least 25 people perished.

Amnesty International’s Myanmar Researcher Joe Freeman said:

This latest tragedy at sea in Southeast Asia once again lays bare the deadly risks faced by Rohingya Muslims who attempt to flee conflict and persecution in Myanmar, plus deteriorating conditions in refugee camps in Bangladesh.

Freeman also urged the Malaysian and Thai governments to coordinate humanitarian assistance for the survivors of the tragedy and to refrain from forcibly returning them to Myanmar. He additionally called on the ASEAN leaders to address the long-standing issue of Rohingya boats at sea and the conflict in Myanmar.

Freeman further highlighted other worsening conditions, such as food shortages, forced labour, arbitrary detention, and restrictions on movement, faced by the Rohingya community in Myanmar.

The US funding cuts have further exacerbated the situation of the Rohingya community in Bangladesh camps, with shortages in shelter and education services. These conditions, Freeman said, have led the refugees to resort to the dangerous option of fleeing by boat.

According to Malaysian police, the rescue operation for another two boats, which also reportedly carried Rohingya refugees, is underway. The police have also opened an investigation under Section 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 against those who have been rescued thus far. It is an offence under Section 6 of the Act to enter Malaysia without a valid permit or entry pass.

This is not an isolated incident, as recently two boats carrying around 300 Rohingya refugees were turned away by the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA). Moreover, according to local media, the MMEA has detained 1,333 undocumented migrants off the coast of Langkawi and Kedah between 2020 and October 2025.

Notably, there are 117,670 Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers registered with the UNHCR in Malaysia as of May. Meanwhile, Malaysia has not ratified the UNHCR Convention, despite calls from the Malaysian Human Rights Commission (Suhakam).

The government, however, proposed, in February, to review the National Security Council (NSC) Directive No.23 to recognize the refugees’ right to work.

UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration(IOM) have also issued a joint statement, expressing their concern over the latest tragedy and emphasizing the duty of states under international maritime law to protect those in distress at sea.",https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/Ambassador_Miller_visited_Rohingya_Refugee_Camps_in_Coxs_Bazar_46365456711-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 17:01:02.086807

In Kane County, a measure expressing support for immigrant rights in Kane County and calling on the state and federal government to reform immigration procedures — but not banning immigration enforcement on county property — was brought forward by board member Myrna Molina and considered by the board’s Legislative Committee in late October.
For example, at the Kane County Board Executive Committee meeting last week, board member Leslie Juby said the resolution is reaffirming the county’s commitments to its residents, and that that is its job.
And board member Mohammad Iqbal said there were “so many defects” in the measure that was ultimately passed by the board.
But Kane County Board Chair Corinne Pierog said the proposal “doesn’t share values, it requests action.” mmorrow@chicagotribune.com","As President Donald Trump’s federal immigration crackdown in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs enters its third month, the Kane County Board on Monday gave final approval to a measure expressing support for immigrant rights in the county and calling on the state and federal government to prohibit immigration enforcement at sensitive locations and enact immigration reforms.

The board is also discussing a ban on civil immigration enforcement actions on county-owned property.

Since the Trump administration’s surge of immigration law enforcement in Chicago — dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz” — began in September, hundreds have been arrested, thousands have protested across Chicago and the suburbs and numerous cities and counties have considered or passed local legislation aiming to address the ongoing immigration crackdown.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson established Chicago city property as “ICE-free” zones in early October, and municipalities like Evanston, Waukegan, Carpentersville and Elgin have followed suit with similar measures. Cook, Will and Lake counties, too, have prohibited federal immigration enforcement actions on their property.

In Kane County, a measure expressing support for immigrant rights in Kane County and calling on the state and federal government to reform immigration procedures — but not banning immigration enforcement on county property — was brought forward by board member Myrna Molina and considered by the board’s Legislative Committee in late October.

It has since generated discussion among board members about what the resolution does and the county’s part in it.

For example, at the Kane County Board Executive Committee meeting last week, board member Leslie Juby said the resolution is reaffirming the county’s commitments to its residents, and that that is its job. She said she doesn’t understand why the county committing to providing services “in a fair, equitable and culturally responsive manner to all residents,” as the resolution states, “would be a point of contention for anyone.”

“We’re asking the state of Illinois and the federal government to do something, because we recognize that, as Kane County Board members, we do not have the purview to do that,” Juby said. “While I understand it looks like it’s symbolic only, we’re doing everything that we are allowed to do in our capacity.”

Board member Clifford Surges said the resolution “looks awfully much like a proclamation,” rather than an actionable request, and said the county’s proclamations have gotten “more and more political.”

Board member Michelle Gumz, on the other hand, said the resolution requests action of state and federal elected officials. And board member Mavis Bates said it was the job of the Legislative Committee to send directives to the legislature about the county’s priorities.

After ultimately being recommended by the Executive Committee last week, the matter came to the full board for final approval on Monday, where it again generated a mix of opinions among the board.

Board member David Young, for example, criticized the way the federal immigration crackdown is being talked about, saying that claiming federal agents “are literally ripping people out of their homes” is “putting a target on these agents that are just doing their job.”

“That rhetoric, I think, just has to stop,” Young said. “And this resolution actually does that. It actually goes ahead and, I think, puts a target … on the back of those ICE agents that are just doing their job.”

He also said that the current immigration enforcement actions going on are “being done based upon our Constitution,” and suggested that, under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which dictates that federal law takes priority over conflicting state laws, this resolution could open the county up to a lawsuit from the federal government.

Board member Jon Gripe took issue with what he said was the “condemnation of an entire group of law enforcement officers.” Gripe previously attempted to add an amendment to the measure expressing support for law enforcement officers, but it failed to get sufficient support from the Legislative Committee.

And board member Mohammad Iqbal said there were “so many defects” in the measure that was ultimately passed by the board.

Iqbal said the term “human dignity” in the measure is “ambiguous” and that, despite the title indicating “fair reform,” the resolution doesn’t propose reform in the county. He also criticized the resolution’s calling on the state of Illinois to enact reform because the federal government handles immigration enforcement, not states, and said that the resolution’s request to “ensure no person is detained or deported based on racial or ethnic profiling” is already in the law.

“The committee should re-look at it,” Iqbal said. “They’re putting too much into this resolution. If there’s only one thing they want to say, prohibit immigration enforcement in a sensitive location such as school, places of worship or community centers, that’s probably reasonable.”

A number of other board members spoke in favor of the measure.

Board member Sonia Garcia spoke about the fear she sees in her community about the recent immigration enforcement operations.

“I can’t go ahead and be quiet on this,” Garcia said.

And Gumz, too, indicated support for the resolution in light of the fear she says she sees in her district as the federal immigration crackdown continues.

“I watch it with my own eyes,” Gumz said. “To act is something that I have to do.”

And board member Vern Tepe suggested that expressing support for human rights is necessary in the country right now.

“It’s the way that they’re treated, and it’s the amount of hate that seems to be prevalent throughout our society on … both sides,” Tepe said. “And the only way to stop it is to stand up for human rights and to realize that we have to work and point out those inequities that happen.”

Board member Michael Linder said that the way the immigration crackdown is being carried out is “not even what was intended,” saying that the surge of enforcement had been meant to “remove the criminals.” He said the country still needs to address illegal immigration, but “it’s not addressed by being inhuman(e).”

And Juby again pointed out that, though the county can’t enact immigration reform, it can advocate for changes at the state and federal levels.

“The things that we’re asking for them to do are not things in our control, but things that we believe in,” she said. “We believe that we should be humane and that we should have comprehensive immigration … reforms. We believe in due process. We believe in keeping families together. We recognize that everybody who comes here has value and contributes in one way or another. We’re asking for you not to sweep them out of churches and hospitals and schools. That’s not hard.”

Several residents also spoke both in favor of and against the measure during the meeting’s public comment period.

Ultimately, the measure passed in a split vote, with board members Gary Daugherty, Gripe, Iqbal, Bill Lenert, Bill Roth, Rick Williams and Young voting against it, and Surges abstaining.

With that measure passed, the board is also beginning to consider an ordinance prohibiting federal immigration agents from using county-owned property for enforcement actions like staging or processing, much like the legislation local municipalities around Chicago and its suburbs have enacted in recent weeks.

At Monday’s meeting, Molina said the request “comes from a deep concern for our community,” and said the intention of the proposed ordinance is to “ensure that every family in Kane County feels safe, respected and welcome in the places we all share.”

Kane County State’s Attorney Jamie Mosser, at the meeting, said it is her job to provide legal advice to the county board, not to draft policies. She said she would provide her assessment of what’s constitutional and what’s not out of what other municipalities have done in their legislation as the county considers proceeding with the proposed ordinance.

“I’m not a policy decision-maker, nor am I the one who’s supposed to write policy for you,” Mosser said. “I am more than happy that, once an ordinance is given to us, to review it.”

The proposed ordinance’s text was not presented on Monday, but Molina said she has drafted an ordinance and is seeking review and feedback from the state’s attorney.

Linder pointed out that the ordinance may not forbid anything not already prohibited by the state’s Trust Act, which generally prohibits state and local law enforcement from getting involved in deportation efforts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal policing agencies dealing with immigration matters.

And Gripe said he wants the State’s Attorney’s Office to provide insight on the matter, and expressed concern about the possibility of a lawsuit from the federal government over such an ordinance.

Young said the matter should become a proclamation, rather than an ordinance, suggesting that would reduce the legal risk for the county. But Kane County Board Chair Corinne Pierog said the proposal “doesn’t share values, it requests action.”

I agree with Kurt Vonnegut, who said: Armistice Day has become Veterans Day.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) helicopters will undoubtedly be circling my neighborhood looking for roofers and landscapers this “Veterans Day,” just as they have been for weeks. In the U.S., you’re an easy mark when you have brown skin and your job demands that you labor out in the open.

My town, located just outside of Chicago, has been crawling with ICE agents or soldiers (the terms deserve to be used interchangeably) for weeks now. Recently, two moms, in the cold with their whistles, helped guard a crew working on a roof that was damaged by hail in a recent storm. The ICE agents/soldiers, dressed in full military kit, carrying semi-automatic weapons, and wearing ski masks to hide their identity, are patrolling in unmarked trucks — I think we all know how to spot them at this point.

These people remind me of the soldiers I patrolled with in Afghanistan, only the average ICE agent has less training than the average soldier. It seems like every neighborhood in the U.S. is now subject to an armed and potentially violent confrontation with federal troops. The U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan has come full circle.

Similar to the way that I terrorized Afghan villages during my time in the military following 9/11, ICE has been terrorizing my town. When I was in the U.S. Army Rangers, we’d target high school and college-age Afghans. Most of the time, these kids were simply walking down the street, minding their own business, when they became subject to a search, an intimidating interrogation, or abduction. After a while, Afghans would alert their neighbors anytime our caravan of trucks entered a town — sometimes they would use whistles. Villagers would quickly disappear and it then felt like we were rolling through a ghost town. This, in part, is life under occupation.

The Trump Regime’s Skyrocketing Domestic Occupying Forces

ICE training has been cut by five weeks to “surge” the number of troops: Training is now eight weeks long, down from 13 weeks. The Trump administration hopes to increase the number of ICE agents from 6,500 nationwide to 10,000 by the end of 2025. A signing bonus of $50,000 has reportedly drawn 150,000 people to apply for positions with ICE, as the agency uses white nationalist imagery to attract white supremacist recruits.

ICE agents/soldiers are occupying U.S. neighborhoods with some of the deadliest weapons in the world with only eight weeks of training and no comparable past experience required. According to a former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official interviewed by NBC News, “[DHS is] trying to push everyone through, and the vetting process is not what it should be.” Yet, even if the vetting were more rigorous and thorough, no amount of training could justify armed soldiers terrorizing our neighbors.

My Ranger unit in the Army had some of the best-trained soldiers in the world in it. Still, we lost a soldier every six months or so to an accidental discharge of a weapon. A first sergeant in my unit, who was considered an extremely competent soldier, accidentally shot his M-4 rifle inside a Blackhawk helicopter. The first sergeant lost his rank and was booted from the Rangers.

Pat Tillman, the former professional football player who joined the military after 9/11, was also in my unit. He was killed in an act of “friendly fire” and his death was covered up all the way up George W. Bush’s chain of command.

The vast majority of those killed in the U.S.’s “global war on terror” after 9/11 were noncombatants. “Collateral damage” is what they call it. But in reality, these deaths should be defined by what they are: gross recklessness with deadly weapons and a general disregard for human life. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world died at the hands of U.S. soldiers and their leaders. Even the most well-trained military units can’t be trusted to do the right thing. The “global war on terror” proved this.

So when I see ICE and militarized police carrying assault rifles or weapons of any kind, I’m reminded how naive and foolish it is to trust those armed by the U.S government. It is becoming increasingly clear that ICE agents — dressed and equipped like soldiers — should not be allowed anywhere near our neighborhoods, especially armed with assault weapons.

In October, Chicago resident Miramar Martinez was shot five times by a Border Patrol agent here in Chicago. The yet-to-be-publicly-named masked agent fled to Maine immediately after the shooting. According to the local FOX news station, the masked man, moments before opening fire, aimed an assault rifle at Miramar and shouted: “Do something, b—h.”

Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez was shot and killed by an ICE agent/soldier in another suburb in Chicago in September.

In only the past few weeks we have seen far too many incidents that prove how dangerous this masked band of vigilantes is.

Meanwhile, Trump is seeking to make the National Guard complicit in this occupation: So far he has deployed troops to Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles,; Chicago; Portland, Oregon; and Memphis, Tennessee. He is threatening to deploy even more troops to Baltimore, New York, New Orleans, Oakland, San Francisco, and St. Louis. The Posse Comitatus Act prevents the National Guard from being deployed in a law enforcement capacity. But as Democracy Docket has documented, this 150-year-old law hasn’t stopped Trump, who has already been reprimanded by a federal judge who found that his administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act by “using troops to directly protect federal agents carrying out arrests, setting up perimeters and road blockades for law enforcement operations and, on at least two occasions, detained civilians.”

Morale is collapsing in the National Guard. Internal documents show that the Army is aware that their mission is unpopular; a snapshot from September found that only 2 percent of social media postings analyzed had a positive view of the National Guard’s deployment to Washington, D.C., while more than 53 percent of posts cast Trump’s orders negatively. This provides an opening to anyone hoping to convince National Guard members to lay their weapons down and resist Trump’s demands. These soldiers have a moral responsibility to refuse illegal orders. It’s our duty to remind them of this fact — something to consider the next time you’re at a protest or have an opportunity to talk to an active-duty guard member.

Veterans’ groups such as About Face, and Veterans for Peace are doing a phenomenal job encouraging National Guard members to resist Trump. The “Vets Say No” protests here in Chicago and other cities have drawn thousands to hear their message of resistance. These groups are reminding soldiers that they are not alone, that the U.S. has a proud tradition of refusing orders, and that courage and honor sometimes involves saying no to commanding officers.

Rejecting “Hero” Worship

In speaking with immigrants in my neighborhood, I know they are experiencing a similar fear to that felt by the Afghans I patrolled. I signed up for the military in February of 2002 thinking I would make the U.S. safer by helping to protect it from another 9/11-style attack. I learned that most of what the U.S. was doing in places like Afghanistan was making the world a more dangerous place: both by occupying territory where it didn’t belong, and by killing so many noncombatants — innocent civilians. Further, it was predictable that the uncritical hero worship of soldiers that we saw after 9/11 would breed a dangerous level of comfort with those who carried weapons on behalf of the U.S. government.

I grow more angry and frustrated with each passing “Veterans Day” — this is my 20th since leaving the U.S. Army Rangers as a conscientious objector — because it gets clearer and clearer that “Veterans Day” is nothing more than an attempt to bury the oppressive and deadly agenda of the U.S. ruling class by celebrating our “heroes.” Heroes don’t kill innocent civilians, prey on the marginalized, or participate in imperialist missions designed only to make rich people richer, do they? If you are carrying a weapon on behalf of the federal government in 2025, you are the opposite of a hero, in spite of your best intentions.

I never call it “Veterans Day.” I call it Armistice Day as we did in the years following World War I. Armistice Day was meant to celebrate an end to war, as opposed to Veterans Day, which seems intent on glorifying war. I agree with Kurt Vonnegut, who said:

Armistice Day has become Veterans Day. Armistice Day was sacred. Veterans Day is not. So I will throw Veterans Day over my shoulder. Armistice Day I will keep. I don’t want to throw away any sacred things.

But in truth this day is more accurately described as “Occupiers Day” — a term that properly describes the threat that our communities inside and the U.S. face from all those who carry a weapon on behalf of the U.S. government.

Collectively, let’s see this day as an opportunity to maintain and accelerate the necessary pushback required to ward off the imperial mindset that has infected far too many in this country. No one is “illegal,” and only through abolishing ICE will we find safety for communities. We need to stop celebrating occupiers — both at home and abroad.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2241666954-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 17:01:07.227240

WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that on November 4 in Los Angeles, CA, ICE officers arrested Victoria Sorocean, an illegal alien from Moldova wanted in her home country for murder committed with premeditation and exceptional cruelty.

In September 2013, Sorocean and an accomplice were convicted of intentional murder, and she was sentenced to 17 years in prison. Sorocean and an accomplice tortured their victim in an apartment in Chisinau, Moldova. They beat the victim with a stick and electrical cable before throwing the victim out a ninth-floor window.

In an attempt to evade a 17-year prison sentence, Sorocean fled to the United States. Under the first Trump Administration, ICE arrested her on January 10, 2020. Following her arrest, Sorocean engaged in various legal tactics to avoid removal, including filing multiple appeals with the Board of Immigration Appeals and seeking asylum.

In 2022, Sorocean was released back into the country under the Biden administration.

“It shocks the conscience that the Biden Administration released into America a cruel, violent illegal alien who tortured a human being, beat them with an electrical cable and a stick, and then threw her victim from a ninth-floor window,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “These are the types of barbaric criminal illegal aliens ICE is targeting every single day. 70% of all ICE arrests are of illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. This does not even include foreign fugitives like this convicted murderer. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, the world’s criminals are no longer welcome in the U.S.”

This case highlights the failures of the previous administration which allowed millions of illegal aliens, including violent criminals and murderers like Sorocean, to roam free in American neighborhoods.

ICE officers arrested Sorocean on November 4, 2025, and she will remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

Trump’s lawyers argued in a lengthy filing with the high court that allegations leading to the $5m verdict were “propped up” by a “series of indefensible evidentiary rulings” that allowed Carroll’s lawyers to present “highly inflammatory propensity evidence” against him.

Carroll, a longtime advice columnist and former TV talkshow host, testified at a 2023 trial that Trump turned a friendly encounter in spring 1996 into a violent attack in the dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury retailer across the street from Trump Tower.

The jury also found Trump liable for defaming Carroll when he made comments in October 2022 denying her allegation.

Trump’s lawyers, led by Justin D Smith, a St Louis, Missouri-based attorney, , called Carroll’s claims a “politically motivated hoax”.

They accused the trial judge, Lewis A Kaplan, of warping federal evidence rules to bolster Carroll’s “implausible, unsubstantiated assertions”. They said by upholding the verdict, the second US circuit court of appeals was in conflict with other federal appeals courts on how such rules should be applied.

“President Trump has clearly and consistently denied that this supposed incident ever occurred,” Smith and his co-counsel wrote. “No physical or DNA evidence corroborates Carroll’s story. There were no eyewitnesses, no video evidence, and no police report or investigation.”

A message seeking comment was left with Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan.

In September, when Trump’s lawyers first indicated they would appeal to the supreme court, she said: “We do not believe that President Trump will be able to present any legal issues in the Carroll cases that merit review by the United States supreme court.”

A spokesperson for Trump’s legal team said in a statement the supreme court appeal was part of the president’s crusade against “Liberal Lawfare”.

“The American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes,” the statement said.

A three-judge appellate panel upheld the verdict in December 2024, rejecting Trump’s claims Judge Kaplan’s decisions spoiled the trial, including by allowing two other Trump sexual abuse accusers to testify. The women said Trump committed similar acts against them in the 1970s and in 2005. Trump denied all three women’s allegations.

In June, second circuit judges denied Trump’s petition for the full appellate court to take up the case. That left Trump with two options: accept the result and allow Carroll to collect the judgment, which he’d previously paid into escrow, or fight on in supreme court, whose conservative majority – including three of his own appointees – could be more open to considering his challenge.

Trump skipped the 2023 trial but testified briefly at a follow-up defamation trial last year that ended with a jury ordering him to pay Carroll an additional $83.3m. The second trial resulted from comments Trump made in 2019 after Carroll first made the accusations publicly in a memoir.

Kaplan presided over both trials and instructed the second jury to accept the first jury’s finding that Trump had sexually abused Carroll. Kaplan and Carroll’s lawyer, Kaplan, are not related.

In their supreme court filing, Trump’s lawyers said Kaplan compounded his “significant evidentiary errors” at first trial by “improperly preventing” Trump from contesting the first jury’s finding that he had sexually abused Carroll, leading to an “unjust judgment of $83.3m.”

The second circuit upheld that verdict on 8 September, with a three-judge panel calling the jury’s damages awards “fair and reasonable”. Trump has since asked the full appellate court to hear arguments and reconsider the ruling.

Trump has had recent success fending off costly civil judgments. In August, a New York appeals court threw out Trump’s staggering penalty in a state civil fraud lawsuit.

Last month, the Harris County Commissioners Court approved allocation of over $1 million for the county’s Immigrant Legal Services Fund. The program provides free legal representation to eligible immigrants who are in detention or facing the threat of deportation. It also provides counsel to children under 17 in Harris County who were previously detained in ORR shelters.

""We must stop the left-wing radicals who are robbing Texans to prevent illegals from being deported by the Trump Administration,” Paxton said in a statement. “Beyond just being blatantly unconstitutional, this is evil and wicked.""

The program was first proposed by County Judge Lina Hidalgo in 2020, in part, to improve due process in the federal immigration system, Houston Public Media reported.

“The goal is to provide attorneys for immigrants to be able to pursue their case,” Hidalgo said then. “If it turns out their case has no merit, and they're not to stay, that's fine. But they should have a shot at a fair process, and they can’t possibly navigate the system, a complicated, confusing system, without the legal support.”

The program was renewed in a 4-1 vote, with Tom Ramsey, the only Republican on the court, voting against it.

The money will be distributed to several nonprofit organizations, including BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, and Justice for All Immigrants. The funding will last through Dec. 31, 2026.

Paxton says the Texas Constitution prohibits governmental entities like Harris County from misusing public funds by giving gifts or conferring private benefits to individuals and groups ""that do not serve a legitimate public end.""

We reached out to Harris County for comment. A spokesperson said they are aware of the lawsuit and will release a response later today.

This is the latest in a flurry of lawsuits by Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate against incumbent John Cornyn and U.S Rep. Wesley Hunt, both fellow Republicans.

Bill Comes as Masked, Unidentifiable ICE Agents Use Tear Gas and Pepper Balls Against Non-Violent Journalists, Protestors, and Citizens

Read the Bill Here(link is external)

Washington, DC – Representatives Dan Goldman (NY-10), Scott Peters (CA-50), and Raja Krishnamoorthi (IL-8) introduced the Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act, which would restrict federal immigration enforcement agents’ use of crowd munitions like tear gas, align immigration enforcement with the heightened DOJ standards on use of force, and require the use of body cameras and strictly limiting the use of masks.

Under President Trump, federal agents have been captured using excessive force against non-violent American citizens(link is external), immigrants(link is external), journalists(link is external), protesters(link is external), priests(link is external), and others. There has been a significant increase in the careless use of harmful equipment like flash bangs(link is external), pepper balls(link is external), and tear gas(link is external). During a recent 60 Minutes interview,(link is external) President Trump was asked about violent examples of immigration enforcement and stated that immigration raids have “not gone far enough.”

""The images we’ve seen out of New York, California, and Chicago are the result of a broken system that allows militarized immigration agents to abuse our neighbors and evade any form of accountability,” Congressman Dan Goldman said. “Federal agents should never be storming peaceful communities with tear gas and flash bangs. The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act will end these abuses by setting clear limits on force, banning dangerous crowd munitions, and requiring body cameras and identifiable uniforms. No one should fear masked agents without badges on the streets of our cities and neighborhoods. This bill restores transparency, accountability, and the basic principle that law enforcement must protect the people, not attack them.”

Congressman Scott Peters said, “In May, Federal agents stormed into Buona Forchetta, a small, neighborhood restaurant that was filled with families. They threw the owner against the wall, handcuffed all employees, and used flash-bang grenades on concerned bystanders outside the restaurant. Why terrorize law-abiding, hardworking people? That makes no one safer; it makes Americans less safe. Immigration enforcement should not be conducted by masked, unidentified agents using unchecked force and aggressively deploying tear gas, pepper balls, and flash bangs. We must curb excessive force and make it easier to identify officers acting improperly, while ensuring Federal law enforcement can still apprehend those who pose a genuine threat to public safety and nationalsecurity.”

Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said, ""ICE, CBP, and DHS agents must be held to the same constitutional standards as every other law enforcement officer. Yet each day of the Trump Administration's ‘Operation Midway Blitz’ brings a new story of excessive force being used in Chicago and its suburbs—from a faith leader shot with a pepperball while praying outside Broadview to a reporter struck while documenting ICE protests to my own constituents being terrorized for performing civilian oversight over DHS's actions. This unchecked aggression against civilians must stop. Our Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act restores transparency and safeguards both the public and law enforcement by ensuring clear standards, mandatory body cameras, and a fundamental respect for basic rights.”

Angelica Salas, Executive Director, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) said, ""For months now, we all have seen how encounters with immigration enforcement mean chaos, violence, and trauma, regardless of immigration status. The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act brings humanity and transparency into those moments. It limits the use of militarized force and ensures that agents are accountable to the communities in which they operate. Every family deserves to feel safe. Every life deserves dignity.”

Deborah Weinstein, Executive Director, Coalition on Human Needs said, ""Masked agents endangering our people with unnecessary force is an affront to the principles of American democracy. The Coalition on Human Needs is proud to endorse the Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act and stands with Rep. Peters and co-sponsors in requiring accountability and careful restrictions on federal immigration officials' use of force.""

Nick Wilson, Senior Director of Gun Violence Prevention Policy at the Center for American Progress said, “The Trump administration’s reckless and indiscriminate immigration enforcement actions have stoked fear in communities across the country. We welcome the introduction of the Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act, which seeks to ensure the safety of our communities and officers by implementing common sense standards to improve transparency and accountability in enforcement actions. Law enforcement should protect the public, not trample on people’s rights and put Americans at risk. This bill offers urgently needed guardrails and accountability mechanisms that ensure that federal law enforcement better protects and promotes the rights and safety of communities.”

Sarah Pierce, Director of Social Policy at Third Way, said, ""As ICE under President Trump pursues increasingly extreme actions against both immigrants and U.S. citizens, lawmakers must act to protect their constituents and uphold public safety. The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act does exactly that—ensuring federal officers have the tools they need to safeguard the public and themselves, without undermining the security of the communities they are supposed to serve. Its training, oversight, and proportionality requirements are especially critical as ICE expands its workforce through rushed recruitment and abbreviated onboarding. Immigration enforcement should strengthen public safety and the integrity of our immigration system—but never at the expense of the public's security.""

The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act:

Prevents enforcement personnel from being equipped with tear gas, pepper balls, and flash bangs, wearing masks, and using non-identifying uniforms.

Aligns immigration enforcement with current DOJ standards on force, allowing it to be used only when “no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative appears to exist.

Implements additional requirements that personnel exercise force proportionally, use de-escalation techniques, and minimize risk to third persons.

Requires mandatory use of body and vehicle cameras for immigration enforcement.

Reinforces protections against force while engaging lawfully in protected First Amendment activities, such as protesting, reporting, and assembling.

Supports local law enforcement by requiring that they are pre-notified of immigration operations in their jurisdiction and prohibiting Federal immigration enforcement from wearing uniforms with the word “police” to limit public confusion.

Creates training requirements for de-escalation and abiding by constitutional protections.

The president’s lawyer sent the threat to the BBC over the way a documentary edited his Jan. 6, 2021, speech before a mob of his followers stormed the U.S. Capitol.

Trump’s history of suing news media companies — sometimes winning multimillion-dollar settlements — is part of a long-running grievance against the industry he describes as “fake news” that has often focused a critical eye on his actions.

But Trump faces fundamental challenges to getting a case to court, never mind taking it to trial. He would also have to deal with the harsh glare of publicity around his provocative pep talk the day Congress was voting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.

“If he sues, he opens a Pandora’s box and inside is every damning quote he’s ever uttered about the ‘steal,’” said attorney Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer who practices in the U.S. and U.K.

The BBC documentary

The BBC’s “Panorama” series aired the hourlong documentary titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

The third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.

BBC Chairman Samir Shah apologized Monday for the misleading edit that he said gave “the impression of a direct call for violent action.”

Director-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing.

From to letter to lawsuit

A lawsuit in England is unlikely because the one-year deadline to bring one expired two weeks ago, experts said. If successful in overcoming that barrier, libel awards in the High Court rarely exceed 100,000 pounds ($132,000), experts said.

Trump could still bring a defamation claim in several U.S. states, and his lawyer cited Florida law in a letter to the BBC.

Filing a lawsuit and demanding money is one thing, but prevailing in court is much different. To succeed, Trump would have to clear many hurdles to get a case before a jury.

Before any of that could happen, Trump faces a more fundamental challenge: The BBC program was not aired in the U.S., and the BBC’s streaming service is also not available there. Americans could not have thought less of him because of a program they could not watch, Stephens said.

“The other ticklish problem for Trump’s lawyer was that Trump’s reputation was already pretty battered after Jan. 6,” he said. “Alleging ‘Panorama’ caused additional harm when your reputation is already in tatters ... is a tough sell.”

Trump was impeached on a charge of inciting insurrection over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by some of his supporters, though he was acquitted by the Senate.

The demands

Trump’s lawyer Alejandro Brito threatened the BBC with a defamation lawsuit for “no less than” $1 billion. The letter spelled out the figure and used all nine zeros in numeric form.

The letter demanded an apology to the president and a “full and fair” retraction of the documentary along with other “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements” about Trump.

It also said the president should be “appropriately” compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”

The letter cites Florida’s defamation statute that requires a letter be sent to news organizations five days before any lawsuit can be filed.

If the BBC does not comply with the demands by 5 p.m. EST Friday, then Trump will enforce his legal rights, the letter said.

“The BBC is on notice,” it said.

Other media lawsuits

While many legal experts have dismissed the president’s claims against the media as having little chance of success, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies.

In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.

That settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.

Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her. Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to throw out that finding.

Litigation threat could leverage payout

London lawyer David Allen Green dismissed the litigation letter for failing to spell out any actual harm Trump suffered. But he said Trump’s willingness to use lawsuits as a form of deal-making could leverage a payout because the edit was indefensible.

“Putting aside the theatrics of a bombastic letter with its senseless $1 billion claim, there is a power play here which Trump has done many times before,” Green said on The Law and Policy Blog. “The real mistake of the BBC (and the production company) was opening itself up to such a play of power.”

Stephens said if Trump were somehow to win billions from the BBC, it could crush the news organization that is mostly funded through a fee charged to all television owners in the U.K.

But he said that outcome was unlikely and the broadcaster should stand its ground. He recommended Trump take the public relations win and avoid the damage from revisiting the Jan. 6 events that would be dredged up at trial.

He said Trump was due an apology, which Shah offered, for the BBC not upholding high journalistic standards.

“The question is, ‘Did it cause harm in people’s minds?’” he said. “Because he was elected afterwards, it doesn’t appear it did.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/771f865/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4860+0+450/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F11%2Fd9%2F0abb62599b4df6f5ad64fa248822%2F2c9dc88366564b39b482e6ddf2cb637f,N,,2025-11-11 15:02:52.800796

As a federal judge considered a use of force injunction, which was ultimately granted, Bovino testified to CBP agents' actions.

He defended their use of force.

The Trump administration on Monday filed an emergency request asking the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to immediately pause the preliminary injunction on federal immigration agents' use of force in the Chicago area, while it considers their appeal, saying the order violates the separation of powers.

District Judge Sara Ellis' order prohibits federal agents from ""using riot control weapons"" against journalists, demonstrators and religious practitioners without first issuing warnings unless necessary to stop immediate threats of physical harms to agents or others.

Ellis said the government lied under oath, saying federal agents' conduct in the Chicagoland area shows no signs of stopping.

She also disputed statements made during Bovino's own recorded deposition.

Ellis called Bovino out for at least three instances in which his deposition contradicted the video evidence, including the Little Village incident on Oct. 23 when Bovino publicly said he had thrown a tear gas canister at protesters after being hit by a rock in the head. He later admitted, under oath, he had thrown it before.

It is worth noting that while the 7th Circuit did block Ellis' attempt to have Bovino meet with her daily, they did uphold the temporary restraining order that this order replaces. If it survives on appeal, the preliminary injunction will remain in effect until a trial on this case can be held.

Faith leaders on Tuesday blocked 26th Street, under the arch in Little Village, with a prayer service and makeshift altar.

Volunteers were standing by after reports that federal agents would be back in Little Village Tuesday.

None had been seen as of about 11 a.m.

They're putting pressure on federal agents, they say, and showing organized resistance, together with the faith community.

""Only God has the right to destroy families. Your hate and racism has no place in the United States of America because we are American families, and we want to be treated with respect and dignity,"" said Pastor Julie Contreras, with United Giving Hope.

""They could bring 1,000 agents; we'll bring out 10,000 people to the streets. We don't have guns; we don't have nothing but whistles. And this is how we're going to fight this administration,"" Little Village Community Council President Baltazar Enriquez said.

Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement:

""On the same day Bovino is reportedly leaving Chicago, Trump is yet again threatening to send military troops into an American city against our own citizens. This doesn't mark an end to federal overreach - it marks an expansion. Illinois is remaining clear-eyed that Donald Trump's power-grabbing efforts to undermine American rights and freedoms are continuing with full force. This has never been about improving immigration enforcement or public safety - this is about normalizing military tanks and armed troops on American streets.

""Chicago IS the nation's best big city for the ninth year in a row because of its growing economy, hardworking people, and neighbors who take care of each other and welcome visitors from every corner of the globe with unmatched warmth and pride. No lies or TruthSocial posts will change that.

""And the only real estate vacancy Trump should be worried about continues to be the one at Trump Tower.""

Price, Aditya Desai, Henry Ishitani",,,,,https://harvardlawreview.org/blog/2025/11/perttu-v-richards/,"And on the spectrum of party presentation violations, Richards barely registers — making the decision a minor deviation from a concededly flexible rule.
Perttu v. Richards began when Kyle Brandon Richards and two other incarcerated plaintiffs sued prison manager Thomas Perttu over a year’s worth of “prolific and repetitive sexual abuse.” Their handwritten complaint, filed without counsel, alleged a litany of constitutional violations.
According to Richards, Perttu approached him one morning and said, “Do what the fuck I tell you to do.
Fuck who I tell you to fuck.” When Richards refused, Perttu threatened to kill him.
Before Richards, the Court’s most extended treatment of the party presentation principle occurred in the 2020 decision United States v. Sineneng-Smith.","“In our adversarial system of adjudication, we follow the principle of party presentation.” The principle dictates that courts decide only the questions presented by the parties before them and pass upon only those arguments the parties make. Last Term, in Perttu v. Richards, the Supreme Court held 5–4 that in cases covered by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), a party has a right to a jury trial on administrative exhaustion when the question of exhaustion is intertwined with the merits of their claim. Hanging over the Court’s split on the PLRA’s meaning was a secondary dispute about the rule of party presentation. Four dissenting Justices accused the majority of violating the rule by resolving the case on grounds the parties had never raised. But Richards simply represents the Court’s longstanding practice of treating party presentation as a rather pliant principle. And on the spectrum of party presentation violations, Richards barely registers — making the decision a minor deviation from a concededly flexible rule.

Perttu v. Richards began when Kyle Brandon Richards and two other incarcerated plaintiffs sued prison manager Thomas Perttu over a year’s worth of “prolific and repetitive sexual abuse.” Their handwritten complaint, filed without counsel, alleged a litany of constitutional violations. According to Richards, Perttu approached him one morning and said, “Do what the fuck I tell you to do. Fuck who I tell you to fuck.” When Richards refused, Perttu threatened to kill him. On a separate occasion, Perttu warned that he could keep Richards in prison “forever,” so “[j]ust do what I ask you to.” Another time, Perttu demanded: “Come on bitch boy, take another piss for me. Piss for me boy, and Ill [sic] let you go home.”

Richards sought relief through the prison complaint system, submitting at least a dozen grievances under the Prison Rape Elimination Act. While some were processed, any grievances describing sexual abuse “never got processed and were destroyed.” Perttu reportedly said he was “not going to let [Richards] file any sexual assault grievances.” On several occasions, Perttu tore up the grievance forms and promised to kill the plaintiffs if they submitted any more.

So Richards and his co-plaintiffs brought a Section 1983 suit in federal court. In addition to describing Perttu’s interference with the prison grievance procedure, they claimed that the facility had retaliated against them by placing them in solitary confinement, thereby violating the First Amendment. Perttu moved for summary judgment on the basis “that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust available grievance procedures as required by the PLRA.” The court sided with Perttu and dismissed the case for failure to exhaust. Richards, still acting pro se and now the sole plaintiff, appealed.

The Sixth Circuit appointed counsel and reversed. The panel recognized that the PLRA required incarcerated plaintiffs to exhaust available administrative remedies before filing suit. But remedies had to be available. If “prison administrators [had] thwart[ed] inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation,” the exhaustion requirement didn’t apply. Whether exhaustion precluded Richards’s suit was therefore bound up with the merits of his First Amendment retaliation claim, since both turned on the same factual question: Had Perttu blocked Richards from filing his grievances? The judge had erred by deciding that question himself. “[T]he Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial when the resolution of the exhaustion issue under the PLRA would also resolve a genuine dispute of material fact regarding the merits of the plaintiff’s substantive case.”

The Supreme Court affirmed on a 5–4 vote, but not because the Seventh Amendment demanded it. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts ducked the constitutional question and opted for “a construction of the statute . . . by which the [constitutional] question may be avoided.” As a statutory matter, the Court held that “parties have a right to a jury trial on PLRA exhaustion when that issue is intertwined with the merits of a claim that falls under the Seventh Amendment.” A 2007 decision by the Chief Justice, Jones v. Bock, had taken up whether PLRA exhaustion was an affirmative defense or a mandatory element of a plaintiff’s complaint. Jones had landed on the former because the PLRA’s “silen[ce] on the issue” represented “strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed,” and exhaustion was usually an affirmative defense. That logic applied equally here. Because the PLRA was “‘silent on the issue’ whether judges or juries should resolve factual disputes related to exhaustion,” it incorporated the settled practice that when factual disputes are intertwined with the merits of a claim — thus triggering the Seventh Amendment — the whole bundle goes to the jury, including issues (like exhaustion) a judge would ordinarily decide on her own.

Justice Barrett dissented, joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh. Justice Barrett first recognized the difficulty of identifying a founding-era analogue to the defense of exhaustion given that the defense arose “long after the founding.” Happily, Richards did not require answering that particular question, since the case concerned the unique circumstance of a factual dispute about exhaustion intertwined with the merits of the claim. Unhappily, in avoiding the Seventh Amendment question, the majority relied upon a “statutory theory” “not present[ed]” by either party in the Supreme Court or any court below. Resolving the case on that basis violated “party-presentation principles,” under which the Court generally “refuse[d] to consider arguments that the parties failed to make before” it and that “the court of appeals did not analyze first.” To make matters worse, the statutory argument was incorrect. Whereas the majority guaranteed Richards a jury trial on account of the PLRA’s silence, Justice Barrett “understood silence to mean . . . that Congress did not affirmatively confer such a right.”

The disagreement between the Justices represents more than a difference in statutory interpretation. By accusing the majority of reaching out to decide a case on grounds that no party advocated, the dissent highlighted a vexed question of judicial practice: party presentation principles in the United States Supreme Court. Time and again, the Court has emphasized that litigants, through their counsel, “know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and argument entitling them to relief.” As a result, the Court “rel[ies] on the parties to frame the issues for decision” while acting as a “neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.” Fair enough. But in practice, the Supreme Court has not exactly followed its own instruction — suggesting that party presentation is more of a guiding principle than an absolute rule.

Before Richards, the Court’s most extended treatment of the party presentation principle occurred in the 2020 decision United States v. Sineneng-Smith. There, the Court reversed a Ninth Circuit judgment on account of the circuit court’s “takeover of the appeal.” After briefing and oral argument, the Ninth Circuit had ordered further briefing by court-appointed amici on three additional questions the court wanted answers to. It then reversed the district court’s judgment on the basis of amici’s responses — not arguments made by the defendant herself. The Court found this insupportable. While “a court is not hidebound by the precise arguments of counsel, [] the Ninth Circuit’s radical transformation of this case [went] well beyond the pale.”

All that makes Sineneng-Smith seem like a straightforward confirmation of the fact that party presentation limits courts’ ability to look beyond the parties’ arguments. Yet Sineneng-Smith itself was a bit of a dodge. The Court had granted certiorari on the question of whether a federal statute criminalizing the encouragement of unlawful immigration for profit violated the First Amendment. Its resolution of that question was “hotly anticipated.” But the Court never reached the First Amendment issue. Instead, it disposed of the case in a relatively sparse opinion by resting entirely on the party presentation principle.

Do as I say, not as I do. As Judge Eric D. Miller observed, by deciding the case this way, the Court itself bent the rule. In its opening brief urging reversal, all the United States had said on the issue of party presentation boiled down to a short paragraph at the tail end of the document, noting that “[i]n reaching out to address this issue, the Ninth Circuit . . . deviated from . . . the normal course of party-driven litigation.” The government “did not elaborate on that objection, let alone advance it as a basis for reversal.” Both parties devoted their briefing to the First Amendment issue. While chastising the court of appeals for breaking from the principle of party presentation, the Court took a detour of its own.

Small wonder Sineneng-Smith described “[t]he party presentation principle [as] supple, not ironclad.” And in a footnote, the Court self-consciously appended an addendum of cases from 2015–20 where it had “called for supplemental briefing or appointed amicus curiae,” including “to present argument in support of the judgment below when a prevailing party has declined to defend the lower court’s decision or an aspect of it.” None of the cases, the Court insisted, bore “any resemblance to the redirection ordered by the Ninth Circuit panel in” Sineneng-Smith. But why not? “While the Court seems completely confident of its authority to appoint such amici, it provides no explanation for the practice.” Maybe the difference lies between appointing amici to defend the lower court’s decision versus arguments never articulated by the parties themselves. Perhaps the former approach takes the issues as they arrive for review, while the latter veers too far into naked judicial activism. Less charitably, “perhaps the Court doth protest too much; the length of the list is enough to make one suspect that the Court has been less than scrupulous in its adherence to the principles it articulated.”

Turn the clock back a little further, and the list will only grow. Professor Amanda Frost has noted that “some of the Supreme Court’s landmark cases were decided on grounds that were never raised by the parties.” This includes Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, where “neither the petitioner nor the respondent took issue with Swift v. Tyson’s holding that federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction could create federal common law”; Washington v. Davis, where the defendants agreed that plaintiffs could prove an equal protection violation without pleading discriminatory animus — only for the Court to disregard the concession and hold that plaintiffs could not; and Dickerson v. United States, where “both the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court questioned whether a federal statute . . . [could] displac[e] the Court’s ruling in Miranda v. Arizona, even though neither party relied on that statute.”

Recall the possibility that appointing amici to support an undefended judgment might be permissible, but not to brief arguments the parties never raised below. Dickerson complicates that distinction. The federal statute in question, 18 U.S.C. § 3501, sought to overturn Miranda’s reticulated warnings framework by allowing confessions to be admitted whenever voluntarily given. “Because no party to the underlying litigation argued in favor of § 3501’s constitutionality in this Court,” the Court explained in a footnote, it had “invited Professor Paul Cassell to assist [its] deliberations by arguing in support of the judgment below.” Yet the statute had gone undefended even in the court of appeals. The Fourth Circuit explicitly recognized that “the applicability of § 3501 was not briefed by the Government,” and that the Department of Justice had “actually prohibit[ed] the U.S. Attorney’s Office from briefing the issue.” It was the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest group, which had presented the § 3501 argument in an amicus brief. A panel majority saw fit to press on with the § 3501 analysis, over a dissent which strenuously disagreed. In the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist’s majority opinion made no mention of the problem of potentially violating party presentation. All the airtime party presentation got was the single-sentence footnote.

By playing fast and loose with the party presentation principle, Dickerson resembles another Fourth Amendment decision rendered almost forty years earlier — one that hadn’t been litigated as a Fourth Amendment case at all. In Mapp v. Ohio, a woman convicted for possessing obscene materials challenged her conviction under the First Amendment. A majority of Justices voted to reverse her conviction, and in so doing issued a watershed decision incorporating the exclusionary rule against the states. No party had urged that outcome. And the Court had to overturn one of its prior decisions, Wolf v. Colorado, to get there. As the Court recognized in a footnote (by now a familiar move), Mapp herself “did not insist that Wolf be overruled”; indeed, Mapp’s counsel “expressly disavowed” that request in oral argument. But a brief by “amicus curiae [the ACLU] . . . did urge the Court to overrule Wolf” — in a single three-sentence paragraph. That was sufficient. Dissenting, Justice Harlan chastised the majority for “simply ‘reach[ing] out’ to overrule Wolf” when Mapp’s brief had “not even cite[d] the case.” More than six decades later, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Barrett’s dueling opinions reprised in Richards this very old debate.

Given Dickerson, Mapp, and Sineneng-Smith, the majority’s move in Richards is not so radical. Yet even on its own terms, the Court’s statutory analysis was not a major departure from the arguments the parties had made. Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged Justice Barrett’s critique but contended that “the statutory question ha[d] been fully briefed by amici and involves the same precedents relied on by the parties.” The Court thus appeared to concede that the dispositive statutory argument had been made by amici (a group of law professors), not the parties themselves. It didn’t need to. Richards’s merits brief had mentioned the “usual practice” no fewer than seven times. For instance, he had argued that under Beacon Theaters, Inc. v. Westover, “juries decide all factual questions necessary to resolve the merits of a legal claim, even when some of those questions may overlap with issues a judge could otherwise decide,” “and there [was] no indication that Congress intended to depart from” this “usual practice” — meaning that the PLRA incorporated it.

It is true that Richards did not explicitly urge the Court to avoid the constitutional holding and rely on a statutory rationale. But in this context, the distance between a statutory and constitutional ruling is smaller than it first appears. The “usual practice” at the time of the PLRA’s enactment had the Seventh Amendment baked in: Courts tried legal claims before equitable ones, or declined to resolve jurisdictional issues that would effectively decide the merits, because that was what the Seventh Amendment demanded. In the end, the distinction that makes a difference might boil down to the Court’s decision to “express no view [] on whether Congress could have required otherwise in the PLRA without violating a party’s Seventh Amendment right.” Said another way, because Richards is not a constitutional decision, Congress may overrule it.

Why does the Court stray from the supposedly fundamental principle of party presentation more often than the Justices seem willing to admit?

At a high level, the debate over party presentation echoes the longstanding competition between two models of judicial review: (1) law declaration — which would favor a loose party presentation principle — and (2) dispute resolution — which would command a strict rule. Advocates for the former model warn that parties cannot be allowed to “completely control the judiciary’s statements of law . . . lest they undermine the federal courts’ role to independently ascertain the meaning of legal texts for the benefit of all.” Critics retort that since courts exist for the very purpose of dispute resolution, the parties alone should decide “both the legal and factual claims relevant to their dispute.” Yet in the end, most agree that the American judicial system contains features of both approaches; its “choice among these models is ‘all of the above.’”

Consistent with this blended approach, the Court’s departures from party presentation have varied in degree. Resolving a case on grounds not wildly dissimilar from the parties’ positions (as in Richards) tilts only weakly toward a law declaration model. By contrast, basing an opinion on an argument expressly disavowed by petitioner’s counsel (as in Mapp) reflects a far more muscular exercise of judicial agenda control. The practice of appointing amici to argue an undefended judgment sits between the two poles. Doing so echoes law declaration in that the Court refuses to let one side’s concession constrain its ability to say what the law is. But appointing amici might also be understood as guardrail on freewheeling law declaration by forcing “adversary presentation as an aid to the accurate determination of factual and legal issues.” Finally, the Court’s habit of formulating entirely new questions presented indicates a certain fondness for law declaration. But at least the parties will themselves brief the additional question; at least they have notice of a potential basis for the Court’s eventual disposition.

Why should the Court be so free to deviate from party presentation when, as Sineneng-Smith indicates, lower federal courts are not? Nearly thirty years ago, Judge Laurence Silberman posited that the Justices did not wish “to restrict their own ability to reach out to issues not presented in cases brought to the Court, nor . . . justify that practice by openly acknowledging the Supreme Court as not subject to normal judicial constraints.” He did not think this was a good thing. But as a structural matter, the Supreme Court may face unique pressures to get the law “right” regardless of what the parties do. Unlike lower court decisions, which are precedential only within their respective jurisdictions, the Supreme Court’s holdings bind the nation, making it especially important for the Court to reach the right result. Moreover, a circuit court panel can choose to issue an unpublished opinion tying only the parties to the consequences of their litigation choices. The Supreme Court cannot.

Moreover, the Court’s turn towards law declaration (and attendant departures from party presentation) may reflect its increasingly outsized role in resolving national disputes. Perttu is a win for a relatively slim class of incarcerated litigants, but party presentation has taken a beating in more high-profile cases too. For instance, the Court recently ordered supplemental briefing on an issue raised by a law professor as amici in litigation challenging the National Guard’s deployment in Illinois — an issue to which the United States had “devote[d] only a cursory footnote,” and which the respondents had not briefed at all.

The upshot is that the Court has not, and likely never will, box itself in by enshrining a strong form of party presentation. Viewed in perspective, Richards is hardly a departure from a principle that has never been all that strict. By resolving the case on grounds advanced chiefly (though not exclusively) by amici, the Richards Court followed the “usual practice” in more ways than one.",https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HLR-Logo.png,N,,2025-11-11 15:02:58.148837

Both weapon-makers have been seen as profiting off Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Raytheon and Northrop Grumman’s stock prices spiked after October 7, 2023, as Israel ramped up its attacks.

Since Israel’s assault on Gaza, HRC’s sponsorships had increasingly come in for criticisms from sympathetic celebrities speaking out on Gaza.

At a February 2024 protest outside HRC’s annual gala, protesters condemned the groups’ sponsorship by Northrop Grumman.

“[HRC’s] initiatives that are meant to benefit us are being funded by a weapons manufacturer. Not cute, not queer,” actor Indya Moore told the crowd of protesters. “Their bullets, their bombs, and their missiles are massacring Palestinians who are also queer and trans and deserving of a human rights campaign.”

While accepting HRC’s own “Visibility Award” for LGBTQ+ representation in March 2025, actor Hannah Einbinder condemned the silencing of the Palestinian struggle and the ongoing genocidal war and called out oil companies like Shell and BP for their role in the climate crisis. Investigations have shown that BP’s oil supply is deeply involved in Israel’s war machine.

Einbinder has repeatedly called attention to Palestine and boycotting Israel’s warfare. In September 2025, she made headlines for calling for a free Palestine during her Emmy acceptance speech, and the same month she joined a boycott organized by Film Workers for Palestine against Israeli film institutions implicated in the Gaza war and “apartheid against the Palestinian people.”

A statement provided to The Intercept from HRC said Raytheon and Northrop Grumman no longer sponsored the group, but didn’t directly address when or how the relationships ended. The statement cast the changes as of a piece with the group’s long-held stances against extremism.

“While our focus is on LGBTQ+ equality in the United States, we have spoken out about the crisis, the rising cost of extremism in the United States and around the globe and how Islamophobia, anti-semitism and anti-LGBTQ hatred are globally linked,” a spokesperson for HRC said. “We have also championed the right to protest here in the United States, as it and other pro-democratic principles are being undermined and threatened by this administration.”

Adalah and Gender Liberation Movement said that pro-Palestine groups including No Pride in Genocide and Writers Against the War on Gaza had pushed for this move since at least October 7, 2023.

Highlighting Northrop Grumman in particular for its production of weapons used in Israel’s genocide against Gaza, the Adalah and the Gender Liberation Movement statement says, “These are tools of state-sanctioned destruction and death, not of human rights or equality, and they do not distinguish between queer and straight lives.”

The two groups also noted in their statement that HRC did not commit to permanently rejecting cash from any weapons manufacturers, nor did it adhere to organizers’ demands to call for an arms embargo on Israel.

The statement says, “Our work is not finished, and we remain committed to the struggle.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2155939161-e1762875035991.jpg?fit=4992%2C2500&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-11-11 15:02:40.144517

I then left for Mexico City to transmute my grief into music.
Over the course of this month, anti-gentrification protests have erupted across Mexico City.
The discourse goes much deeper than not being American enough for the Americans, or Mexican enough for the Mexicans.
I have always known that my purpose living in Mexico is to bridge my two worlds: countries, identities and cultures.","This year marks the 10th anniversary of splitting my life between the two countries I call home. My brother Jose was deported from the United States in October 2015 at age 29. He had been here since he was 2 years old. He was returned to Mexico, a country he didn’t even know.

My parents arrived in the U.S. with my two older brothers in 1989, following the rest of my mom’s family’s migration, missing their window for the Amnesty program. I was the only citizen in my family, born in Whittier and raised across Southern California. I grew up well aware of our situation, the privilege my social security number gave me, knowing that at any given moment or traffic stop, my family could be taken from me.

In 2015, I was in my last year of college, studying flashcards for my music industry midterm, when my mom called to tell me that my worst nightmare had come true.

In the 10 years since, I’ve crossed the San Ysidro Port of Entry more times than I can count, spending hours in line with a heaviness in my chest. When I’d visit my brother in Tijuana, he would ride with me until I was about to cross over. He’d hop out, we’d say our goodbyes, and I’d cry the rest of the way home. As a child, I felt the frustration of injustice for my family. But I silenced those feelings, afraid of outing their immigration status. As an adult, with their blessing, that frustration has turned into an outcry for them and the millions of families like ours.

According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, 271,484 people were removed from the United States in fiscal year 2024—each deportation fracturing families like mine. Many of our parents came to the U.S. sold on the “American Dream” only to find themselves living a nightmare. They sacrificed their dreams and their careers and worked exploitative, under-the-table jobs around the clock, with no path to citizenship in sight. Now I find myself, like other first generation kids sharing similar stories online, pursuing a reverse migration toward the “Mexican Dream.”

For a long time, I fantasized about what life would be like for my family had we stayed in Mexico, or at least had the opportunity to visit over the summer and holidays like I saw my friends and their families do, their vans filled to the brim with gifts and necessities for loved ones on the other side of the border. I made a promise to myself that one day I would give myself the opportunity to at least live a chapter of my life there. Now I’m fulfilling that promise.

I knew it wouldn’t be easy to take the leap to move back to the motherland. The final push came when, in the span of two months, my grandmother passed away, I ended an abusive relationship, and Disney shelved the documentary to which I had devoted my life. Grief swallowed me whole, and all I wanted was to heal and be held by my family and the land that gave them life.

Retracing the steps of my ancestors, I began in Guadalajara with my maternal side. I met around 25 family members for the first time, but the matriarchal connection with my tías and primas was so deep, it felt like the home I always dreamed of, allowing me to truly mourn my abuela through their stories.

I then left for Mexico City to transmute my grief into music. I’ve been coming to the city since 2018. Over time I began to understand my family’s roots here, and I knew that my next music projects had to be created here–rooted in the connection to my ancestors.

Mexico is currently home to over one million Americans—the largest population of U.S. citizens living outside the United States—with an estimated 700,000 in Mexico City alone. Two and a half years later, I’m still here.

My dad’s side of the family has been in this city for nearly 100 years, coming down from Alamos, Sonora, in the 1930s for my bisabuelo’s government job. They had always been a mystery to me, as my abuelo was a pilot and died in a plane crash when my dad was a teenager. Through interviews with my two last living tía abuelas, I discovered family lore I never knew—stories of quinceañeras at Castillo de Chapultepec and possible connections to legendary Mexican cinema stars. It was a life I never knew existed as a low-income, first-generation kid of undocumented immigrants, stuck in a country that my family couldn't leave.

So what does it mean for me to be here in Mexico today as a dual citizen?

Over the course of this month, anti-gentrification protests have erupted across Mexico City. Demonstrators are expressing their rightful anger at the exploitation of the cost of living, which has been inflated by the surge of foreigners who have come here since the pandemic-induced digital nomad movement.

Meanwhile, back in California, the number of people reporting to work in the private sector decreased by 3.1% after immigration raids began—a downturn only recently matched by COVID-19 lockdowns, showing how enforcement tears apart both economies and communities. As a Mexican American, I’ve been caught in the crossfires of this ongoing discourse.

The discourse goes much deeper than not being American enough for the Americans, or Mexican enough for the Mexicans. It’s about the question: Where can we call home? A home that feels safe and dignified and where you actually belong.

As an artist and freelancer, I’ve worked contracts in pesos and dollars. My parents made the sacrifices they did for me to have that opportunity. It’s a privilege I do not take for granted. But what does that mean for people like my brother who have been deported, lived their whole lives in the states, and jobs they can get are call centers that pay in dollars? Or folks who live in Tijuana and have to pay rent in dollars? Where do we fit in this equation?

All I wanted was for folks in the U.S. who dehumanized families like mine, writing us off as “illegal”, to see our humanity. I didn’t realize I would also have to fight for our existence with our folks back in Mexico too.

The work of Chicana scholar and foremother, Gloria Anzaldua, reminds us we are not alone in existing in this liminal space — Nepantla, the Nahuatl word for “in-between.” This feels like a true reflection of my identity, and the chapter of my life from which I’m emerging. I have always known that my purpose living in Mexico is to bridge my two worlds: countries, identities and cultures.

I am grateful for everything this land has given me, and I will live here for as long as I am meant to. Wherever life takes me, if and when I have to go back to the U.S. to pursue other dreams, my goal is to create everything I can from my time here and bring it back as an offering to our people over there.

I know I will still spend the rest of my life in between both countries. And if I am to have a family to call my own one day, I’ll spend the summers I never got to have as a kid with them and my family in Mexico. I will honor my parents’ sacrifices in every way I can, and continue to pass on the love for our roots to the next generation. As our paisanos are persecuted up north, I hope to see growing solidarity and welcome among our own people south of the border as well.

What we know:

On Monday, a Chicago Tribune report suggested Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino and his team would soon be reassigned. However, a DHS spokesperson on Tuesday pushed back, saying, ""We aren't leaving Chicago.""

The agency said since Operation Midway Blitz began, homicides in Chicago have dropped 16 percent, shootings are down 35 percent, robberies down 41 percent, carjackings down 48 percent, and transit crime is down 20 percent.

The denial came as Bovino prepared to visit the Little Village neighborhood on Tuesday, where community groups are planning a 9:15 a.m. demonstration at the neighborhood’s iconic arch. Gov. JB Pritzker is scheduled to appear later that morning at an American Legion event nearby.

The backstory:

Tensions between city and federal officials flared again this week after a photo circulated online showing Border Patrol agents posing in front of Chicago’s Cloud Gate sculpture, better known as ""The Bean.""

Featured

According to Block Club Chicago, some agents shouted ""Little Village"" instead of ""cheese"" while taking the picture, an apparent reference to the Southwest Side neighborhood where federal agents clashed with protesters over the weekend.

Gov. JB Pritzker sharply criticized the image, calling it ""disgusting"" and accusing federal officers of ""producing reality TV moments"" instead of keeping residents safe.

""As children are tear gassed and U.S. citizens detained, they are posing for photo ops,"" Pritzker said.

Bovino fired back on X, accusing Pritzker of lying and defending the operation as an effort to root out gangs like the Latin Kings ""that you've allowed to fester with no action for years."" He ended his post with, ""Feel free to join us in Little Village.""

‘CALL IN THE TROOPS, FAST’

Big picture view:

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump late Monday night weighed in on Truth Social, calling Chicago’s crime out of control and urging troops be called in ""BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!""

He also called the Magnificent Mile the ""Miracle Mile"" and said the ""28% vacancy factor"" along the iconic strip is due to ""murder and crime.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/11/1280/720/bovino-pritzker-trump-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-11-11 12:03:25.900411

It was unclear where the team would be headed after it leaves Chicago, the sources said. Bovino said in a sworn deposition that he oversees more than 200 Border Patrol agents who were assigned to the Chicago area in early September. Since then, DHS officials have reported more than 3,000 arrests as part of the federal presence, dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The operation has involved multiple federal agencies, some of which are slated to remain in Chicago, according to sources. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has been in Chicago for decades, will not be leaving the city.

The date of Bovino’s departure, along with the reassignment of Border Patrol agents, is yet to be determined, the sources told NewsNation.

DHS officials did not confirm the departure and instead said the ongoing mission in Chicago will continue. In a post on X, Tricia McLaughlin wrote, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”

In the post, McLaughlin wrote that since the start of Operation Midway Blitz, homicides in Chicago have dropped by 16%, shootings have decreased by 35%, robberies have declined by 41%, carjackings have dropped by 48% and transit crimes have declined 20%.

Bovino, who has remained the face of the federal presence in Chicago, told NewsNation last week that Border Patrol agents have “received a lot of thanks” from local residents and immigrants who are in the United States legally.

“They’re concerned that individuals who come to the United States (illegally) commit crimes, and I think people are beginning to realize that illegal immigration is not a victimless crime,” Bovino said.

Bovino has remained a main target of elected officials in Illinois, namely Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. On Monday, Pritzker responded to a photo of Bovino and Border Patrol agents posing in front of Chicago’s iconic Cloud Gate sculpture, where Block Club Chicago reported an agent yelled, “Everyone say, Little Village,” before a photo was taken.

In a social media post, Pritzker said, “Making fun of our neighborhoods and communities is disgusting.” A spokesperson for Pritzker’s office did not respond to a request for comment from NewsNation on Monday after Bovino invited Pritzker to join him in the city’s Little Village neighborhood Tuesday.

Little Village has remained a flashpoint of clashes between federal agents and residents throughout the federal operation. Bovino was captured on video throwing a canister of tear gas into a crowd of protesters, which drew the ire of U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, who had previously issued a temporary restraining order, limiting the use of force by federal agents.

Last week, Ellis extended the order with an extensive injunction and ruled Bovino had lied under oath about being hit in the head with a rock before throwing the tear gas. On Monday, attorneys for the Trump administration filed an appeal seeking to have a stay issued in response to Ellis’ order.

“Greg Bovino and his masked agents are not here to make Chicago safer,” the governor wrote. “… They are posing for photo ops and producing reality TV moments.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/10/68e3fdf2a353c0.42947885.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-11 11:02:54.555129

“The Miracle Mile Shopping Center in Chicago, once considered our Nation’s BEST, now has a more than 28% vacancy factor, and is ready to call it quits unless something is done about the murder and crime, which is prevalent throughout the City,” the president wrote on Truth Social late Monday.

“CALL IN THE TROOPS, FAST, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE! ‘Just the News.’”

But, according to The Chicago Tribune, federal immigration agents under Commander Gregory Bovino may soon leave the Illinois metropolis as the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” winds down after two months of contentious raids on alleged undocumented migrants.

Bovino is expected to leave within days to take up another assignment elsewhere, the Tribune reported on Monday. At the same time, his Border Patrol forces are redeployed and an on-call task force, composed of FBI personnel and U.S. attorneys, parts ways.

“Every day DHS enforces the laws of this country, including in Chicago,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement. “We do not comment or telegraph future operations.”

The administration claims to have made more than 3,000 arrests since beginning its operations in the area in early September, but its actions have provoked tensions at the street level.

Confrontations with protesters have seen a person shot in an incident in which two cars were accused of ramming an agency van, a Presbyterian minister hit in the head with pepper balls, and tear gas fired in residential streets, creating a climate of fear among residents.

Bovino was ordered to testify in federal court in late October after he and his masked officers faced a wave of allegations about their aggressive tactics, including one episode in which an agent was accused of pointing a gun at a demonstrator and saying “bang, bang” and “you’re dead, liberal.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has repeatedly made the case that federal intervention in local law enforcement is unnecessary, decrying the crackdown by comparing it to events in Nazi Germany and urging ICE to stand down over the Halloween holiday weekend to ensure the safety of trick-or-treaters.

Pritzker took the agency to task again on Monday after its officers posed for a team photograph in front of the Cloud Gate sculpture, known as the Bean, in Millennium Park.

“Making fun of our neighborhoods and communities is disgusting,” the governor said.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested Hamdi, a media commentator and outspoken critic of Israel, last month while he was on a speaking tour in the US.

The State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged at the time that Hamdi supports terrorism and poses a threat to national security, while his lawyers have argued he was targeted for criticising Israel and its war in Gaza.

Hamdi will be released from ICE detention in the next few days and return to the UK, his representatives say.

Hamdi was visiting the US to speak at events for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim advocacy group, when ICE officers arrested him at the San Francisco International Airport on 26 October.

His detainment came after the US government revoked Hamdi's visa and criticism from far-right political activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who accused him of supporting terrorists.

""We've said it before, we'll say it again: The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans"", the State Department said of Hamdi at the time he was detained.

The BBC has reached out to the US State Department, ICE, and DHS for comment and confirmation of the agreement to release Hamdi.

Lawyers for Hamdi and the California chapter of CAIR said in a Monday statement that they welcome an agreement allowing Hamdi to voluntarily return to the UK instead of facing deportation.

They said he was targeted for speaking against ""Israel's war crimes against Palestinians"".

CAIR said that the immigration charging document filed in Hamdi's case only accuses him of overstaying his visa, which the government revoked without notifying him first.

The organisation said the charging document does not identify ""any criminal conduct or security grounds"", which it said was proof that Hamdi was never a danger to the community or to national security.

""It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell. His only real 'offense' was speaking clearly about Israel's genocidal war crimes against Palestinians,"" Hussam Ayloush, the CEO of California's CAIR chapter, said in the news release.

When reached for comment, the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) did not confirm details of Hamdi's detainment or release but told the BBC that it was providing consular assistance to a ""British man detained in the USA"". The office said it has also been in touch with the man's family and with local US authorities.

""This decision brings joy to me, his mother, his wife, our entire family, and all of Sami's supporters around the world,"" Hamdi's father, Dr Mohamed Elhachmi Hamdi, wrote on X.

The rules also require that the court consider reasonable alternatives to closure and make written findings to support the closure.
The lawsuit — filed against the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, and its Judge Sugarmon, in his official capacity — argues that the press and the public have a rule-based presumptive right of access to juvenile delinquency proceedings.
Quote: “In Tennessee, court rules are clear that juvenile delinquency proceedings should be open by default,” McAdoo said.
“In Shelby County, however, the juvenile court has put in place a requirement that shuts the door on reporters who are there to attend delinquency proceedings.","Case Number: CH-25-1700

Court: Shelby County Chancery Court

Clients: MLK50: Justice through Journalism, Memphis Fourth Estate, Memphis Publishing, and Nexstar Media Group.

Background: In Tennessee, rules that govern access to the state’s juvenile courts state that proceedings involving children accused of committing crimes or other offenses are presumptively “open to the public.” The rules and case law make clear that these proceedings can only be closed after a court has balanced the interests of the parties and the public’s “compelling interest” in open proceedings and ensured that closure is no broader than necessary. The rules also require that the court consider reasonable alternatives to closure and make written findings to support the closure.

But the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, has adopted and enforced a policy that makes juvenile delinquency proceedings presumptively closed by requiring members of the public to request and obtain permission from the court up to 48 hours in advance to attend any of these proceedings. The policy requires requesters to specifically name the juvenile whose hearing they want to attend.

In February 2025, Paul McAdoo, the Reporters Committee’s Local Legal Initiative attorney for Tennessee, sent a letter on behalf of MLK50: Justice Through Journalism urging Judge Tarik B. Sugarmon to reconsider the policy, arguing that it violated the juvenile court rules and was impeding news coverage of proceedings. Judge Sugarmon and another court official responded that they would maintain the policy and have continued to do so even after McAdoo sent a letter in March that again urged them to stop enforcing it.

In November 2025, McAdoo filed this lawsuit on behalf of MLK50: Justice Through Journalism, Memphis Fourth Estate, Memphis Publishing, and Nexstar Media Group.

The lawsuit — filed against the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, and its Judge Sugarmon, in his official capacity — argues that the press and the public have a rule-based presumptive right of access to juvenile delinquency proceedings. It asks the court to declare that the advance permission policy is illegal and block its enforcement.

Quote: “In Tennessee, court rules are clear that juvenile delinquency proceedings should be open by default,” McAdoo said. “In Shelby County, however, the juvenile court has put in place a requirement that shuts the door on reporters who are there to attend delinquency proceedings. This unlawful policy deprives the public of timely, accurate information about how the court is handling the cases that come before it, particularly at a time when Shelby County is incarcerating more children than in recent years.”

Related: In June 2025, McAdoo successfully represented WBIR in a fight for public access to a 15-year-old’s murder prosecution in Meigs County Juvenile Court. WBIR used the unsealed records and a video of the previously closed proceeding to shed new light on the case.

Menocal suggested that this is shaping up to be a rough term for government contractors.
The GEO case involves claims by ICE detainees against a contractor operating an ICE detention facility, and the question for the justices is whether the contractor gets an immediate appeal when a district court rejects the contractor’s argument that the detainees have no claims against the contractor if the contractor is simply following ICE’s instructions.
The dominant position of the justices was that whatever protection the contractor might have, it is simply a defense, not the kind of immunity from suit that would justify an immediate appeal.
At that point, Justice Samuel Alito pressed insistently the argument that if Bennett’s clients had sued “ICE and specific ICE officials,” they “could raise sovereign immunity; they could raise qualified immunity … And if the district court denied any of those, then they could get an interlocutory appeal.
It wouldn’t surprise me if Alito took the time to write in support of the GEO here, but it would surprise me if a strong majority doesn’t reject the contractor’s claim.","The argument on Monday in The GEO Group v. Menocal suggested that this is shaping up to be a rough term for government contractors. As I wrote last week, the argument in Hencely v. Fluor Corporation did not appear to go well for the contractor, and the justices seemed even more clearcut in their lack of sympathy for the contractor’s position in GEO.

The GEO case involves claims by ICE detainees against a contractor operating an ICE detention facility, and the question for the justices is whether the contractor gets an immediate appeal when a district court rejects the contractor’s argument that the detainees have no claims against the contractor if the contractor is simply following ICE’s instructions.

The dominant position of the justices was that whatever protection the contractor might have, it is simply a defense, not the kind of immunity from suit that would justify an immediate appeal. Indeed, the opening question of the argument set a tone that did not change much as the hour wound down: Justice Clarence Thomas politely asked Dominic Draye, counsel for the contractor (GEO), if he could point to “the language in [the relevant Supreme Court precedent] that indicates … this immunity from suit.” When Draye admitted that the pertinent precedent, Yearsley v. W.A. Ross Construction, doesn’t have any such language, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson interjected to ask why “isn’t Yearsley better understood as a defense than an immunity?”

Justice Elena Kagan took the tack of parsing Yearsley more closely, and in particular the factors it suggests for determining when the contractor should be able to shift responsibility to the government and thus claim immunity. In particular, she wanted to know whether the contractor is claiming that “‘I satisfied the Yearsleycriteria and that shows that I did nothing wrong?’ Or [that] ‘I satisfied the Yearsley criteria, and that means that even though I did something wrong, I am, in fact, protected from legal consequences?’” When Draye said his client was arguing that it should be protected even if it did something wrong, Kagan commented that “the rationale of Yearsley” is that “I’m following the government’s instructions and the government’s instructions are lawful, so, obviously, everything I did was lawful too.” At which point Jackson chimed in to emphasize that Draye’s client “wouldn’t get the Yearsley defense [if the instructions were unlawful], because … the government would have to have the authority to issue the instructions, and to the extent the instructions violated the law, they wouldn’t be authorized.”

Justice Brett Kavanaugh also was skeptical, asking “[w]hy is the government on the other side from you []? I mean, that seems like a big … hurdle.” For Kavanaugh, it didn’t ring true for Draye to argue that a vote against the contractor “will thwart the implementation … of all [those] government programs? I’m just not seeing that. And because [the federal government is] on the other side, it casts doubt on your assertion that all these programs are going to be [adversely affected if we rule against you].”

It would be an exaggeration, at least a slight one, to say that the argument was unremittingly hostile to the contractor, as there was a substantial passage in its favor during the argument of Jennifer Bennett (representing the detainees). At that point, Justice Samuel Alito pressed insistently the argument that if Bennett’s clients had sued “ICE and specific ICE officials,” they “could raise sovereign immunity; they could raise qualified immunity … And if the district court denied any of those, then they could get an interlocutory appeal. So why shouldn’t the rule be the same for GEO?”

For Alito, it seemed self-evident that the same protections should be available to the contractor as were available to ICE and its own employees. But if other justices share that view, they certainly kept it to themselves. It wouldn’t surprise me if Alito took the time to write in support of the GEO here, but it would surprise me if a strong majority doesn’t reject the contractor’s claim.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2176485456.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 11:03:11.055580

Navigation application audio clip

In a half mile, take the Pennsylvania 378 south exit toward Bethlehem.

Sonja Hutson

I am walking down Main Street in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and it almost kind of feels like a movie set of an American small town. You know, tree-lined streets, black lamp posts, brick sidewalks, cute little restaurants and shops and coffee shops, and not far from where I’m standing in downtown is the rusting remains of the former steelworks. Bethlehem is a former steel town, and it kind of feels like the ghost of Bethlehem’s past a little bit, very symbolically looming over the town.

Female voice clip 1

It’s also just a symbol of pride and like a symbol of, you know, those working-class roots.

Male voice clip 1

Bethlehem is a wonderful place because there’s so many different people and walks of life.

Female voice clip 2

It’s a, you know, a historic town. But I think it’s pushing towards the future.

Sonja Hutson

The town has successfully transitioned to other industries like tech, logistics, education and healthcare. We actually passed a major hospital on the way into town, but there’s still a lot of economic angst here and political division.

Male voice clip 2

I like what the Republicans are doing compared to the Democrats. I don’t want to pay healthcare for illegals.

Female voice clip 3

I don’t think politicians should be dictating what women should do with their bodies.

Female voice clip 4

I really like the ideas of libertarianism, so basically do whatever you want, marry who you want.

Sonja Hutson

Not only is Bethlehem a case study of how politics has changed in post-industrial America, it’s also a critical area in a critical swing state. Over the next several years, the Financial Times is going to be taking a close look at Bethlehem to try to understand how big political and economic issues are playing out in people’s day-to-day lives. And we’re gonna bring you an audio version of some of those stories right here on the Swamp Notes podcast. I’m Sonja Hutson and this is the first episode of our special series on Bethlehem.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I’m joined by the FT’s US news editor Derek Brower, who has been spearheading the newsroom’s Bethlehem Project. He’s here to talk more about what we can expect from it. Hi Derek.

Derek Brower

Hi Sonja.

Sonja Hutson

So tell us a little bit about this project and what you’re hoping readers and listeners will get out of it.

Derek Brower

Well, that’s a good question, Sonja. We thought, I think looking at how we covered the previous election, how American politics is covered in general, that we needed to do something from the ground up and explain how people living in Trump’s America were feeling about Trump’s America. There’s trillions of dollars at stake in how elections are decided. Bond markets are affected by who wins an election. Housing prices are affected, the global economy is affected, and those elections are decided by people in battleground states and swing states in corners of states like Pennsylvania, like Bethlehem. So that’s why we want to go find out how these people are feeling.

Sonja Hutson

And why did you pick Bethlehem in particular?

Derek Brower

We wanted to find a city in America that represented a lot of the themes that are prevalent in the Maga movement. And so Bethlehem, which by the way will be famous to some of our listeners as this place that was the home of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, which steel-guarded the Golden Gate Bridge and Empire State Building and so on. The industrial past is such a big and important theme of the politics that Donald Trump has espoused in recent years. So that’s the first thing.

It also has shifted politically in ways that the country has shifted politically over the past elections. The movements in how people have voted have been towards the winning candidate. The demography is akin to that across the country with Latinos and an African-American population living alongside majority white population. And then fundamentally, it’s just a city that I think will allow us to explore some of the big themes of Donald Trump’s economy. That’s the crackdown on immigration, the impact of tariffs, his efforts to control inflation and the hopes and aspirations, but also the anxieties of younger people as they try to fathom or figure out how they’re going to get new jobs, live with an AI revolution that they see unfolding in front of them and afford housing.

Sonja Hutson

And the main story in our first episode today is about the crackdown on immigration that you mentioned. We’ll get to that in just a second. Derek Brower, the FT’s US news editor. Thanks so much for your time.

Derek Brower

Thanks, Sonja.

Sonja Hutson

US President Donald Trump has made cracking down on immigration, a central part of his second term. Cities across the country are experiencing more raids from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, as a result.

News clip 1

We’re following a massive ICE raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.

News clip 2

Protests erupted in the streets of Los Angeles after immigration officials conducted several raids and arrested dozens of people.

Sonja Hutson

Bethlehem is no exception. Back in June, an immigration raid at a construction site sent a chill through the city.

News clip 3

Tonight, the Bethlehem community came out to stand in solidarity with 17 people arrested by ICE during a raid.

Sonja Hutson

Now, this was relatively small compared to some of the other immigration enforcement actions across the country this year. But the response in Bethlehem, which is 30 per cent Hispanic, highlighted the intense division over how to treat people who work and contribute to society, but also came to the country illegally.

The FT’s Guy Chazan went to Bethlehem to learn more about this. He joins me now to talk about it. Hi, Guy.

Guy Chazan

Hi.

Sonja Hutson

So let’s rewind a little to June. Tell me what we know about the raid and any other immigration enforcement actions since then.

Guy Chazan

Well, the men who were detained were construction workers, and they were restoring a place called Five 10 Flats, which was an apartment complex in the south side of Bethlehem that had been damaged in a fire. And they’re all led away. Some people were on the scene and actually photographed it and filmed it on their phones.

[AUDIO CLIP OF RAID PLAYING]

Guy Chazan

But no one in Bethlehem seems to know where the men who were mainly from Venezuela and Mexico are being held, or even whether they’re still in the United States. There’ve been further detentions since then. For example, one woman I spoke to watched in horror as ICE agents led her husband away. Her husband’s called Darwin Contreras. He was attending a routine appointment at Lehigh County Courthouse, which is just in the neighbouring town of Allentown, and he’s been in detention ever since.

Sonja Hutson

And can you just back up a little bit and talk about how this raid fits in with immigration enforcement that we’ve seen across the country this year?

Guy Chazan

Well, ICE — Immigration Customs Enforcement — has really stepped up its activities all over the country. We saw in Los Angeles, for example, how ICE agents raided car parks next to Home Depot stores where Mexican day labourers often gathered to pick up work. And this is really coming from the top of the White House officials like Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff, have been saying how. It was important for us to really step up its enforcement activities and really pursue undocumented aliens and detain them and possibly deport them. So we’re seeing this across the country. Really, what happened in Bethlehem is no exception at all.

Sonja Hutson

Yeah. And like we heard earlier, there was a rally after the raid in support of the people who were arrested. You spoke to someone who helped organise that. Can you tell me about them and how they reacted to the raid when it happened?

Guy Chazan

Well, yes. This is Jon Irons, who’s a local county commissioner.

Jon Irons

I was born in Ecuador and I was adopted as an infant. And so I grew up outside of Chicago. And so, you know, the immigrant story is part of my story too.

Guy Chazan

And I went with him to the construction site where the raid happened.

Jon Irons

We’re aware that ICE has been operating for a long time and detaining people. But we haven’t seen these large work site raids in Bethlehem.

Guy Chazan

He told me that the raid had made him really scared.

Jon Irons

You know, I know that my citizenship and my status is just a legal decision and that it can be taken away from me. And we need to acknowledge that everyone’s at risk.

Guy Chazan

He felt like if they were targeting these men, then really everyone was at risk. Everyone with an immigrant background was at risk of being arrested and possibly deported. And after the raid happened Jon Irons helped organise this protest that about 500 people showed up to.

[AUDIO CLIP OF PROTEST]

Guy Chazan

They were holding up placards that said things like, don’t bite the hands that feed you. And we speak for those you silenced. Jon Irons described the mood of this protest, but he also said how people generally feel in the city.

Jon Irons

Yeah. There was a lot of anger, there was a lot of, you know, fear and this was kind of the moment we’re talking about this change in our federal government and what’s happening with the expansion of the ICE budget and sort of rise of fascism. And so people were ready to be activated on this.

Guy Chazan

And it’s obvious that people are very exercised by these ICE enforcement actions. And really, it’s led to waves of protests, not only in big cities like Los Angeles, but also in small communities like Bethlehem.

Sonja Hutson

Well, what do immigration officials have to say about the raid and some of the other arrests that they’ve made in Bethlehem since then?

Guy Chazan

Well, Homeland Security basically said that these inspections, as they call them, workplace inspections, are critical for targeting illegal employment practices. And they’re saying that such practices actually undermine American workers and destabilise labour markets. And one spokesman for the DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, has also sort of hit back at the criticism of the arrest of Darwin Contreras, saying that he was actually a criminal with convictions and that he was arrested during a court hearing for driving under the influence.

Sonja Hutson

Well, Guy, what about people in the community that were in support of the raid? What did they tell you?

Guy Chazan

They basically said that the people who were arrested in that June raid had broken the law and, you know, what country is going to just turn and look the other way when people enter the country illegally? There was also a sense of trying to create a kind of deterrent effect as well. I think we are not gonna just sort of turn a blind eye to this illegal immigration to these undocumented aliens. They are going to be held accountable for breaking the law. So that was the argument that the supporters of this policy were pushing that I spoke to in Bethlehem.

Sonja Hutson

I feel like this conversation that we’ve been having around the responses to the raid has been very black and white. Did you talk to anyone in Bethlehem whose opinion falls more in the middle?

Guy Chazan

Yes. I mean, for example, the head of the local chamber of commerce, Tony Ianelli, he was very, very nuanced on it. He said he was OK with some measures to crack down on immigration.

Tony Ianelli

Do I think that, quote unquote, very bad people who have committed very bad crimes, do I think removing them from illegally being here, you know, I think that’s OK.

Guy Chazan

But Ianelli also said that there really should be a pathway for people who have been in the country for a long time and haven’t committed any crimes, a pathway for them to achieve citizenship.

Tony Ianelli

There are a lot of good, hardworking people that are, number one, would contribute, but number two, are doing lots of jobs that many people are not lining up to do, and I mean, hardworking jobs with a dedication like I’ve never seen.

Guy Chazan

And that that would actually solve a lot of problems and also be good for the economy.

Sonja Hutson

So we’ve heard takes from across the spectrum throughout this conversation, but do we have any data on how many people fall into these different camps?

Guy Chazan

Well, I think polls show how divided the country is on this. A New York Times Sienna poll in September found that 51 per cent of people thought Trump’s actions on immigration had gone too far. But 47 per cent said they had been just right or not gone far enough. So there is sort of rising concern about the way this policy is being implemented, but there are still plenty of people who agree with it.

Sonja Hutson

Yeah, it’s interesting because in some ways like the imagery, or at least the imagery that the Republican party has put out about the border of all of these people coming across, if you’re living in Pennsylvania, that’s almost 2,000 miles away from you, but it probably feels really different when that immigration enforcement actually comes to your community.

Guy Chazan

Absolutely. And you know, Bethlehem is 30 per cent Hispanic. And from my conversations with people, it became clear that really a lot of the Hispanic people who live in Bethlehem have been there for decades and are really very, very well entrenched in the community and respected members of their community. I kept hearing the word hardworking, skilled workers.

Sonja Hutson

Something that I feel like we keep coming back to is this idea of contributing economically and whether these immigrants have contributed economically, been hardworking as you mentioned. How big of an impact on the economy has Trump’s deportation drive had?

Guy Chazan

I think it’s increasingly important and you know, over the summer we saw a lot of agricultural workers being arrested and people in the hospitality industry, these are sectors of the economy that have long experienced labour shortages. And you heard farmers, you heard people who own restaurants complaining about the fact that the policies of the Trump administration were actually undermining their business because they were not going to be able to replace the foreign workers that were now being rounded up and in some cases deported.

And there was a really interesting paper put out earlier this year by researchers from the centrist Brookings Institution and the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, and it predicts that a drop in net migration will put significant downward pressure on growth in the labour force and employment, and quote, monthly payroll employment growth could be near zero or negative in the next few years. And in fact, the last non-farm payroll report we got shows there has been very little change in employment since April. So there is a kind of economic argument in all of this as well, and that is something that is potentially quite dangerous for the Republican party, and for the Trump White House. If they pursue these policies too aggressively, they could lead to strains on the economy, which will put off traditional Republican constituencies.

Sonja Hutson

What does all this tell you about the approach that each political party has taken on immigration and maybe also what approach they should take to appeal to voters in a critical area like Bethlehem?

Guy Chazan

Well, I think the overall impression I had from this was that Bethlehem is a swing city. Pennsylvania is a swing state. I think it’s one of those things where swing voters or independents are really put off by what the Trump administration is doing in terms of immigration. They might have wanted the new government to exert greater control over the southern border, but I don’t think they envisage these kind of policies, the sort of snatching people in workplaces and at courthouses and so on. And I think among sort of real classic swing voters, there is a sort of revulsion from that. I don’t know yet whether it’s enough to make them change their minds about the Republican party and sort of swing them more towards the Democrats. I think it’s still a bit early to tell, but it’s generally, it could be one of those issues that does emerge as a sort of important factor in the midterm elections next year if the Democrats really harness that in order to win support and win over those wavering voters.

Sonja Hutson

Guy, you mentioned earlier that a lot of people in the community were shocked by this raid. You know, now that it happened and there’s been some time for people to sit with this, where do you think Bethlehem goes from here?

Guy Chazan

Well, it’s interesting. There was a very, very robust response in a group of residents created something called the Lehigh Valley Emergency Response Network.

John Stratton

We don’t set out thinking that we’re going to necessarily prevent every ICE arrest in the Lehigh Valley. I mean, I think that would be unrealistic.

Guy Chazan

And the idea is that they want to, as the local pastor John Stratton put it to me, they want to be able to sort of monitor ICE actions because ICE is acting in places which it never did before, such as courthouses.

John Stratton

We are documenting any human rights violations that we are bearing witness to the violence of ICE and the cruelty of ICE.

Guy Chazan

And also provide resources to people who are seeing loved ones and relatives and friends get arrested and deported, providing advice to them, maybe some legal support as well.

Sonja Hutson

And I very much look forward to holding my annual Lincoln County town hall in the weeks ahead to hear directly from coastal families and small businesses what they’d think about any such unwelcome and unneeded makeover of Newport.”

State Rep. David Gomberg released a statement in his newsletter Nov. 10.

""The Oregon Coast, with reliance on hospitality, fishing and food processing, and agriculture, has largely been able to avoid the consequences and controversy of immigration actions that have challenged our larger cities.

We are now aware there are persistent rumors and reports that ICE is in the process of expanding operations near the Newport Municipal Airport in space that has been deeded to the Coast Guard. Predictably, the federal agencies that actually know something are not saying. But I have been in constant contact with our US Senators and Congresswoman, the Governor’s office, Attorney General, and local leaders.

What I do know is that reports indicate the proposed siting of a new ICE detention facility in the Newport area. We are aware that our local Coast Guard helicopter has been relocated to North Bend, and that is disturbing.

I’m not aware of any planned public reaction. As always, I encourage people to exercise their first amendment rights peacefully, lawfully, and constructively. Know your rights.

I should also add that our US Coast Guard is not ICE. They are currently on duty, as always, protecting our communities, coastline, visitors and particularly our fishing fleet. That includes occasionally posting vans (sometimes unmarked) with government plates at lookout stations to observe traffic in our harbors. I’ve received reports of some personnel being harassed. That needs to stop! The Coast Guard saves lives and we support their brave work and presence here.

I will update you as this situation evolves.

Oregon remains a sanctuary state. And within that status, anyone committing crimes against people or property should be held accountable regardless of immigration status.

The federal government needs to fix their broken immigration laws and border policies. But that should not include tearing local families apart, intimidating and debilitating local businesses and their employees, or upending local communities.

Reasonable people will have different reactions to how our federal government best handles immigration policy.

Immigration judges' backgrounds vary over time In recent years, immigration judges' backgrounds have varied.","This article was first published by the nonprofit newsroom LAist on November 6, 2025 and is republished here with permission.

For three immigration judges, the day took a similar turn.

Kyra Lilien, who was hired in 2023, was presiding in a courtroom in Concord, Calif., in July when she paused the hearing of an immigrant seeking asylum to read an email.

""I told them that we were not going to have a hearing because I had just been fired,"" Lilien said. Present in the court was a court interpreter and an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security. ""They asked me if I was joking.""

Anam Petit, who was hired as an immigration judge in 2023 after a career in immigrant defense, was sitting on the bench in her courtroom in Virginia's Annandale Immigration Court in September. It was her two-year anniversary in the position and she was between hearings when she got the email.

""My voice was shaking. My hands were shaking. My mind was racing. And I gave the decision and I dismissed everyone without mentioning anything,"" Petit said. One decision that day was to deny asylum, and the other was a partial denial, each for a different member of one immigrant family, she recalled.

Tania Nemer was hired as a judge at the Cleveland immigration court in 2023. She had about 30 or 40 immigrants, a DHS attorney and staff in her court one morning in February. She had just finished explaining rights and responsibilities to the group when her door opened and her manager asked her to come with him. She was later escorted out of the building.

""I didn't know at all why I was being fired at the time. And I kept asking; no one had a reason,"" Nemer said.

Nemer was one of the first immigration judges fired by the Trump administration after a slew of dismissals of leaders at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the branch of the Justice Department that houses immigration courts. Later that month, the administration fired 12 judges — an entire incoming class that had just been trained and was about to take the bench.

Those dismissals come as the administration has ramped up mass deportations of those without legal status, and sometimes pointed to judges as obstacles in that effort.

The pattern has been consistent. Every few months this year, a new class of judges gets termination notices in the middle of the day, often while they are in the middle of immigration court proceedings. The notices often target those who have reached the end of their two-year probationary period, a trial period for federal workers before they are ""converted"" to permanent employees. It was previously common for these civil servants to be converted to permanent employees of the DOJ.

""None of us have been given an explanation, we are in the dark, but we've been trying to ascertain patterns,"" Lilien said, the former judge in northern California. She wonders if her past experience representing immigrants got her fired, even though she also worked at DHS as an asylum officer.

Her hunch has some correlation with the data. NPR has independently identified 70 immigration judges who received termination notices from the Trump administration between February and October. The number of judges who received termination letters matches the tally kept by the immigration judges' union. It also accords with NPR's past coverage of the terminations.

The count does not include assistant chief immigration judges (ACIJ), who are courthouse supervisors and also have their own dockets. The union has counted 11 ACIJs terminated.

An analysis of each of the 70 immigration judges' professional backgrounds found that judges with backgrounds defending immigrants, and no prior work history at DHS, made up about 44% of the firings — more than double the share of those who had only prior work history at DHS.

NPR also analyzed the classes of judges onboarded between February 2023 and November 2024, who would have neared the ends of their probationary periods this year or are still in the probationary period. Of those judges, those who had prior DHS experience, including working as asylum officers and as attorneys for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, made up the largest share still on the bench.

NPR reached out to the DOJ, EOIR and the White House for a comment on the firings and NPR's findings. The press staff at EOIR is furloughed due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, according to automatic email replies, though immigration courts are still operational. The White House referred questions to the DOJ.

""DOJ doesn't 'target' or 'prioritize' immigration judges for any personnel decision one way or the other based on prior experience,"" a DOJ spokesperson told NPR in a statement. ""DOJ continually evaluates all immigration judges, regardless of background, on factors such as conduct, impartiality/bias, adherence to the law, productivity/performance, and professionalism.""

The spokesperson added that, ""pursuant to Article II of the Constitution, IJs (Immigration Judges) are inferior officers who are appointed and removed by the Attorney General.""

The spokesperson disputed the 70 count, saying the agency has terminated fewer than 55 judges, but was unable to provide more details. The agency's number is inconsistent with other news reports, NPR's prior reporting and the union. NPR reached out to reconcile the numbers. The DOJ spokesperson said staff have been furloughed and the Justice Department is not able to confirm their data.

Employees search for reasons

Fired judges have been grasping at straws to understand why they were fired — some have filed Freedom of Information Act requests. Others have turned to wrongful termination complaints and lawsuits. Some worry they were targeted on the basis of protected classes, such as gender or race.

""I fit the bill,"" said Nemer, who had represented immigrants prior to becoming an immigration judge. Nemer listed off characteristics cited in a lawsuit she has filed, arguing she was fired based on various protected classes.

""It's hard to know without having the explanations of why judges were fired,"" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan organization that focuses on immigration policy. ""But the way the Trump administration is approaching immigration courts reflects a really high prioritization of immigration enforcement and [the administration] has really made deportations this whole-of-government effort.""

Immigration judges approve or deny a final order of deportation. Court officials have placed pressure on judges to move through their dockets faster, including by reviewing asylum cases without hearings.

Each fired judge can leave behind thousands of cases, according to several interviews with fired judges throughout the year. Each case is an immigrant who has likely already waited years for their day in court, to make the case for why they should be allowed to stay in the U.S.

Many of these cases have now been reassigned to other judges, at the bottom of their already years-long dockets. Immigrants whose cases were already in progress, or set to be reviewed soon, now have new dates as far out as 2029.

There were 700 immigration judges at the start of the year. Over the past 10 months, EOIR has lost more than 125 judges to firings and voluntary resignations. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress approved a spending bill that allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including the hiring of more immigration judges, to address the backlog of millions of cases at immigration court.

Fear of retribution

Probationary judges aren't the only ones who have been fired under the Trump administration. NPR tracked 12 fired judges who started prior to 2023. This means they were fired after their two-year probationary period.

Some have been left wondering if their firings were retribution for the decisions they made on the bench.

Shira Levine had worked for EOIR since 2021 before being fired in September. She was presiding over a hearing for an immigrant who had already waited more than five years for a day in court when she got the email.

""People looked surprised, but no one looked shocked,"" Levine said. ""That's because, unfortunately, this by that point had become a pattern."" She said she didn't expect to be removed since she had passed her two-year mark. She was never given a reason.

Levine, like several others, received a standard email that they were being terminated pursuant to Article 2 of the Constitution, which gives the executive the power to dismiss federal employees.

Levine thought she might have been dismissed because of her response to some recent Trump administration policies.

During the summer months, immigration judges had already had to contend with an outsized enforcement presence in normally empty courtroom hallways. ICE attorneys — who argue on behalf of a government that an immigrant should be deported — started more regularly filing ""motions to dismiss"" cases. When a judge granted such a motion, migrants would be detained before leaving the building.

Levine said such motions should be granted if there is a change in the individual migrant's case, not a change in immigration policy.

""I was not told it was because of my decision to deny the motion to dismiss that I was fired,"" Levine said. ""But I handed down a decision that contravened what they apparently wanted the judges to do.""

Others, like Ila Deiss or Emmett Soper, who had been immigration judges since 2017 and 2016, served as career officials at the DOJ for nearly two decades.

Soper had been with EOIR since graduating law school in a variety of other roles. He doesn't know if his firing had anything to do with past policy work under the Biden administration's EOIR director or his handling of cases as a judge.

As the Trump administration brings in new people to the bench, he has concerns over the loss of experienced judges.

""You have to be able to manage your courtroom and you have to make very difficult, sometimes life-or-death decisions, with the person whose life is going to be affected and the family members sometimes right in front of you,"" Soper said.

""It's not something that you pick up right away. And with all of these judges — many of whom are very experienced — being fired, the agency is losing something that will take a long time to get back, if they ever can.""

Prior political interference

The agency is prioritizing other judges to hire.

The Trump administration has moved to bring back immigration judges it sees as unfairly fired by the Biden administration. The Justice Department, ina February memo, said that it cannot be confident the Biden administration was ethical and lawful in how it dismissed immigration judges and other adjudicators.

A handful of judges in 2022 had not been converted to permanent employment, sparking GOP outrage over what lawmakers saw as political interference.

Earlier this year, Matthew O'Brien and David White, two of those judges let go under President Joe Biden, were reinstated at immigration courts in Virginia. O'Brien was brought back to a managerial position, as NPR previously reported — though he is no longer with EOIR. White is a judge at the Falls Church court.

The Justice Department appointed a new director of EOIR, Daren Margolin, in October. Margolin has previous experience as the assistant chief immigration judge, or courthouse supervisor, throughout multiple courts in California, and a background as a military and DHS lawyer. He had been fired from a command position at a Marine base for negligently firing a gun and had left EOIR in 2024 before returning to lead the agency.

Then the DOJ last month announced its first class of 2025, which included 25 temporary judges who are military lawyers.

""EOIR is restoring its integrity as a preeminent administrative adjudicatory agency,"" the announcement states. ""These new immigration judges are joining an immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law.""

The incoming class of permanent judges comprises mostly those with a background in federal government work, including EOIR itself and the Department of Homeland Security. Their previous jobs included training Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents, serving as asylum officers and working for ICE's legal arm.

One judge was originally going to take the bench at the start of the year, but was among theinitial class of judges fired before they could start. None of the incoming judges appear to have previously worked in the field of immigrant defense based on EOIR's announcement.

Immigration judges' backgrounds vary over time

In recent years, immigration judges' backgrounds have varied. Many came to the position after several years working for ICE's legal branch. Others became judges after working for immigrant defense nonprofits or in private practice. Some have no immigration law experience, which was previously a requirement for temporary judges but not for permanent ones.

When immigration courts were first established, it was more common for immigration judges to have an enforcement background, said Dana Leigh Marks, a former immigration judge and immigration attorney who litigated landmark immigration cases before the Supreme Court.

Marks joined the court in 1987, when courts were still under the former Immigration and Naturalization Service branch of the DOJ.

""Frankly, I was one of the individuals who was hired to show that it wasn't just a career path of prosecution that led you to be eligible to be an immigration judge,"" Marks said.

That push for professional diversification carried through the Biden administration. That administration selected as immigration judges not just immigration attorneys, but also criminal defense attorneys, other administrative judges across the federal government, and those with military experience, as it sought to diversify the perspectives of those interpreting the complicated set of immigration laws.

Marks said that the president and his cabinet will continue to affect personnel decisions as long as these courts stay in the executive branch.

""It's common sense that the boss of the prosecutor should not be the boss of the judge,"" Marks said, recalling the fight to keep immigration courts separate from immigration enforcement when DHS was created in 2002. Enforcement, which is primarily ICE, was separated from the DOJ.",https://kcet.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ffe28f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1760x924+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkcet-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F73%2F78%2F5be5cce14d39a7f503d1a430f419%2Ffedagenst.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 12:03:36.868875

Yet the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County requires members of the press and public to seek permission up to 48 hours in advance to attend any delinquency hearing, and to specifically identify the juvenile involved.
For example, MLK50 reporter Rebecca Cadenhead has sought access to juvenile court hearings in part to report on how the court is operating since the 2018 end of a federal oversight period that had been required by a 2012 settlement between Shelby County and the U.S. Department of Justice following a DOJ investigation concluding the Shelby County Juvenile Court discriminated against Black youth.","Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Local Legal Initiative attorney Paul McAdoo is representing a Tennessee news media coalition in a new lawsuit challenging access restrictions to certain juvenile court proceedings in Shelby County, arguing they unlawfully impede news coverage of the justice system and stifle public oversight of the court.

On behalf of MLK50: Justice Through Journalism, the Daily Memphian’s publisher Memphis Fourth Estate, The Commercial Appeal’s publisher Memphis Publishing, and Memphis television station WREG’s owner and operator Nexstar Media Group, Reporters Committee attorneys are asking the Shelby County Chancery Court to block the enforcement of a policy that requires members of the press and public to obtain advance permission from the county’s juvenile court before attending delinquency hearings, which are presumptively open to the public pursuant to court rule.

“In Tennessee, court rules are clear that juvenile delinquency proceedings should be open by default,” McAdoo said. “In Shelby County, however, the juvenile court has put in place a requirement that shuts the door on reporters who are there to attend delinquency proceedings. This unlawful policy deprives the public of timely, accurate information about how the court is handling the cases that come before it, particularly at a time when Shelby County is incarcerating more children than in recent years.”

While the rules that govern access to Tennessee’s juvenile courts allow for some types of proceedings to be closed, those rules explicitly state that delinquency cases are presumptively open to the public. The rules specify a process the court must follow in order to close a delinquency proceeding, which requires the court to, among other things, “make adequate written findings to support any order of closure” on a case-by-case basis.

Yet the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County requires members of the press and public to seek permission up to 48 hours in advance to attend any delinquency hearing, and to specifically identify the juvenile involved. The lawsuit argues that this advance permission policy renders these proceedings presumptively closed, including when a hearing itself is not scheduled more than 48 hours in advance, or a journalist is not made aware of it within that timeframe or does not know the name of the specific juvenile involved.

The lawsuit also details multiple instances in which reporters have been barred from accessing hearings due to the policy, either because their advance requests were not answered until after a hearing took place or because they’ve been explicitly denied.

For example, MLK50 reporter Rebecca Cadenhead has sought access to juvenile court hearings in part to report on how the court is operating since the 2018 end of a federal oversight period that had been required by a 2012 settlement between Shelby County and the U.S. Department of Justice following a DOJ investigation concluding the Shelby County Juvenile Court discriminated against Black youth. According to the legal filings, Cadenhead has twice been prevented from observing the court’s current practices — once when her request to attend was not answered until nearly two weeks after the hearing at issue, and once when it was expressly denied — and thus has not attempted to attend a proceeding since, which she claims has posed “significant challenges” to her reporting.

This lawsuit is the most recent case in which McAdoo is helping Tennessee news organizations push for transparency in the state’s criminal justice system.",https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2x1-State-Names-Tennessee-e1746637932449.png,N,,2025-11-11 03:57:40.035974

Hassan M Ahmad, a lawyer from the California chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-CA), and the Muslim Legal Fund of America (MLFA) said in a statement on Monday that the journalist and commentator was punished for his criticism of Israel during his US speaking tour and not for any alleged wrongdoing.

“It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell,” Hussam Ayloush, the CEO of CAIR’s California chapter, said in a statement.

“His only real ‘offense’ was speaking clearly about Israel’s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians.”

“The immigration charging document filed in his case alleged only a visa overstay—after the government revoked his visa without cause and without prior notice—and never identified any criminal conduct or security grounds,” Hamdi’s legal representatives said in the joint statement.

Hamdi’s wife, Soumaya Hamdi, welcomed the news in a series of posts on social media, saying, “Sami is coming home, alhamdullilah. Elated doesn’t begin to describe the feeling.”

She also expressed her “heartfelt gratitude” to the “countless wonderful people” who offered assistance during her husband’s detention.

A number of institutions raised concerns about Hamdi’s treatment, including his former university, the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, and freedom of expression organisation PEN America.

By contrast, some people openly advocated for Hamdi to be detained, including far-right activist and Donald Trump ally Laura Loomer, who celebrated Hamdi’s detention and repeatedly claimed he was going to be deported, without citing her sources.

Loomer, a self-described “proud Islamophobe”, also accused Hamdi of supporting Islamic terrorism, without providing any evidence.

Responding to allegations about his son, Hamdi’s father, Mohamed El-Hachmi Hamdi, said in a post on X that he “has no affiliation” with any political or religious group.

“His stance on Palestine is not aligned with any faction there, but rather, with the people’s right to security, peace, freedom and dignity. He is, quite simply, one of the young dreamers of this generation, yearning for a world with more compassion, justice, and solidarity,” he added.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has targeted a number of pro-Palestinian advocates, even as it has also worked to mediate a precarious truce agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Those targeted include Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian former student of Columbia University. who continues to face challenges to his US immigration status after being freed from detention in June.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sam_hamdi_and_child-1762459545.jpg?resize=1752%2C1080,N,,2025-11-11 00:56:40.566473

“The government has agreed to release Sami,” the family said in a statement on Monday.
“He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.” Hamdi was detained on 26 October at San Francisco international airport.
“This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” Cair said.
“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”","The family of British political commentator Sami Hamdi, who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in late October while on a speaking tour in the US, say he is set to be released and will be able to “return home soon”.

“The government has agreed to release Sami,” the family said in a statement on Monday. “He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.”

Hamdi was detained on 26 October at San Francisco international airport. At the time, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said his detention appeared to be in retaliation for the Muslim political commentator’s criticism of Israel while touring the US, calling it a “blatant affront to free speech”, and called for his release.

Later on 26 October, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said that Hamdi’s visa had been revoked and that he was in “ICE custody pending removal”.

“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin said.

In a separate statement that same day, the state department said that the US “has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans. We continue to revoke the visas of persons engaged in such activity”.

The Guardian reported last month that the US officials appeared to be referencing remarks Hamdi made following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, as on 27 October, the DHS shared a video clip by the pro-Israel group Memri, in which Hamdi was recorded saying that Palestinians should “celebrate their victory” and asked if they had felt “euphoria” over what had taken place.

Hamdi later sought to clarify his remarks. In another speaking engagement several days after the Hamas attacks he said: “We don’t celebrate blood lust, we don’t celebrate death and we don’t celebrate war” adding that “what Muslims are celebrating is not war, they’re celebrating the revival of a cause – a just cause – that everybody thought was dead, this is an important distinction … I don’t celebrate war, I don’t celebrate death.”

In an interview with the Guardian in late October, Hamdi’s wife called the allegations against her husband “outrageous” and said the videos were “edited in a way to frame Sami in a horrible light and produced by an organization that is very well known to be anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, Islamophobic and out there to target people who are speaking up against the genocide against Palestinians”.

On Monday, the California chapter of Cair, whose legal team has been representing Hamdi in court along with attorneys from the Muslim Legal Fund of America and The HMA Law Firm, confirmed in a statement that Hamdi had accepted an offer to leave the US voluntarily.

They added that the immigration charging document filed “in his case alleged only a visa overstay – after the government revoked his visa without cause and without prior notice – and never identified any criminal conduct or security grounds”.

“This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” Cair said.

However, McLaughlin of DHS said in a statement: “Sami Hamdi, an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer who cheered on Hamas following its October 7 terrorist attack, requested voluntary departure and ICE is happily arranging his removal from this country.

Asylum seekers and others detained while showing up for their immigration court date have been kept for days at a time in rooms meant to hold people for less than 12 hours, according to advocates.
“These spaces cannot hold people safely for more than 12 hours, fundamentally, as a matter of operations and a matter of physical layout,” LCCRSF attorney Marissa Hatton declared at federal court in San José.
LCCRSF and other civil groups argue that the federal government made this change without making changes to its procedures and practices “necessary for longer-term incarceration,” like making bedding, medication or hygiene products available to detainees.
The court did not make a decision on Monday, but the next scheduled hearing is set for Dec. 9.","Civil rights advocates argued in federal court on Monday that immigrants are being detained in unacceptable conditions in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in downtown San Francisco.

Asylum seekers and others detained while showing up for their immigration court date have been kept for days at a time in rooms meant to hold people for less than 12 hours, according to advocates.

The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area — one of the groups that has sued the federal government — said that this practice violates both federal law and the Constitution, and it is asking the court to provide immediate relief to detained immigrants.

The lawsuit alleges that ICE has kept immigrants detained at the 630 Sansome St. holding site in “a state of sleep deprivation.” Plaintiffs say they were forced to sleep on either the floor or metal benches, with only a sheet of plastic for cover in cold rooms where the lights were kept on 24 hours a day.

“These spaces cannot hold people safely for more than 12 hours, fundamentally, as a matter of operations and a matter of physical layout,” LCCRSF attorney Marissa Hatton declared at federal court in San José.

One plaintiff, Martin Hernandez Torres, told lawyers that federal agents deprived him of his blood pressure medication while he was detained overnight, resulting in a hypertensive crisis that may have left him with permanent brain damage.

For years, ICE has kept individuals awaiting deportation or a hearing in hold rooms like the one in downtown San Francisco for up to 12 hours at a time — as required by the agency’s own standards.

But as it ramped up operations under the Trump administration in recent months, ICE leadership issued a waiver in June for its own rule and allowed for detentions of up to several days.

LCCRSF and other civil groups argue that the federal government made this change without making changes to its procedures and practices “necessary for longer-term incarceration,” like making bedding, medication or hygiene products available to detainees.

Officials with ICE said their agencies do not comment on pending litigation, but the attorney representing the federal government, Douglas Earl Johns, told Biden-appointed Judge P. Casey Pitts that the waiver to the 12-hour rule “is applied operationally on an individual basis.”

Earlier this year, several members of Congress and immigrant justice groups in New York similarly accused ICE of keeping immigrants detained in “inhumane conditions” after detaining them at their court hearings.

Civil rights groups are asking the court to freeze ICE’s waiver of its 12-hour rule and require federal agents to provide detained individuals with basic medical screenings, prescribed medication and improve overall conditions in the holding rooms.

The court did not make a decision on Monday, but the next scheduled hearing is set for Dec. 9.

In its statement, CAIR said federal immigration authorities accused Hamdi of overstaying his visa – but that the visa was revoked without cause or prior notice. No criminal conduct or security grounds were ever identified, CAIR added.

“This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” the statement read.

Hamdi was detained at San Francisco International Airport on October 26, a day after speaking at CAIR’s annual gala in California.

On Friday, Hamdi’s wife Soumaya said the US government provided “no evidence” to justify his detention.

“If they want him out of the country, why not simply let him go?” she posted to Instagram. “Why is the US government holding a British journalist without charge?”

Hamdi is known for his analysis on developments in the Middle East and appearances on British TV. He had recently spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance.

At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.” However, in a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”

“People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians,” he said.

Background

A requested poll of the court failed to produce a majority of judges in regular active service and not disqualified who voted in favor of rehearing en banc.

Analysis

Judges King, Gregory, Wynn, Thacker, Benjamin and Berner voted to grant rehearing en banc. Chief Judge Diaz and judges Wilkinson, Niemeyer, Agee, Harris, Quattlebaum, Rushing and Heytens voted to deny rehearing en banc. Judge Richardson did not participate.

Petition for rehearing en banc denied.

Dissenting opinion

King, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:

The exceptionally important issue that our en banc court should have addressed is whether a bankruptcy court can possess subject-matter jurisdiction over a bankruptcy proceeding involving fully-solvent corporate entities who lack any semblance of financial distress? Put most simply, the answer should emphatically be NO.

Our en banc court has blundered in declining to recognize that there is simply a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for Bestwall to maintain its manufactured sham Chapter 11 bankruptcy. And it does so at the expense of thousands of plaintiffs that are seeking tort relief in the Nation’s civil courts against the likes of New Georgia-Pacific and Bestwall. Because we should have convened as an en banc court and recognized that Bestwall’s manufactured sham Chapter 11 bankruptcy is subject to dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, I respectfully dissent.",https://valawyersweekly.com/files/2021/10/VLW-digital-product-mockup-for-Facebook.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 19:57:50.510714

National Domestic Violence Hotline: People who have experienced domestic abuse can get confidential help at thehotline.org or by calling 800-799-7233.

The immigrant from India believed her husband when he said that if she wasn’t gone by the time he got to their Georgia home in 10 minutes, he would kill her.

She said her husband and his family, who are also immigrants, abused her throughout their marriage, beating her with a belt, pouring hot water on her, cutting her, and pushing her head through a wall.

“Several times I tried to escape, but they found me and brought me back home,” said the woman, who is in the country illegally and spoke on the condition of anonymity because she is afraid being identified would harm her chances of gaining legal status.

With no time to run after her husband’s call in July 2020, she dialed 911, even though she knew she could be deported. The police arrived to find the husband threatening her with a knife in front of their young children, she recalled. He was arrested but not prosecuted, she said.

The woman and her children sought services from the Tahirih Justice Center, a national nonprofit organization that serves immigrant survivors of gender-based violence. She is still winding through the immigration process five years later.

Besides immigrants’ increased vulnerability to sexual violence, they face a host of mental health and physical challenges, researchers say. They have high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and anxiety, according to a 2024 study.

“Personally, I know anxiety related to the current political climate is precipitating expensive emergency room visits and negatively impacting people’s ability to get to work and make a living,” said Nicole E. Warren, a nurse midwife and an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in Baltimore.

Immigrants without legal status also face increased rates of chronic conditions and higher death rates from preventable diseases due to their limited access to health care and their fear of seeking it, advocates say.

“One of our clients was so afraid to leave her home that she avoided seeking medical care during her pregnancy, out of fear of interacting with ICE,” said Miriam Camero, director of client advocacy, social services, at Tahirih.

Food banks have reported that many immigrants in need of food assistance have stopped coming, for fear of deportation.

It has always been difficult for people without legal immigration status to get help when they need it. The Trump administration’s crackdown on people in the country illegally has intensified the pressure. The situation has also hampered the advocates and attorneys who defend their rights.

“We’re working extra hours to do all the work,” said Vanessa Wilkins, executive director of Tahirih’s office in Atlanta. “The safety planning and added protection that clients might need, including documents just to make sure they are safe, can definitely make you feel overwhelmed.”

U Visas

For domestic abuse survivors without legal status, like the woman from India, going to the authorities seems more fraught amid the immigration crackdown, said Maricarmen Garza, chief counsel of the American Bar Association Commission on Domestic & Sexual Violence.

“There are just no guarantees,” Garza said, “especially with how law enforcement is intertwined in enforcing immigration law.”

In more than half of states, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can collaborate by formal written agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove people in the country illegally. Advocates say this can interfere with victims’ efforts to get a certificate to file for a “U visa,” which would allow them to live and work in the U.S. with the possibility of lawful permanent residency.

The battered woman from India recalls police telling her that if she did not press charges, she could get a certificate for a U visa. She agreed to their suggestion but recalls the anxiety of filing about five abuse reports over two years to get the certificate. “I got panic attacks just writing them down, because it meant I was reliving the situations again,” she said.

When asked for comment about the difficulties immigrant domestic violence victims face, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson touted President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. “The president’s successful effort to deport criminal illegal aliens is making all victims safer and ensuring they will never again be harmed by dangerous criminal illegal aliens,” Jackson said in a statement. She said “allegations without evidence” that immigrants have been told to drop charges “should not be taken seriously.”

Immigrant women without legal status can be particularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation because of language barriers, as well as cultural and social isolation, researchers have found.

According to a 2023 report, lifetime rates of abuse by intimate partners range up to 93% in some immigrant groups, compared with about 41% of U.S.-born women experiencing such abuse in their lifetime.

As the Trump administration reshapes the country’s immigration system, survivors of violence who entered the country illegally have a tough time proving their abuse and trauma to get relief, advocates say.

A refugee health and asylum program at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore provides immigrant victims of abuse with free forensic evaluations to support their claims for humanitarian relief, including applications for U visas.

Warren, the program’s associate director for women’s health, said that in the past, a written affidavit of the clinic’s findings was enough to corroborate an applicant’s legal accounts of past trauma.

“Now, we are getting requests for our in-person testimony,” Warren said.

Application Backlogs

The woman from India applied for a visa after she received a certificate from law enforcement allowing her to do so in 2023. Hers is one of nearly 11.6 million pending visa applications, according to data through June — the highest volume of cases ever recorded by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The number of pending U visa applications is 415,000, according to the agency.

Only about 10,000 U visas are issued per year, and it can take more than seven years to process applications, Garza said.

Adding to the pressure, the Trump administration has reduced the availability of Section 8 housing, which helps low-income individuals and others pay their rent. As of September, people without legal authorization to be in the United States are not eligible to receive rental help over U.S. citizens.

“If Tahirih wasn’t behind me, I could be homeless,” said the woman, who said she can afford only half her rent.

Victims’ advocates say they are working harder than ever to support their clients but are stretched thin as they face federal funding cuts and increased demand.

The Tahirih center reported a 200% increase in call volume in the four months after Trump took office, compared with the same period last year.

“At the end of the day there are a lot of emails and a lot of people we aren’t able to reach as quickly as in the past,” said Casey Carter Swegman, the center’s director of public policy.

To reach immigrant survivors of abuse who are afraid to come forward, advocates are “getting back to basics,” said Joanna Otero-Cruz, executive director and president of the Philadelphia group Women Against Abuse.

“We’re doing grassroots outreach to hairdressers and other small-business owners,” she said. “They’re the eyes and ears for us.”

In Riverhead, New York, a 38-year-old woman who emigrated from El Salvador said she has twice been the victim of domestic abuse but was too scared to report it to police.

She said the second assault was by a man for whom she cooked and cleaned in his home. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of her sense of shame and her fears of deportation, said he raped her, took pictures of her naked, and threatened to put them on social media if she tried to go to the police. He then stalked her, she said.

Noemi Sanchez, Long Island regional coordinator for the Rural & Migrant Ministry, a nonprofit that supports farm workers, is working closely with the woman to elevate her self-esteem and help her understand that “no woman deserves to have a man mistreat them.”

Meanwhile, the survivor from India received a temporary work permit in 2024 and is employed as a certified nursing assistant, which “helps me survive,” she said.

“I have really come a long way,” she added. “It wasn’t easy. I had great support behind me. They didn’t let me down.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 19:57:34.830382

The Future of Federal Civil Rights Protection Administration officials may claim they are carrying out their statutory duties, but the reality is that civil rights enforcement is being stripped of its independence, expertise, and moral authority.
Future administrations will face the enormous challenge of rebuilding what the Trump Administration has dismantled in just nine short months.","Civil rights are the fundamental rights and freedoms granted to individuals and protected by the government, ensuring equal treatment free from discrimination. These rights extend to all aspects of civil life, including employment, housing, voting, education, public accommodation, and healthcare. It is the duty of our federal government, through the Constitution and laws enacted by Congress, to guarantee and safeguard these rights regardless of an individual’s sex, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, or sexual orientation. To aid in doing so, many federal agencies have internal civil rights offices to not only enforce civil rights law, but also to investigate violations made the U.S. government.

Since returning to the White House, the Trump Administration has upended nearly every civil rights office across the federal government by slashing jobs and budgets, leading to hundreds, if not thousands, of investigations left in indefinite limbo or dismissed. Meanwhile, Congress, who created these very offices and is charged with oversight of the federal government, is doing little to ensure the funding they have appropriated is used accordingly, and the offices fulfill their statutory duties.

The following examples illustrate how the Trump Administration, as part of a broader campaign against civil society and free expression, has weaponized and dismantled key watchdog offices throughout the federal government.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

In March, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it would abolish three key civil rights and oversight offices within the department – the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CISOMB), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) – suggesting the offices were a road block to immigration enforcement. These offices served the vital function of independently investigating allegations of abuse and discrimination by DHS components, including by the Transportation Security Agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection, against both American citizens and immigrants alike.

Dozens of employees in each office were fired, taking staffing levels down to the statutorily mandated minimum, often of one single employee. A whistleblower disclosure to Congress alleges that more than 500 civil rights complaints, including allegations of medical neglect, sexual abuse, and discrimination, were abandoned when most employees were fired in March. Following a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups against DHS, the Department committed to preserve the three offices and staff both OIDO and CISOMB with five to seven employees, and CRCL with twenty – still significantly less than the original levels.

The Department of Justice

Established by Congress through the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the Justice Department’s (DOJ) Civil Rights Division (CRT) is responsible for enforcing laws that protect Americans from discrimination in voting, housing, employment, education, and policing.

Under President Trump’s pick to lead CRT, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, priorities have changed. A memo to CRTemployees directed the prioritization of investigations and enforcement in the categories of (1) combatting discrimination, (2) ending antisemitism, (3) protecting women and children, (4) ending “sanctuary” jurisdictions, and (5) the denaturalization of naturalized U.S. citizens. While some of the priorities would seemingly be appropriate, the key is what Trump’s DOJ deemsdiscriminatory or antisemitic. According to reports, CRT has moved quickly to implement these priorities and has dropped investigations and court cases in dozens of cases, some relating to racial discrimination and voting rights. In response to this significant reshaping of CRT, upwards of 300 attorneys have resigned with some offices losing 75% of their attorneys. An employeedescribed the situation as “a complete bloodbath.”

The Department of Education

In late September, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of the Trump Administration in allowing the Department of Education to lay off over half of the staff at the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). OCR is tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in public schools and universities across the country, including discrimination, sexual harassment, and hate crimes. Before President Trump returned to office, OCR was one of the largest offices at the Department, with over 500 employees and 12 regional offices across the country, receiving tens of thousands of complaints a year. Today, OCR staff has been reduced to a fraction of what it once was, at least seven of those 12 regional offices have been closed, and thousands of cases have been dismissed without investigation.

The Trump Administration has diverted significant federal resources in a quest to police free speech, particularly pro-Palestinian speech, and push its policy agenda on campuses. Under the guise of combatting antisemitism and diversity initiatives, the Administration pressured universities deemed as “insufficiently responsive to antisemitism” by threatening to withhold billions in federal funding unless they comply with the Administration’s political demands. Through coordinated investigations and funding threats, these actions have transformed civil rights enforcement from a mechanism of protection into one of political intimidation. The result is a gutted civil rights office that cannot effectively investigate complaints, leaving students vulnerable to violations of their civil rights with no recourse. Or in the alternative, the government weaponizing the charge of antisemitism against students, professors, and administration officials to shut down advocacy for Palestinian human rights.

The Future of Federal Civil Rights Protection

Administration officials may claim they are carrying out their statutory duties, but the reality is that civil rights enforcement is being stripped of its independence, expertise, and moral authority. What remains is a system designed to shield the government from accountability, and weaponize its resources against those it's meant to protect.

Civil rights are not abstract concepts, and neither are the harms when the government violates them. From harassment at airports, selective vetting for immigration benefits, and arbitrary inclusion on no-fly lists, Arab Americans are no strangers to discriminatory government practices, especially after 9/11 and the creation of DHS. Likewise, these protections are not self-sustaining. The responsibility to protect them from executive branch overreach lies with not only Congress and our judicial system, but with every American.

While these offices and previous administrations were not perfect, they are the result of decades of activism from Black, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities and other communities, to ensure equal treatment and accountability. In practice, this means that when a student faces discrimination at school, a traveler is profiled at the airport, an immigrant is disappeared, or an employee is fired for speaking out, federal investigation and enforcement now depends less on justice and more on whether the case advances the President’s political agenda.

The guidance says that such people could become a “public charge” — a potential drain on U.S. resources — because of their health issues or age.
“Certain medical conditions – including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions – can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care.” About 10% of the world’s population has diabetes.
“Do any of the dependents have disabilities, chronic medical conditions, or other special needs and require care such that the applicant cannot maintain employment?” the cable asks.
They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to fill out a form that asks them to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions, or violence.","Foreigners seeking visas to live in the U.S. might be rejected if they have certain medical conditions, including diabetes or obesity, under a Thursday directive from the Trump administration.

The guidance, issued in a cable the State Department sent to embassy and consular officials and examined by KFF Health News, directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the U.S. for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits. The guidance says that such people could become a “public charge” — a potential drain on U.S. resources — because of their health issues or age.

While assessing the health of potential immigrants has been part of the visa application process for years, including screening for communicable diseases like tuberculosis and obtaining vaccine history, experts said the new guidelines greatly expand the list of medical conditions to be considered and give visa officers more power to make decisions about immigration based on an applicant’s health status.

The directive is part of the Trump administration’s divisive and aggressive campaign to deport immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. and dissuade others from immigrating into the country. The White House’s crusade to push out immigrants has included daily mass arrests, bans on refugees from certain countries, and plans to severely restrict the total number permitted into the U.S.

The new guidelines mandate that immigrants’ health be a focus in the application process. The guidance applies to nearly all visa applicants but is likely to be used only in cases in which people seek to permanently reside in the U.S., said Charles Wheeler, a senior attorney for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a nonprofit legal aid group.

“You must consider an applicant’s health,” the cable reads. “Certain medical conditions – including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions – can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care.”

About 10% of the world’s population has diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases are also common; they are the globe’s leading killer.

The cable also encourages visa officers to consider other conditions, like obesity, which it notes can cause asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure, in their assessment of whether an immigrant could become a public charge and therefore should be denied entry into the U.S.

“All of these can require expensive, long-term care,” the cable reads. Spokespeople for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cable.

Visa officers were also directed to determine if applicants have the means to pay for medical treatment without help from the U.S. government.

“Does the applicant have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of such care over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense?” the cable reads.

The cable’s language appears at odds with the Foreign Affairs Manual, the State Department’s own handbook, which says that visa officers cannot reject an application based on “what if” scenarios, Wheeler said.

The guidance directs visa officers to develop “their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future,” he said. “That’s troubling because they’re not medically trained, they have no experience in this area, and they shouldn’t be making projections based on their own personal knowledge or bias.”

The guidance also directs visa officers to consider the health of family members, including children or older parents.

“Do any of the dependents have disabilities, chronic medical conditions, or other special needs and require care such that the applicant cannot maintain employment?” the cable asks.

Immigrants already undergo a medical exam by a physician who’s been approved by a U.S. embassy.

They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to fill out a form that asks them to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions, or violence. They’re also required to have a number of vaccinations to guard against infectious diseases like measles, polio, and hepatitis B.

But the new guidance goes further, emphasizing that chronic diseases should be considered, said Sophia Genovese, an immigration lawyer at Georgetown University. She also noted that the language of the directive encourages visa officers and the doctors who examine people seeking to immigrate to speculate on the cost of applicants’ medical care and their ability to get employment in the U.S., considering their medical history.

“Taking into consideration one’s diabetic history or heart health history — that’s quite expansive,” Genovese said. “There is a degree of this assessment already, just not quite expansive as opining over, ‘What if someone goes into diabetic shock?’ If this change is going to happen immediately, that’s obviously going to cause a myriad of issues when people are going into their consular interviews.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8ce7ec1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+29/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc4%2F8e%2Fd83c9dd244aea617f198727f1930%2Fap-25027517785383-resized.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 16:05:20.959981

But the school district said that it has been upholding the law and will continue to do so.","Indiana’s attorney general is suing the state’s largest public school district, arguing policies at Indianapolis Public Schools are “thwarting” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deportation efforts.

A lawsuit filed Nov. 6 by Attorney General Todd Rokita says the school district is restricting ICE’s access to school grounds, in violation of state law, through policies that don’t allow agents to enter non-public school areas unless they have a judicial warrant or in the case of an emergency.

The district’s policies also illegally prevent school employees, according to a complaint, from helping ICE with enforcement actions.

Under what the attorney general’s office describes as the state’s “anti-sanctuary law,” the lawsuit says public employees are not to be prevented from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement measures.

“Schools across the country are vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens — it’s happened in many other states — and it is essential that ICE be able to take action when that occurs to help keep our kids safe,” Rokita said in a news release .

The school district responds

In a statement critical of Rokita’s lawsuit that was shared with McClatchy News, Indianapolis Public Schools said it is “deeply offended” by the attorney general “dehumanizing our children and their families by labeling them as ‘aliens.’”

The district said it is dedicated to providing a safe environment for all students, characterizing the lawsuit as a “silly” measure motivated by a desire for “political gain.”

“While IPS takes all legal obligations seriously, we respectfully hope that all concerned parties will recognize the heavy burden that silly litigation and political posturing places on students, families, and taxpayers,” the district said.

The lawsuit, which is also represented by America First Policy Institute, a conservative nonprofit foundation, mentions a specific example in which school employees were said to have gotten in the way of ICE deporting a student’s father, leading the attorney general’s office to investigate.

The father had agreed to self-deport and was scheduled to leave the U.S. on a flight on Jan. 8, according to the filing. ICE, however, did not want to force him to leave the country without his son.

ICE reported to the attorney general’s office that the man’s child “had gone to school on the morning of January 8 in apparent disregard of his father’s wish that they depart the country together that afternoon,” the complaint says.

“ICE did not wish to separate the family and therefore sought to reunite the Honduran national with his son so that they could leave the United States together,” the complaint continues.

When ICE reached out to Indianapolis Public Schools for help, the agency “faced significant obstacles — caused by IPS policies and actions,” according to the filing.

The school district said that ICE needed a judicial warrant to assist the man in taking custody of his son for deportation unless agents could show an emergency allowed for the measure, the complaint says.

Instead of working with ICE, the school’s employees are accused of connecting the child with an immigration attorney to help him stay in the U.S.

“Ultimately, IPS — instead of releasing the son to the father’s custody so that the father and son could depart the country together — released the minor to the immigration attorney at the end of the school day,” the complaint says.

The filing argues the school district’s policies caused the father to remain in the U.S. illegally because he missed his deportation flight since he was not reunited with his son.

With the lawsuit, Rokita wants the court to compel the school district’s employees to fully cooperate with immigration enforcement.

But the school district said that it has been upholding the law and will continue to do so.

Warrant needed for private areas of schools

During the start of President Donald Trump’s second presidential term in January, Trump rolled back regulations that barred immigration authorities from schools and other “sensitive” areas, McClatchy News previously reported.

Some states issued guidelines to schools in response, advising employees that ICE isn’t allowed inside school facilities unless they have a specific type of warrant.

Under federal law, for ICE to enter areas of a school that are private — such as classrooms, fenced-in school yards and administrative offices — agents need a judicial warrant, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.

The center notes that the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution “protects school administration personnel, teachers, and students from unreasonable searches and seizures, regardless of their immigration status.”

In a post on X Monday, DHS announced an undocumented immigrant from Mexico was arrested in connection with a shooting ""targeting Border Patrol agents in Chicago."" No identity was released as of Monday afternoon.

DHS said the suspect had previous convictions for unlawful use of a weapon.

""He is currently marked as a violator of the Laken Riley Act, pending charges related to assaulting officer,"" the post read.

The incident unfolded Saturday in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood.

Cell phone video taken at around noon along West 26th Street showed federal agents clashing with neighbors and what appears to be tear gas being deployed. Video showed Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino on the scene, holding what appears to be a canister of tear gas.

Authorities said the incident began near West 26th Street & South Kedzie Avenue. Border Patrol agents were conducting enforcement operations when DHS said a man driving in a black Jeep fired shots at them and took off.

DHS in a statement said ""an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at border patrol’s vehicles"" and ""Chicago Police Department was called for assistance and cleared the scene, calling it a ""dynamic situation.""

The incident later spilled over to West 23rd Street and Sawyer Avenue. Chicago police officers could be seen trying to disperse the crowd. Neighbors said they heard the commotion and went outside to check and saw federal agents walking a young girl in the alley.

One woman who didn't want to show her face on camera said agents were trying to get ahold of the girl's family.

""I just stood in front of the little girl,"" one neighbor said. ""I wrapped my hands around her, I grabbed onto the fence, and I just stayed there and kept telling the agents they couldn’t grab her, she’s a minor. She doesn’t have an adult with her. I don’t know her, I'm just her neighbor.""

The girl's family told Telemundo Chicago that federal agents were looking for her father. The girl's grandmother and another neighbor said, at one point, they tried to search their building.

""They tried to come into my house...trying to say I was hiding someone, which there was no one in my house but my kids, and they insisted,"" the neighbor said. ""They got scared once I told them, 'Show me your warrant, show me your face. Why masks?'""

The girl's grandmother said her son is believed to be at the center of the investigation. He told her he was on his way to her house when the incident unfolded with federal agents.

""He said he didn’t do nothing to them,"" the grandmother said. ""He was coming out of the alley, they rammed him and they shot at him.""

As of Saturday evening, DHS said they were still looking for the alleged shooter. Chicago police said they responded to a call of shots fired at federal agents to secure the area - and that there were no reports of anyone being struck by gunfire.

Montpelier, Vt. – Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund(link is external)","New grants increase capacity of organizations providing due process to those involved in defense removal proceedings at a critical time

Vermont Business Magazine The Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund(link is external) (VILDF) today announced that it has raised more than $500,000 from over 1250 donors across the state since its launch on May 8, 2025. The organization has a goal to raise $1 million to create a sustainable immigration legal defense system in Vermont. The rapid rate of fundraising is because of a groundswell of support all over Vermont. The funds raised are from not just planned events, but also spontaneous gatherings – concerts, parties, art auctions, church gatherings – by people motivated to uphold the right to due process for all persons as it is enshrined in the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution.

VILDF is also announcing a second round of awards to four organizations providing direct legal and interpretation services to those involved in defense removal proceedings: The Vermont Asylum Assistance Project ($100,000), the Vermont Afghan Alliance ($35,900), the Association of Africans Living in Vermont ($82,875), and the Family Room ($12,000).

“Vermonters understand the right to due process isn’t a privilege – it’s a fundamental promise of our democracy. Across our state, from concerts to community suppers, people are raising their voices and contributing their hard-earned dollars to defend that promise,” said State Treasurer Mike Pieciak, who founded VILDF in his personal capacity in May. “When we look out for our neighbors, we strengthen our communities and our country. That spirit of fairness and compassion is what makes me proud to call Vermont home.”

VILDF’s Advisory Committee approved the slate of awards in early November. The Advisory Committee focused on non-profit organizations providing direct legal and interpretation services to those involved in removal proceedings. The United Way of Northwest Vermont, which manages the funds for VILDF, will make the awards.

“Vermont is leading the way in showing how we can come together,” said Senator Kesha Ram Hinsdale, who helped launch VILDF. “The newest awards are investments in the greatest needs our system faces and will help uphold the rights to which every person in our state is entitled.”

The second slate of awards will specifically support additional attorneys and other support for immigrant legal defense.

As a result of these grants, the Vermont Afghan Alliance (VAA) is shifting a significant portion of its in-house attorney time to direct legal defense cases as members of that community legally in the United States contend with removal proceedings despite their status.

The Association of Africans Living in Vermont (AALV) will be able to add to their in-house attorney case load, bring on three legal interns to support case documentation and follow up, and train a new cohort of pro bono attorney volunteers able to more sustainably provide due process during removal proceedings. Based on current activity, AALV anticipates 100 or more removal detention cases in 2025 alone.

The Family Room, which often partners with AALV, will use their grant for interpretation services when necessary for those in different stages of defense removal proceedings. This is especially critical when an attorney is not available.

VAAP’s award is its second $100,000 award from VILDF. VAAP’s first award this past summer funded the deployment of community legal support workers accessible to rural immigrant communities across Vermont, the hiring of 3 new attorney positions and one new executive coordination position (all of whom will be in place by next month), and nearly 100 pro-bono attorneys, paralegals, and interpreters trained. This translated to VAAP’s engagement in 62 removal defense cases with the VAAP attorney as the attorney of record, 27 additional detained clients assisted with at least limited scope representation, and the litigation of 10 bond hearings and 5 habeas/temporary restraining (TRO) actions.

VAAP’s actions mean individuals are less likely to face detention or deportation alone. VILDF’s Advisory Committee has confidence that VAAP’s actions will help Vermont move toward a more sustainable system of legal defense. As a condition of these awards, all grantees are committing to consult with VAAP as Vermont builds a stronger community of practice for immigrant legal defense. For more information about VAAP, please see https://www.vaapvt.org(link is external)

As VAAP executive director, Jill Martin Diaz reflects, “When we walk into Vermont facilities for legal intake, we still see the basics denied: a single landline for multiple volunteer lawyers is not language access, and removal orders entered ‘in absentia’ because custodians fail to produce detainees for remote hearings is not due process. With historic support from the Vermont Immigrant Legal Defense Fund (VILDF), VAAP is mobilizing supervised volunteers inside these facilities to course-correct in real time for people at immediate risk and to maintain the precedent of democratic rule of law for all.”

“For more than a decade, AALV has been proud to serve Vermont’s diverse community by supporting vulnerable noncitizens and ensuring they have access to essential services,” said Nathan Virag, Immigration Attorney at AALV. “With the generous support of the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund, we continue our work providing direct legal defense and representation for individuals facing removal proceedings, as well as advocacy in federal court for the release of detainees. As the needs of our community evolve, AALV remains committed to standing alongside those impacted by changing immigration policies and working with our partners throughout Vermont to ensure that every member of our community is treated with dignity and fairness.”

""What we've witnessed over the last year has been absolutely heartbreaking. Some Afghan allies who risked their lives in support of U.S. military and diplomatic missions in Afghanistan, detained by ICE and a government meant to protect them,” said Molly Gray, Executive Director of the VAA. “The VT Afghan Alliance is grateful to the Fund's founders, and to all Vermonters who have contributed to this effort. With the Fund's support, the Alliance will help protect the due process rights of our new neighbors and try to prevent deportation and ultimately persecution at the hands of the Taliban.""

“United Way exists to meet the needs our community tells us matter most – and Vermonters have spoken clearly,” said United Way of Northwest Vermont CEO Jesse Bridges. “As fiscal sponsor of the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund, we’re proud to leverage our capacity to help raise resources and partner with trusted organizations to impact our community. This is trust-based philanthropy in action, and it’s how we meet the moment with responsiveness and dignity.”

“As I read this MOU and the executive order I do believe that they are consistent,” said James Benjamin, who is the attorney for Baltimore County.
But there are sharp differences of opinion about whether that executive order and the MOU with ICE can coexist.
Don Mohler, who was Kamenetz’s chief of staff when he signed the executive order in 2017, said the MOU approved by County Executive Kathy Klausmeier’s administration remains true to Kamenetz’s order.
Mohler said, “All of the approaches taken by County Executive Kamenetz, County Executive Olszewski, County Executive Klausmeier, have all been designed to be constitutionally solid and common sense approaches to public safety.” At last week’s protest there was anger that the county would cut any kind of deal with ICE.","In 2017, then-Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz signed an executive order, in part to protect immigrants who are in the county jail from federal authorities.

That order remains in place.

But there are those who believe that executive order is threatened by a recently signed agreement between the county and Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE.

The order states that no one in the county jail will be detained beyond their court-ordered release date unless there is a criminal warrant signed by a judicial official.

During the 2017 signing ceremony for the order Kamenetz said that “the existence of a written executive order is going to give people in the community assurances and security.”

Fast forward to 2025 and Baltimore County says there is nothing new here. The Memorandum of Understanding or MOU with ICE puts on paper what they’ve been doing at the county jail since last year.

“As I read this MOU and the executive order I do believe that they are consistent,” said James Benjamin, who is the attorney for Baltimore County.

The MOU says the county must contact ICE before someone with a federal immigration detainer or a judicial warrant is released. Then ICE will decide whether it will take custody of the inmate.

But there are sharp differences of opinion about whether that executive order and the MOU with ICE can coexist.

David Rocah, senior staff attorney with the Maryland American Civil Liberties Union, said the 2024 policy that the MOU is tied to states that the county can hold inmates for ICE beyond their release date, either up to four hours or two days depending on the type of detainer.

Speaking at a rally against the MOU in Towson last week, Rocah called it a betrayal of Kamenetz’s executive order.

“Baltimore County has no authority, none, to detain people for ICE after a judge or a jury orders their release,” Rocah said. “That’s unconstitutional.”

A county spokesman said as a practice no one is being held in the county jail beyond their release date.

Rocah said another problem with the MOU is that the county is making promises with ICE it can’t keep about notification of inmate release dates because they often are not known in advance.

“They may be released on conditions, or released on their own recognizance, or the charges may be dismissed or they may have a trial and are acquitted,"" Rocah said in an interview.

Cori Alonso-Yoder, assistant professor of law and the director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Maryland’s Carey School of Law, said the people most likely to get snagged by the county’s MOU with ICE aren’t the ones who are living in the U.S. without permission, but those who are playing by the rules, and therefore are on ICE’s radar screen.

“I think that’s part of the trouble with the way this policy is being laid out is there’s this diffusion of individual enforcement against folks who are likely not the ones who are most dangerous to the community,” Alonso-Yoder said.

Kamenetz died in 2018. Don Mohler, who was Kamenetz’s chief of staff when he signed the executive order in 2017, said the MOU approved by County Executive Kathy Klausmeier’s administration remains true to Kamenetz’s order.

Mohler said, “All of the approaches taken by County Executive Kamenetz, County Executive Olszewski, County Executive Klausmeier, have all been designed to be constitutionally solid and common sense approaches to public safety.”

At last week’s protest there was anger that the county would cut any kind of deal with ICE. There were signs that said things like “Democracy Not Dictatorship” and “Neighbors Not Targets.”

“We should not encourage masked individuals with heavy weapons to enter our public buildings, our schools, our faith-based institutions, our places or worship,” said Baltimore County Councilman Izzy Patoka, a Democrat. “That is not what we ought to be agreeing to. But folks I think that's what we agreed to.""

But the county says that is not what was agreed to.

Klausmeier’s press secretary, Dakarai Turner, said Patoka is weaponizing misinformation for political purposes.

“The mere suggestion that this agreement invites masked and armed people into our schools or places of worship evokes disturbing imagery and stirs painful memories,” Turner said in a statement. “Spreading misinformation does nothing to make people safe, it is instead a disservice to the people of Baltimore County and a devaluation of responsible discourse.”

The county points out that the MOU is not a 287G agreement. That’s when local police officers are in essence deputized to help with federal immigration enforcement. That is not happening.

The driver for the county to sign the MOU is the threat of losing federal money, because earlier this year the county landed on the Justice Department’s list of sanctuary jurisdictions. It gets about $400 million a year from the feds, which makes up roughly nine percent of its revenue.

County attorney Benjamin said. “There was concern obviously about impacts to federal funding so we wanted to work and be able to memorialize what has already been in place so that way we’ll be able to get off the list.”

County Executive Klausmeier says it never should have been on the sanctuary jurisdiction list. Officials say it happened because ICE thought the county was ignoring its immigration detainers when in fact ICE was sending them to the wrong agencies.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4ad810/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1760x924+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7b%2Fc4%2F6265a48d465c96773cf9f4d24f73%2Fkamenetz.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 17:57:13.704868

According to a recent announcement, Baltimore County has been removed from a list of localities that were designated by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as sanctuary jurisdictions. The press release from Baltimore County shares that a recent memorandum of understanding between the county and DHS clarifies county procedures that have been in place since before the current federal administration took over.

As previously covered on Conduit Street, DHS published an initial list in August that included eight counties and Baltimore City but that list was quickly removed following backlash from a number of associations including the National Sheriffs’ Association (NSA). Since that time the list was revised leaving just Baltimore County as the only location in Maryland, but has now been removed.

Following the original DHS announcement, members of the NSA – many of whom manage local law enforcement and corrections in the listed jurisdictions – responded immediately in a statement reiterating their disappointment and a need for better coordination and communication from DHS:

This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label. The completion and publication of this list has not only violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement, but it also has the potential to strain the relationship between Sheriffs and the White House administration. This is an unfortunate and unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement and the enforcement of the rule of law at a time when that unity is needed most.

Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, is home to some 650,000 people, roughly 1 in 9 of whom were born outside the United States.
He confirmed to Bolts after his victory that he intends to terminate the 287(g) agreement once he enters office.
Partnerships with ICE, and 287(g) agreements in particular, have been a flashpoint in sheriff’s elections since the first Trump administration.
“I don’t know anybody that has called the police since this 287(g) has passed,” Lawton told Bolts.","Angela Staffareni, an organizer and immigrant advocate in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, became a citizen in October and promptly registered to vote for the first time. She awoke Wednesday “full of hope and happiness” because Sheriff Fred Harran, a Republican who has closely partnered with ICE, had been defeated, thanks in part to her vote.

“We finally have a little change,” Staffareni told Bolts. “I know ICE will still be here, but at least in our community we get some sense of peace. People haven’t wanted to go church, to concerts, to public events, because everybody is thinking they’re going to be taken.”

Many in this county were outraged when Harran in April signed an agreement to assist federal immigration authorities through ICE’s 287(g) program. Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, is home to some 650,000 people, roughly 1 in 9 of whom were born outside the United States.

Since Donald Trump’s return to office, local and state agencies across the country have rushed in huge numbers to aid his deportation campaign by joining 287(g), which authorizes local law enforcement officers to act as federal immigration agents. The agreement in Bucks County granted Harran’s deputies the power to question the immigration status of people they encounter and to serve and execute arrest warrants on ICE’s behalf.

Harran faced pushback from his own county’s commissioners, who argued he had no authority to sign the contract. He also faced a lawsuit from the ACLU and protests from angry residents. And his Democratic challenger, Danny Ceisler, a 33-year-old attorney and Army veteran, spoke up against the ICE partnership, putting the issue at the center of his campaign.

Ceisler defeated Harran by 11 percentage points last week, a margin of roughly 25,000 votes. He confirmed to Bolts after his victory that he intends to terminate the 287(g) agreement once he enters office.

“It makes immigrant communities afraid to call the police,” Ceisler said. “You’re talking about some of the most vulnerable members of society, who not only need to be able to call the police for their own protection, but to report crime, which affects everybody.”

Ceisler hopes officials in other parts of the country are watching. “It sends a message to elected public safety leaders across the country that partnering with ICE is a loser in any district that’s remotely a swing district,” he said.

Bucks County is about as politically competitive as can be, with Trump carrying it by 274 votes out of nearly 400,000 last fall, but on Tuesday the local Democratic Party experienced a triumphant night beyond Ceisler. Amid high turnout for a municipal cycle, Democrats also won the district attorney election for the first time since the 1960s, flipped the controller’s office, and solidified their power on local school boards that as recently as 2023 were banning books and pride flags.

Bucks County stood out this fall as a rare sheriff’s race with immigration enforcement at the forefront. Partnerships with ICE, and 287(g) agreements in particular, have been a flashpoint in sheriff’s elections since the first Trump administration. In past cycles, Democrats who have promised to end these agreements have flipped sheriff’s offices from Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) and Wake County (Raleigh), North Carolina, to Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

But that energy was largely absent this year, in part because relatively few sheriff’s offices were on the ballot across the country. (There’ll be hundreds of sheriff’s races next year, including in counties that contract with ICE.) Some GOP sheriffs who’ve helped ICE did stand for re-election this year in competitive counties but faced no Democratic opponents, frustrating immigrants’ rights advocates, including in Erie County (Buffalo), New York, and Chesapeake, Virginia.

Sheriffs in Pennsylvania have limited powers compared to those in other states, so Bucks County was an unlikely host for the year’s sheriff election most defined by immigration enforcement.

In most of the rest of the country, sheriffs run jails and very often perform at least some patrol work. The 287(g) program empowers law enforcement officers to conduct tasks associated with immigration enforcement in those settings, during everyday police work or when people are booked in jail, which makes the program pipeline to deportation.

But the Bucks County sheriff’s office does not run the local jail. It also doesn’t run regular patrols, as daily police work here is conducted by 39 town and city departments. (The Trump administration has revived a 287(g) model that empowers local police to stop and question people about immigration status during patrols; no department in Bucks County participates in this program.) The office’s main responsibilities include staffing local courts, conducting evictions, serving warrants, and transporting incarcerated people to and from their court appearances.

Ceisler said the 287(g) agreement in Bucks County had the greatest potential for impact in the execution of bench warrants, more than 5,000 of which are outstanding there today.

“The reality is I can’t stop ICE itself from coming into the county,” Ceisler said. “What I can do is prevent the 17 deputies who were trained to be de facto ICE agents from doing that work.”

Immigrant advocates say Ceisler’s win is significant for reasons beyond the details of the current 287(g) arrangement.

“Harran saying he was going to collaborate was more than enough to create this fear in the community,” said Andrea Lawton, an activist originally from Guatemala, who runs a 600-member WhatsApp group in Doylestown, the seat of Bucks County.

She said that many who are vulnerable to immigration enforcement do not distinguish among local agencies. Just knowing that the sheriff’s office was involved with ICE in this way, she said, made people in her network distrustful of all police—even though the sheriff’s office is the only law enforcement agency in Bucks County currently involved in the 287(g) program.

“I don’t know anybody that has called the police since this 287(g) has passed,” Lawton told Bolts. “Because they don’t trust them. Domestic violence and labor abuse and all kinds of things are happening and nobody’s going to help.”

In part out of fear of Harran’s office, people in Lawton’s WhatsApp network have lately reported not wanting to go to work, take kids to school, or appear in court. Trump’s re-election fundamentally changed daily life in the county for many, she said, and the sheriff’s willing collaboration only heightened the concern. Lawton has been a citizen since 2006, but even she moves more carefully these days.

“We are the workforce of this county and they’ve been after all of us,” Lawton said.

“Everybody in kitchens in Doylestown are Latinos,” she added, “mostly from Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico. All the pizzerias here, all the restaurants, landscaping, cleaning, construction. People are posting on the group that they don’t want to leave their houses, they don’t want to attend activities, because they’re afraid.” She continued in Spanish, “Es un ambiente de miedo.”

Ceisler told Bolts that he has appointed Heidi Roux, director of a local legal aid group called Immigrant Rights Action, to his transition team, and he promised to meet with affected groups as he shapes plans before being sworn into office in January.

Lawton feels encouraged by this. “One person doesn’t have all the power,” she said. “The community has to be united because things are going to continue the way they were. We’re still under the Trump administration, but at least we have hope. Just give us hope.”",https://boltsmag.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Image-from-iOS-scaled-e1762801257284.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 18:57:18.141519

“The American people want us to stand and fight for health care,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
Federal workers get a reprieve The package seeks to roll back some of the Trump administration’s shutdown-related hits to the federal workforce.
“We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits” Jeffries said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A legislative package to end the government shutdown appears on track Monday after a handful of Senate Democrats joined with Republicans to break the impasse in what has become a deepening disruption of federal programs and services, the longest in history.

What’s in and out of the bipartisan deal drew sharp criticism and leaves few senators fully satisfied. The legislation provides funding to reopen the government, including for SNAP food aid and other programs, while also ensuring backpay for furloughed federal workers the Trump administration had left in doubt.

But notably lacking is any clear resolution to expiring health care subsidies that Democrats have been fighting for as millions of Americans stare down rising insurance premiums. That debate was pushed off for a vote next month, weeks before the subsidies are set to expire.

President Donald Trump noted the deal as he arrived at the White House after watching the Washington Commanders’ game on Sunday evening against the Detroit Lions, on the 40th day of the funding lapse. “It looks like we’re getting close to the shutdown ending,” he said.

The Senate could wrap up passage as soon as Monday. The bill cleared a procedural hurdle, 60-40, late Sunday, with eight Democrats joining most Republicans. In a rare dissent, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York voted against because it failed to fully address the health care funds.

It would next go to the House, where lawmakers have been away since September but were being told to prepare to return to Washington this week. Then, it’s to Trump’s desk for his signature.

Here’s a look at the deal as it’s moving through Congress:

Funding to reopen the government, for now

Included is funding to keep much of the federal government running for the next couple of months, to Jan. 30, with a stopgap measure. It largely funds government operations at their current rates.

Yet in a breakthrough for what’s considered a more normal appropriations process, the package also includes several bills to fully fund other government operations including agricultural programs and military construction along with veterans’ affairs for the full fiscal year, through September 2026.

Additionally, the package ensures states would be reimbursed for money they spent to keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, running during the shutdown.

Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said she was “relieved.”

“This shutdown has gone on far too long,” she said. “And I also think it’s highly significant that we’ll have three yearlong appropriations bills attached. Veterans Day is coming very soon, and it would be wonderful if we get the full-year Veterans Affairs bill signed into law.”

Health care funding still up for debate

The Democrats failed to secure their main demand during the shutdown, which was an extension of the health care subsidies that many of the 24 million people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act rely on to help defray costs.

Instead, the package guarantees a vote on the issue in December — which was not enough for most of the Democrats, who rejected the deal and voted against it.

“The American people want us to stand and fight for health care,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

Federal workers get a reprieve

The package seeks to roll back some of the Trump administration’s shutdown-related hits to the federal workforce. Employees have faced repeated threats of firings and mass layoffs this year.

The stopgap measure reinstates federal workers who had received reductions in force, or layoff, notices and protects against such future actions.

It also would provide back pay for federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay during the shutdown — something that’s traditionally provided but that the Trump administration had threatened was not guaranteed.

Getting the bill to the president’s desk

Political and procedural hurdles remain as Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, slogs through more voting and the shutdown entered its 41st day Monday.

Senators hope to skip past a series of steps that could drag voting out all week if the dissenters put up a prolonged fight.

One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against advancing the package Sunday, and he is said to have concerns over a hemp industry provision. And three ultra-conservative GOP senators held up voting for more than two hours as they demanded consideration of their ideas. It is unclear if any of them plans to stage further protests.

Democrats, who have fought for the past month in their hopes of preserving the health care subsidies, also could delay final passage, and their next steps are uncertain.

And the package faces fresh scrutiny once it goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana holds a slim GOP majority and would likely need almost all Republicans to support the bill in the face of objections from Democrats who are holding out for the health care funds.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the party will fight the bill, forcing the Republicans in the House to pass it largely on their own.

“We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits” Jeffries said. “Donald Trump and the Republican Party own the toxic mess they have created.”

It leaves one of his biggest policy initiatives hanging in the balance.

While upholding the tariffs would mark a vast expansion of presidential power, striking them down could unleash a host of dilemmas for Trump — from mass payouts to finding new legal authority to push his priorities across the line.

What would await the administration, in the words of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, is “a mess.”

Refunds for companies

The Trump administration has acknowledged that a Supreme Court loss would mean refunds of the billions in tariff revenue already collected.

It convinced lower courts to pause their rulings invalidating the tariffs in part because of concerns the refunds could be issued, only for the Supreme Court to potentially declare the tariffs legal and make it difficult to claw back the cash.

Refunds for the group of small businesses challenging Trump’s tariffs at the high court would be the most straightforward; the administration already agreed to pay them back if it loses.

As for the others, Neal Katyal, who represented the businesses at the argument, told Barrett “it’s a very complicated thing” that involves formal protests and administrative procedures.

“So, a mess?” Barrett responded.

Katyal replied, “So, it’s difficult, absolutely.”

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told Fox News on Thursday that he’ll “hand that file” to the Treasury Department to process refunds if the court rules for the challengers.

“You’ll have all these importers and importing interests who are going to want that money back,” Greer said. “And so, we’ll have to figure out probably with the court what kind of a schedule might look like and what are the rights of these parties and what rights the government has to that money.”

Following the argument, businesses have already piled on new lawsuits in the Court of International Trade to ensure they’re in place.

“This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA [International Emergency Economic Powers Act] duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief,” Turn5, an auto parts e-commerce business, wrote in a lawsuit filed Thursday.

The government has confronted the problem before, after the Supreme Court in 1998 struck down a harbor maintenance tax as unconstitutional. It led to a new round of litigation that lasted roughly two years as companies fought for refunds.

But that battle involved only about $750 million, far less than the billions of dollars already collected under Trump’s new levies. Greer told Fox News the “reciprocal” tariffs are already more than $100 billion.

Trump has said a loss would turn the United States into a “third-world country” and casts the case as a life-or-death moment. He reiterated his concerns following the Supreme Court arguments, where justices appeared skeptical of the administration’s arguments, when asked about his plans should the high court rule against the White House.

The president contended the government would have to pay back “trillions of dollars” because it’s taken in as much from the tariffs. A loss would also affect trade deals his administration made based on projected trade earnings, he said.

“I’m going to hope that we win,” Trump said Thursday. “I can’t imagine that anybody would do that kind of devastation to our country.”

Once resolved, the funds would go back into the companies’ coffers, because they were legally liable to front the costs. But Americans who paid inflated prices because of the tariffs would likely not see the money return to their pockets.

Seek out new tariff options

An adverse Supreme Court decision could bar Trump from invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement the bulk of his sweeping tariff agenda.

It would force the president to seek out other statutes to effectuate his overhaul of global trade.

“There is a whole host of statutes in the tariff architecture of Title 19, which both expressly confer the power to tariff and always impose clear limits,” Katyal said, referring to the section of law that deals with customs duties.

Katyal listed several options, including sections 122, 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930. Later in the argument, he referenced Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, as well.

Under Section 122 authority, Trump could impose tariffs up to 15 percent for up to 150 days over unbalanced trade, though it has not been used before.

The president could invoke Section 201 authority to impose duties if an increase in imports is causing or threatening “serious injury” to American manufacturers, after the U.S. International Trade Commission has investigated and made findings.

Using Section 232 authority, Trump could impose restrictions on imports if the U.S. secretary of Commerce determines, after an investigation, that some circumstance of those imports “threaten to impair” national security.

Trump could direct the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to impose tariffs as an enforcement measure of American rights under trade agreements and in response to certain foreign trade practices, following the office’s investigation, using Section 301 authority.

And by invoking Section 338 authority, the president could place tariffs on imports “whenever he shall find as a fact” that the foreign nations impose “unreasonable” charges or discriminate against U.S. commerce. Those levies may not exceed 50 percent. No president has used that measure, either.

“You can recreate some of what they want to do,” said John Yoo, a University of California, Berkeley professor and former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, at a panel during the Federalist Society’s annual conference.

Nazak Nikakhtar, partner and chair of the firm Wiley Rein’s national security practice, noted at the same event that every trade statute that allows the president to tariff “expressly says ‘duties’” and spells out a process.

“IEEPA looks very different, and I think based on textual [arguments], the president is likely to lose,” she said.

Justice Samuel Alito said during Wednesday’s argument that it’s a “realistic possibility” for the administration to try a new approach.

But Trump would then attempt to collect the tariffs under a new legal authority and, inevitably, the plaintiffs would take him back to court.

“And it would have to progress through those lower courts and come back to us when — a year from now? Six months from now? While the tariffs continue to be collected, and the amount that’s at stake mounts into the billions?” the conservative justice said.

“I mean, what are we at now, a hundred billion? We get up to — up to a trillion?” he continued. “That’s what you’re suggesting?”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/scotus_trump_tarrifs_110525gn05_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-10 17:02:04.219784

The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens.
Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there.
Despite Equatorial Guinea's oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty.
Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration made a $7.5 million payment to the government of Equatorial Guinea as it seeks to deport people to the West African country and draws closer to its heavily prosecuted leaders, according to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that “this highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.""

Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would “far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined” to the country.

The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money.

The State Department declined to comment on the details of diplomatic communications, but said, “Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State. As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”

As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust.

The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the “third country” policy as a reckless tactic that violates due process rights and can strand deportees in countries with long histories of human rights violations and corruption.

At the same time, the Trump administration has developed ties with the vice president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro “Teddy” Nguema Obiang, who is notorious among world leaders accused of corruption for a lavish lifestyle that has attracted the attention of prosecutors in several countries.

The AP has reported that the State Department granted a sanctions waiver to allow him to travel to a high-level U.N. gathering in New York in September and visit other American cities. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau also met with Obiang.

Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there.

Obiang is the son and presumed successor of Equatorial Guinea’s longtime ruler. He's accused of decades of corruption and abuse of power. The vice president, who oversees national defense and security, has been under international sanctions for years and faces allegations of siphoning state wealth while most people live in poverty.

Despite Equatorial Guinea's oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Obiang's father, is Africa’s longest-serving president, holding power since 1979.

In 2017, a French court found the younger Obiang guilty of laundering and embezzling millions of euros, handing down a three-year suspended sentence and a 30 million euro fine as well as ordering the confiscation of his luxury Paris properties and car collection worth tens of millions. Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice.

U.S. prosecutors also reached a $30 million settlement with Obiang in 2014. He had to surrender assets, including a Malibu mansion, a Ferrari and Michael Jackson memorabilia.

I’m now trying to reopen my asylum case as part of new proceedings.
At the moment, I’m awaiting two rulings: one on my release from immigration detention, and another on my asylum case.
The biggest wave of Russians seeking political asylum in the U.S. came in 2022–2023, during the Biden administration.","In the 10 months since Donald Trump returned to the presidency, U.S. federal immigration agents have begun carrying out frequent raids of American cities in search of people to deport. Twice over the summer, large groups of Russian nationals were expelled from the country, and at least two of them were arrested immediately after returning to Russia. As of late August, about 200,000 people had been deported from the U.S. during Trump’s second term. Meduza spoke with three Russians who applied for asylum in the U.S. because they feared persecution at home, but whose applications were denied. They’re now living as undocumented immigrants, knowing they could be deported at any time.

Eduard Glezin

Asylum application rejected after 11 years of waiting

In 2014, when [Ella] Pamfilova took over as Russia’s human rights commissioner, I was fired from that agency’s press service. Until then, all attempts by the security services to go after me for my [pro-democracy] activism had been fended off by [Vladimir] Lukin, who had been my boss for 10 years. Before my dismissal, the new head of HR put together a file of compromising material on me — including all the police reports from my detentions at protests and the corresponding court rulings. He told me he would hand everything over to his colleagues at the Federal Security Service (FSB), where he himself had worked until recently, to “check for extremism.” That could have landed me in prison for up to five years. So I decided to leave quickly.

I believed that America was the one country that could guarantee my safety. I had no dream of buying a villa or a yacht — I just wanted to save my life. My English wasn’t great, I had never been to the U.S., and I didn’t have any family there. Still, I took the risk: I came on a tourist visa and later applied for political asylum.

Back in 2014, I had to start my life from scratch. In Russia, I held a PhD in history and worked in an office. Here, I worked at a gas station, as a waiter, and as a cab driver. Now I’m a long-haul trucker — the best-paying of all the jobs I’ve had, and one of the few open to me. But I’m about to lose even that: under a new regulation, only U.S. citizens or green card holders are allowed to drive large trucks. At the same time, I need money to pay a lawyer — around $20,000. Considering I also have to cover rent, the situation is tough.

By law, the period between applying for asylum and being called in for an interview with an immigration officer is supposed to be 45 days at most. But I had to wait 11 years. The authorities say these kinds of delays are due to a personnel shortage, but I suspect the real reason is that they’re waiting for applicants to give up and move elsewhere — or for the regimes they fled to change, so that their asylum claims no longer have grounds.

In early October 2025, my asylum claim was denied. I got the sense that the officer interviewing me had already decided to reject my case before we even spoke. He was extremely biased during the interview, and he refused to consider a report detailing the current situation in Russia, an expert statement about my case, and other evidence. He asked a lot of irrelevant questions but never the most important one: why I left Russia.

I told him about my dismissal and the threats of criminal prosecution only in my closing statement — the only opportunity I had after the interview. The officer also ignored the fact that because of my posts on Facebook and VKontakte, Roskomnadzor had repeatedly sent me letters accusing me of “discrediting” the Russian army and spreading “fake news” about it, promoting terrorism and extremism, destabilizing the public order, and personally “discrediting” Comrade Putin.

I watched justice die right before my eyes. All the immigration officers and judges [who handle asylum cases] are just bureaucrats forced to follow orders from above. In closed Facebook groups for immigrants, people often share reports about judges being fired for approving more than half of asylum applications. They’re replaced by more “disciplined” military lawyers who are instructed to follow directives and deny people residency.

I came to the U.S. before Donald Trump became president. Under [Barack] Obama and [Joe] Biden, there were no plans to deport a million migrants a year. It’s immigrants who make America great — and now the country is undermining the foundation of its own economy.

The situation has gotten even worse now, because ICE has begun patrolling highways and specifically targeting truckers. If I get caught in one of these raids, I’ll be sent to detention, which would make working with my lawyer much harder. They’ll take away my phone, and I won’t be able to make calls without special permission. And prison guards treat detainees far worse than the police do. In practice, if I’m stopped on the road, deportation will be inevitable.

After I went public about my situation this fall, human rights organizations from Poland and France reached out to me. They’re now reviewing my application for a humanitarian visa.

Many [immigrants in situations like mine] prefer to stay silent, hoping for a favorable court decision. I’ve chosen to speak out — to warn anyone planning to leave Russia to think very carefully before seeking asylum in America under the current administration.

Vladislav Krasnov

Spent more than a year and a half in detention before having his asylum application denied in spring 2025

In Russia, I volunteered with [late opposition leader Alexey Navalny’s] Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) and was one of the organizers of the “indefinite protest” [against pension reform in 2018]. For obvious reasons, my family and I didn’t want to have anything to do with the war in Ukraine — not even indirectly, by paying taxes. So we decided to leave the country. Besides, my colleague Dima Ivanov had just been sentenced to eight and a half years in prison, and I didn’t want to share his fate. I decided to move to the U.S. — I believed asylum cases there were reviewed impartially and that officials actually looked at the evidence.

At first, I tried to apply for a student visa — my plan was to improve my English and get a degree. But my application was rejected. I felt unsafe in the country where I was staying at the time, so I decided to try reaching the U.S. through Mexico. I went alone; my family stayed behind. I downloaded the CBP One app in advance — it had been introduced by the Biden administration to help asylum seekers avoid crossing the border illegally. Through the app, I notified U.S. border officials of my intention to apply for asylum, and I was assigned a specific time to cross.

As far as I know, everyone who crossed that way was processed properly: they submitted fingerprints, filled out the necessary paperwork, and awaited their asylum hearings while free. But by August 2023, when I reached the border, Biden had apparently issued informal instructions for some migrants to be detained for “extra screening.”

After I crossed the U.S. border I was sent to a holding cell — a 20-square-meter room packed with 25 people. We slept on yoga mats and covered ourselves with foil blankets. A week later, I was inexplicably transferred to Mississippi — a different state, meaning a different jurisdiction. I had been headed to California, where I had a sponsor and friends, and where asylum cases are approved much more often than in Republican-run Mississippi or Louisiana. In those states, the statistics are grim: judges approve barely two percent of asylum claims.

I went through my interview, but I wasn’t released from detention. Officers were letting maybe one person out of every 50 go free, even though our cases and evidence were practically identical. I ended up stuck in detention for three weeks, in a barracks with 75 beds for 150 people. The routine was absurd: breakfast at 4:00 a.m., lunch at 10:00, dinner at 4:00 p.m. Communication was another problem — some people couldn’t reach their families for weeks. It was, in a word, absurd.

I spent more than six months in detention. After my interview, I was scheduled for a court hearing in Los Angeles in 2024 — but a few days later I received a letter saying my case had been transferred to Louisiana. It’s a Republican state, and some lawyers call it a “deportation hub.”

On March 1 — the day of Navalny’s funeral — I was brought before the court. I presented evidence showing I faced persecution in Russia: court records, letters from [human rights activist] Lev Ponomaryov, TV Rain, and [human rights organization] OVD-Info confirming that I had volunteered with FBK, that they knew me personally, and that I was in real danger. But it wasn’t enough. Instead of discussing my case, the judge fixated on the fact that I had been an election observer, and we spent an hour talking about the Russian electoral system.

My lawyer made several mistakes that affected the outcome — for example, he failed to submit my full persecution history. As a result, the case materials contained inconsistencies.

Later, I obtained additional evidence: a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights confirming that my detentions in Russia had been unlawful; interviews I’d given to media outlets like The Guardian; and new letters of support from Memorial, [Russian opposition politician Ilya] Yashin, and many other public figures.

After the hearing, I filed an appeal — and while it was pending, I learned that my lawyer had lost his license. In July, I found a new attorney, but in August I was put in cuffs — on both my hands and feet, like in a movie — and transferred from Louisiana to New Jersey for deportation.

At the airport, I managed to talk to the officers out of putting me on the plane. I gave them my appeal number and insisted they take me back to detention. I’ve heard that in cases like this, people are sometimes literally shoved onto planes, kicked inside, and sent to Russia via Dubai, Cairo, Istanbul, or Qatar.

When I was brought back to Louisiana, I was released from detention under a pre-trial agreement, thanks to the fact that I had joined a lawsuit against former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In late October, after 14.5 months in custody, I finally left Louisiana and went to California, where a friend who had agreed to sponsor me took me in.

I’m now trying to reopen my asylum case as part of new proceedings. Appeals don’t take new evidence into account — which is why I had to rely on the limited documents my first lawyer filed. Now I’m determined to see this case through.

At the same time, I can’t leave the U.S. After my release, I had no documents — they were taken when I crossed the border. I don’t know where they are now, and after so many transfers, I doubt they’ve survived.

These days, I’ve found a kind of calm — a “zen” about it all. It was hard at first, especially being away from my family, and particularly in detention. I was there when detainees were still given 500 free phone minutes, but that program ended in June 2024, and now every call costs money.

A lot of people break down in immigration detention. There are no clear timelines for legalization, and in Republican states, under Trump’s current policies, getting asylum is practically impossible. In the end, many simply give up and ask to be sent back.

Spent more than two years in migration detention and has appealed his deportation ruling

Russia’s armed attack on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, was a shock unlike anything I had ever experienced. Comparable only to losing someone close to you. Over the next couple of months, as reports of war crimes mounted and most Russians remained indifferent, it became clear to me that I couldn’t go on living in that kind of environment.

I staged a one-man protest in my city and was given a jail sentence for it. Afterward, security officers came to warn me — along with my 83-year-old, seriously ill mother — that if I didn’t stop, I would end up in prison. My mother was in tears, begging me not to go out again.

But I wanted to protest constantly — almost every time I read the news from Ukraine. I promised my mother I would stop and started preparing to leave the country. I wrapped up work projects, sold some property, and began the process of getting my passport for foreign travel.

After the announcement of Russia’s “partial mobilization,” I bought a ticket to Yerevan. During my first months abroad, I realized I needed to move on — Armenia wasn’t my culture, even though it’s a democratic country and generally friendly to Russians.

I hadn’t planned to seek asylum anywhere. I considered applying for a German work visa, but at 45, I was told by an integration center that health insurance becomes significantly more expensive at that age and that employers rarely hire “older” applicants.

Europe also felt closer to me than the U.S., but by 2023, I couldn’t find a way to get there from Armenia. Meanwhile, several of my acquaintances had gone to the United States. After crossing the border from Mexico, they received local driver’s licenses, work permits and waited for their asylum hearings while living freely.

One of them advised me to do the same. He didn’t regret his choice — and still doesn’t — and I respected him enough to follow his example. It never occurred to me that I might end up in immigration detention. There was the CBP One app, which seemed like a perfectly legal way to enter the U.S. All the online reviews I found were positive: people waited for their assigned date, crossed the border, received a “Form I-94,” and lived legally in the U.S. while awaiting their court date. There was no mention of arrests or detention.

I flew to Mexico City in July 2023 and registered in the CBP One app the same day. At the end of August, I was told to appear at a specific location and time for an appointment with a border officer at the San Ysidro Pedestrian Crossing.

My asylum request was denied in May 2024 — because I had traveled back to Russia few times from Armenia to wrap up personal affairs. The judge decided my encounters with the police didn’t amount to persecution. I was dissatisfied with the ruling and felt I hadn’t been given a full chance to present my arguments in court.

I appealed to a higher authority, but the appeal was rejected, fully upholding the immigration judge’s decision. At first, I resigned myself to it and began preparing for deportation. (Immigration authorities had ruled to send me to Russia, even though I asked to be deported to Armenia.) But when I reread the decision, I realized how superficial it was — it failed to address key arguments I had raised on appeal, such as my involvement in Navalny-linked organizations and my financial support for them. On top of that, I could face prosecution in Russia for donations I made from Armenia to Ukrainian charities.

So without much hope, I filed a second appeal while continuing to prepare for deportation. To my surprise, the federal appellate court was sympathetic: it appointed a pro bono lawyer for me and issued an order halting my deportation. Now I’m waiting for the final decision, which could come any day.

In addition, in June I filed a motion in a federal district court in Pennsylvania, arguing that my detention had dragged on too long. During the hearing, the federal judge sided with me and criticized ICE for keeping me locked up without sufficient justification.

At the moment, I’m awaiting two rulings: one on my release from immigration detention, and another on my asylum case. If deportation does happen, I’ll try to escape during a flight transfer — to avoid being sent back to Russia. I know of cases where deportees managed to pull that off. Much will depend on the country the layover is in — and, of course, on luck. So far, I haven’t had much of that.

A human rights advocate’s take

Anna Shumova, chair of the board of directors of Russian Seattle for Freedom, which helps Russian immigrants in the U.S.

The biggest wave of Russians seeking political asylum in the U.S. came in 2022–2023, during the Biden administration. For those crossing the U.S.–Mexico border through the CBP One app, wait times varied widely: at first, it might take just a couple of weeks, but by 2023–2024, people were waiting up to ten months.

Things started to change in June 2024, when a memo directed immigration officials to keep all Russian nationals in detention until their court hearings. It’s hard to say how fairly U.S. immigration courts evaluate cases from other countries — I only work with Russians — but it seems clear the current crackdown affects asylum seekers across the board.

With Trump’s return to the White House, one major thing shifted: deportations became large-scale and routine. Multiple flights to Russia now leave each month. Many immigration judges have been dismissed, and the rest, in my view, are trying to adapt to the new reality to keep their jobs.

Another telling sign came in August, when the Trump administration released the State Department’s annual report on human rights in Russia. This year’s edition was almost three times shorter than the previous one — 41 pages instead of 110. The section on LGBTQ+ rights was cut entirely, and political repression was described as something that affects only prominent journalists, activists, and public figures — not ordinary citizens.

For Russians whose asylum requests and appeals have been denied, finding another way to legalize their status in the U.S. is extremely difficult. Marriage to an American citizen is technically an option, but in practice, most people try to reopen their cases instead. After that first hearing, asylum seekers usually understand what the court was looking for and where their case was weak. If they get another chance, they do everything they can to strengthen their evidence and collect more testimony.

The reality in detention centers doesn’t vary much between conservative and liberal states. ICE — the federal agency that runs all of them — sets the tone nationwide. And the U.S. prison system has never been known for its compassion. The problems are the same everywhere: no medical care, constant psychological pressure, no sense of what’s ahead, limited access to lawyers or family, no documents, computers, or phones, bad food, and filthy conditions.

Once the U.S. denies your asylum claim, getting protection elsewhere is nearly impossible. That’s why Russians have to explore any possible route — work or student visas, or residency through investment programs. The only relatively safe way to leave the U.S. after losing a case is if you weren’t in detention at the time of the decision. Otherwise, deportation to Russia is almost guaranteed.

In terms of anxiety levels, life for Russians waiting for a decision from the immigration court feels a lot like life in Russia. You’re constantly expecting that you might be thrown in jail, and you never know where you’ll run into law enforcement. On top of that, you don’t have a work permit or any rights.",https://meduza.io/imgly/share/1762798330/en/feature/2025/11/10/thousands-of-russians-have-applied-for-asylum-in-the-u-s-since-2022-trump-s-ice-raids-could-land-many-of-them-in-putin-s-prisons,N,,2025-11-10 17:57:04.570830

While the U.S. Department of Homeland security is once again justifying their actions, the question becomes whether the judge overseeing the preliminary injunction will agree as even her orders are now being appealed by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Cellphone video showed the moment Saturday morning Rafael Veraza says he and his family were pepper sprayed by Border Patrol agents in the parking lot of a Sam's Club in Cicero, just over the city border from Chicago's Little Village neighborhood.

""He started spraying from the front of the car towards the back. Basically I got sprayed all over my face,"" Veraza said.

He says the effect was immediate.

""I'm asthmatic. I've been with asthma since I was a little kid,"" Veraza said. ""So the moment that it hit me, I couldn't breathe.""

He said his 1-year-old daughter Arianna, who was riding in the back of the car, also breathed in the gas. Both were briefly hospitalized.

""My daughter was trying to open her eyes,"" Veraza said. ""She was struggling to breathe.""

Homeland Security says Border Patrol agents had entered the Sam's parking lot shortly after deploying crowd control measures on the residents of Little Village. It happened in the aftermath of what they said were gunshots fired from a black Jeep Wrangler aimed directly at them.

""Individuals stalked and followed the convoy into the parking lot and a vehicle rammed a Border Patrol's vehicle,"" a DHS statement read in part. ""After departing the parking lot, the law enforcement convoy was again attacked resulting in a broken window.""

Images showing the damage were also released by DHS. However, there was no explanation as to why Veraza and his family, who had decided to abort their shopping trip after seeing the agents' presence, were pepper sprayed.

""I'm not even doing a thing,"" Veraza. ""I'm trying to exit.""

On Sunday, surrounded by elected officials and other community members, Veraza came forward with his story. He and others expressing outrage at the way in which they say agents lashed out at the entire community in the aftermath of shots allegedly being fired. With tear gas and other chemical agents that were deployed at those that had come out to protest the agents presence in Little Village.

""There were ten cars in front of me. There were neighbors all around. People were upset. All of the agents popped out of the car, guns drawn.

Forced migration is at the root of the modern migration crisis.
While it does not cancel the right to migrate—long upheld by Catholic social teaching—it calls attention to a prior moral obligation: to create the conditions where migration is not a necessity born of hardship, but a free and dignified choice.","For our Sounding Board column, U.S. Catholic asks authors to argue one side of a many-sided issue of importance to Catholics around the country. We also invite readers to submit their responses to these opinion essays—whether agreement or disagreement—in the survey that follows. A selection of the survey results appear below, as well as in the October 2025 issue of U.S. Catholic. You can participate in our current survey here.

As Pope Leo XIV begins his pontificate, many people expect him to continue Pope Francis’ focus on migrants’ rights, a cause he has already promoted in several public statements. In fact, even his choice of name—Leo—appears to signal a deeper commitment to this issue. His namesake, Pope Leo XIII, was the first pope to promote part of migrants’ rights that is often over-looked: the right not to migrate.

In the midst of massive deportations and growing attention to border crises in the United States, the church’s teaching not only affirms people’s right to migrate but also emphasizes the freedom people have to remain in their homeland. This “right to stay” refers to individual’s and families’ right to live securely and with dignity in their homelands, rather than being driven to leave by violence, poverty, or political instability. It places a moral obligation on the international community and local governments to address the root causes that force migration in the first place.

The migration crisis is not only a political or economic issue—it is a moral challenge that tests our commitment to human dignity and the common good. Catholic social teaching insists that true justice in migration policy must uphold both the right to migrate and the right to remain in one’s homeland. This means confronting the injustices—such as war, poverty, environmental degradation, and political oppression—that compel people to relocate in search for a better life.

A just response requires more than managing borders. It demands international solidarity, development policies that respect human dignity and foster the common good, and a renewed commitment to building conditions in which people are truly free to stay and flourish.

The idea of the “right to stay” first appeared in Pope Leo XIII’s 1888 encyclical Quam Aerumnosa (On Italian Immigrants), which addressed the challenges faced by Italian migrants to the United States. The pope expressed sorrow that many people had left Italy in search of a better life only to face poverty and harsh conditions in their new home. Worse still, many people lost access to the sacraments and the life of the church. In response, Leo sent missionary priests to minister to migrants in their own language—an early example of papal advocacy for migrants’ spiritual and material support.

Three years later, in Rerum Novarum (On Capital and Labor), Leo took this advocacy a step further, addressing the material struggle of migrants. He argued that governments and civil society should help workers build enough stability and property in their home countries to support their families. In other words, people should not have to migrate simply to survive—they should be able to flourish where they are.

These two insights form the core of what we now call the right not to migrate. First, people should not be compelled to leave their homelands due to unmet material needs or fear of violence and persecution. And second, societies should actively promote the conditions that allow people to remain—conditions like peace, security, and economic opportunity. In other words, migration should be a free choice, not a desperate necessity.

This idea has deep roots in the Catholic tradition. In 567, the Second Council of Tours called on local communities to care for the poor in the area so people would not be forced to travel to foreign cities in search of help. The council states:

Each and every city should provide its poor and needy inhabitants with sufficient nourishment in accordance with its own ability. Both priests and citizens should take care of feeding the poor in their own region. In this manner, the poor will not have to engage in tiresome traveling and dwell in foreign cities.

According to the Council, public officials and members of society ought to support the poor so that they are not constrained to move away to foreign lands.

A 16th-century Dominican theologian, Domingo de Soto, professor at the University of Salamanca and one of the main voices at the Council of Trent, mentions the right to stay when talking about foreign beggars in his book Deliberation on the Cause of the Poor. This book was written in response to laws in Europe that forbade public begging, especially of foreign beggars.

Soto defended people’s right to migrate to other countries based on natural law, hospitality, and the universal destination of goods. Some people objected to his argument, saying that the Second Council of Tours dismissed the right to migrate by promoting a right to stay. Soto, however, replied that the right to stay, as expressed in the Council, did not impede the right to migrate to other countries. Instead, people still have the right to migrate when they deem it necessary, and it is essential to support the poor so they are not compelled to leave their homeland if it can be avoided.

Modern popes have continued teaching the right to stay. In Exsul Familia (On the Spiritual Care of Immigrants), inspired by Leo XIII, Pius XII argues that the principle of the universal destination of goods ensures that people have a right for a living space, a place to develop themselves and their families, especially in their own homelands.

The universal destination of goods is an ancient Christian principle rooted in the theology of creation. God created the universe for the good of all people, and no one should be kept from the basic goods they need for their flourishing on account of nationality, wealth, race, or belief. While the church respects and defends private property and national sovereignty as pillars of society, these are not absolute principles and should not override people’s basic rights to survive and thrive.

After the horrors of World War II and the experiences of totalitarian regimes, John XXIII grounded the right to stay in the dignity of the human person in the encyclical Pacem in Terris (On Peace), affirming everyone’s right to live and move freely within their own country—and to return if they leave.

The dignity of the human person is a key principle of Catholic social teaching. Every individual is created in the image and likeness of God and redeemed by Christ, and therefore must be protected and cared for, regardless of nationality, religion, or ethnicity. St. Pope John Paul II continued to emphasized this right, referring to the “right not to migrate” in his 2004 message for the World Day of Migrants and Refugees. He talked about the dysfunctional migration of our times as the “migration of the desperate” and urged governments and society as a whole to take an active role in eliminating the root causes of forced migration.

Given the long history of Catholic teaching on the right to stay, Catholics should be aware that besides the right to migrate, the church teaches that people should have the freedom to choose to stay in their homeland. Forced migration is at the root of the modern migration crisis.

Catholic social teaching maintains that a local society and the international community should work to build the common good by promoting peace, rule of law, justice, and security while ensuring access to health care, education, housing, decent work, political stability, and human rights so people are not compelled to leave their homes.

In communities where the common good is in decline, people often feel compelled to leave their homeland and migrate abroad in pursuit of conditions more conducive to human flourishing. In a simple way, Catholics should work for justice and solidarity internationally, especially with those that live in vulnerable communities.

This right does not imply that migration should be obstructed. On the contrary, every pope since Pius XII has strongly affirmed the right to migrate while acknowledging the need for legitimate regulation of migration. However, the freedom to remain in one’s homeland calls for efforts to address the root causes of forced and dysfunctional migration, ensuring that people are free to stay where they are, even as migration remains a legitimate and protected option.

As Pope Francis reminded the church in one of his final messages for the World Day of Migrants, the right not to migrate safeguards the freedom to choose whether to stay or leave and calls for the responsibility of governments and civil societies. This is designed specially against forced and dysfunctional migration. While it does not cancel the right to migrate—long upheld by Catholic social teaching—it calls attention to a prior moral obligation: to create the conditions where migration is not a necessity born of hardship, but a free and dignified choice.

Thune said that, per the deal under consideration, the Senate would agree to hold a separate vote later on the subsidies.
“The Senate might get a vote” on the health insurance credits, Ben Ray Luján, a New Mexico Democrat, said.
Two leading progressives in the Senate Democratic caucus were even more dismissive of the emerging compromise.
“We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.","The US Senate on Sunday took a key vote on a bill that would end the record-setting federal government shutdown without extending the healthcare subsidies that Democrats have demanded.

Senators began voting on Sunday night to advance House-passed stopgap funding legislation that the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said would be amended to combine another short-term spending measure with a package of three full-year appropriations bills.

The package would still have to be passed by the House of Representatives and sent to Donald Trump for his signature, a process that could take several days.

Senate Democrats so far have resisted efforts to reopen the government, aiming to pressure Republicans into agreeing to extend subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, which expire at the end of the year. Thune said that, per the deal under consideration, the Senate would agree to hold a separate vote later on the subsidies.

Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic senator for Connecticut, told reporters that he would vote against the funding measure but suggested there could be enough Democratic support to pass it.

“I am unwilling to accept a vague promise of a vote at some indeterminate time, on some undefined measure that extends the healthcare tax credits,” Blumenthal said.

“The Senate might get a vote” on the health insurance credits, Ben Ray Luján, a New Mexico Democrat, said. “I’ll emphasize ‘might’. But is Speaker Johnson gonna do anything? Is the president gonna do anything?”

Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, has previously said he would not hold a vote on a plan to extend the tax credits that make health insurance affordable for millions of Americans who are not insured through their employers.

Two leading progressives in the Senate Democratic caucus were even more dismissive of the emerging compromise. “It’s a mistake,” Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told Punchbowl News. “It would be a policy and political disaster for Democrats to cave,” Bernie Sanders of Vermont said.

Democrats in the House expressed their dismay. Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, promised to fight the proposed legislation. “We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives,” Jeffries said in a statement.

“A deal that doesn’t reduce health care costs is a betrayal of millions of Americans counting on Democrats to fight for them”, Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat who leads the House progressive caucus, wrote on X. “Republicans want health care cuts. Accepting nothing but a pinky promise from Republicans isn’t a compromise – it’s capitulation. Millions of families would pay the price.”

“Unacceptable,” the Florida congressman Maxwell Frost chimed in. “There are 189,000 people in my district who will be paying 50-300% more for the same, and in many cases worse, healthcare. I won’t do that to the people I represent. I’m a NO on this ‘deal’.”

Democrats outside Washington denounced the compromise as well. “Pathetic. This isn’t a deal. It’s a surrender. Don’t bend the knee!” California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, wrote on social media.

Sunday marked the 40th day of the shutdown, which has sidelined federal workers and affected food aid, parks and travel, while air traffic control staffing shortages threaten to derail travel during the busy Thanksgiving holiday season late this month. Thom Tillis, a Republican senator from North Carolina, said the mounting effects of the shutdown have pushed the chamber toward an agreement. He said the final piece, a new resolution that would fund government operations into late January, would also reverse at least some of the Trump administration’s mass layoffs of federal workers.

“Temperatures cool, the atmospheric pressure increases outside and all of a sudden it looks like things will come together,” Tillis told reporters. Should the government remain closed for much longer, economic growth could turn negative in the fourth quarter, especially if air travel does not return to normal levels by Thanksgiving, the White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett warned on the CBS Face the Nation show. Thanksgiving falls on 27 November this year.

Americans shopping for 2026 Obamacare health insurance plans are facing a more than doubling of monthly premiums on average, health experts estimate, with the pandemic-era subsidies due to expire at the end of the year. Republicans rejected a proposal on Friday by the Democratic Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, to vote to reopen the government in exchange for a one-year extension of tax credits that lower costs for plans under the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare.

Adam Schiff, a Democratic California senator, said on Sunday he believed Trump’s healthcare proposal was aimed at gutting the ACA and allowing insurance companies to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.

“So the same insurance companies he’s railing against in those tweets, he is saying: ‘I’m going to give you more power to cancel people’s policies and not cover them if they have a pre-existing condition,’” Schiff said on ABC’s This Week program.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a4fb516e98952f4688c2cd23cb9bb52f6674c0f/333_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0e07f7d63ed6007f4fd2124849b6760",N,,2025-11-10 18:57:11.079632

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that “this highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.”

Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would “far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined” to the country.

The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money.

As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”

As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust.

The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the “third country” policy as a reckless tactic that violates due process rights and can strand deportees in countries with long histories of human rights violations and corruption.

At the same time, the Trump administration has developed ties with the vice president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro “Teddy” Nguema Obiang, who is notorious among world leaders accused of corruption for a lavish lifestyle that has attracted the attention of prosecutors in several countries.

The AP has reported that the State Department granted a sanctions waiver to allow him to travel to a high-level U.N. gathering in New York in September and visit other American cities. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau also met with Obiang.

Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there.

Obiang is the son and presumed successor of Equatorial Guinea’s longtime ruler. He’s accused of decades of corruption and abuse of power. The vice president, who oversees national defense and security, has been under international sanctions for years and faces allegations of siphoning state wealth while most people live in poverty.

Despite Equatorial Guinea’s oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Obiang’s father, is Africa’s longest-serving president, holding power since 1979.

In 2017, a French court found the younger Obiang guilty of laundering and embezzling millions of euros, handing down a three-year suspended sentence and a 30 million euro fine as well as ordering the confiscation of his luxury Paris properties and car collection worth tens of millions. Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice.

U.S. prosecutors also reached a $30 million settlement with Obiang in 2014. He had to surrender assets, including a Malibu mansion, a Ferrari and Michael Jackson memorabilia.

The workshop, entitled ‘Litigation before the European Court of Human Rights: Immigration detention and alternatives to the detention of children,’ brought together lawyers, human rights advocates, and civil society actors from across Europe.

Organised within the framework of the RELEASE Project, the event provided an important collaborative learning space. Its goal was to strengthen our collective understanding of the procedural and strategic dimensions of litigating cases involving the rights of children in, and alternatives to, immigration detention before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).

Through case studies and expert-led discussions, we explored the challenges of representing migrant children in detention contexts, the jurisprudence of the ECtHR, and innovative litigation and advocacy strategies to protect their rights.

Understanding Litigation Before the ECtHR

We began by examining the procedural steps required to bring a case before the ECtHR – from admissibility requirements and communication with the Court’s Registry, to navigating the different stages of proceedings. Understanding these mechanisms is fundamental, not just for lawyers, but for all those involved in safeguarding children’s rights across borders.

Discussions then moved toward substantive rights: the protection of migrant children under the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly in relation to Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) and Article 5 (right to liberty and security). We also analysed the use of interim measures, urgent procedural tools available to prevent irreparable harm to children facing imminent risk of detention or deportation.

These sessions were both technical and human. They reminded us that behind every application to the Court are children; individuals whose experiences of fear, uncertainty, and confinement demand urgent legal and moral attention.

The EU Pact on Migration and Asylum: Between Progress and Peril

One of the most critical and timely discussions during the workshop concerned the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum. While the Pact introduces certain safeguards for children’s rights, it also raises serious human rights concerns.

By embedding detention into border and screening procedures, the Pact risks normalising the detention of children – a practice that international law and child rights bodies have repeatedly declared to be never in a child’s best interests.

The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and numerous child rights organisations have rightly called for a complete ban on the immigration detention of children, urging Member States to enshrine such prohibitions in national legislation.

At the heart of this issue lies a fundamental question: Do we treat children in migration as rights-holders, or as instruments of migration control?

Implementation will be the true test. States must ensure that all safeguards under international human rights law are not only codified but applied in practice. The best interests of the child must be the primary consideration in every decision. Detention cannot be justified on grounds of migration management.

Instead, States should invest in community-based alternatives – models that prioritise care, protection, and dignity. True alternatives to detention are not merely procedural mechanisms; they are reflections of a society’s values.

Sharing the Maltese Context

What struck me most deeply during the workshop was the reaction of other participants when we shared the Maltese context. Many were visibly shocked to learn how, in Malta, migrant children are too often treated as migrants first and children second.

It was difficult to describe how some minors, despite being visibly underage, are handcuffed during transfers; or how access to education is sometimes denied, leading to severe consequences for their mental health and development.

These are not isolated instances. They reflect systemic failures to uphold the most basic standards of child protection.

International monitoring bodies have raised these concerns time and again. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture(CPT), in several reports, has found that facilities such as Safi Detention Centre are unsuitable for children. The CPT has repeatedly urged the Maltese authorities to establish alternative accommodation and ensure that children are never detained in such conditions.

Yet, progress remains painfully slow.

Law, Accountability, and the Role of Litigation

One of the workshop’s central aims was to examine how the law itself permits the immigration detention of children and how it can be challenged.

Participants discussed the different legal avenues available to contest such practices:

arguing that detention breaches constitutional protections;

demonstrating violations of EU law;

invoking breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights (particularly Articles 3 and 5);

highlighting non-compliance with the European Social Charter; and

asserting violations of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which explicitly requires that the detention of children be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.

However, legal frameworks alone are not enough. We must ask the difficult, uncomfortable questions:

Are breaches of children’s right to liberty isolated or systemic?

What alternatives to detention exist in practice?

Are these alternatives being considered, and if so, why are they being rejected?

Accountability demands that these questions not remain rhetorical.

The CPT’s Findings: Persistent Concerns

In its recent report, published just a few months ago, the CPT expressed continued concern about the conditions in Malta’s immigration detention facilities. The Committee noted that detained children “had no access to regular purposeful activities, education or even the exercise yard for more than one to two hours per day.”

The report reaffirmed the CPT’s longstanding position: “Every effort should be made to avoid resorting to the deprivation of liberty of a foreign national who is a child.”

This is not a recommendation; it is a reminder of our legal and moral obligation.

Leaving Athens, I felt a mix of emotions.

Disheartened, because the stories shared across Europe revealed a persistent pattern: migrant children being detained, separated, and dehumanised in the name of border control.

Determined, because despite these realities, there is a growing movement of lawyers, advocates, and organisations pushing for change – challenging policies, litigating cases, and giving voice to those who are too often silenced.

Every policy decision, every piece of legislation, and every court ruling affects real children. Behind the legal arguments are faces, names, and futures.

At aditus foundation, we remain steadfast in our commitment to protecting and promoting the rights and dignity of migrant children in Malta and beyond.

Through legal support, we assist children and families in navigating complex procedures, challenging unlawful detention, and ensuring access to essential services such as education and healthcare.

Looking Ahead

Workshops like these are invaluable reminders that while progress can be slow, it is possible. Each shared strategy, each successful case, and each act of solidarity brings us closer to a future where no child is ever deprived of liberty simply for seeking safety.

Our collective challenge is to ensure that Europe lives up to its ideals of human rights, justice, and dignity for all.

They visited an ICE facility to verify conditions and interview a detainee while maintaining anonymity for safety and journalistic integrity.

According to a Facebook post by Victor Galvan on March 20th, political prisoner and long-time Colorado community member Jeanette Vizguerra told friends and family that she was receiving two pieces of bread, some jam and an apple per day at the Geo ICE Detention Center in Aurora, Colorado. As ICE activity has exponentially increased locally and nationally, this claim raised critical concerns about the physical well-being of detainees, among a litany of concerns about human rights violations.

Journalists are not permitted in the Geo ICE Center, so with the help of community organizers, I was able to visit with a detainee as a “friend” and further investigate claims. For their safety, the interviewee’s name will be omitted.

Visiting a detainee requires navigating strict scheduling and security protocols. Visitors must bring the detainee’s “A-number,” valid ID, and adhere to strict dress codes.

After around three hours of delays, intensive security screening, and sitting in a lobby with an American-flag-backdropped picture of Trump looming over it, visitors were ushered into a prison-like visitation booth, complete with white-cast cement walls, fluorescent lights, and shoddy phones to communicate through. My subject is an immigrant who told me they had been detained for over a year at the Aurora ICE Center. Despite willingly submitting themself to detention and deportation, the latter process had been continually delayed, subjecting them to further mistreatment in detention.

In 2012, my interviewee was diagnosed with Chronic Lyme Disease, a set of persistent symptoms following Lyme infection. Its clinical recognition remains debated, similar to “Long COVID” following coronavirus infection. According to accredited medical resource LymeDisease.org, “An LDo published survey of over 3,000 patients with chronic Lyme disease found that patients suffer a worse quality of life than most other chronic illnesses, including congestive heart failure, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and arthritis. Over 70% of patients with chronic Lyme disease reported fair or poor health.” The interviewee had been able to manage their symptoms to much success before imprisonment, but lack of proper care in the facility allowed the disease to progress to a debilitating degree.

Considering that proper nutrition is central to treating Lyme Disease Persistent Symptoms (LDPS), my interviewee had a keen investment in the claims I was investigating. Since the visitation with Jeanette Vizguerra in March, ostensibly, the meals have improved for the wider detainee population in the GEO ICE Center. It was reported that three meals a day are served, typically consisting of a silver-dollar-sized portion of salad, small portions of beans (or other protein), rice, potato, cornbread, and fruit. Multiple doctors in the past advised that this detainee cut out gluten and sugar from their diet, so they are generally restricted to salad, beans, and rice.

“It isn’t enough food to ever feel full from,” they told me. “I will often eat the food they give me, even if I’m not supposed to for my health, just because I’m so hungry.” Whether all detainees, including political prisoners or those under punishment, receive similar meals is unclear.

Another troubling aspect of the detainee’s treatment is the handling of their medication. Correct timing and dosing are crucial for treating. “It’s important that my medications are spread out over the day, especially around meals,” the interviewee told me. “But staff usually give me all the medications at once to save time, which makes me sick.”

Since imprisonment, the subject’s overall health has taken a sharp decline. They report a chronic fatigue, which makes any physical activity next to impossible; trouble focusing, so extreme it prevents them from reading (one of their favorite activities and one of few activities afforded to detainees), and other impairing psychological problems, including schizoaffective symptoms.

My interviewee’s experience at the Aurora Geo ICE Center illustrates the severe consequences of inadequate care, consequences that are being felt by the tens of thousands of detainees reported across the United States. The need for oversight and accountability for detainees, particularly those with chronic and medically complex conditions, is incredibly urgent. If GEO and ICE continue to operate with little transparency and no meaningful accountability, it is likely that Aurora and the nation will continue to see worsening reports of abuse, neglect, and death in these facilities. Organizations such as CO Stands Together and many others are advocating for such transparency and accountability from Geo and Colorado leaders. Such organizations are also providing a wealth of opportunities for Colorado residents to stay informed and get involved, such as attending the weekly vigil in honor of Jeanette Vizguerra held at the Aurora ICE center, supporting detainees with donations for commissary, and much more.",https://yellowscene.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Handcuffs-Prison-Image-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 17:01:50.234888

Ahead of a hearing in that case, scheduled for later Monday, many state officials sharply rebuked the Trump administration for continuing the fight.
But the Trump administration refused to back down, turning first to an appeals court, which denied its first request, before escalating the fight to the Supreme Court.
There, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued a temporary pause, known as an administrative stay, to buy the appeals court more time to review the matter.
“For low-income Americans, SNAP is a vital bulwark against hunger and food insecurity,” the appellate court said.","The Trump administration on Monday said that it would return to the Supreme Court in yet another attempt to halt full federal funding for food stamps, signifying the latest twist in a winding saga that has imperiled the nation’s largest anti-hunger program.

The administration revealed its intentions just hours after an appeals court refused to block the decision of a lower court judge, who had previously ordered the government to finance benefits completely this month for the roughly 42 million people who receive aid to buy groceries.

The move came as Congress inched closer to reopening the government, offering a glimmer of hope that lawmakers might finally put an end to the wrangling over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The program has faced extensive disruption and delay in recent weeks as a result of President Trump’s refusal to fully finance the program.

If the government reopens, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, said the administration’s emergency request to the Supreme Court would not be needed. Otherwise, he said, the government “still intends to pursue a stay” to halt the order requiring full SNAP payments.

For all of the persistent legal uncertainty, the developments on Monday offered a pathway to resolving the weekslong battle waged by cities, states, religious groups and nonprofits, which have been trying to spare low-income Americans from severe financial hardship while much of Washington remains largely inoperative.

Despite having ample funds in reserve, the Trump administration has refused to supply the money required to help roughly one in eight Americans purchase groceries. Its position has offered a stark contrast with the other ways that Mr. Trump has rearranged the budget during the shutdown, including his work to reprogram billions of dollars to pay the officers conducting mass deportations.

In doing so, the Trump administration has even sought to threaten and penalize some states that have tried to furnish benefits to residents in full. At one point over the weekend, the government demanded that these states needed to immediately “undo” that work and threatened them with financial punishment if they did not, prompting a broad outcry.

On Monday, a judge in Massachusetts granted a request by more than two dozen states to temporarily block the federal government from carrying out that directive. Ahead of a hearing in that case, scheduled for later Monday, many state officials sharply rebuked the Trump administration for continuing the fight. They said the decision to appeal — on a day when the Senate was making progress on a funding deal — was especially punitive and harmful.

Letitia James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, said in a news conference that states would use “every legal pathway to ensure families get the benefits they are entitled to.”

“It is a moral imperative,” she said, “and no one should go hungry because their own government is refusing to feed them.”

Ms. James was joined by other state attorneys general, including Matthew J. Platkin of New Jersey, who described the federal government’s attempts to slash food stamps as “the most heinous thing” he had seen in office.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The legal saga began late last month, after a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the administration to explore ways to furnish food stamp payments for November. When the government failed to comply quickly — and as some families faced the prospect they might not receive any aid at all — the judge instructed the government to tap all of its available funds to pay benefits in full.

Shortly after that ruling, many states began to provide those benefits to some of the Americans who receive SNAP and had been waiting days for aid. But the Trump administration refused to back down, turning first to an appeals court, which denied its first request, before escalating the fight to the Supreme Court.

There, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued a temporary pause, known as an administrative stay, to buy the appeals court more time to review the matter. That scrambled the work underway to ship payments to low-income Americans, and by the weekend, created vast uncertainty and disruption felt by families around the country.

By late Sunday, though, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit handed down its latest decision: It denied the administration’s request in a scathing, 29-page opinion that also severely faulted its tactics during the shutdown.

“For low-income Americans, SNAP is a vital bulwark against hunger and food insecurity,” the appellate court said. “Access to food is, of course, a basic human need.”

The appellate judges said the government “knew full well” that its original plan — making only partial SNAP payments — “would be technically difficult.” And the opinion acknowledged that the Trump administration had “proceeded to do nothing to attempt to solve that problem” in ways that would have preserved the food stamp program and spared it from significant delays.

Diane Yentel, the president of the National Council of Nonprofits, one of the organizations that had sued the government over SNAP, praised the appeals decision in a statement on Monday. “The administration’s callous and cruel use of hungry Americans as a political tool must end,” she said.

Many who seek to limit immigration to the United States argue that social cohesion is impossible when any state absorbs too many newcomers at once.
Immigrants are woven into American life as our neighbors, our fellow worshipers, our friends and family.","“States have the right and the duty to protect their borders.” These words came not from President Trump, or any other American politician, but from Pope Leo XIV on Oct. 23. That recognition provides the rationale for nations to protect the basic rights and way of life of their citizens—and also recognizes the enormous stresses on social and physical infrastructure that open borders can produce. But the assertion of that standard was followed by an appeal to human conscience that every American needs to hear. This right of every nation to secure its borders, Pope Leo said, “should be balanced by the moral obligation to provide refuge.”

The pope said that many nations are ignoring this moral obligation: “Ever more inhuman measures are being adopted—even celebrated politically—that treat these ‘undesirables’ as if they were garbage and not human beings.”

It was a clear reference to the migration policies of the developed nations of the world, including the United States, a nation that still displays on its most revered monument words that our ancestors—refugees—saw as a balm and a promise: “Give me your tired, your poor,/ Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”

The pope’s words came during yet another day of violence and confrontation on the streets of the United States, where the masked agents of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency continue a crusade of intimidation, terrorizing residents in cities across the country. On Oct. 8, millions of Americans saw the image of an ICE agent firing a pepper-spray projectile directly into the face of a Christian pastor who was advocating for those bearing the brunt of ICE actions in Chicago, a city recently singled out by Mr. Trump as “a hellhole” in need of federal intervention. And on Oct. 27, ICE agents dragged a 67-year-old Chicago resident—a U.S. citizen—from his car, breaking six of his ribs and causing internal bleeding. The incident occurred during an ICE raid on a children’s Halloween parade.

Those recorded acts of violence have been accompanied over the past few months by many more unseen and completely unnecessary violations of human dignity and American law by agents of ICE and other government agencies against both new migrants and longtime American citizens.

The words of Pope Leo—and the fundamental promise of America inscribed at the feet of the Statue of Liberty—are also under attack in that violence. So, too, are two traditions. First is the centuries-old compact in the United States that people deserve due process, the right to protest and the protection of the rule of law. The second is the internationally recognized right stated in the United Nations Global Compact on Migration (from which the United States withdrew during the first Trump administration) that migrants “are entitled to the same universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, which must be respected, protected and fulfilled at all times.”

They are not “garbage”; they are not vermin to be eradicated; they are not the enemy. They are here in the United States seeking the same rights of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” with which we are all endowed by our creator.

Where did we go wrong?

When did the notion that we should protect our borders and regulate immigration devolve into a determination to unleash anonymous masked agents pulling people from cars, and to publicly celebrate the creation of true hellholes like the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility?

The Trump administration would have us believe that migrants are here to steal American jobs, to commit crime, to pollute our unique way of life. These are in some cases the same tropes used by Nazi criminals whom Americans died to overthrow in World War II. They are also an echo of the ugliest instincts of human nature. And they are, at their core, sentiments that are un-American, ones that betray our heritage as they also betray the words of the Gospel.

Americans now hear and see stories on a daily basis about people detained by ICE, both residents and visitors to the United States, who are held without a charge for weeks, and stories of those who have sought to obey American jurisprudence being seized outside the very courtrooms they were summoned to in observance of the law.

The positive contributions of immigrants to the United States are being deliberately denigrated, even as citizens reap the bounty of their work in industries where Americans simply will not toil under current conditions: agriculture, manual labor and in the many other industries that contribute to our national economic output and the necessities of daily life. No one, for example, has offered an alternative to the current economic system that orders our nation’s farm life, from the breadbaskets of California to the processing plants of the Midwest. Far from compensating our agricultural workers (42 percent of whom are undocumented) with a living wage and a chance at upward mobility, our politicians are terrorizing them, telling them they are not welcome while pretending the sweat of their brows is not what keeps our economy and society robust.

People of faith across the country have stood up for these least in the past few months, often with admirable tenacity and courage, but we need to do more. The Gospel mandates it, to say nothing of history and economic reality.

On a practical level, we have also created a situation in many cities where the supposed forces of law and order are creating chaos, a classic example of setting fires to claim credit for putting them out. The public scenes provoked by ICE agents have been used in several cases by Mr. Trump to justify the deployment of National Guard troops to cities to restore order—actions that have been opposed in almost every case by the governors and mayors tasked with local governance.

Many who seek to limit immigration to the United States argue that social cohesion is impossible when any state absorbs too many newcomers at once. The response of terrorizing communities with inhumane immigration enforcement, however, demonstrates the moral blindness of this claim. It is not undocumented immigrants who threaten social cohesion in our cities, but rather the tactic of forcing them to choose between self-deportation or living in fear of arrest and detention.

Immigrants are woven into American life as our neighbors, our fellow worshipers, our friends and family. As the past months have amply demonstrated, it is not possible to target immigrants en masse without also targeting the communities of which they are an integral part. In that sense, the immoral and violent tactics presently being used for immigration enforcement are a true reflection of the goals at which they aim. They are also a compelling argument for why such goals are a betrayal of not only American values but also of the Gospel.

WASHINGTON – Earlier this month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested a criminal illegal alien who is a confirmed member of the 18th Street Gang, a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), and was on El Salvador’s most wanted gang members’ list.

Antonio Israel Lazo-Quintanilla was arrested by ICE in October. While technically his only crime in the United States is driving without a license, this illegal alien is wanted in El Salvador for aggravated homicide, extortion, possession of drugs, and a litany of other felonies.

70% of the illegal aliens arrested by ICE have been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. But this statistic doesn’t even count gang members, terrorists, human rights abusers, and foreign fugitives who lack a rap sheet in the U.S.

“70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the United States,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This gang member on El Salvador’s most wanted list is a perfect example of ICE targeting the worst of the worst.

Please note that the views of outside contributors do not reflect the official opinions of SCOTUSblog or its staff.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to revive President Donald Trump’s attempt to narrow access to birthright citizenship. As the justices consider the administration’s request, three important briefs submitted to the court hint at an even more significant departure from the broad access to citizenship that has defined U.S. law since the late 19th century. The Justice Department’s petition requesting review, backed up by an amicus brief submitted by Republican members of the House of Representatives and another by Republican Senators, suggest that the Trump administration may be preparing to deny U.S. citizenship to children whose parents are U.S. citizens if the parents, or the children, are also citizens of another country.

The 14th Amendment citizenship clause provides U.S. citizenship to everyone “born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” Since 1898, courts and executive branch agencies have interpreted the amendment’s citizenship clause broadly. Almost everyone born in the United States since then has been treated as a U.S. citizen from birth. On his first day back in the White House, the president issued an executive order directing executive branch agencies to deny U.S. citizenship to certain children born in the United States based on the citizenship and immigration status of their parents. Trump’s order does not target the children of U.S. citizens or permanent resident fathers.

The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to review a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit blocking implementation of the president’s directive. The justices have not yet issued a decision about the government’s request.

In the Justice Department’s petition requesting Supreme Court review, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the federal government’s lead Supreme Court lawyer, defends the president’s executive order by analyzing the citizenship clause’s language regarding jurisdiction. He argues that the citizenship clause excludes the children of people who do not owe “allegiance” to the United States. Relying on the court’s 1873 decision in the Slaughter-House Cases – the court’s “first case interpreting the Citizenship Clause” – Sauer argues that the citizenship clause excludes from U.S. citizenship children born to “citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States.” Although it is not made explicit in the brief, dual citizens are also citizens of a foreign government and so Sauer’s sweeping argument could deny citizenship to their children. And indeed, Sauer does not limit this broad claim anywhere in the government’s written arguments.

A few pages later, Sauer claims that a proper reading of the citizenship clause demands measuring the “allegiance” of a child born in the United States. Sauer quotes a speech by Senator Lyman Trumbull in 1866 appearing to support the view that the citizenship clause should not apply to children who are citizens of another country. “What do we mean by ‘subject to the jurisdiction of the United States?’ Not owing allegiance to anybody else,” Trumbull said in a passage that Sauer quotes. Since dual citizens owe allegiance to another country as much as the United States, they wouldn’t satisfy Trumbull’s test. Trumbull’s view of the citizenship clause should matter, according to Sauer, because he was “the principal sponsor in the Senate” of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, a federal law that contained language regarding citizenship that was similar to what would later appear in the 14th Amendment.

The briefs by Republican elected officials echo Sauer’s arguments. The 18 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and 9 U.S. Senators, whose briefs are identical except for the parties, are represented by the America First Legal Foundation, the non-governmental organization founded by Trump’s immigration advisor Stephen Miller. The briefs repeatedly argue that the jurisdiction required by the citizenship clause excludes citizens of another country. In the opening paragraph of their argument, the elected officials claim that the only people who are “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,” as the 14th Amendment requires, are those who “owe direct and exclusive allegiance to the sovereign.” Later, they claim that “no one can have two countries.” Discussing the Slaughter-House Cases, they argue that the citizenship clause excludes “children whose parents remained citizens of another country,” as “they lacked total allegiance to the United States.”

Following Sauer, the politicians contend that their restrictive view of the citizenship clause is bolstered by debates surrounding the Civil Rights Act of 1866. According to their brief, Senator John Bingham – who they describe as “a principal author of the future Fourteenth Amendment” – said that the act’s citizenship provision applied to the children “of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty,” italicizing the text for emphasis. “This invoked the concept of total allegiance to the United States,” the politicians add in the next sentence. Quoting the same statement by Trumbull that Sauer quotes, the elected officials’ briefs argue, “Any divided loyalty meant no citizenship.” Leaving no doubt that they believe that the citizenship clause excludes people based on their citizenship status as well as that of their parents, the elected officials note, “If the parents or child had divided allegiances, the child would not be a U.S. citizen under the Jurisdiction Clause.”

Applied literally, these arguments would deny U.S. citizenship to children if either they or their parents were citizens of another country when the child was born. President Trump’s executive order does not go that far, so it is unlikely that the court would either at this point. Still, the fact that the briefs reach more broadly than the president’s order suggests that advocates for narrowing access to U.S. citizenship have already thought of another target.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourt4-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 16:05:43.347251

What to know today

SENATE SHUTDOWN DEAL: Senators have reached a tentative bipartisan agreement to end the government shutdown, sources with knowledge of the details said. The proposal would advance three full-year spending bills for certain agencies and a short-term measure to fund the rest of the government at current spending levels through Jan. 30.

TRUMP ISSUES 2020 PARDONS: President Donald Trump pardoned Rudy Giuliani and dozens of others involved in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the Justice Department’s pardon attorney, Ed Marin, said late last night. The pardons are largely symbolic, as none of the people listed were convicted of federal crimes, which the presidential pardon covers.

MAXWELL SEEKS COMMUTATION: Ghislaine Maxwell, the co-conspirator of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is seeking a commutation of her 20-year prison sentence from Trump, a whistleblower has told House Democrats.

U.S.-SYRIA BILATERAL: Trump is meeting today with Ahmad al-Sharaa, the first Syrian president to visit the White House. The former jihadist is expected to commit to joining the U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State militant group, two U.S. officials said.

Jeffries vows to continue fight over health care costs when the House receives the bill to reopen government from the Senate

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.,said House Democrats will “continue to wage this fight” over health care costs when the Senate sends the amended short-term government spending bill back to the House, adding that the eight Democratic senators who voted with Republicans last night to take up the measure owe their constituents an explanation.

“I’m not going to explain what a handful of Senate Democrats have decided to do, that’s their explanation to offer to the American people,” Jeffries told reporters. “What we’re going to continue to do as House Democrats, partnered with our allies throughout America, is to wage the fight.”

Jeffries also referred to House Republicans who in recent weeks have said, like Democrats have, that Affordable Care Act tax credits need to be extended, saying “now is their chance.”

Jeffries stood by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., after some House Democrats called for new leadership following yesterday’s vote. When asked if he thinks Schumer is effective and should keep his job, Jeffries said “yes and yes.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders endorses Minnesota Lt. Gov Peggy Flanagan for Senate

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is endorsing Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan for retiring Democratic Sen. Tina Smith's seat.

Flanagan, who serves as lieutenant governor under Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, wrote in a post on X, ""@BernieSanders has fought for working families since Day One. He’s built a movement that is taking on special interests and fighting for an economy that works for everyone. I’m honored to have earned his endorsement of my campaign for US Senate.""

The independent senator reposted Flanagan's message on Instagram.

Sanders said in a statement provided to The New York Times that Flanagan has “the guts to stand up for working people against the billionaires and the corporate interests.”

Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., is the other candidate running in the Democratic Senate primary in Minnesota next year.

Sanders' endorsement of Flanagan came as he has expressed opposition to a deal to end the government shutdown that a group of Senate Democrats decided to advance last night.

In a post on X yesterday, Craig slammed the agreement as well because it doesn't guarantee any extensions to expiring Obamacare subsidies and said she plans to vote against it.

Supreme Court skeptical of Rastafarian man’s religious rights claim

The Supreme Court appeared unlikely this morning to allow a devout Rastafarian to bring a damages claim against Louisiana prison officials who cut his dreadlocks in violation of his religious rights.

Based on the morning argument, a majority of the justices did not appear to think Congress specifically allowed for state officials to be sued under a federal law called the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is often solicitous toward religious claims, although the bulk of recent cases have involved cases brought by conservative Christians.

Johnson tells lawmakers the House could vote on a bill to reopen government on Wednesday

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., laid out a potential timetable for the House schedule this week, including a vote on a government funding bill, during a conference call with House Republicans this morning, four sources on the call said.

Johnson said he’s hoping to vote as soon as Wednesday on the Senate’s deal to re-open the government, although that will depend on how quickly the Senate is able to move, the sources said. Although the vote timing is fluid, members were encouraged on the call to start getting back to Washington as soon as possible given the air travel delays.

The speaker also vowed that before the House votes, he will swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., who won a special election on Sept. 23. Following her swearing-in, the House will then vote on a rule for the Senate deal, followed by final passage, and then the House will leave town again, Johnson told members on the call.

While the vote is expected to be tight, and leadership is still in the process of doing a whip check, Johnson expressed confidence that they would be able to pass the Senate’s government funding package, the sources said.

Christine Pelosi to run for California state Senate instead of her mother's House seat

Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced today that she is running for a state Senate seat, ending speculation that she might run for her mother's seat in the House.

""I'm running to represent you, San Francisco, in Sacramento,"" she said in her announcement video. ""Fighting for consumer rights, women's rights, gun violence survivors, immigrants and our most vulnerable communities against the threat we face.""

Nancy Pelosi announced last week that she would not seek re-election. Her daughter is a Democratic strategist and attorney and is running for the seat currently held by state Sen. Scott Wiener, who is seeking Pelosi's congressional seat.

N.Y. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani selects key aide and de Blasio alum for 2 top posts

Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani named his appointments for key administration roles this morning, tapping campaign manager Elle Bisgaard-Church as chief of staff and public service veteran Dean Fuleihan for deputy mayor.

Fuleihan, who has decades of experience in New York politics, is a more conventional choice for a top post. He was director of New York City's Office of Management and Budget under Mayor Bill de Blasio and served as de Blasio's first deputy mayor from 2018 to 2021.

""I will turn to Dean for council, not only for his wealth of managerial experience, but also because of the similarity between our visions for this city,"" Mamdani said.

Bisgaard-Church managed Mamdani's primary and general election campaigns. She also worked as his chief of staff during his time as a state representative in Albany, N.Y.

""Few have played a more central role in this movement, or in every victory we achieved together in the assembly than Elle,"" Mamdani said. ""Together, alongside Dean, she will be responsible for ensuring that our commitment to excellence remains inviolable.""

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman will not run for re-election

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., announced she will not run for re-election in 2026 after her sixth term concludes.

Watson Coleman, 80, was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2014 making her the first African American woman from New Jersey to do so, her office noted in a news release. Before being elected to Congress, she served as majority leader of the New Jersey General Assembly.

In a statement, Watson Coleman said she made the decision after much reflection and conversations with her family.

""I have always stood on the frontlines in the fight for principled progressive policies and my work has centered on the belief that there must be a floor below which we should never allow any child, family, or person to fall,"" she said, adding that her legislative record on issues such as criminal justice, health care, poverty and the economy reflected those priorities.

""I hope we will see, in this district and districts across the nation, representatives who, in the words of my dear former colleague and friend, Congressman John Lewis, stand ready to, 'Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America,'” she said.

Trump criticizes air traffic controllers who took time off during the shutdown

In a post to Truth Social, Trump slammed air traffic controllers who took time off during the shutdown and also recommended bonuses for those who stayed on the job.

""For those Air Traffic Controllers who were GREAT PATRIOTS, and didn’t take ANY TIME OFF for the 'Democrat Shutdown Hoax,' I will be recommending a BONUS of $10,000 per person for distinguished service to our Country,"" Trump said in a post.

""For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,"" he added.

Trump said those who took days off ""will have a negative mark, at least in my mind, against your record,"" and encouraged those who might want to leave their jobs, saying, ""please do not hesitate to do so, with NO payment or severance of any kind.""

The Federal Aviation Administration had a shortage of air traffic controllers before the shutdown, which has caused flight delays and cancellations across the nation.

Johnson urges House members to travel to D.C. for a shutdown vote

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., this morning urged House members to begin traveling back to D.C. to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Johnson said he would issue an official 36-hour notice before votes in the House.

“There’ll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us,” Johnson said of the work to be done when the House returns.

The House could have stayed in session during the shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history, but he chose to designate every week since Sept. 19 a district work period.

Senators reached a bipartisan agreement yesterday to advance a bill that would end the shutdown, NBC has reported.

6 killed in U.S. strikes on 2 more alleged drug boats in eastern Pacific

U.S. forces struck two more boats allegedly operated by drug cartels in the eastern Pacific yesterday, killing six people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement.

The latest in a string of similar operations against what the U.S. government calls “designated terrorist organizations,” the two strikes were carried out in international waters and three men were aboard each vessel, Hegseth said.

“These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth said on X.

China suspends port fees on U.S. ships as tensions ease

China announced today that it has dropped countermeasures on U.S.-linked vessels for a year as trade tensions ease between Washington and Beijing.

Effective at 12:01 ET today, the Chinese Transport Ministry suspended its port fees and investigations related to American ships following the U.S. move to pause investigations into China’s maritime industry.

The suspension was part of a consensus reached by U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators in Kuala Lumpur last month, the ministry said.

Beijing also dropped sanctions targeting five U.S. subsidiaries of the South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean.

Trump's attorneys demand BBC issue a retraction, threaten to sue

Trump's attorneys sent a letter to the British Broadcasting Corp. over the weekend demanding a retraction and threatening to seek $1 billion in damages from the broadcaster.

The move comes amid a growing controversy over edits to the president’s infamous Jan. 6 ellipse speech in a documentary that aired on the BBC. Two top BBC executives have already resigned.

The White House referred NBC News' request for comment to an outside legal team.

“The BBC defamed President Trump by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election,” a spokesman for the president’s outside legal team told NBC News. “President Trump will continue to hold accountable those who traffic in lies, deception, and fake news.”

A BBC spokesperson told NBC News, “We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.”

Critics have framed the BBC's edits of Trump's Jan. 6 speech as misleading and criticized the decision to cut a portion of the president's speech when he told supporters to protest peacefully.

BBC Director General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness left the company.

Turness said in a letter to staff members that she was stepping down because ""leaders need to be fully accountable.""

""While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,"" Turness said.

Supreme Court to weigh imposing new limits on mail-in ballots in a major election case

Taking up a contentious election issue with nationwide implications, the Supreme Court this morning agreed to consider whether federal law bars states from counting mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day.

The case pits Republican-led Mississippi, defending its election law that allows for mail-in ballots received after Election Day to be counted, against the Republican National Committee and the state’s own Republican Party. The Libertarian Party of Mississippi also joined the challenge in opposing the law.

If the RNC’s argument were applied nationwide, it would upend election law in many states, which count ballots that come in after an election as long as they were postmarked on time. Many of those laws were designed to ensure that overseas military members who submit ballots from afar have their votes counted.

Supreme Court rejects long-shot effort to overturn same-sex marriage ruling

The Supreme Court this morning turned away a long-shot attempt to overturn the landmark 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

Without comment, the justices rejected an appeal brought by Kim Davis, a former county clerk in Kentucky who was sued in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her opposition to same-sex marriage based on her religious beliefs.

Her latest appeal in the case, brought a decade later, had attracted considerable attention amid fears that the court could overturn the 2015 same-sex marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges, in the aftermath of the 2022 ruling that overturned the landmark abortion rights decision, Roe v. Wade.

Democrats seek investigation into agency messages blaming Democrats for the shutdown

A group of Senate Democrats is pushing for an investigation into the Trump administration’s use of federal agency websites and emails to post partisan messages blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.

In a letter obtained by NBC News, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other Democrats are asking the Government Accountability Office to open a probe into whether the political messages violated federal appropriations laws.

The lawmakers point specifically to a rule that prohibits the executive branch from using funds for “purely partisan” purposes. They are asking for more information from the GAO to see if several agencies violated laws that pertain to ethics and partisan political activity.

Senators advance tentative deal to end the government shutdown

Senators struck an agreement Sunday, projecting confidence that it will be sufficient to end the lengthy U.S. government shutdown, three sources with direct knowledge of the details told NBC News.

The agreement, reached by a group of Democrats who teamed up with Republicans, cleared the first hurdle on a vote of 60-40 to advance in a late-night Senate vote. If it’s approved, it would then need to pass the House and gain Trump’s signature to become law and reopen the government.

Even if it has enough support to clear those hurdles, the process is expected to take days.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer confirmed to the justices that the federal government intends to ask the high court to pause orders from lower courts to maintain full SNAP payments, which provide federal food assistance to families in need.

His notice comes after a federal appeals court late Sunday rejected the administration’s bid to halt U.S. District Judge John McConnell’s order, which directed the government to fund November SNAP payments by transferring some $4 billion in child nutrition funds.

Though those payments remain frozen under a Friday night ruling from Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the appeals court’s decision starts a 48-hour clock for it to expire.

It also comes as Congress moves closer to reopening the government, which Sauer noted in his letter to the court.

He flagged for the justices that the Senate on Sunday voted to begin the process for funding the government, which would include full funding for SNAP through the end of the fiscal year.

“That proposal, if ultimately adopted by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President, would end the shutdown and moot this application,” Sauer wrote.

The solicitor general also noted that a federal judge issued another temporary injunction Monday morning tied to the SNAP payments.

U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani temporarily paused a U.S. Department of Agriculture memorandum that said states that sent full SNAP payment files for November must “immediately undo any steps taken to issue” full benefits.

Sauer said the government would file a supplemental brief by 4 p.m. EST.

The Trump administration first appealed to the Supreme Court after McConnell ruled that the administration needed to provide full SNAP payments for November by last Friday, after finding it was acting arbitrarily and capriciously by not transferring the child nutrition funds to fully fund SNAP during the shutdown. He had previously ruled that the administration needed to deplete a $5 billion SNAP emergency fund, at minimum, to ensure benefits went to families and people with no or limited incomes.

Justice Department lawyers argued that such a move would unacceptably put those programs at risk, and Sauer contended it would “sow further shutdown chaos.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AP25311542469710-e1762721157989.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-10 16:05:34.854976

Nonprofit civil rights organization Faith in Action East Bay, based in Alameda and Contra Costa counties, organized the afternoon march to denounce what they see as illegal and immoral racial profiling, separation of families, and violation of detention rights. They advocated for the departure of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents from the Bay Area.

Marchers gathered outside the federal San Francisco Immigration Court before walking half a mile to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services building.

The steady beat of a drum played while the group continuously sang a hymn that switched between the names of different deities, demonstrating the presence of several faith groups.

Rabbi Allan Berkowitz helped organize the walk and spoke about what he believes is a gross violation of human rights and dignity.

“Every single faith tradition represented today carries values and messages that people matter,” said Berkowitz. “What unites us is the commitment to preserve the sanctity of every human being.”

Berkowitz likened the actions of today’s clergy against President Donald Trump’s administration as a similar action by previous faith leaders, such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

“Very often it’s clergy who show the moral courage and show the moral leadership to stand up to dictators and stand up to oppression,” said Berkowitz.

After arriving outside of the USCIS building, the group set up a vigil across the street. Organizers and San Francisco police shut down half the street to accommodate the large crowd.

The Rev. Deborah Lee, co-executive director of the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, denounced the activities going on within the federal building.

“Today, this is a place of arrest, of kidnappings, family separation. This is a point of captivity, a point of no return into the web of detention centers, exile and deportation, sometimes to third-party countries,” said Lee.

Growing numbers of detainees

The Migration Policy Institute, an independent nonprofit that tracks immigration data and policies, estimated over 60,000 people were being detained by the Trump administration as of late August. In comparison, there were nearly 40,000 people detained when former President Joe Biden left office in January.

According to the Deportation Data Project, a team made up of professors and students across the University of California system, over 2,000 individuals in the San Francisco area alone have been detained by ICE since the start of the Trump administration.

The project noted, however, they do not expect new data to be released during the government shutdown, potentially drastically undercounting the number of detentions.

The Rev. Katie Choy-Wong spoke to the crowd about her grandparents’ experiences as undocumented Chinese migrants who faced prejudice and bias when arriving to the Bay Area. She offered a prayer to all people involved in the immigration enforcement system, including the officials, in a hope their minds would change.

“Help us to support our brothers and sisters being detained, deported, dehumanized, demoralized, not only support them in our prayers, but in a tangible way,” said Choy-Wong. “We pray that (government officials) look into their own conscience. We pray, oh God, that they treat people with respect, decency and nonviolence. We pray that they use their capacity to fight injustice from within.”

When asked whether he had glimmers of hope for the future, Berkowitz said the results of Tuesday’s elections in favor of Democratic policies was something that gave him hope.

As the Trump administration adds federal law enforcement focus to Portland, Oregon, local officials in neighboring areas are pushing back on the Department of Homeland Security and investigating their own police forces for alleged collaboration.

Unrest in the Portland area grabbed President Donald Trump’s attention over the summer – and by late September – he announced deployment of troops to the ""war-ravaged"" city – an effort that Trump-appointed Judge Karin Immergut blocked in October.

Washington County, an area home to about 600,000 people immediately west of Portland, declared a state of emergency last week in response to DHS’ increased enforcement in the area.

The move opens up $200,000 in emergency funding to help community organizations that serve impacted residents, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB).

An immigrations rights group official was one of several residents to complain about ICE ramping up enforcement, telling OPB that her organization was receiving 100 phone calls on the matter daily and that broken glass is ""everywhere"" from ICE officers breaking car windows to detain occupants.

County Commissioner Nafisa Fai told the outlet that residents may benefit from moratoriums on evictions and having their electricity shut off over nonpayment if breadwinners in their family are taken away by ICE.

Effective October 30, 2025, most employment authorization document (EAD) renewal applications that previously qualified for the 540-day automatic extension will no longer receive this benefit. However, applications filed before October 30, 2025, will remain unaffected by this change.

This policy shift marks a significant departure from previous DHS practices and could impact thousands of workers and employers who rely on extended work authorization during processing delays.

Background

Under prior policy guidance, certain foreign nationals who timely filed to renew their employment authorization were eligible for an automatic extension of up to 540 days. This policy helped eligible foreign nationals avoid disruptions in their employment authorization amid increasingly lengthy U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) processing times.

DHS asserts that this policy change is consistent with several of the Trump administration’s executive orders and the administration’s overarching immigration policy.

Impacted Categories

Several commonly impacted employment eligibility categories include:

A-3: Refugee

A-5: Asylee

A-17: Spouse of a principal E nonimmigrant

A-18: Spouse of a principal L nonimmigrant

C-8: Pending Asylum

C-9: Pending Adjustment of Status under Section 245 of the INA

C-26: Spouses of certain H-1B principal nonimmigrants

It is important to note that this interim final rule does not affect the 180-day automatic extension available to F-1 students applying for STEM OPT extensions. The STEM OPT extension is authorized under a separate regulatory framework and therefore remains outside the scope of the recent IFR. USCIS has previously confirmed that 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) does not apply to F-1 STEM OPT extensions. While the IFR does not expressly state that STEM OPT is excluded, it acknowledges that its provisions do not alter other regulatory authorities, such as those governing Temporary Protected Status.

Best Practices for Foreign Nationals and Employers

Foreign nationals in the affected categories can no longer rely on automatic extensions once their EAD expires. As a result, depending on USCIS processing times, foreign nationals and employers should be prepared for potential gaps in employment authorization. To minimize disruptions, employers should continue to monitor EAD expiration dates and encourage employees to file renewal applications as early as possible – up to 180 days before the current EAD expires. Early filing is critical to reducing the risk of work authorization interruptions due to delayed adjudication.

The increased risk for federal contractors and recipients of federal funds takes several forms.

E-Verify. Two noteworthy FCA cases this year reflect a crackdown on federal contractors’ failure to use E-Verify to confirm that their employees were eligible to work in the United States. DOJ announced in September that Bayonne Drydock and Repair Corporation agreed to pay more than $4 million to resolve allegations that it violated the FCA by employing immigrants lacking work authorization for work under two federal contracts. This settlement follows an announcement in January — during the final days of the Biden administration — that a different federal contractor had agreed to pay just over $1 million to resolve similar allegations. Both cases alleged that the contractors failed to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222-54, which requires employers to electronically confirm employees’ employment eligibility in the federal E-Verify database. These settlements underscore the importance of government contractors monitoring their compliance — and their subcontractors’ compliance — with E-Verify requirements.

PRWORA. Potential FCA exposure also might arise from the Trump administration’s July announcement that it was effectively rescinding longstanding guidance under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). PRWORA provides that an organization that administers a “federal public benefit” is required to verify an applicant’s immigration status before issuing benefits (with limited exceptions for charitable organizations in certain circumstances). The Trump administration’s interpretation of the law significantly expands the number of federal benefit programs that are subject to the immigration-status restrictions — including Head Start programs, Title X family planning clinics, community services block grant programs, and community health centers. Although many of these policy changes are currently enjoined in a number of states and as to Head Start nationwide, other aspects are in effect and could give rise to potential FCA liability.

“Sanctuary Cities.” Many federal agencies — including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — have announced new conditions on federal grants requiring recipients to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. These conditions are often accompanied by conditions related to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. Although multiple jurisdictions have successfully obtained injunctions against these new conditions, where they apply, the terms could create additional FCA risk for jurisdictions that accept the federal funds but are later deemed uncooperative by federal immigration officials.

These are just three examples of how the Trump administration could continue to advance its immigration policy priorities through FCA enforcement. Government contractors and grant recipients should take proactive steps, including by carefully reviewing their agreements with and certifications to the government, as well as their immigration-verification compliance mechanisms. Early attention to these issues can help mitigate risk and avoid costly investigations or enforcement actions.

How long will Wisconsin farmers continue to believe this administration is on their side?
Many hope the short-term pain of Trump’s tariffs will pay off in the long term, with a stronger and more stable U.S. economy.
Until recently, many Wisconsin dairy farmers and their workers hoped to remain under the radar, even as immigration raids have caused chaos in other states.
Wisconsin dairy farmers skated through the first Trump administration without any dairy farm raids.","President Donald Trump’s tariffs, trade wars and immigration crackdown are taking a toll on Wisconsin farmers. For almost six months, China refused to purchase U.S. soybeans in response to Trump’s escalating tariffs, leaving Wisconsin farmers with no customer for their bumper soybean crop this year. Commodity prices are low, due to high yields and depressed demand. And recently after a long period of quiet, federal immigration agents arrived in Wisconsin, targeting construction workers in Madison and farm hands in Manitowoc — bad news for Wisconsin’s dairy industry, where 60-90% of the workforce is comprised of undocumented immigrants.

It’s an anxious, uncertain time in rural areas of the state.

Yet on a recent drive from Madison to Reedsburg, I passed dozens of giant Trump signs planted among the corn and soybean fields and banners declaring “Take America Back!” on the sides of red barns.

How long will Wisconsin farmers continue to believe this administration is on their side?

National polls show rural support for the president remains strong, even as farmers say their own economic situation is weakening. Many hope the short-term pain of Trump’s tariffs will pay off in the long term, with a stronger and more stable U.S. economy. Ever since he first ran for president in 2016, Trump appealed to many farmers with his pitch that he would remember “the forgotten men and women of America” and, especially, with his criticism of global trade deals like NAFTA, which accelerated the “get big or get out” trend in agriculture that helped kill off more than half of family farms in our state since the early 2000s.

Year after year, Wisconsin was the No. 1 state for farm bankruptcies in the country, as the number of dairies dropped from 16,000 in 2004 to fewer than 7,000 today. Since 2023, we no longer lead the country in bankruptcies — consolidation and foreclosure have simply weeded out so many farms that there aren’t that many left to shut down.

When things have been as bad as they have been for as long as they have, it’s not surprising that Trump’s brash, anti-establishment message resonated with rural voters. Many hoped that he would throw a rock at the whole system and shake up what felt like an impossibly rigged economy. Alas, it turns out it’s possible for things to go from bad to even worse.

Recently, Trump promised to use some of the revenue generated by his chaotic tariffs on other countries’ products to make bailout payments to farmers, although the status of those payments is up in the air during the government shutdown. Even without the shutdown, converting tariff revenue into subsidies for U.S. farmers is “not even like robbing Peter to pay Paul. It’s like robbing Peter to pay Peter,” Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former senior adviser for rural development at USDA, told me. Tariffs are essentially a tax on domestic consumers, who have been paying much higher prices for goods like farm equipment and fertilizer. Taking that money and giving it back in the form of a handout to the same farmers who paid for the tariffs in the first place is no real solution.

Plus, getting another bailout “isn’t what farmers want. We want to receive our money from the marketplace and let that process work out,” Darin Von Ruden, president of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, told the Green Bay Fox affiliate WLUK-TV.

Von Ruden recently hosted a listening session on his farm in Westby, part of a multistate tour by Farmers for Free Trade to dramatize the harm done by tariffs. The group hopes to pressure members of Congress to recognize the problem and vote to change course. But so far Republican members of Congress in Wisconsin seem determined to show how loyal they are to Trump, even if that means a whole lot of pain for their constituents.

Beyond the next bailout for farmers, whenever that might come, unstable markets caused by trade wars are a long-term problem. Soybean farmers say it will take years to regain a good trading relationship with China. And there is no thoughtful government effort underway to support smaller, local and regional food economies. Meanwhile the looming loss of health care and food assistance under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” also threatens lasting damage to rural Wisconsin.

And then there are the ICE raids. For decades, Wisconsin dairy farms have depended on an immigrant workforce that does not qualify for any form of work visa under current rules, since the U.S. government only offers visas for seasonal, not year-round farm work. More than half of the workers on Wisconsin dairy farms are undocumented immigrants. Until recently, many Wisconsin dairy farmers and their workers hoped to remain under the radar, even as immigration raids have caused chaos in other states. Across the country this year, half of farmers report contending with a serious labor shortage, according to Zach Rutledge, an ag researcher at Michigan State University.

Wisconsin dairy farmers skated through the first Trump administration without any dairy farm raids. This year, high-profile ICE crackdowns in Chicago and Los Angeles seemed far away and farmers could kid themselves that Trump was only trying to round up “bad” immigrants, not the hardworking people they employ. But then came the arrests in Manitowoc, a big dairy producing area of the state, and the startling roundup of seven construction workers who shared a house in Madison.

In late October, Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the Twin Cities and defended a raid that snatched a group of roofers off a work site in St. Paul.

The cruelty, the waste, the lack of any coherent plan by this administration is becoming clearer and clearer.

According to one dairy farmer I know, farmers have received mixed signals from the Trump administration, with the ag and labor secretaries assuring them they understand the importance of the immigrant workforce, while Stephen Miller continues to press for mass deportations, consequences be damned.

Trump, busy building his massive White House ballroom, remains distracted, unpredictable, unconcerned about the chaos he has unleashed. Sooner or later, even his core constituency, the people who put food on our tables and who are accustomed to enduring economic uncertainty and hardship year after year, are bound to get fed up.

This month we provide updates on the Crystallex sales process, Helms-Burton litigation, and developments in various cases of interest.

Crystallex

As we have previously discussed (here, here, here, and here), the United States District Court for the District of Delaware is presently holding a judicial sale of shares of Citgo's parent company, in order to satisfy tens of billions of dollars in debts owed to creditors by Venezuela and its state-owned oil company.

After holding a week of hearings in September, which we summarized in our October FTU (here), the parties conducted post-trial briefing and Judge Stark held another two days of hearings on October 20 and 21. These hearings concerned motions filed by Gold Reserve and Venezuela to disqualify the Special Master overseeing the sale process and the Special Master seeking approval of the Amber Energy bid for the PDVH shares (the entity which owns CITGO). No decision has been made by the court, which accepted post-trial briefs on October 28.

Previously, Judge Stark terminated the Gold Reserve SPA and permitted the Special Master to execute the Amber Energy SPA. However, Amber Energy's financing is only committed until December 1, 2025. Amber Energy's bid for Citgo has a total value of approximately $8.5 billion, with approximately $5.859 billion going to Venezuelan creditors, $500 million in additional consideration for creditors, and $2.125 billion in cash to settle bondholder claims against its parent company, PDVSA. (This represents a discount from the $2.8 billion judgment those bondholders recently received from the Southern District of New York; the bondholders have the right to terminate the settlement on December 1 if a sale order has not been signed.)

At the hearing, Gold Reserve argued that OFAC sanctions prevented the 2020 bondholders from taking any actions that would interfere with the merger that would be required for Gold Reserve's financing to close. Gold Reserve also argued that the court should favor price over certainty, and that the Special Master had failed to generate adequate competitive tension.

Venezuela impugned the Special Master's motives in its disqualification materials and leaned heavily on many of those same argument in its merits arguments, as well as emphasizing its previous arguments about the valuation and the price of the Amber bid. Accordingly, Venezuela argued that the proper valuation is $18.6 billion and any sale needs to be for at least 50% of that (and therefore the Amber bid is too low), and the Special Master should have done a host of things differently with respect to the sale to increase the competitive tension.

The parties who support the Amber bid, including the Special Master, Crystallex, ConocoPhillips, OIEG, Red Tree, and more, attacked Venezuela's valuation as significantly too high (relying on testimony from Venezuela's expert at the sale hearing that it was a theoretical valuation that didn't discount the litigation risk from the 2020 bonds). They also challenged Venezuela's position on the 50% rule and explained that they had found competitive tension in the sale process, which they believed was fair and in compliance with Delaware law. Many creditors challenged Gold Reserve for ignoring the fact that Judge Failla had not only found the 2020s to be valid but issued a $2.8 billion judgment, and also pointed out that because Gold Reserve lost its committed financing, it no longer has a conforming bid.

It is anticipated that a decision from Judge Stark will come out this month, in advance of the December 1, 2025 date when Amber's settlement agreement with the 2020 bondholders will terminate if a sale order has not been entered. Another issue looming over the proceedings is the necessity of obtaining a license from OFAC to allow the transaction to close.

Another Helms-Burton Case Reaches the Supreme Court

Last month, we reported on the Supreme Court's historic decision to grant certiorari in Exxon Mobil Corp. and Havana Docks—marking the first time the court has agreed to weigh in on the scope of the Helms-Burton Act (HBA). As those petitions were under consideration, a third certiorari petition concerning HBA was filed in Seaboard Marine Ltd. v. de Fernandez (No. 25-283).

The respondent-plaintiff in Seaboard, Odette Blanco de Fernandez, claims to be the surviving shareholder of two Cuban corporations that owned land and port development rights in Mariel Bay, Cuba. She alleges that a portion of the land formerly owned by one of the companies is now occupied by Cuba's principal container terminal. The defendant, Seaboard Marine, is an international shipping company that delivers goods to the terminal. De Fernandez filed suit in the Southern District of Florida, asserting that Seaboard's use of the port constitutes ""trafficking"" under the HBA. The district court granted summary judgment in Seaboard's favor, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, allowing certain claims to proceed. Seaboard's certiorari petition raises three key issues with the Eleventh Circuit's decision, which we lay out below.

Shareholder Standing to Sue for Corporate Property

Seaboard argues that the Eleventh Circuit erred in allowing de Fernandez to sue under the HBA based on her status as a shareholder. The Eleventh Circuit reasoned that the statute's reference to plaintiffs who ""own a claim"" reflects Congress's intent to expand the pool of eligible claimants beyond titleholders. Seaboard contends that this interpretation is overly broad, violates traditional principles of corporate separateness, and risks opening the floodgates to duplicative or competing claims from multiple shareholders of confiscated corporations.

This issue will undoubtedly be significant for future HBA cases. We expect—especially in view of the claims filed to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission—that a great number of the most valuable claims to property in Cuba are owned by corporations.

Breadth of the Definition of ""Trafficking""

The Eleventh Circuit interpreted ""trafficking"" under the HBA to include any commercial activity that ""benefits from"" confiscated property, even indirectly. Seaboard challenges this interpretation, arguing that the Act requires a more direct connection between the alleged trafficking and the property. Below, the district court found no evidence that Seaboard's freight was loaded, offloaded, or transported over the specific parcel of confiscated land. Nonetheless, the Eleventh Circuit held that Seaboard benefited from the land because the terminal's overall functionality depended on it. Seaboard argues that this reading is overly expansive and that ""benefits from"" should be limited to investment-like exploitation rather than routine commercial use.

Narrow Construction of the ""Lawful Travel"" Exception

Seaboard also argues that its shipments of agricultural goods to Cuba fall within the HBA's ""lawful travel"" exception, which exempts from liability transactions incident to lawful travel. Seaboard operated under federal regulations that authorize such exports, including humanitarian shipments. However, the Eleventh Circuit narrowly construed ""travel"" to mean only the movement of people, excluding trade-related activities. Seaboard contends that this interpretation conflicts with federal law and regulations, which explicitly link lawful travel to authorized trade.

De Fernandez initially waived her response to Seaboard's petition. However, following its November 7, 2025 conference, the Supreme Court ordered a response, which is due by December 1, 2025. We will continue to monitor developments in de Fernandez closely. Alongside Havana Docks, the Eleventh Circuit's decision in de Fernandez is among the first appellate rulings to meaningfully address the scope and application of the HBA. Unless the Supreme Court intervenes, the Eleventh Circuit's interpretation will remain a significant precedent for HBA litigants.

Other Important Developments

A variety of interesting cases in the cross-border/judgment enforcement/arbitration-adjacent areas are winding their way through the courts. Next month, we will report on a few of these in greater detail, but here are some highlights.

Petersen v. Argentina

The long-running dispute (commenced in 2015) over the Petersen plaintiffs' multibillion-dollar claim against Argentina arising out of the partial renationalization of YPF (the Argentine oil and gas company) moved into the Court of Appeals. Last week, the parties argued Argentina's appeal of a judgment entered against it by the New York federal district court. The three-judge panel was comprised of Judges Chin, Cabranes and Robinson of the US Circuit Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit. The issues on appeal include forum non conveniens, comity, whether Argentine law was properly applied, and damages methodology. Argentina's sovereign-immunity defense was rejected by the Second Circuit in 2018.

Litigation Against Spain and India

High profile sovereign litigation against Spain and India continues to proceed in US courts. Spain is seeking certiorari to the US Supreme Court over a DC Circuit decision allowing a path to enforce arbitral awards against it in favor of NextEra Energy, Inc. of approximately $386 million. Spain contends that it did not agree to arbitrate, while the claimants have prevailed on their argument that the ICSID Convention makes clear that the question of whether Spain agreed to arbitrate falls to the arbitral tribunal. Last month, the Supreme Court sought the position of the Solicitor General on the question presented.

As to India, Antrix Corp. Ltd., a state-owned commercial division of India's space agency, is urging the Ninth Circuit to once again refuse to enforce a decade-old $1.3 billion arbitral award issued to satellite communications company Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd, arguing that the award has been set aside in India and that, in any case, jurisdictional obstacles stand in the litigation's way. You may recall we reported on this case previously at the Supreme Court last term, when the court reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision that the FSIA required personal jurisdiction to be established over the sovereign in enforcing an arbitral award.

Is there a time Limit to Vacate a Void Judgment?

Today, the Supreme Court will hear challenges to President Trump's tariffs, but there is also another case being argued: whether there's a time limit for filing motions to vacate allegedly void judgments based on claims that the issuing court lacked personal jurisdiction over a party.

Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited, Inc., has asked the justices to overrule a Sixth Circuit panel's refusal to vacate a 2015 default judgment against it. Coney Island Auto Parts claims the judgment was void when issued and is unenforceable now. Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited Inc. v. Burton, case number 24-808.

The Sixth Circuit (a 2-1 panel decision) held that Coney Island Auto Parts' motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4), which allows motions to vacate void judgments, was untimely because it had failed to file the motion within a ""reasonable time,"" as required by Rule 60(c)(1).

Coney Island Auto Parts claims the Sixth Circuit's reading of Rule 60(c)(1) cannot be reconciled with its plain text and history or the practicality of void judgments. While the rule establishes a one-year deadline for motions to vacate based on mistakes, new evidence or fraud, it only states that motions based on other reasons should be filed in an undefined ""reasonable time."" Since void judgments are invalid from the very beginning and cannot become valid over time, the company argues they can be challenged at any time.",http://www.mondaq.com/images/MondaqThumb.png,N,,2025-11-10 13:02:48.760506

She was removed from the case last year after a judge determined she publicly leaked internal records from Dominion in violation of a court order.
“If you are wondering how it could be that people are claiming that the 2020 Election was stolen and Donald Trump was able to win in 2024, this is why,” he said.
“This is all I can say on this issue at this time.” Dominion Voting Systems was sold last month to Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican director of elections for St. Louis, Mo., and renamed Liberty Vote.
It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s sweeping pardon Sunday night for efforts to expose voting fraud would affect Lambert’s case.","The Supreme Court on Monday declined to review the disqualification of an attorney accused of improperly accessing voting machines after the 2020 election as counsel in a defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems.

Michigan attorney Stefanie Lambert represented Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrne in the defamation suit brought by Dominion, a voting technology company that conspiracists homed in on in the wake of President Trump’s 2020 election loss.

She was removed from the case last year after a judge determined she publicly leaked internal records from Dominion in violation of a court order.

A lawyer for Byrne contended to the justices that Lambert’s apparent expertise in “election fraud” has made her a threat to Dominion, prompting the company’s bid to disqualify her from representing him in the case, even as she represents him in other litigation.

“Here, Petitioner’s counsel of choice is the leading expert attorney and primary counsel in election related cases across the country and other matters involving Respondent, including a breach of contract action,” lawyer Peter Ticktin wrote in Byrne’s petition to the court.

“Respondent’s motives are evident, because it continues to engage in reactive actions and conduct demonstrating its fear that Petitioner’s counsel will be able to continue to represent Petitioner in litigation with and involving Respondent,” he said.

There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Dominion waived its right to respond to Byrne’s petition.

Lambert faces criminal charges in Michigan over an alleged scheme to access voting tabulators following the 2020 election, as Trump’s supporters sought evidence that he won instead of former President Biden. She was scheduled to go to trial last week, but a judge pushed the proceeding to March.

Ticktin told The Hill that the case remains open for appeal that Byrne did not have the assistance of the attorney of his choice in the Dominion litigation. He also defended Lambert’s actions, saying she gave Dominion’s discovery file to law enforcement “as she was required to do so by statute” and describing her as responsible for preventing foreign election interference in the 2024 race.

“If you are wondering how it could be that people are claiming that the 2020 Election was stolen and Donald Trump was able to win in 2024, this is why,” he said. “This is all I can say on this issue at this time.”

Dominion Voting Systems was sold last month to Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican director of elections for St. Louis, Mo., and renamed Liberty Vote. The Hill reached out for comment.

“Does Dominion even exist anymore?” Ticktin asked, attributing its apparent disappearance to Lambert.

It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s sweeping pardon Sunday night for efforts to expose voting fraud would affect Lambert’s case.

Though Lambert is not named in the pardon, it grants a “full, complete and unconditional pardon to all United States citizens” for conduct relating to both the so-called “fake electors” scheme and “any conduct relating to their efforts to expose voting fraud and vulnerabilities in the 2020 presidential election.”

However, presidential pardons are limited to federal offenses, not state offenses, so it is not likely that she would immediately be absolved.

“Meanwhile, US funding cuts have led to shortages in shelter, education services and aid in the Bangladesh camps, putting additional strain on communities and further compelling people to seek the dangerous option of fleeing by boat.
It is currently unclear whether the boat began its original journey in Myanmar or Bangladesh.
Malaysia has a record of pushing back migrant boats from Myanmar.
In January 2025, authorities said they had expelled two boats ferrying about 300 undocumented migrants from Myanmar from the country’s waters.","Responding to the deaths of refugees and migrants on a boat that sank off the coast of Malaysia, Amnesty International’s Myanmar Researcher Joe Freeman said:

“This latest tragedy at sea in Southeast Asia once again lays bare the deadly risks faced by Rohingya Muslims who attempt to flee conflict and persecution in Myanmar, plus deteriorating conditions in refugee camps in Bangladesh.

“Those who were aboard a boat that sank off the coast of Malaysia had left a rapidly worsening situation both at home in Rakhine State and in overcrowded and underfunded camps over the border in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.

“In Myanmar, Rohingya civilians face food shortages, forced labour, arbitrary detention, and restrictions on movement while they remain trapped in a conflict between the Myanmar junta and the Arakan Army that has driven more Rohingya into camps in Bangladesh.

“Meanwhile, US funding cuts have led to shortages in shelter, education services and aid in the Bangladesh camps, putting additional strain on communities and further compelling people to seek the dangerous option of fleeing by boat.

“The Malaysian and Thai governments must coordinate comprehensive search and rescue missions for survivors of this tragedy and provide them with humanitarian assistance and protection from forcible return to Myanmar.

“The unconscionable practice of pushing boats away from borders must end, and regional governments must ensure that any boats carrying refugees and migrants are allowed to land safely in the nearest country. ASEAN leaders must act decisively to address the long-standing issue of Rohingya boats at sea, as well as the ongoing conflict in Myanmar.”

Background to the Rohingya refugee crisis

At least 11 people are reported to have died after a boat carrying around 70 migrants and refugees sank near the border between Thailand and Malaysia.

The passengers were among a group of around 300 mostly Rohingya people who were originally on a larger vessel before splitting onto small boats, according to Malaysian officials. It is currently unclear whether the boat began its original journey in Myanmar or Bangladesh.

Civilians in Rakhine State have been trapped in the armed conflict between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar military, which has blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid and carried out deadly indiscriminate air strikes. Amnesty International and other groups have also documented violations of international humanitarian law and mounting abuses against civilians by the Arakan Army, which now controls most of northern Rakhine State.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya are internally displaced, and more than 150,000 Rohingya men, women and children have fled across the border to the Bangladesh camps since late 2023, bringing the total number of refugees to an estimated 1.2 million.

The ruling is the latest legal blow to the Trump administration as it attempts to crackdown on protests against immigration raids nationwide.","President Trump has issued sweeping and unconditional pardons to his top allies who aided him in his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election–that’s according to the Justice Department’s pardon attorney. Among those pardoned were Rudy Giuliani, who tried to pressure state legislatures to reject Joe Biden’s victory in key swing states; Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff in 2020; John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro, two attorneys who conspired to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election results on Jan. 6; Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Trump; and Sidney Powell, who filed lawsuits challenging election results in key swing states. The pardons only apply to federal charges and don’t include state charges. Both Powell and Chesebro had pleaded guilty to state charges. Giuliani has been indicted in Georgia and Arizona. On Sunday, Trump also pardoned dozens of other Republicans who were involved in the plan to organize fake electors and promote conspiracies of alleged voter fraud during the 2020 election. Earlier this year, Trump had pardoned more than 1,000 Jan. 6 rioters.

The U.S. federal government shutdown has entered its 41st day. On Sunday night, seven Democratic senators broke away from their party to vote alongside Republicans on a key bill to end the shutdown and fund most government agencies until January 30. The Democratic senators include Tim Kaine of Virginia, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Dick Durbin of Illinois, as well as Maine’s Independent senator Angus King. The measure does not include an extension of the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. The bill still needs to pass the House before the government can be reopened, and that would require Speaker Mike Johnson to call a House session and finally swear in Representative Elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona; she would be the final vote on a discharge petition to release the Epstein files.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that air travel would be “reduced to a trickle” if the shutdown continues. U.S. airlines canceled more than 3,500 flights over the weekend, impacting tens of thousands of travelers nationwide. Travelers expressed outrage over the delays.

bq.Traveler Delia Nau: “I’m shocked and I’m shocked. And I’m…it is definitely a Republican shutdown. It’s not the Democrats. I understand why they don’t want to take all those people off, you know, health and wellness and insurance. It’s just, it’s ridiculous.”

Israeli air raids and drone attacks continue in Gaza despite the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that went into effect a month ago. Al Jazeera reports 2 people, including a child, were killed in southern Gaza today. This is Nidal Abu Arqoub from Khan Younis.

bq.Nidal Abu Arqoub: “The future is bleak and uncertain. Given our current situation, things remain as they are. Truce, no truce, we do not see a truce. The war is ongoing, and the horizon is dark. We see the country’s situation as very difficult.”

Meanwhile, Hamas handed over the body of Hadar Goldin, an Israeli soldier who was killed in a 2014 war in Gaza. It comes as Reuters reports U.S. officials gathered intelligence that Israeli military lawyers warned there was evidence that war crimes charges could be brought against Israel for its war on Gaza. The former U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters said the material was not broadly circulated within the U.S. government until late in the Biden administration. Lawyers with the State Department also reportedly flagged to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Israel might be committing war crimes.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian man in the Far’a refugee camp. It comes as Israeli settlers attacked a group of Palestinian villagers, activists and journalists on Saturday who had gathered during an attempt to harvest olives near a settler outpost. Two Reuters journalists–including photographer Raneen Sawafta–were injured in the attack in an area close to the Palestinian village of Beita. This is Mohammed Al-Atrash, a journalist with Al Jazeera, who recounted the attack by Israeli settlers.

Mohammed Al-Atrash: “I found myself alone and all the farmers walked down, so I decided to leave the area, during that they hurled stones toward us, like nothing I have witnessed before.”

In Oregon, a federal judge has permanently blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland. In her ruling U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointee, said the president “did not have a lawful basis to federalize the National Guard” and that “there was neither 'a rebellion or danger of a rebellion'” in Portland, as claimed by the federal government. The ruling is the latest legal blow to the Trump administration as it attempts to crackdown on protests against immigration raids nationwide.

In Massachusetts, a video obtained by the Boston Globe shows a man having what appears to be a seizure after federal immigration agents pushed, hit and pressed on his neck when the man attempted to hold on to his wife and crying child after the agents ambushed their car. Carlos Zapata, who is from Ecuador, reportedly lost consciousness as a bystander is heard saying on the video, “They’re trying to rip the baby out of [his] hand.” His wife was taken into custody by federal agents in front of their daughter, who is 1 and a half years old.

The Homeland Security Department later mocked the video of Zapata and his family, saying he faked a seizure to try to stop his wife’s arrest. She now faces deportation.

Two top executives at the BBC on Sunday abruptly resigned following backlash over the public broadcaster’s edit of a speech made by President Trump on January 6, 2021, before a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The resignation of BBC director general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness came just days after The Daily Telegraph published details of a leaked internal memo that said a BBC documentary edited Trump’s remarks in a way that it appeared he explicitly encouraged the Capitol insurrection. The BBC is reportedly planning to formally apologize to Trump, who celebrated the resignations saying on Truth Social: “These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election…What a terrible thing for Democracy!”

Trump has repeatedly defended unfounded claims that his 2020 loss to Joe Biden was rigged.

And the UN Climate Summit opens today in Belém, Brazil where the United States will be notably absent after the Trump administration declined to send a high-level delegation. The U.S. is still expected to influence the climate talks as Trump officials use lobbyists and economic threats to attempt to sabotage environmental initiatives and efforts to cut emissions proposed by representatives from around the world. The United States is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters, while Trump has called the climate crisis a “con job.” Meanwhile, representatives from the Alliance of Small Island States are again urging leaders of the Global North to commit to stronger action in order to prevent the worst impacts of global warming, including the phase-out of fossil fuels. This is Tuvalu’s Environmental Minister speaking in Belém Friday.

Tuvalu’s Environmental Minister Maina Vakafua Talia: “We had high hopes that this new agreement would give us the necessary legal measures to protect Tuvalu from the worst impacts of climate change related sea-level rise. Ten years on from Paris, we are gravely concerned about the slow progress in delivering significant emission reductions to ensure our survival.”

Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?” Since this meeting, the prevalence of aggressive collateral and warrantless ICE arrests has increased drastically, and their impact on communities is widespread.","Since President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January of this year, the total number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees has increased by over 20,000 people. As of September 2025, there were 59,762 people being held in immigration detention centers nationwide.

Due to such a rapid increase in detainees, detention centers are overcrowded, contributing to inhumane and troubling conditions. Many people have been given spoiled food and non-potable water, had no access to showers or clean clothes and face medical neglect for both physical and mental health concerns.

At least 23 deaths occurred in ICE detention during fiscal year 2025, an increase from 24 deaths in the prior four years combined. Several of these deaths were a result of apparent suicide due to the grueling conditions.

Although Trump and his administration promised to target “the worst of the worst,” 71.5% of those detained have no criminal convictions.

Many people have also been denied due process. The National Immigrant Justice Center states there must be probable cause that an individual is violating immigration laws and that they’re likely to escape before a warrant for arrest can be obtained. The agency’s policies list one of the most significant factors in determining the likelihood of escape is their ties to the community.

If these requirements are not met, the ICE agent is not legally permitted to make a warrantless arrest. Nonetheless, many long-term community members in the Chicago area were arrested without warrant by ICE and Border Patrol in early September during “Operation Midway Blitz.” The operation led to over 3,000 arrests by the end of October, many of these arrests being “collateral arrests” by ICE agents patrolling the streets.

A WBEZ Chicago interview with U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino revealed the collateral arrests in Downtown Chicago are partly based on “how they look.” Bovino has claimed his comments were taken out of context, but the unedited recording of the interview says otherwise.

Rather than seeking individuals who have raised legitimate suspicion of illegal activities, ICE is increasingly concerned with the appearance of arrestees.

While the arrests themselves are unjust, the violent methods used are even more so. In a “60 Minutes” interview with Trump, Norah O’Donnell described agents tackling young mothers, tear gassing in residential areas and smashing car windows during ICE arrests.

When asked if he felt ICE has gone too far with such tactics, Trump boldly states, “I think they haven’t gone far enough.”

It is this rhetoric that led ICE agents to detain pre-K teacher Diana Patricia Satillana Galeano on Nov. 5, following her into her place of work and dragging her out. Parents and children watched as this took place during one of the busiest hours of drop-off, according to Chris Widen, whose 4-month-old son is taught by Galeano.

DHS has disputed this narrative, claiming they attempted to conduct a targeted traffic stop prior to arriving at the learning center, and that they did not enter the building.

However, numerous eyewitnesses, including U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois, stated the ICE agents entered the facility and went room to room looking for teachers while young children watched. Ramirez and other elected officials are calling for a federal review of the agents’ actions.

The Trump administration pushes the narrative that detainees are dangerous, and that ICE is protecting the “American way of life.” ICE admitted in court that they identify people with pending charges or whose charges were dismissed as criminals, dismissing the right to a fair trial.

Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who served during Trump’s first term as senior advisor and speechwriter, has been one of the most active ICE proponents.

At a meeting between Miller and ICE’s top 50 field agents, Miller “eviscerated” everyone for not detaining more people who aren’t criminals. Miller’s desire to have everyone arrested with or without a basis for arrest is very clear, asking the field agents, “Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?”

Since this meeting, the prevalence of aggressive collateral and warrantless ICE arrests has increased drastically, and their impact on communities is widespread.

Miller told Fox News that ICE is looking to arrest at least 3,000 people a day, proudly stating Trump is going to continuously raise that number. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also emphasized the administration’s determination to “aggressively and efficiently” deport undocumented immigrants.

As of April, the University Police Department and the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office signed a 287(g) agreement allowing ICE to intervene on UF’s campus. This followed the detainment of UF student Felipe Zapata Velásquez, despite no previous criminal record.

Since then, students have been speaking out for others that can’t speak out for themselves. A recent protest on Nov. 5 shows their continuous effort to protect students and the community.

Regardless of your stance on immigration, needless aggression for the sake of efficiency is unacceptable. This blatant lack of empathy is not just impacting immigrants — it’s impacting entire communities nationwide.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ufa/ef41c3ee-b912-4c7e-b673-acd2368cb3e6.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&dpr=2&ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=faces,N,,2025-11-10 11:03:18.203822

USDA’s latest memo, sent Saturday to state directors of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, instructed states to deliver just 65 percent of benefits during the government shutdown and required those who already sent full payments to claw back that money.

“To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized. Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,” the memo notes.

The department threatened to take various actions if states don’t comply, including cancelling federal funds that go toward administrative costs for the program or holding states liable for “overissuances.”

The Saturday memo is the latest in a string of moves from the Trump administration that has altered federal guidance on SNAP on a near daily basis, first directing states to pay partial benefits, then saying USDA would comply with full benefits, then filing an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson agreed late Friday to lift a deadline imposed by a Rhode Island judge, who ordered officials to tap into a separate USDA nutrition account to deliver full SNAP payments this month.

Nearly 42 million Americans rely on the anti-hunger program, which went dark for the first time on Nov. 1 during the record-breaking shutdown.

Several states have rushed to redirect their own funds to support food banks and benefits for families, but the back-and-forth in court has caused significant confusion across the country.

The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.","More than 99% of the world's 7.7 billion people have one or more of their environmental rights threatened, according to new research.

In the most comprehensive analysis of inequality in environmental conditions to date, CU Boulder researchers revealed that nearly half of the global population lives in regions facing three or more environmental problems. Those include polluted air, unsafe water, extreme heat, food insecurity and biodiversity loss.

The analysis was published September 25 in Environmental Research Communications.

It provides strong evidence for urgent climate action, as representatives from nearly 200 countries prepare to convene for the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the United Nations' annual climate meeting, in Brazil beginning November 10.

""Over the years, communities around the world have been fighting for local environmental justice,"" said first author Naia Ormaza-Zulueta, a doctoral student in the Department of Environmental Studies. ""We want to stitch their stories into a single, undeniable global tapestry so that they can't be dismissed as isolated problems.""

In 2022, the UN formally recognized that everyone on Earth has the right to a healthy environment. The landmark resolution, while urging countries to take action to protect that right for their people, is not legally binding.

The resolution also failed to account for environmental harm caused by activities in other countries, said Ormaza-Zulueta. Extensive research has shown that large, industrialized nations, such as the United States, emit the most greenhouse gases, but lower-income countries experience the greatest impacts.

Pollution without borders

Ormaza-Zulueta and Zia Mehrabi, a data scientist in the Department of Environmental Studies and founder of the Better Planet Lab, wanted to put a number on how many people have had their environmental rights threatened.

They collected large datasets on environmental problems to calculate whether an individual in a given location around the world is experiencing, or has recently experienced, conditions that violated their rights in five core areas defined by the UN: clean air, clean water, a safe climate, healthy and sustainably produced food, and thriving biodiversity and ecosystems.

The team found that almost everyone on Earth lived in places that have recently experienced at least one environmental risk that failed to meet the UN conditions. Over 45%, or 3.4 billion people, had at least three rights threatened, and 1.25%, or 95 million experienced all five conditions.

""The numbers are heartbreaking,"" said Ormaza-Zulueta.

Having access to clean air, defined as an annual average outdoor particulate matter concentration below the World Health Organization guideline, was the most common threat, followed by access to healthy and sustainably produced food.

In Colorado, a study has revealed that ozone pollution, mainly from cars and oil and gas operations, causes more than 800 deaths each year.

""A lot of people think Boulder has great air quality for being so close to the mountains,"" said Mehrabi. ""But the reality is that our ozone level is high for multiple months during the summer. There are days when the air quality is so bad that our children can't play outside.""

Hotspots of injustice

While most people are at risk of poor environmental conditions, not everyone feels the same impact. Consistent with previous research, disadvantaged populations, such as those with lower incomes, those who are displaced and those living on Indigenous lands, are far more likely to experience poor air quality, limited access to clean water and excessive heat than the rest of the population.

Those living in wealthier areas usually experience the best environmental conditions and are more likely to escape the worst impact as climate change progresses.

Internationally, several environmental impact hotspots stood out in the study: South Asia, for example, contains 41% of all people living with all five threats to environmental rights, despite making up only one-fifth of the world's population.

Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found. For instance, pollution from the United States is responsible for 12,000 deaths from poor air quality in India each year and 38,000 deaths in China. Meanwhile, emissions from the 27 countries in the European Union have made extreme weather events 1.8 times more likely in Southeast Africa and the Amazon rainforest.

""No matter where we live, our rights are inherently connected to those of people in other parts of the world,"" Ormaza-Zulueta said. She added that the large demand for products in the United States and Europe has caused biodiversity loss and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The resulting global warming and increased frequency of extreme weather events are felt around the world.

""An unstable environment destabilizes our society,"" Mehrabi said. ""There is already a lot of fear in the United States and elsewhere about conflict, immigration, and other signs of instability. Environmental issues are only going to make them worse.""

Even though the statistics are bleak, Mehrabi said they don't tell the whole story. In addition to the five core categories, many people are at risk of other poor conditions that were not measured, such as exposure to toxins released from mining and plastic waste.

""There are many solutions to these environmental problems we're facing now, from responsible clean energy to a more sustainable and just supply chain. We need strong policies that encourage businesses to adopt these solutions,"" Mehrabi said.

Mehrabi pointed to due diligence laws in countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Germany, which require domestic companies to uphold human rights across their global operations. He said other nations need to follow suit.

The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.

""By showing how these injustices are happening across the world, deniers can no longer dismiss the polluted river here or dirty air there as anecdotes.

TOP TALKER

TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS: A group of business and civic leaders published an open letter in the Chicago Tribune on Sunday to voice their opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration-enforcement actions.

“We are united in opposing these extreme enforcement methods that cause long term harm to our city. While immigration policy is complex and opinions differ, we agree on this: these tactics are not welcome in our city,” they wrote in the full-page ad.

Most of the signatories are familiar names in Democratic circles — Chicago is a Democratic town, after all. Among them: John Atkinson, head of the Illinois Economic Development Corporation and an ally of Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, former Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Ariel Investments Co-CEO and Democratic donor John Rogers Jr.

But also signing the letter was Craig Duchossois, chair emeritus of the Duchossois Group, which recently secured a $5 billion investment from Blackstone Inc. Duchossois is also a major Republican donor, contributing more than $18 million to GOP candidates and causes in the last election cycle. Duchossois’ daughter, Ashley Joyce, who chairs the family company, also signed the letter in the Tribune. Neither returned our request for comment.

What it means: Duchossois speaking up signals that Democrats aren’t the only ones opposed to tactics by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. We hear other Illinois Republicans in the business community have also, quietly, voiced their concerns to friends within Trump’s circle.

The White House defended its actions, saying, Operation Midway Blitz has taken “dangerous criminal illegals” off Chicago’s streets. “Making Chicago communities safer will create an environment where all businesses can thrive in the long-term and their customers can feel safe. Chicago leaders should’ve never made their city a sanctuary for these dangerous criminal illegals to begin with.” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Playbook.

On Friday, some of those who signed the public letter stood together at a press briefing to express their concern that immigration enforcement is hurting the economy.

“We know the president listens to business leaders,” said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition. “He’s extremely motivated by what the business community has to say.”

Shi said revenues for some businesses have declined by 50 percent. “Immigrants, along with undocumented immigrants, contribute $22 billion in taxes and local spending every year,” Shi said. “They’re not just part of our economy. They drive it.”

And Jack Lavin, CEO of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, said the ramped up immigration enforcement has “scared people away” from restaurants, cultural events and downtown “the heart of Chicago’s economic engine.” More from ABC 7’s Sarah Schulte

At least for now.

[Read: Immigrant Aid in Orange County Poised to Expand]

On the Prop. 50 election night, city council members voted 3-2 to table proposals for a $100,000 immigrant legal defense fund and a $100,000 rent and food assistance program amid budget concerns as officials are projected to face a $10 million deficit at the end of the decade.

Councilman Nick Dunlap said the city can’t afford to fund the aid programs.

“We’ve got parts of our city where entire neighborhoods are without street lights. We’ve got neighborhoods where the roads and streets are so bad that kids and adults can’t ride their bikes and can’t play without worrying about tripping or hurting their feet,” he said.

Dunlap also said people reached out to him and raised concerns that the aid programs were divisive because of their limited funds.

“It seems extra divisive because if there were additional funds available, they should be going to serve our entire community and not a particular group of our community,” he said.

Council members Ahmad Zahra, who spearheaded the proposals, and Shana Charles were the dissenting votes.

“If fiscal responsibility is the goal then I think we should go and reconsider a lot of votes that we’ve taken in the past,” Zahra said at Tuesday’s meeting.

“Maybe we should reconsider firing our city manager back a few years ago, that cost us to pay two city managers at the same time because we had a nine months severance package.”

Charles called the widespread deportation sweeps a public health emergency and said federal immigration agencies are disregarding the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S, Constitution.

“I hope you find it within your heart to have compassion for our neighbors who are experiencing terrifying persecution because of their skin color or spoken language. This is how we show that our city stands up for human rights and the U.S. Constitution,” she said at Tuesday’s meeting.

Charles said she worries about her own family including her children who are Guatemalan American.

“I would be worried that my kids would say to me, ‘Mom, I’m now ashamed of what you did’ if I said to them, yeah, we have $30 million in the bank, and we’re just going to leave $200,000 of it sitting there instead of doing something real that could help real families,” she said.

“This $200,000 is not going to break us, but it could absolutely do some real good right now.”

The council’s aid fund rejection comes as immigrant advocates warn that the roving deportation sweeps that kicked off in June are ramping up again as food bank leaders warn of a sharp increase in hunger amid the longest government shutdown in history.

According to the USC Equity Research Institute, about 16% of Fullerton residents are undocumented or live with an undocumented family member in a city of roughly 137,000 people.

Fullerton’s Financial Woes

Funding for both programs would have come from the roughly $27 million left in the city’s general fund reserve after officials allocated roughly $3.8 million from that pot of money to balance their budget earlier this year.

Fullerton is also facing a projected $9.3 million deficit next fiscal year that, if left unchecked, could go up to $10 million by the end of the decade, according to the city budget.

Councilwoman Jamie Valencia, who had previously voted to bring back proposals on the immigration aid funds, did not directly speak to why she voted against the proposals this time but asked a couple of questions on the budget.

“We have such a huge deficit that we need for critical infrastructure for our city. That’s what cities focus on,” she said.

“When we brought this two weeks ago to council, my main concern was that I would love city staff to come back to the table and explain, does our city and can our city financially support without getting away from our critical infrastructure bank and to keep our city going?”

The proposed amount for the programs – $200,000 – is less than 1% of the city’s reserves.

Like Valencia, Mayor Fred Jung didn’t speak to his vote directly, but asked about the budget.

Zahra said the programs were about helping residents in need and the amount wouldn’t break the bank.

“This is not going to impact us. We can weather this. It’s a small amount of money,

and these are what reserve funds are for,” Zahra said.

Charles said the city is expected to discuss two separate proposed sales tax increase measures before next year’s November election that could bring in $15 million for infrastructure like road repairs and $15 million for public safety.

Sounding Off on Immigration Aid Funds in Fullerton

Dozens of people came out to speak in favor of the aid funds in Fullerton Tuesday, arguing officials need to step up to protect and support local immigrant families during a time when they are struggling and fear their loved ones being deported.

A majority of Fullerton School Board members, including Vanessa Estrella, Miguel Alvarez and Ruthi Hancett, were among the speakers in favor of the proposals arguing that it was necessary to keep families together.

“Fullerton School District has already lost some of our students when their parents were deported suddenly,” Hancett said.

“Other families are living in constant fear and have restricted their movements because of the risk of being deported, not because they’re criminals, but because of the illegal ways that immigration is being enforced.”

Some of the speakers wore t-shirts with monarch butterflies – a longtime symbol of immigration for the insect’s migration pattern between Mexico and the U.S.

Others wore white.

Aliya Yousufi, senior policy and advocacy manager at the Council on Islamic-American Relations in Anaheim, said the legal aid fund is necessary because immigrants aren’t always guaranteed a public defender.

“Without access to legal representation, many residents, including those who worship, work and study right here in Fullerton, are forced to face the system alone,” she said at Tuesday’s meeting.

“A legal defense fund would ensure that every Fullerton resident, regardless of status, has fair representation and a chance to stay with their family.”

Some of the speakers spoke directly to Councilwoman Valencia saying she represented a predominantly Latino district and urged her to support local families.

Tanya Leon, a resident and program manager with the OC Justice Fund, said without city support Fullerton residents in detention will have no place to turn for help.

“I just don’t see what the point of fixing critical infrastructure is if Fullertonians are no longer here to use it,” Leon said. “Our residents are district four residents. They are being removed. It makes no difference to me if my streets are better, if my neighbors can’t use them.”

Two people on Zoom spoke out against the proposals, arguing private nonprofits should be the ones supporting immigrants, not the taxpayers.

Jack Dean, a Fullerton resident who served on the city’s fiscal sustainability committee, said the city doesn’t have the money and taxpayers shouldn’t fund a partisan cause.

“I would urge you to work with existing organizations to assist undocumented immigrants begin collecting donations,” he said.

“If you truly believe in this cause, all of you in attendance tonight should be among the first to contribute. Let’s use city funds on services and projects that are needed here and that benefit all city taxpayers.”

Another speaker on Zoom who identified himself solely as Tony agreed.

“It’s not the job of the government to help people with legal aid,” he said.

“I’m willing to help them. I mean, everybody that was here tonight, if they all pitched in, we’d probably have $200,000. We don’t need the government to help community members.”

Those living in wealthier areas usually experience the best environmental conditions and are more likely to escape the worst impact as climate change progresses.
Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found.
“No matter where we live, our rights are inherently connected to those of people in other parts of the world,” Ormaza-Zulueta said.
The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.","More than 99% of the world’s 7.7 billion people have one or more of their environmental rights threatened, according to new research.

In the most comprehensive analysis of inequality in environmental conditions to date, CU Boulder researchers revealed that nearly half of the global population lives in regions facing three or more environmental problems. Those include polluted air, unsafe water, extreme heat, food insecurity and biodiversity loss.

The analysis was published September 25 in Environmental Research Communications.

It provides strong evidence for urgent climate action, as representatives from nearly 200 countries prepare to convene for the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the United Nations’ annual climate meeting, in Brazil beginning November 10.

“Over the years, communities around the world have been fighting for local environmental justice,” said first author Naia Ormaza-Zulueta, a postdoctoral researcher in the Better Planet Lab at CU Boulder. “We want to stitch their stories into a single, undeniable global tapestry so that they can’t be dismissed as isolated problems.”

In 2022, the UN formally recognized that everyone on the planet has the right to a healthy environment. The landmark resolution, while urging countries to take action to protect that right for their people, is not legally binding.

The resolution also failed to account for environmental harm caused by activities in other countries, said Ormaza-Zulueta. Extensive research has shown that large, industrialized nations, such as the United States, emit the most greenhouse gases, but lower-income countries experience the greatest impacts.

Pollution without borders

Ormaza-Zulueta and Zia Mehrabi, a data scientist in the Department of Environmental Studies and founder of the Better Planet Lab, wanted to put a number on how many people have had their environmental rights threatened.

They collected large datasets on environmental problems to calculate whether an individual in a given location around the world is experiencing, or has recently experienced, conditions that violated their rights in five core areas defined by the UN: clean air, clean water, a safe climate, healthy and sustainably produced food, and thriving biodiversity and ecosystems.

The team found that almost everyone on Earth lived in places that have recently experienced at least one environmental risk that failed to meet the UN conditions. Over 45%, or 3.4 billion people, had at least three rights threatened, and1.25%, or 95 million experienced all five conditions.

“The numbers are heartbreaking,” said Ormaza-Zulueta.

Having access to clean air, defined as an annual average outdoor particulate matter concentration below the World Health Organization guideline, was the most common threat, followed by access to healthy and sustainably produced food.

In Colorado, a study has revealed that ozone pollution, mainly from cars, and oil and gas operations, causes more than 800 deaths each year.

“A lot of people think Boulder has great air quality for being so close to the mountains,” said Mehrabi. “But the reality is that our ozone level is high for multiple months during the summer. There are days when the air quality is so bad that our children can’t play outside.”

Hotspots of injustice

While most people are at risk of poor environmental conditions, not everyone feels the same impact. Consistent with previous research, disadvantaged populations, such as those with lower incomes, those who are displaced and those living on Indigenous lands, are far more likely to experience poor air quality, limited access to clean water and excessive heat than the rest of the population.

Those living in wealthier areas usually experience the best environmental conditions and are more likely to escape the worst impact as climate change progresses.

Internationally, several environmental impact hotspots stood out in the study: South Asia, for example, contains 41% of all people living with all five threats to environmental rights, despite making up only one-fifth of the world’s population.

Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found. For instance, pollution from the United States is responsible for 12,000 deaths from poor air quality in India each year and 38,000 deaths in China. Meanwhile, emissions from the 27 countries in the European Union have made extreme weather events 1.8 times more likely in Southeast Africa and the Amazon rainforest.

“No matter where we live, our rights are inherently connected to those of people in other parts of the world,” Ormaza-Zulueta said. She added that the large demand for products in the United States and Europe has caused biodiversity loss and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The resulting global warming and increased frequency of extreme weather events are felt around the world.

“An unstable environment destabilizes our society,” Mehrabi said. “There is already a lot of fear in the United States and elsewhere about conflict, immigration, and other signs of instability. Environmental issues are only going to make them worse.”

Even though the statistics are bleak, Mehrabi said they don’t tell the whole story. In addition to the five core categories, many people are at risk of other poor conditions that were not measured, such as exposure to toxins released from mining and plastic waste.

“There are many solutions to these environmental problems we’re facing now, from responsible clean energy to a more sustainable and just supply chain. We need strong policies that encourage businesses to adopt these solutions,” Mehrabi said.

Mehrabi pointed to due diligence laws in countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Germany, which require domestic companies to uphold human rights across their global operations. He said other nations need to follow suit.

The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.

“By showing how these injustices are happening across the world, deniers can no longer dismiss the polluted river here or dirty air there as anecdotes. This can be a critical tool for pushing for policy changes,” Ormaza-Zulueta said.",https://mediasvc.eurekalert.org/Api/v1/Multimedia/1ced1b58-b9ce-4992-ac00-e2831fdf48d9/Rendition/thumbnail/Content/Public,N,,2025-11-10 12:03:07.241751

Sample of Portland, Ore., declared in a Nov. 8 statement regarding recent immigration enforcement activity in that state.
“It does not matter whether some of our brothers and sisters have proper documentation or not,” said Archbishop Sample.
“My heart is heavy because of the continued fear and anxiety that runs through the community of our Hispanic brothers and sisters in this archdiocese,” said Archbishop Sample.
“As your archbishop and spiritual father, I wish I could remove this cross from you,” Archbishop Sample told the Hispanic Catholic faithful in his message.
“We are in this together to uphold the dignity of every human person, every child of God,” said Archbishop Sample, urging all to “lean on the love that Jesus has for each one of us.","Human dignity comes “not from government, but from our loving God,” Archbishop Alexander K. Sample of Portland, Ore., declared in a Nov. 8 statement regarding recent immigration enforcement activity in that state.

“It does not matter whether some of our brothers and sisters have proper documentation or not,” said Archbishop Sample. “They are our brothers and sisters in the body of Christ.”

The archbishop’s statement — posted in both English and Spanish on the archdiocesan website and the archbishop’s social media platforms, along with a video version of the message — follows months of immigration raids and arrests under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants lacking permanent legal status in the U.S., a group known to be majority Catholic Christians.

“My heart is heavy because of the continued fear and anxiety that runs through the community of our Hispanic brothers and sisters in this archdiocese,” said Archbishop Sample. “This is due to the increased ICE activity within our communities, even now in the vicinity of some of our parishes.”

Oregon has become one of several flashpoints for tensions over the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies, with regular protests taking place outside the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland.

“I want to assure our Hispanic brothers and sisters that the shepherds of the church in the United States are working diligently to advocate for their humane and respectful treatment. We are doing all that we can to alleviate this suffering,” said Archbishop Sample, who noted he is currently attending the annual U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ fall plenary meeting in Baltimore.

Both Portland, Oregon’s largest city, and the state government have codified their sanctuary status, prohibiting their respective law enforcement personnel from assisting any federal agency with immigration enforcement.

In September, Trump federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect the building. The city of Portland and the state of Oregon sued, with U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut — a Trump appointee — temporarily blocking the deployment of the troops in an October order made permanent Nov. 7.

More than 200 individuals residing in Oregon have been detained by ICE officers since Trump took office, said Reyna Lopez, executive director of the farmworker advocacy organization PCUN (Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste), during an Oct. 31 press conference in Portland.

Several North Portland public schools have implemented “secure the perimeter” protocols — locking all exterior doors while continuing learning activities — in response to reported ICE activity. On Nov. 6, some 100 community members surrounded César Chávez School an hour ahead of dismissal to watch out for ICE officers during student pickup.

Catholic social teaching on immigration balances three interrelated principles — the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation’s duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

The Catholic Church’s teaching also makes clear human laws regulating migration are also subject to divine justice, but it has not yet issued teaching exploring the morality of deportation beyond the magisterium of St. John Paul II.

The late pontiff’s 1993 encyclical “Veritatis Splendor” (“Splendor of Truth”) and 1995 encyclical “Evangelium Vitae” (“The Gospel of Life”) — both quote the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes,” the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, naming “deportation” among various specific acts “offensive to human dignity” that “are a disgrace, and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer injustice, and they are a negation of the honor due to the Creator.”

He underscored their moral severity in “Veritatis Splendor” by calling them examples of “intrinsic evil,” explaining that, no matter the motives, these acts are “not capable of being ordered to God and to the good of the person.”

Across the U.S., Christians account for approximately 80 percent of all of those at risk of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort, with the single largest group of affected Christians being Catholics, according to a joint Catholic-Evangelical report published by World Relief.

The report found one in six Catholics (18 percent) are either vulnerable to deportation or live with someone who is.

According to a Pew Research Center data analysis from March 2025, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29 percent) or the children of immigrants (14 percent). But eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics are either born outside the U.S. (58 percent) or are the children of an immigrant (22 percent), while 92 percent of Asian Catholics are either immigrants (78 percent) or are the children of an immigrant (14 percent). Far fewer white Catholics — just 15 percent — share this immigrant experience: only 6 percent were born outside the U.S., with another 9 percent born in the U.S. to at least one immigrant parent.

“As your archbishop and spiritual father, I wish I could remove this cross from you,” Archbishop Sample told the Hispanic Catholic faithful in his message.

The archbishop assured them he was “deeply concerned over what you are experiencing right now, along with all of your local parish priests. I know this is a great burden for them as well, because they feel helpless to take this cross from you. … Please know that I and your pastors stand with you in solidarity during this difficult time.”

Archbishop Sample also addressed priests “who are caring for people during these difficult times,” promising his “support and prayers.

“We are in this together to uphold the dignity of every human person, every child of God,” said Archbishop Sample, urging all to “lean on the love that Jesus has for each one of us.

“He alone is our hope, and in him alone do we trust. He is with you always and will never abandon you,” said the archbishop. “Place yourselves in his hands.”

Archbishop Sample concluded his message with “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” (“Long live Jesus Christ!”) — the battle cry of the Cristeros, who defied the anti-Catholic, secular government of Mexico during the Cristero War of 1926-1929. The Cristeros’ defiant cry was made famous in particular by Blessed Miguel Pro. The Mexican martyr and Jesuit priest extended his arms in the form of a cross and shouted those words before he was executed by firing squad in 1927.

In 2000, St. John Paul II canonized 25 martyrs from the Cristero War. In 2016, Pope Francis canonized the most recent Cristero martyr, St. José Sánchez del Río, a teenager remembered for repeating “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” many times before his own public martyrdom in 1928.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The Senate voted 60-40 on Sunday to move forward toward passing legislation to fund the government and hold a later vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire on January 1. The agreement is a step toward ending the government shutdown, but does not guarantee that the health care subsidies will be extended. Mary Clare Jalonick and Lisa Mascaro report for AP News.

Federal judge Mark L. Wolf warned yesterday of the “existential threat to democracy” posed by the Trump administration, in an essay published in the Atlantic. The essay came two days after an announcement by the Federal District Court for Massachusetts that Wolf was leaving his post. Mattathias Schwartz reports for the New York Times.

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told young lawyers on Friday that Justice Department lawyers are “bouncing around this country fighting these activist judges,” adding “we need you, because it is a war, and it’s something we will not win unless we keep on fighting.” Avery Lotz and Andrew Pantazi report for Axios.

Far-right influencers have hinted online that U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Reding Quiñones will pursue charges of a “grand conspiracy” against Trump’s adversaries. The investigation appears to focus in part on a January 2017 intelligence community assessment about Russian interference in the 2016 election, looking particularly at the role played by former CIA director John O. Brennan. Quiñones last week issued more than two dozen subpoenas, according to sources. Glenn Thrush, Alan Feuer, and Charlie Savage report for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Department of Agriculture on Saturday told states to only move ahead with partial SNAP payments following the Supreme Court decision on Friday, according to a USDA memo. The memo instructed states to deliver just 65 percent of benefits during the government shutdown. “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized. Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,” the memo says. Rachel Shin reports for POLITICO.

Trump has pardoned several allies who backed his efforts to subvert the 2020 election, according to Justice Department Pardon Attorney Ed Martin who shared the documents on Sunday night. The pardons are largely symbolic as none of those who were identified in Martin’s post were charged with federal crimes. Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

Trump has also approved a pardon for former police officer Michael McMahon who was convicted of acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, conspiracy, and interstate stalking of a family living in New Jersey. Kenneth P. Vogel reports for the New York Times.

Ghislaine Maxwell is preparing a commutation application to be reviewed by the Trump administration, according to a document obtained by the House Judiciary Committee Democrats. If approved, Maxwell’s sentence could be significantly reduced. The Supreme Court already rejected Maxwell’s appeal to her conviction; Trump has not ruled out granting her a pardon. Hailey Fuchs reports for POLITICO.

Cornell University agreed to pay $30 million to the Trump administration to immediately restore millions in federal funding and settle investigations into Cornell’s response to antisemitic incidents on campus. The school has also agreed to invest $30 million on agricultural and farming technology programs; submit undergraduate admissions data to the administration; and comply with foreign funding reporting requirements. Bianca Quilantan reports for POLITICO.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

A 3-year old child died as a boat, carrying 21 migrants, capsized off Panama’s Caribbean coast on Sunday, according to Panamanian officials. An official confirmed that the boat was not traveling northward to the United States but in the direction of Colombia. This is the second known case of a child drowning this year on this ‘new migrant route,’ whereby individuals are returning to South America since the Trump administration closed the U.S. border. Panamanian officials say that since late September 14,000 people have travelled in small boats along the coast to avoid passing through the Darien Gap. Annie Correal reports for the New York Times.

Naomi Seibt, a prominent far-right German activist, has applied for political asylum in the United States. Kate Brady and Aaron Wiener report for the Washington Post.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced yesterday that it would suspend export controls for a year on five critical minerals needed for the manufacture of certain semi-conductors and explosives. On Friday, the Ministry of Commerce suspended export control regulations on rare earth materials as agreed between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of October. Keith Bradsher reports for the New York Times.

U.S. government officials will not attend this year’s G20 summit in South Africa, Trump said on Friday. “Afrikaners… are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,” Trump posted on Social Media, adding that “no U.S. Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.” Faith Wardwell reports for POLITICO.

More than $5 billion worth of U.S. weapon exports to support NATO allies and Ukraine have been delayed by the government shutdown, according to a State Department estimate shared with Axios. “This is actually really harming both our allies and partners and US industry to actually deliver a lot of these critical capabilities overseas,” a senior official said. Stef W. Kight reports.

The United States on Friday opted out of a regular review of its human rights record at the U.N. Human Rights Council. AP News reports.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday condemned the COP30 summit as “essentially a hoax,” adding “It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives.” A White House spokesperson said regarding COP30 that “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.” Derek Gatopoulos, Theodora Tongas, and Mauricio Savarese report for AP News.

GLOBAL AFFAIRS

Thailand today threatened to suspend the ceasefire agreement with Cambodia following the explosion of a land mine in the border area that injured two Thai soldiers. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said that the “hostility towards our national security has not decreased as we thought it would,” adding that all action under the U.S.-brokered truce agreement will be halted until Thailand’s demands are met. There was no immediate response from the Cambodian government. Jintamas Saksornchai reports for AP News.

Malaysian authorities said today that hundreds of migrants who left western Myanmar about two weeks ago were missing at sea, including dozens who were on a boat that capsized over the weekend. The migrants had initially set off in a wooden boat carrying about 300 people, according to the Langkawi District Police, adding that the passengers were then transferred to two other boats on Thursday. One boat, carrying 70 people, capsized on Saturday. The police have recovered seven bodies and 13 survivors. The other boat, carrying about 230 others, is still missing at the time of writing. Zunaira Saieed and Ashley Ahn report for the New York Times.

BBC Director General Tim Davie and CEO Deborah Turness resigned yesterday following a report in the Telegraph last week that the public broadcaster had misleadingly edited a speech by Trump prior to the Jan 6. Capital riot. The Telegraph leaked a BBC internal memo arguing that a BBC Panorama documentary had juxtaposed Trump’s comments in a way that made it sound as though he had explicitly encouraged the attack. Stephen Castle reports for the New York Times.

The Saudi Arabian government has disclosed at least 320 executions so far this year. According to human rights group Reprieve, two-thirds of the executions this year have been related to drug offenses. In court documents reviewed by the New York Times, some of those facing the death penalty are low-level smugglers who say they were coerced into carrying drugs. Ismaeel Naar and Vivian Nereim report.

A Paris appeal court is considering the request for release of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy Nicholas from prison. The ruling is expected this afternoon. The appeal trial is expected to take place in several months, possibly in spring. Vaux-Montagny and Sylvie Corbet report for AP News.

The Serbian Parliament on Friday approved a new law to tear down the former General Staff military complex in Belgrade which was bombed by NATO in 1999 and to replace it with a Trump-branded hotel and apartments. The plans had previously been stalled after Serbian government officials who had endorsed it were charged with fraud. Lara Jakes and Alisa Dogramadzieva report for the New York Times.

Syria carried out nationwide operations targeting Islamic State cells, which involved 61 raids and 71 arrests, a Syrian Interior Ministry spokesperson said on Saturday. Timour Azhari reports for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Over 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, Gaza health officials said on Saturday. The death toll includes bodies recovered from the rubble in Gaza and Palestinians killed by the Israeli army since the ceasefire began on October 10. Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinians on Saturday who approached troops, the Israeli army said in a statement. Israel on Saturday returned the remains of another 15 Palestinians to Gaza, a day after Hamas returned the remains of the deceased hostage, Lior Rudaeff. Wafaa Shurafa, Sally Abou Aljoud, and Julia Frankel report for AP News.

The U.S.-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre in southern Israel replaced Israel as the overseer of humanitarian aid to Gaza on Friday, but the Israelis are still “part of the conversation,” a U.S. official said. The United States has not yet said which of the Israeli restrictions on aid might be lifted or how the CMCC plans to manage aid operations. A statement from COGAT, the unit within the IDF responsible for facilitating aid to Gaza, said that while “the Americans will take the lead…It should be emphasized that this does not constitute a transfer of authority or responsibility from COGAT.” Karen DeYoung, Claire Parker, Alex Horton, and Cate Brown report for the Washington Post.

The World Bank supports the U.S.-drafted U.N Security Council resolution on Gaza that would authorize a two-year mandate for a ‘Board of Peace’ transitional governance administration, according to a letter, dated Saturday, seen by Reuters. Michelle Nichols reports.

Hamas fighters in Rafah, within the Israeli-controlled area of Gaza, will not surrender to Israel, Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades said yesterday, adding that “the enemy must know that the concept of surrender and handing oneself over does not exist in the dictionary of the Al-Qassam Brigades.” Hamas did not comment directly on continuing U.S.-led talks over the fighters in Rafah. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

The Biden administration last year gathered intelligence that Israeli military lawyers were concerned about the legality of the tactics being used by Israel’s army in the war in Gaza, which could support charges of war crimes against Israel, according to five former U.S. officials. The intelligence prompted an interagency meeting at the National Security Council in late 2024 where officials and lawyers debated how to respond. Three former officials said that U.S.-lawyers concluded that it was still legal for the U.S. to continue supporting Israel with weapons and intelligence because the U.S. had not gathered its own evidence that Israel was violating the law of armed conflict. Erin Banco, Jonathan Landay, and Humeyra Pamuk report for Reuters.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Friday that Israeli settlers carried out at least 264 attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in October. OCHA added that this amounts to an average of eight incidents per day and marks the biggest monthly total since the U.N. began tracking such incidents in 2006. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

President Donald Trump granted Hungary a one-year exemption from U.S. sanctions on Russian oil, following a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the White House on Friday. Hungary also agreed to buy liquefied natural gas from the United States, according to a State Department fact sheet. Erica L. Green reports for the New York Times.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

Last week, the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary announced it had agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by the United States, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The Sudanese government’s ambassador to South Africa said on Friday it was too early for his country to agree to the plan, adding “we had many truces at the beginning of the war but every time there was no respect from the [RSF].” Residents in Khartoum told AFP News Agency that they heard the sounds of drones and explosions early on Friday morning. Barbara Plett Usher and Mayeni Jones report for BBC News.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily halted a lower court order that would have required the Trump administration to fund SNAP payments in full. Tony Romm and Abbie VanSickle report for the New York Times.

A federal appeals court on Sunday night declined to block an order from a district court judge requiring the Trump administration from paying SNAP payments in full for November. The ruling is on hold due to an earlier order from the Supreme Court on Friday. Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that Trump overstepped his authority when he sought to deploy the National Guard troops to Portland for the stated purpose of protecting the ICE office, issuing a permanent block on troop deployment. Anna Griffin reports for the New York Times.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that the Education Department had violated the First Amendment rights of furloughed workers by using their work email accounts to send partisan messages blaming Democratic lawmakers for the government shutdown. Chris Cameron reports for the New York Times.

,Litigation,2025-11-10 13:15:03+00:00,The Denver Post,Supreme Court to hear arguments in Aurora detention center lawsuit - The Denver Post,Seth Klamann,,,,,https://www.denverpost.com/2025/11/10/supreme-court-colorado-case-detention-center-geo/,"The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday in a class-action lawsuit against Aurora’s immigration detention center, considering a legal question in the more-than-decade-old case that accuses the facility of enacting a system of forced labor.
That’s the question that the U.S. Supreme Court will consider: whether Geo can appeal now.
The Geo Group has filed multiple appeals — including an earlier request to the Supreme Court that was rejected.
The state Supreme Court and a federal appellate court both sided with the detainees.
In an earnings call Thursday, George Zoley, the executive chairman of Geo’s board, said the company had also appealed that decision to the U.S Supreme Court.","The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday in a class-action lawsuit against Aurora’s immigration detention center, considering a legal question in the more-than-decade-old case that accuses the facility of enacting a system of forced labor.

Filed on behalf of nine now-former detainees, the 2014 lawsuit accuses the private prison company that runs the facility of forcing random detainees to clean parts of the facility for free. If they refused, the lawsuit alleges, detainees — meaning immigrants without proper legal status — faced solitary confinement.

But the high court’s justices aren’t set to weigh in on the primary allegations in the suit when they convene Monday morning. Instead, they’ll consider a denser legal question. The company that owns the facility, the Geo Group, has tried to argue that it has immunity from the litigation as a government contractor. But a federal judge rejected that defense.

Geo then appealed, but in late 2024, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — the federal appellate court overseeing Colorado — declined to overturn the lower court’s ruling. Its judges wrote that Geo couldn’t appeal the ruling while the broader lawsuit was still underway.

That’s the question that the U.S. Supreme Court will consider: whether Geo can appeal now.

The Geo Group asked the high court to intervene earlier this year, citing conflicting rulings from judges across the country on similar questions. If the Supreme Court sides with the company, the justices then would likely tell the 10th Circuit’s judges to circle back to the immunity question and decide if Geo can argue that it’s innoculated against facing the allegations.

Though complex, Monday’s arguments represent the latest incremental step in an 11-year-old legal saga. So old is the case that four of the Supreme Court’s current justices hadn’t been appointed when it was filed. Nearly 40 attorneys have filed to represent one party or another while the case has been pending. The Geo Group has filed multiple appeals — including an earlier request to the Supreme Court that was rejected.

“We’re looking forward to the opportunity to argue before the Supreme Court,” said David Seligman, a Denver attorney who is one of the lawyers representing detainees. “This case has been going on since 2014, and we and our clients are deeply frustrated by Geo’s efforts to continue delaying this litigation. All we want is the opportunity to have our claims vindicated in court.”

The Geo Group did not respond to an email seeking comment late last week, but its attorneys wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court: “The Tenth Circuit’s decision is the latest addition to a deep division in the circuit courts as to whether a denial of derivative sovereign immunity is an appealable collateral order.”

The Trump administration has asked to participate in the Supreme Court case and will argue on the same side as the detainees’ attorneys, against Geo’s appeal claims.

Immigration policy — and its enforcement — has undergone radical shifts in the country during the course of the litigation. Amid President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation efforts, the Aurora facility’s capacity has expanded to its full potential of more than 1,500 detainees. The Trump administration is also planning to expand its capacity in the state by reopening a private prison northeast of Denver for immigration detention. That facility was previously operated by Geo.

The work policy that the lawsuit challenges is still in place, said Andrea Loya, the executive director of Casa De Paz, a nonprofit group that works with detainees and their families.

“Unfortunately, that is still the same,” she said, adding that some current detainees protested the policy earlier this year.

According to the lawsuit and subsequent legal filings, officers in the Aurora facility have randomly selected six detainees from each of its housing pods every day. Those people have been required to clean the entire pod. If they repeatedly refuse, they “face a range of possible sanctions, including disciplinary transfer, solitary confinement for up to seventy-two hours, suspension of privileges, reprimand, and warning,” Chief Judge Jerome A. Holmes wrote in the 10th Circuit’s ruling last year.

When the case was first filed, the detainees’ lawyers also challenged Geo’s voluntary work program, in which detainees cook, clean, do laundry and maintain the facility’s landscaping for $1 a day. The attorneys argued that the practice violated minimum wage laws.

But U.S. District Court Judge John L. Kane rejected that claim, finding that the detainees weren’t employees and that Geo wasn’t their employer.

Other courts have ruled otherwise. In a separate lawsuit filed in Washington state against another Geo-run immigration detention center, a jury awarded nearly $17.3 million in back wages to detainees who participated in the voluntary work program, and a judge added nearly $6 million more in penalties, according to the Washington State Standard. The state Supreme Court and a federal appellate court both sided with the detainees.

In an earnings call Thursday, George Zoley, the executive chairman of Geo’s board, said the company had also appealed that decision to the U.S Supreme Court.

“No company has ever paid state minimum wages to individuals working in confinement facilities,” he said.

The company reported $173.9 million in net income for its third quarter and $222.5 million for the first nine months of 2025.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TDP-L-GEO-ICE-Crow-RJS-60235.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-11-10 11:03:33.346254

Trump Is on the Offense Against Workers Over a month into the longest government shutdown in history, over 700 thousand federal workers have been furloughed without pay since September; another 700 thousand workers deemed “essential” are working without pay.
While the administration throws up its hands and once again claims there’s no money to pay federal workers or deliver SNAP benefits, it continues to pay politicians, as well as the military, ICE, and police.
They will end the shutdown on their terms, not in the interests of the working class.
Universal healthcare has been a rallying call of rank-and-file workers — healthcare workers among them — for years.","Twelve days into the government shutdown, Vice President JD Vance threatened federal workers that they would feel the pain if Democrats did not agree to Republicans’ plan: “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be. To be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful.” Beneath his usual grimace of performative empathy, Vance exposed the callous truth of this face off between the Democratic Party and Trump’s GOP: workers’ lives are nothing but a bargaining chip for the two imperialist parties.

Left out in the cold by the Democrats and Republicans, the working class and poor are left to sort it out for ourselves. All workers, public sector and private alike, must demand that our unions take the side — not of the representatives of the bosses — but of the workers and oppressed, using their might to force an end to the shutdown, an end to layoffs and full backpay for all those furloughed, full employment and a living wage for all to feed their families, universal healthcare, and an independent, combative plan of action to fight all of Trump’s attacks on the working class.

Trump Is on the Offense Against Workers

Over a month into the longest government shutdown in history, over 700 thousand federal workers have been furloughed without pay since September; another 700 thousand workers deemed “essential” are working without pay. Though the courts have intervened to block permanent layoffs for now, the Trump administration continues to set its sights on cutting the federal workforce, especially in the departments of Education, Health, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The administration is again signaling that it intends to refuse backpay for workers furloughed during the shutdown, flouting a 2019 law that is meant to ensure workers are paid back after a shutdown.

42 million people have not received their SNAP benefits, as tens of thousands of federal workers flock to food pantries and rely on mutual aid to feed their families. Of course banks have been quick to profit off of working people’s hardship, offering short-term loans to workers unable to pay their bills and without the savings to make it through the shutdown.

Flights across the country are being disrupted as airport workers are forced to continue working with severe staffing shortages. Behind the disruption in service and dangerous chaos at airports are the over 11,000 air traffic controllers and other workers who are being forced to work without pay. Many of them are faced with the choice of not showing up to work (risking their jobs), or being exhausted by working additional hours at other jobs just to make ends meet.

The shutdown has been the perfect opportunity for the Trump administration to continue its mission of cutting the federal workforce, forcing hundreds of thousands of people out of their jobs in a second wave of cuts since Elon Musk departed from DOGE. According to some estimations, around two hundred thousand jobs had been cut in the federal administration as of September 23. Those targeted for layoffs during the shutdown show that Trump is not concerned about making the government more “efficient,” but in advancing its chainsaw agenda, dissolving the remaining frayed threads of America’s social safety net and consolidating executive power to attack his enemies.

After all, the shutdown itself is the Democrats’ response to Trump’s attempts to eradicate the limited provisions of Obamacare. The funding package put forward by the Republican Party would send health insurance premiums skyrocketing, effectively cutting off the 24 million people who do not get insurance from a job from access to healthcare. It would also keep in place the cuts to healthcare programs for working and poor people established in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

The Right is using the shutdown to punish its enemies while rewarding its allies. While the administration throws up its hands and once again claims there’s no money to pay federal workers or deliver SNAP benefits, it continues to pay politicians, as well as the military, ICE, and police. Trump enlisted billionaire Timothy Mellon to donate $130 million to the government to pay the military; the administration dipped into emergency funding to continue to pay ICE. And military deployments to the border continue apace to make sure no squabble in Congress affects Trump’s xenophobic war on immigrants. These extraordinary measures are of course due to the essential role these agents play in enforcing Trump’s agenda both domestically in the form of internal repression of immigrants and dissent, and internationally in the form of increasingly aggressive military and federal intervention at the U.S. border and in Venezuela and Latin America.

And as millions more people and families across the country face the fact that they don’t know where their next meal is going to come from, Trump is showing just who he represents. While Trump claims to be on the side of working people, his administration is threatening to starve workers and their families in order to make further cuts to social programs. Of course there is all the money in the world for Gatsby-themed Halloween parties for the ultra-wealthy and political elite, all the money in the world for a corrupt endeavor to construct a vanity wing of the White House with billionaire money in exchange for settled lawsuits.

So far the administration has been able to weather the storm of the shutdown. While federal courts were quick to intervene to cling to some semblance of stability as approval ratings for the government plummet and the capitalists gripe about lost profits, the Supreme Court once again ruled in Trump’s favor on the question of withholding SNAP benefits. It seems likely that the Democratic Party will cave and vote for Trump and the GOP’s funding bill to end the shutdown and stop the potential fallout from a shutdown that proves just how precarious most working-class people are in the richest country in the world.

Nevertheless there are signs that the shutdown may be accelerating anti-Trump sentiment, putting him in a weaker position. Despite divisions in the GOP over healthcare, the fact that the GOP is refusing to cede any ground to Democrats — no matter how much it takes a toll on the administration’s approval ratings — shows that this is Trump’s party through and through. Now Republicans are seeing that this comes at a cost, especially after the rebuke that Trump received at the polls in the most recent national elections and in the streets during the No Kings protest in October.

Democrats Are Mobilizing for the Next Election, Not to Protect Workers

The Democrats refused to fund the government supposedly in an attempt to protect healthcare for millions of working-class people in the United States and stand up to Trump. But this too-little, too-late maneuver is nothing but a play to capitalize on a narrow part of the most unpopular of Trump’s proposals to boost their own decrepit image and improve their chances in the 2026 elections.

The fact that they were ready to cave to the Republicans and accept a year-long extension of healthcare subsidies shows that this was never about ensuring that working people have access to medical care. Now that they have been the beneficiaries of anti-Trump sentiment during November’s elections, the Democrats are seeing this as a moment to project strength. As Senator Bernie Sanders said, Democrats “have got to remain strong” on extending Obamacare provisions, including “a commitment from the speaker of the House that he will support the legislation, and that the president will sign.” But while Democrats remain strong up on Capitol Hill, working people below are suffering each day that the shutdown continues.

But the shutdown is only useful to them until it starts to hurt their approval ratings. And despite their success in the elections, the Democratic Party remains deeply divided even on the question of just how much to stand up to Trump. It is likely that the right-wing of the party will cave without getting anything in return, while the progressive wing is betting that taking a stand now will improve Democrats’ standing in the view of the public. But this political oscillation between two dead end strategies makes clear that the Democrats will not be the ones to stand up to Trump. Until now, they have played by the rules, allowing Trump to move ahead with every single one of his attacks on working people, trans people, people of color, and immigrants. Democrats did not shut down the government to protest Trump’s rampant authoritarianism or attacks on immigrants and working people, but instead chose a safe political battle to score points against republicans toward the midterm elections. Ultimately the shutdown is part of a policy of normalizing Trump’s attacks on democratic rights, including attacks on workers rights and the right to protest.

The Democrats will not be the ones to stand up against Trump’s policies. In fact, they stand in the way of the working class and oppressed, uniting to fight back. Ultimately they have more in common with Trump and the Republicans than they have differences. That’s been true of their support for Genocide in Palestine and war in the Middle East, deportation of immigrants, and economic exploitation of billions of working people across the world. They will end the shutdown on their terms, not in the interests of the working class.

Workers Can Unite to End These Attacks. Unions Need to Take the Lead, Not Bow to Either Party of Capital

The Democrats and Republicans are weaponizing — often and publicly — the suffering of our class during the shutdown. They claim to act in our interest, but this shutdown is about nothing other than their own political jockeying. They may end the shutdown, but this does not repair the damage done to working people or prepare them for the hardships to come after Trump and the GOP’s cuts to social services and what limited government healthcare programs still exist.

The only ones shouldering the burden of this shutdown — even after it ends — are working and poor people. A continuing shutdown means further economic hardship; accepting Republicans’ funding bill means further economic hardship. Workers need to find their own solution, uniting across sectors and organized and unorganized workers to demand better living conditions and an end to Trump’s attacks without anchoring their struggle to either party.

That means a fight by rank-and-file workers with the leaders of the labor movement to carve an independent path. Union leaders have entered the fray of the government shutdown, only to take the side of Republicans or Democrats. Federal workers unions were initially supportive of Democrats’ move to refuse to approve the government funding bill, ready to put up this fight for the entire working class to have access to healthcare. Now as they feel the burden of the shutdown, it’s becoming clear that no politician is coming to save them, including their leaders tied to the Democrats. Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, has called on Republicans to cede to Democrats’ demands and “extend the subsidies and open the government.” Throwing their lot in with the Democratic Party, they tie the futures of working-class people to a losing strategy that will not guarantee anyone healthcare.

Meanwhile, Teamsters president Sean O’Brien continues to throw his support behind Trump. He appeared alongside union leaders and bosses alike in a video for the White House denouncing the shutdown. O’Brien called on Democrats “to make the deal they should have made a long time ago” — a deal that would cut benefits for workers across the country without a real plan to fight to win healthcare and higher wages.

This is not a union leader doing everything in their power to end a shutdown that is harmful to workers; this is a bureaucrat vying for a better seat at the table to negotiate the terms of exploitation for the workers he represents, tying workers’ futures to the political power of a far-right politician who has done nothing in his second term other than fire workers, attack immigrant and Black and Brown workers, and give benefit after benefit to the capitalists and ultra-wealthy. O’Brien is stepping aside to let Trump go on the offense against workers.

The labor movement must organize across the country to demand that their unions mobilize so that workers do not pay the price of this government shutdown or Trump’s attacks. This must go beyond federal workers’ unions to include all organized workers. Millions of workers rely on Medicare and food stamps — this is their fight too; but millions more still struggle to access healthcare. Universal healthcare has been a rallying call of rank-and-file workers — healthcare workers among them — for years. This cannot be a fight to simply extend a healthcare system that doesn’t work, to fight for the devil we know; rather it presents an opportunity to build an independent fight to win universal healthcare for all. We need high quality, state-funded universal health care for everyone living in the country that can’t be taken or negotiated away by the two parties of capital.

But the force to win these kinds of demands is built by uniting the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the Trump administration. From the No Kings march to Trump’s beating in the elections and the resistance to his immigration agenda in Chicago, its clear that there exists deep discontent with Trump and his policies — policies that are not only denying basic rights to immigrants, but also increasing the cost of living and making life harsher for people of color, women, the LGBTQI+ community and all exploited and oppressed people in the United States.

To stop Trump we need working class independence. Labor must join the fight, as did workers in Italy and the Spanish State to demand an end to the genocide in Gaza. Rather than waiting for the Democrats and Republicans to end the shutdown, the labor movement and social movements need to organize the fightback. That means working people taking to the streets, shutting down their workplaces and schools until social services are re-established and every single worker is rehired with full backpay. But it can’t stop there. The Democrats and Republicans are likely to pass this latest funding bill, one that spells disaster for working people. We must unite our struggles to fight for full employment and a living wage for all people regardless of their immigration status, and an independent, combative plan of action to fight all of Trump’s attacks on the working class. This must be united with the struggles against ICE and the National Guard, against the genocide in Gaza, and against Trump’s repressive and Bonapartist policies and his occupations of major cities.",https://www.leftvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/aedb15ec7b8d9057f76beda942cf0b3df299802a-1500x1000-1-e1762736817407.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 12:02:50.454404

That steep falloff in hiring included 76,000 fewer new jobs created in transportation and warehousing, 100,000 fewer in private education and health services, and 115,000 fewer in construction.
And a lot of the kinds of jobs Latino workers are more likely to seek — especially in construction — are the first to disappear in an economic slowdown.
Whether it’s more because of his economic or immigration policies, the fact is that Trump has been bad news for Latino workers.
Once in office, his dumbfounding policies have instead stalled hiring, including prominently in the industries most populated by Latino workers.","Because of historic discrimination and language barriers, Latino workers are more heavily represented in certain industries than in others. Those industries — which include construction, healthcare and hospitality — are also ones that have seen a dramatic slump in hiring in the early Trump administration compared to the last year of Joe Biden’s term.

That’s the finding of a recent report from my organization, Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), which has been taking a closer look at the impact of tax and other fiscal policies on the nation’s Latino community.

ATF estimated in another report last May, for example, that Latino workers would on average lose around $1,500 in 2026 from the combination of Republican tax and service cuts, plus the impact of President Trump’s erratic tariffs.

Our more recent report found that nearly 300,000 net fewer jobs were created in Latino-heavy industries in the first eight months of 2025 — under Trump — than in the first eight months of 2024, under Biden. That steep falloff in hiring included 76,000 fewer new jobs created in transportation and warehousing, 100,000 fewer in private education and health services, and 115,000 fewer in construction.

Businesses are naturally cautious to expand employment amidst the chaos of the Trump administration, which includes a record-long government shutdown, a huge increase in public debt, and an inscrutable tariff policy. And a lot of the kinds of jobs Latino workers are more likely to seek — especially in construction — are the first to disappear in an economic slowdown.

Not considered in the ATF report — since it’s outside our sphere of economics — is another crucial factor in the slowed growth of jobs traditionally and disproportionately held by Latino workers: the Trump administration’s harsh crackdown on immigration. But other reports have found a link.

A study conducted by a California university showed that increased immigration enforcement correlates with a decline in Latino employment in that state — which given its heavy Latino population and the focus it has received from ICE seems like a reasonable proxy for many parts of the country. This report found that over 360,000 fewer Latinos Californians were on the job between May and June of this year, a drop that corresponds to heightened immigration enforcement activity in the state.

A paper published in August noted a decline nationally in employment in agriculture, construction and hospitality — three of the Latino-intensive industries we note in our report — and blamed those losses on Trump’s aggressive deportations.

Whether it’s more because of his economic or immigration policies, the fact is that Trump has been bad news for Latino workers. And few Latinos occupy the rarified income levels that have been most helped by the presidential agenda.

The millions of Latinos making less than $53,000 will actually see their costs increasenext year thanks to GOP fiscal policies. To come out ahead next year after the combination of Republican tax cuts and healthcare-cost increases (caused by the GOP’s refusal to extend ACA premium subsidies), families have to be at least in the middle-income range of $53,000 to $91,000. But those folks on average get only about a dollar a day — a dollar easily swallowed by Trump tariff price hikes.

The real money will flow to those with higher incomes. Households with incomes between roughly $360,000 and $920,000 will pocket a net $5,000 or so on average next year. Households with income of about a million dollars and more will on average net out a $28,000 tax-cut bonanza — with those at the very top sopping up the most gravy per household.

Trump campaigned on creating a strong economy and bringing down costs for average Americans, including Latino families. Once in office, his dumbfounding policies have instead stalled hiring, including prominently in the industries most populated by Latino workers. His harsh immigration policies have made the general economic malaise even worse for Latinos. And his tax-and-spending agenda promises to raise costs for the lowest income 40 percent of households, where almost half of all Latino families can be found.

Polling shows Latino voters, who demonstrated a shift towards the Republican party in 2024, are shifting back towards the Democrats, a phenomenon demonstrated in the recent off-year elections. That makes sense since Donald Trump has delivered the opposite of what he promised.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cp-default-share.png,N,,2025-11-10 14:00:51.220275
,Policy,2025-11-10 12:29:08+00:00,POLITICO,"Legal immigrants face loss of Obamacare help, threatening insurance markets - POLITICO","Robert King, Alice Miranda Ollstein",,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/10/legal-immigrants-face-loss-of-obamacare-help-threatening-insurance-markets-00643210,"“This could potentially trigger some local markets to go into death spirals,” said Bustamante, who focuses on the health impacts of immigration policy.
While Republicans have repeatedly accused Democrats of using the government shutdown as leverage to ensure health care access for unauthorized immigrants, such immigrants were never eligible for Medicaid or ACA subsidies.
Connecticut’s state-run Obamacare exchange, for example, is among those that ramped up in-person outreach to immigrants, according to its CEO, James Michel.
While the U.S. has long imposed restrictions on immigrants considered a burden on taxpayers, the Trump administration was the first to designate public health insurance as a form of welfare.
“When you take health care away from one person in a family, the rest of the family is less likely to get the care they need even if they still qualify,” said Cadena.","Democrats, who are preoccupied with getting an extension of the enhanced subsidies, say it will be hard to undo measures in the megabill.

“Once we get the government open maybe we can get them to negotiate on that, but I am not optimistic,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) on Friday.

Immigration advocates worry that the impact of the loss is being underestimated and predict that entire families could lose access, including U.S. citizen spouses and children. The policy could also raise insurance prices for everyone, said Arturo Bustamante, a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, since immigrants tend to be younger and use fewer health services than the general population.

“This could potentially trigger some local markets to go into death spirals,” said Bustamante, who focuses on the health impacts of immigration policy. “If you only keep unhealthy people insured, who are expected to have high utilization of services, that essentially makes insurance really expensive.”

The 2010 Affordable Care Act offered insurance subsidies in the form of tax credits to lawfully-present immigrants who earned less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level — roughly $15,000 a year. The policy made it easier for green card holders, asylum seekers and refugees to qualify — some of whom are barred by law from Medicaid coverage for at least 5 years after arriving in the U.S.

The Obamacare tax credits, meant to fill this gap in coverage, will disappear starting next year due to a provision in Republicans’ One Big, Beautiful Bill Act. And in 2027, lawfully-present immigrants who earn more than 100 percent of the poverty level will lose discounted Obamacare rates available to citizens, based on income.

While Republicans have repeatedly accused Democrats of using the government shutdown as leverage to ensure health care access for unauthorized immigrants, such immigrants were never eligible for Medicaid or ACA subsidies.

State action

States and advocacy groups are scrambling to warn immigrants about the impending change and get the word out about their options.

Connecticut’s state-run Obamacare exchange, for example, is among those that ramped up in-person outreach to immigrants, according to its CEO, James Michel.

Advocates are stressing immigrants need to pay attention to the fine print of this open enrollment, which kicked off on Saturday for most states.

“They need to make sure they accurately represent their income, particularly if their income might be higher than the poverty line this year [because] that would make them eligible for tax credits,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior strategist for the National Immigration Law Center.

Some states have stepped in to provide Medicaid coverage for immigrants who don’t qualify yet for the program.

The 2009 Immigrant Children’s Health Improvement Act allows states to waive the five-year waiting period for children and pregnant women. As of April 2025, 37 states and the District of Columbia have taken up this option for children and another 31 for pregnant women, according to an analysis from the health policy research group KFF.

Fourteen states and the District of Columbia offer coverage for children regardless of their immigration status, including unauthorized immigrants, but these states have to use their own funds to pay for it. Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or ACA subsidies.

Since September 2025 seven states — Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and California — have offered Medicaid to anyone whose income qualifies regardless of immigration status. However, California, Minnesota and Illinois are scaling back their programs due to budget concerns, according to KFF.

Uncertain fate

Lawfully-present immigrants are bracing for an additional blow to their health care access: the expected revival of the so-called “public charge rule” from Trump’s first administration — which could penalize immigrants who take advantage of the health insurance programs they remain legally entitled to.

The Department of Homeland Security sent a draft proposal of the regulation to the White House on Monday — typically the final step before it is published for public comment.

The previous version of the policy, which the Biden administration stopped enforcing in 2021 and scrapped in 2022, empowered the government to deny immigrants’ applications for permanent resident status if they had received or were expected to receive food or housing assistance, Medicaid, or other public benefits. While the U.S. has long imposed restrictions on immigrants considered a burden on taxpayers, the Trump administration was the first to designate public health insurance as a form of welfare.

The scope of the new version of the rule is not yet known — which immigrants it will apply to and what kinds of benefits will be implicated — but data has emerged about the impact of the previous iteration that has alarmed advocates for immigrants.

“The public charge rule intensified a lot of people’s existing fears of accessing public benefits,” said Adriana Cadena, executive director of the advocacy group Protecting Immigrant Families. “Bringing it back now would only compound that effect, since there’s already a target on immigrants’ backs, and further erode their trust in government.”

A 2021 study found that the rule led many low-income immigrants to avoid using health services, including more than a quarter of legal permanent residents, who were not subject to the rule. The chilling effect began years before the policy took effect, fueled by rhetoric from federal government officials, the UCLA researchers found, and continued for more than a year after President Joe Biden got rid of the rule.

“When you take health care away from one person in a family, the rest of the family is less likely to get the care they need even if they still qualify,” said Cadena.

Bustamante predicted, based on this and other research, that both a revived public charge rule and the loss of ACA subsidies for legal immigrants will have spillover effects for the entire population. For instance, he said, the policies could burden already stressed hospitals if immigrants without health insurance skip preventive care and end up in the emergency room, and they could make it harder to control outbreaks of infectious diseases by deterring immigrants from seeking testing and treatment.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F09%2Fba%2Fcffa5af94e3197edc8bd9574b64b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2223600329,N,,2025-11-10 08:00:48.240185

During a one-day mission to Budapest on 22 October 2025, partner organisations of the Platform met with journalists, media representatives, legal experts, and representatives of civil society to discuss key issues affecting media freedom, rule of law and free expression. Stakeholders described a severely restricted media environment within which independent journalism operates, while also highlighting the deep political polarisation shaping the run-up to the expected April 2026 elections.

In the past year, the ruling party Fidesz has maintained the most sophisticated system of media capture and control yet seen within the European Union, constructed through sustained dominance over public media, continued consolidation of private outlets under allied ownership, and persistent distortion of the market through control over state advertising, with severe consequences for media pluralism and independent journalism.

While online harassment against independent media has long been documented in Hungary, including campaigns aimed at representatives of the Platform partners, the polarised and divisive nature of the election campaign has increased the severity and nature of the threats. Multiple stakeholders reported targeted harassment and smear campaigns directed at independent journalists and outlets by representatives and supporters of the two most prominent parties and media outlets deemed friendly to the ruling party, many of which are owned by the government-linked KESMA foundation. The partners were alarmed by reports that journalists have been smeared online and in the media as being affiliated with opposing political parties in an attempt to discredit them as trusted and independent sources of public interest information.

The partners also sought to assess the impact that the draft bill on the Transparency in Public Life had on the work of journalists, media outlets, and civil society. If passed, it would have allowed for the blacklisting, financial restriction and potential closure of media outlets receiving foreign funds, having a deeply chilling effect on media. For those able to remain open, they may be forced into exile to be able to continue reporting. The mission heard that the bill remains shelved, with no current indication Fidesz plans to reintroduce it ahead of the 2026 election.

However, the ruling party’s two-thirds parliamentary majority and recent extension of the state of emergency mean the bill could be passed immediately, without public consultation. Many representatives spoke of the uncertainty this proposed bill caused, as well as the resources expended by many to establish contingency plans to ensure they can continue their vital work. With its reintroduction still a possibility, the bill continues to pose an existential threat to what remains of Hungary’s free press.

The Platform further notes that although the foreign funding bill was withdrawn, the Sovereignty Protection Office (SPO), the government office that would be charged with overseeing the proposed law, has spearheaded the attempted delegitimisation of media that receive any form of foreign funding or grant, portraying them as foreign agents and traitors. The SPO’s reports have fed wider online harassment and hate against journalists working for these titles online and on social media, including referring to independent journalists as ‘political pressure groups’. The SPO has also supported campaigns led by the ruling Fidesz party to target journalists and civil society, such as the smearing of leading independent outlets and non-governmental organisations.

The Platform’s partners are also concerned about the rise of legal harassment directed at journalists and media outlets, including abusive claims based on the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or press correction procedures. While we support processes to hold journalists to account and ensure inaccuracies are addressed, we are concerned by reports that this process has been used to target factual if critical reporting. With the capture of Hungary’s courts by the ruling party a persistent issue, such legal harassment can have a disproportionate impact on public interest reporting.

Hungarian authorities have not made any progress in aligning domestic law with the EU’s European Media Freedom Act (EMFA) since its full entry to effect in August 2025. Those we met confirmed the absence of any engagement with media outlets or civil society towards this goal. Instead, the Hungarian government has presented the regulation as an authoritarian dictat from Brussels and has challenged the EMFA before the European Court of Justice, seeking to have it nullified.

Following revelations about the abuse of journalists using zero-click Pegasus spyware carried out by Hungarian intelligence services in 2021, prosecutors’ initial investigations failed to provide answers and, to date, no individual or authority has been held responsible for these attacks on journalistic privacy and source protection. Unjustified national security justifications have been used to shield the responsible state institutions from accountability, resulting in a state of impunity.

Beyond such surveillance, the partners also discussed the threat of Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks, a form of digital censorship that left the websites of more than 40 different media offline for several hours after a spate of attacks in recent years. Although police arrested an individual they claim is responsible earlier this year, it is unclear when the person will face trial and questions remain over whether the cyber-attacks were carried out with external coordination and resources.

The Platform partners note that after the mission ended, the Hungarian portfolio of Ringier, a Swiss media company, which includes the most popular tabloid, Blikk, was purchased by Indamedia, a pro-government media group. The acquisition, made ahead of next year’s election, is yet another example of the consolidation of media under ownership of private business interests close to the government and looks likely to further erode media pluralism in Hungary ahead of the vote.

Despite severe pressures on media freedom, quality and independent journalism continues to exist in Hungary and a cohort of outlets maintain a strong commitment to fact-based, public interest reporting. This is reinforced by high-levels of public support, which has translated to significant subscription funding and solidarity when an outlet is targeted. However, these outlets continue to face sustained economic, political, and legal challenges and their foothold remains extremely fragile.

The platform delegation included representatives from the Platform secretariat, ARTICLE 19, Committee to Protect Journalists, European Broadcasting Union, European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, European Federation of Journalists, Index on Censorship, International Federation of Journalists, International Press Institute, and Reporters Without Borders.

Prior to the commencement of the mission, partners reached out to organise meetings with the Prime Minister and the SPO. On behalf of the Prime Minister, Zoltan Kovacs confirmed that he was unavailable to meet due to prior commitments, while the partners never received a response from the SPO.

Dick Durbin,,,,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ice-chicago-raid-trump-durbin-rcna242614,"Masked, armed and wearing bulletproof vests, federal immigration agents stormed into Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago on Wednesday at 7 a.m.

But excessive militarized ICE raids and misuse of the military for immigration enforcement and domestic policing will not make Chicago safer.
I’ve spoken with protestors, just a few of the hundreds of people who have rallied together outside of the ICE facility to push back against federal agents’ actions.
Another ordered federal agents not to indiscriminately deploy tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray on peaceful protestors, journalists and clergy.","Masked, armed and wearing bulletproof vests, federal immigration agents stormed into Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago on Wednesday at 7 a.m. Without presenting a warrant, the agents dragged teacher Diana Galeano out from the day care’s vestibule. Despite her pleas of “I have papers,” urgently delivered in English and Spanish, the agents carted the teacher away as terrified children inside hid and parents outside filmed the arrest.

The arrest of Galeano, who has a valid work permit, is just the latest in a string of reports about the chilling, cruel and chaotic actions by Department of Homeland Security officers in Illinois.

Mr. President: Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles are not “the enemy.”

Thriving on the fear he is cultivating across the country he is supposed to be leading, President Donald Trump has unleashed militarized law enforcement onto the streets of Chicago. There, according to eyewitnesses and local reports, federal officers have zip-tied children, attacked clergymen with tear gas, tackled reporters doing their jobs and temporarily disappeared people based on their ethnicity and regardless of their immigration status.

On the campaign trail, Trump boasted he would be a “dictator” on day one. He has taken the unprecedented, unnecessary and unlawful step of turning the military on American cities to attack what he calls, the “enemy within.”

Mr. President: Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles are not “the enemy.”

Let’s call this what it is: political theater.

Wanting to play a strongman on TV, the president manufactured a crisis. He claimed Chicago needed to be “saved” and tried to deploy 500 members of the National Guard to the city, in a dangerous escalation of tensions he himself created.

That deployment is on hold, thanks to a federal judge’s order that the Trump administration is appealing to the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, under the president and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s direction, federal agents have conducted ruthless immigration raids across Chicago. They have forcefully arrested anyone — even the elderly, women and terrified children — that they suspect of being an immigrant.

And outside of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois — where many detainees are being held — federal agents have met peaceful protestors, journalists and even local law enforcement with excessive force.

My constituents live in constant fear of arbitrary arrests and detentions.

I have always supported bipartisan, evidence-based ways to reduce violent crime. But excessive militarized ICE raids and misuse of the military for immigration enforcement and domestic policing will not make Chicago safer. The administration’s expansive use of the military across the country to support immigration enforcement activities is a dangerous distraction that hurts military readiness, pulls our Guardsmen and women away from home and wastes precious taxpayer dollars to the tune of up to $2 billion by the end of the year, per Pentagon estimates.

Rather than earnestly addressing crime, the Trump administration has hindered crime control efforts by Illinois leaders and slashed funding for crime prevention programs.

This was never about reducing crime. If it was, President Trump would have bolstered support for crime prevention programs, not cut them to the bone. Instead, the president has chosen to punish the states that did not vote for him.

As a senator and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will use every tool at my disposal to push back against this president’s attack on our democracy.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth and I recently traveled to Broadview to visit the ICE processing facility there. We were denied entry. This was the fourth time I asked to visit the facility in several weeks, and the Trump administration has denied me entry every time. What does DHS have to hide?

Contrary to the Trump administration’s highly produced videos posted online, demonstrations at Broadview have been overwhelmingly peaceful. I’ve spoken with protestors, just a few of the hundreds of people who have rallied together outside of the ICE facility to push back against federal agents’ actions.

Who will protect Illinoisans and all Americans from masked immigration agents and federal troops?

And while the president says he’s deporting the “worst of the worst,” 70% of the people stopped by DHS and accused of violations have no criminal record. ProPublica reports that federal immigration agents detained at least 170 U.S. citizens in the first nine months of President Trump’s second term. And that number is only growing.

In one incident, a U.S. citizen said immigration agents arrested him at his Chicago home, detaining him even after he presented his birth certificate. In another case, federal agents arrested a U.S. citizen service worker on her way home because, as she told the Chicago Tribune, the agents said she didn’t “look like” the name on her passport.

My constituents live in constant fear of arbitrary arrests and detentions. President Trump threatens to unleash military forces to “protect federal buildings and agents.” But who will protect Illinoisans and all Americans from masked immigration agents and federal troops?

A federal judge has limited ICE officers’ use of warrantless arrests. Another ordered federal agents not to indiscriminately deploy tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray on peaceful protestors, journalists and clergy. But there are serious questions as to whether immigration agents are obeying.

I’ve called on Secretary Noem to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold her accountable for unlawful actions. And I’m working with other Illinois leaders, including Sen. Duckworth, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, to halt these clear abuses of power by the president.

President Trump does not want to fight crime. He wants to spread fear. And he is destroying the values that define us as Americans. I will continue to hold this administration accountable for its unlawful actions and to stop the president’s unnecessary and dangerous deployment of our nation’s military to city streets.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251107-ICE-zz-5bf2c3.jpg",N,,2025-11-10 09:18:47.520948

He alleges that IPS is limiting ICE's access to school grounds and prohibiting IPS employees from assisting or sharing information with ICE.
Rokita says these policies are not only illegal but are also making schools ""vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens.""
According to court documents, the district does not allow ICE officers inside school buildings without a warrant.
Rokita alleges that IPS instead connected the student with an immigration attorney and that the father and son missed their deportation flight.","Indianapolis Public Schools is pushing back against Attorney General Todd Rokita's ""silly litigation"" and rhetoric that school officials say has left them ""deeply offended.""

Why it matters: Acting on behalf of the state, Rokita is suing Indiana's largest school district for policies he says make it hard for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to do their jobs.

Driving the news: Rokita filed his lawsuit with the Marion County courts late last week.

He alleges that IPS is limiting ICE's access to school grounds and prohibiting IPS employees from assisting or sharing information with ICE.

Rokita says these policies are not only illegal but are also making schools ""vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens.""

""It's happened in many other states — and it is essential that ICE be able to take action when that occurs to help keep our kids safe,"" Rokita said in a news release.

The other side: IPS says it's doing just that — keeping kids safe.

""Indianapolis Public Schools is committed to ensuring safe, supportive and welcoming learning environments for all students,"" the district said in a statement. ""As has always been the case, we will continue to uphold the law while keeping these commitments.""

According to court documents, the district does not allow ICE officers inside school buildings without a warrant.

""While IPS takes all legal obligations seriously, we respectfully hope that all concerned parties will recognize the heavy burden that silly litigation and political posturing places on students, families and taxpayers,"" the district said. ""Every dollar spent on defensive legal posture is a dollar not spent on instructional support, teacher development, student services or enrichment.""

""In this case, Mr. Rokita prefers those dollars go to fight gratuitous political battles, as has too often been the case.""

Zoom in: The lawsuit stems from a January incident in which ICE was attempting to get an IPS student out of school to board a voluntary deportation flight with his father, a Honduran national who was in the country illegally.

Rokita alleges that IPS instead connected the student with an immigration attorney and that the father and son missed their deportation flight.

Rokita says ICE also needs school cooperation in looking for nearly 400,000 unaccompanied minors ""who are vulnerable to exploitation by human traffickers"" and when ""criminal illegal aliens, like MS-13 gang members, infiltrate school locations.""

Flashback: Previous ICE guidance that directed officers to avoid sensitive locations — including schools, hospitals, churches and marches — was scrapped by the Trump administration on his second day in office.

What's next: Rokita is asking the courts to compel IPS to change its policies to be in compliance with state laws that prohibit local government entities from limiting their employees' engagement in activities related to the enforcement of immigration laws.",https://images.axios.com/HPvp7DAK_09h7gUnvVEcXZw61N0=/1366x768/smart/2023/10/26/170803-1698340083087.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:03:38.687514

According to a statement by ICE, all 13 detainees are undocumented and in violation of immigration policies. Officials said one person in custody had previously been ordered removed by an immigration judge, and another had already been deported once before.

The operation involved local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, including the Kenner Police Department, which said the raid was part of a two-month joint investigation.

“We’ve always had complaints out there — nuisance crimes, everything from traffic to litter to loud music,” said Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley. “We go out there and police it, but it seemed like the activity was escalating into just lawlessness.”

WWL asked Conley why ICE was involved in the joint operation.

“We brought them in because we knew there was going to be a large amount of Hispanics out there,” he said. “We’ve had ICE assist us with some gang activity or gang affiliations that come through the city.”

That statement drew criticism from Union Migrante, an immigrant advocacy group that said the collaboration puts Hispanic residents at risk.

“People are traumatized,” said Union Migrante volunteer Rachel Taber. “Their loved ones who have been here working for years, with no criminal record, are now in ICE detention. They’re literally picking up anyone who looks Hispanic and turning them over to ICE.”

Taber accused Kenner police of racial profiling, which Conley denied.

“I can assure you they’re not,” Conley said. “If they have a complaint, they’re welcome to contact our internal affairs, the Department of Justice or the FBI. We’re an open book.”

When asked whether any of those detained were in the process of obtaining legal status or visas, an ICE spokesperson said, “Not that I’m aware of.”

The investigation remains ongoing.

Why it matters: Republicans aren't just making immigration tougher. They're also sowing fear that Mamdani's popularity will ripple through other American cities with big immigrant populations.

""Import communists, become communists,"" White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted before Tuesday's election. He shared a poll showing Mamdani was winning a majority of foreign-born voters.

""What we don't want to see is more Dearborns,"" said Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, referring to the first Arab-majority city in the U.S. It's represented by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a first-generation Palestinian American.

Republicans also are singling out Minneapolis, where Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a naturalized citizen from Somalia, represents the city in Congress. ""What we don't want to see are more 100% Somalian communities that actually are Islamist and Marxist,"" Roberts told Axios.

The big picture: MAGA's crackdown on legal immigration will ""disproportionately limit people from third world countries, which obviously are not comprised of white people,"" said former Trump Homeland Security official Mike Howell, who now runs the Oversight Project.

Howell said it's time for conservatives to stop fixating on ""legal good and illegal bad"" and start focusing on assimilation.

Zoom in: The U.S. has slashed refugee admissions from 100,000 slots in President Biden's last year to 7,500 (mostly for white South Africans) in 2026.

The citizenship test will be getting more difficult, with stricter enforcement of English language proficiency for immigrants.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is screening for ""good character,"" which now looks for community involvement and contributions to the U.S. and ties to the country, among other factors.

Non-immigrant visas (for temporary travel), particularly from African countries, and H1B visas (for work), primarily awarded to Indians, have become more expensive and harder to get.

Between the lines: The Trump administration is also looking to denaturalize (stripping citizenship) some new Americans, with cases already sent for Justice Department review.

Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) penned a public letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi asking her to investigate Mamdani's citizenship application for possible denaturalization. His charge is echoed by Republican colleague Randy Fine (R-Flo.) and right wing online influencers.

The New York Young Republicans also sold t-shirts that read ""Deport Zohran"" during the campaign.

Zoom out: President Trump has questioned Mamdani's citizenship (he was naturalized in 2018) and repeatedly claimed that Mamdani is a communist. Mamdani is a democratic socialist, not a communist.

Trump used a similar line of attack when he falsely claimed for years that former President Obama wasn't born in the U.S. and was not eligible to be president.

Trump also suggested on numerous occasions that Omar, who became a citizen at 17, should ""go back"" to Somalia.

The bottom line: Mamdani addressed some of Trump's attacks during his victory speech on Tuesday, promising ""a shining city for all.""

""New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants — and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,"" he said.

While attending college, Pecero learned about the advocacy work being done on behalf of foster youth by California Youth Connection.","Part one of a two-part series.

Axel Pecero was lost.

It was a warm and clear August night, just hours before the sun would rise, and he was wandering an unfamiliar part of Los Angeles with little money and a dead phone.

But the worst was yet to come.

By the next day, Pecero would become one of the thousands of undocumented people swept up in the Trump Administration’s immigration dragnet.

Since Aug. 6, Pecero has been in the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The 25-year-old former foster youth and father, who was brought to the United States from Mexico as a small child, is being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino County and faces possible deportation.

Over the past few years, Pecero has worked as an advocate for young people involved in the foster care and juvenile justice systems. Dozens of letters of support for the South L.A. man have been submitted to the court on his behalf.

Pecero hopes the letters and the efforts of his immigration attorney will prevent him from being sent away from the only country he has known as home.

“I’m really hoping that the judge is able to see that I’m working on my education,” Pecero said from Adelanto in a 30-minute phone interview with The Imprint. “I want to be able to stay here with my son and continue living my life.”

He has watched other detainees being shackled and whisked away in the middle of the night by ICE agents, their shirts emblazoned with the word “Deportation.”

In the call, Pecero described the series of missteps and decisions that brought him to a deserted Burbank street on a dark night and placed him in the crosshairs of the nation’s unprecedented crackdown on immigrants.

In the weeks following his detention at Adelanto, a notorious facility known for its poor conditions, Pecero has cycled through feelings of frustration and helplessness, he said. He has watched other detainees being shackled and whisked away in the middle of the night by ICE agents, their shirts emblazoned with the word “Deportation.”

Life was just beginning to click into place for the former foster youth as he settled into his mid-20s. After years of upheaval and instability, he is today a proud father who dons suits to testify for foster youth at the state Capitol. He has earned a reputation as a dedicated advocate. He was in the process of trying to leave his mistakes behind and clear his record.

Now he wonders: Will all of the effort that he’s made in recent years to get off the streets and change his life be undone?

“No matter how much I thought I was American — I wasn’t,” Pecero said. “I really hope I have the opportunity to solidify the foundation for the life that I want to lead.”

His current predicament illustrates how missteps that others might attribute to youth can yield enormous consequences for the undocumented amid the current administration’s aggressive immigration operation.

On Aug 5, the night before he wound up in ICE custody, Pecero went to Hollywood to meet a friend and see a band perform. He had traveled from Burbank, about 16 miles away, where he was attending a work conference on youth with substance and behavioral health issues.

Around 9 p.m. he decided to head back to his Burbank hotel. He had an early morning commitment, he told his friend; he was participating in a training session for organizations serving young people in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.

He rode a bus back to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles where he hoped to take a commuter train to Burbank. But once there, he realized he had miscalculated — he didn’t have enough money for the fare. His only option, he said, was to take several local buses to reach his hotel.

The first bus never arrived. He waited for a different one but it didn’t show up for another hour. It was 3:30 a.m. when he finally arrived at his next stop. Rather than wait for a bus that wasn’t scheduled to come for yet another hour, Pecero decided to walk the rest of the way, he said.

But now he had another problem. His phone battery was running out of power.

“Are you on probation or parole?’’

By the time he made it back to Burbank on foot, Pecero’s phone was dead. Without a navigation app, he had little idea where he was.

He found himself in an industrial part of the city, near the airport, he said. He trudged along San Fernando Boulevard, thinking that everything would turn out all right if he could just make it back to the hotel in time for his morning training session.

He was hopeful. He felt he was getting closer.

Then a bright beam of light sliced through the night and fell on him.

“Are you on probation or parole?” a voice boomed out from the darkness.

Pecero told the men in the police cruiser that he was neither. He told them he was lost. He asked for a ride to his hotel.

The voice demanded his identification, and now, he said, it sounded hostile.

“Am I under arrest?’’ Pecero asked. “Am I being detained?”

The Burbank police officers told him, “No,” so Pecero told them he would keep on walking. He asked for directions to the hotel.

Then it happened. He was pushed against the police car and handcuffed, he said. The officers had run his name and found an outstanding warrant related to an unpaid traffic ticket he received for driving without a license in 2021. The arrest warrant was issued after he didn’t show up for a court date on the matter.

It was a little after 5 a.m. when Pecero arrived at the police station. He was fingerprinted, jailed and promised, he said, that he would be released “soon.’’ Hours later, he walked out of the Burbank jail.

Two Homeland Security officers were waiting for him.

“At that moment, I felt my heart drop,” Pecero said.On the other side

It all felt so surreal.

Days earlier, Pecero had passed several U.S. Marines stationed outside a federal building surrounded by demonstrators protesting the immigration raids and sweeps taking place across the city at schools, Home Depots and worksites.

“No matter how much I thought I was American — I wasn’t.”

— Axel Pecero

Now, he was on the other side of the tempest, awaiting transport to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, a detention facility that lies about a two-hour drive from downtown Los Angeles.

What stung most, Pecero recalled, was the casual banter between the two ICE agents waiting with him. As the seriousness of his predicament pressed more heavily on him with each passing moment, the agents traded wisecracks about the number of people they had picked up that day. They bragged that they were going on another “money run” later that day to detain other immigrants.

“I would hope my life is not like a pawn in somebody’s game or just extra money in somebody’s paycheck,” Pecero told The Imprint.

Meanwhile, back at the Burbank hotel where he’d been staying, Pecero’s colleagues were worried. He hadn’t shown up for his training session. No one knew where he was.

Tasha Norton-James, a trainer with the organization running the event, brought her concerns to hotel staff and asked to enter his room. Inside, they found his possessions, but no sign of Pecero. No one knew what to think until his brother arrived at the hotel later that afternoon with news of the arrest and detention. The brother had come to collect his belongings.

Norton-James is among Pecero’s friends and supporters who find it troubling that Burbank police stopped Pecero in the first place, when he was simply walking on a city street.

And they don’t understand how a man with traffic-related misdemeanors fits the profile of those the federal government has said are the targets of ICE operations — “the murderers, the MS-13 gang members, the pedophiles and rapists,” that Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin referred to in a statement last July.

“They’re supposed to be picking up the ‘worst of the worst’ criminals, but they detained Axel, who’s making this world a better place,” Norton-James said.

A ‘normal’ childhood

Pecero arrived in the U.S. when he was 3, brought to Los Angeles by his grandmother. He lived with an aunt and uncle until his parents arrived from Mexico, he said.

When Pecero was 8, his mother returned to Mexico. He remained in the U.S. with his father, but at 16, moved in with an aunt to escape his father’s abuse, he said.

Pecero never formally entered the county’s child welfare system. Instead, he lived with his aunt under an informal arrangement referred to as “hidden foster care.’’ As an unlicensed caregiver, his aunt wasn’t eligible for county resources and support that other relatives and foster parents receive.

At this point in his life, Pecero says he lived like any other typical teen in the U.S. — attending high school and crazy about basketball. Friends recall that he couldn’t pass by a pickup game without asking to join in.

“Growing up, I always thought I was normal,” he said.

But after graduating in 2018, Pecero went from one unstable housing situation to another. Eventually he wound up living in his car.

Two “cite-and-release” cases during that time continue to have far-reaching repercussions for him. In 2020, a joyriding incident led to four misdemeanor charges, including being in possession of a stolen vehicle, court records show.

In March 2021, Pecero was charged with a misdemeanor for driving without a license. It was a warrant for failing to appear in court for that case that led to his recent arrest.

Both cases are on hold while he is being held in Adelanto, though the latter case has escalated dramatically. Because Pecero was in ICE detention and failed to appear for a court date in late August, his initial $10 bail amount now carries a $100,000 bench warrant.

California State Sen. Caroline Menjivar — who is familiar with Pecero’s case and is advocating for his release — said youthful missteps like this should not lead to imprisonment and possible deportation. In an interview, she said she sees parallels in Pecero’s life experiences to her own. She also had run-ins with the law as a young person.

But she said she believes making mistakes is a normal part of growing up, and noted research showing that the area of the human brain that governs impulse control and decision-making doesn’t mature until well after the teenage years.

“They’re supposed to be picking up the ‘worst of the worst’ criminals, but they detained Axel, who’s making this world a better place.”

— Tasha Norton-James

And traumatic and destabilizing events like family separation and homelessness — both of which Pecero experienced — can disrupt development and narrow choices, Menjivar and his other supporters say.

“I recognize that he missed his court appointment, but he was an unhoused foster youth,” she said. “What do we expect from somebody who we turned our backs on? What do we expect when we do not provide the resources for him?”

Finding family

Learning he was going to become a father is what pushed Pecero to seek stability, he said. He saved $600 to rent a room in a house and move out of his car. He saw a flyer for Los Angeles’ Trade Tech community college and qualified for a scholarship that covered classes and housing there.

While attending college, Pecero learned about the advocacy work being done on behalf of foster youth by California Youth Connection. The nonprofit’s mission and sense of community spoke to him. He decided to join.

“They really just took me in, like the family that I didn’t have,” he said.

Over the past two years, his advocacy has grown to include projects with the Los Angeles County Office of Education — work that has taken him from Sacramento to Washington, D.C. Sometimes he would bring his son, now 4, to community meetings and conferences. He called the boy his inspiration.

“Before my son, I didn’t really have any set goals,” said Pecero. “I’ve really tried my best to change, and to be somebody for my son.” He hopes to become a social worker one day.

Now, roughly 80 miles separate father and son, and Pecero’s future rests in the hands of an immigration judge who will determine whether he will be allowed to stay in the country.

In the meantime, he has found a purpose and a rhythm to his days at Adelanto by helping other detainees. He uses his fluent English and Spanish skills to translate documents for others. He collects commissary money for birthday gifts for detainees — a diverse group that includes people who speak Arabic, Mandarin and Punjabi.

He’s also begun writing as a way to pass time and take his mind off his situation, he said.

The German chancellor also revealed he has invited Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to Berlin to discuss the issue.
And in Germany, Merz’s coalition is trying to fend off the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Syrians live in Germany under varying legal statuses – some have been granted German citizenship, while others hold permanent residence permits.
Meanwhile Syria remains scarred by years of conflict and nationals in Germany are looking on at the debate with mounting worry.","When Germany opened its doors to refugees escaping war in the Middle East, more people arrived from Syria than any other country – finding homes, getting jobs, starting families.

A question mark now hangs over their future, after Germany’s government – which has hardened its stance on immigration amid a surging far right – suggested it could be time for some to return home, voluntarily or not.

Some 1 million Syrians arrived in Germany at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015-2016, under former chancellor Angela Merkel. Approximately 1.3 million live in Germany currently, including 25,000 who were born there.

Now, Chancellor Friedrich Merz and other conservatives in his coalition cabinet are calling for their repatriation.

Merz this week said that Berlin would approach the issue in a “very concrete matter,” as he signaled that there are “no longer any grounds for asylum in Germany, and therefore we can also begin with repatriations.”

While the German government will first and foremost encourage voluntary repatriation, Merz said those who refuse “can, of course, also be deported in the near future,” as he said that the return of Syrians to their homeland would be key to rebuilding the war-torn country.

The German chancellor also revealed he has invited Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to Berlin to discuss the issue.

What’s changed in Syria is that the Assad government is no more, bringing an end to years of civil war. And in Germany, Merz’s coalition is trying to fend off the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

Despite Merz’s rhetoric, it remains unclear at this stage how wide-reaching deportations would be. Germany has so far only announced plans to deport Syrians with criminal records.

Since the collapse of Assad’s regime, around 1,300 Syrians – or 0.1% - have voluntarily returned to their homeland, according to Germany’s interior ministry.

Syrians live in Germany under varying legal statuses – some have been granted German citizenship, while others hold permanent residence permits. Over 160,000 Syrians had obtained German citizenship by the end of 2023, Deutsche Welle reported. Those who fall into these categories will not need to leave Germany, CDU politicians said during a coalition debate on Tuesday, according to Reuters.

Hundreds of thousands more hold temporary residence permits, which they are granted after receiving a protection status, such as asylum, refugee or subsidiary protection, which applies when neither of the former can be granted and serious harm is threatened in the country of origin.

Temporary residence permits allow foreigners to live and work in Germany, as well as receive government benefits, but mean their ability to remain there is uncertain.

The issue of repatriation is contentious and comes with significant legal hurdles. Meanwhile Syria remains scarred by years of conflict and nationals in Germany are looking on at the debate with mounting worry.

“Merz’s comments are heading in a direction that fuels right-wing desires to deport anyone who doesn’t fit their so-called idea of who belongs in Germany and that’s terrifying,” said Rafif Dawoud, a 33-year-old architect living in Berlin, who migrated from Syria over 12 years ago and is now a German citizen.

Dawoud said that while she knows people who have willingly returned, “talking about sending back people who have been trying to integrate, who see Germany as their second or even first and only home, who actively contribute to this society and economy, well that’s an absolute disgrace.”

Others are concerned about a volatile political situation back home. A retired engineer, who currently lives in Germany but does not hold citizenship, described the overthrow of Assad’s government as a “historical necessity” while questioning its replacement.

“We must ask whether the country is moving toward a state that mirrors European and specifically German values, respecting freedoms and human principles, or whether dictatorship and a new totalitarian religious system are simply being reproduced under a different name,” the man, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN.

Since Assad’s ousting, Syria has seen flare-ups of deadly sectarian violence, with clashes erupting between security forces and those loyal to the former president, including in Syria’s coastal Latakia region in March.

Speaking to CNN, Akram al-Bunni, a Syrian political activist who was jailed under Assad’s regime, said the German government must take into consideration the nature of the country’s new authority, which he believes could expose many Syrians to new persecution. The security situation must also be considered, al-Bunni said, stating that weapons remain “uncontrolled in the hands of extremist factions.”

Johann Wadephul, Germany’s foreign minister and a politician in Merz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), hinted at some of the problems awaiting Syrians on a recent visit to Damascus, when he compared the country’s devastation to “images we saw from Germany in 1945 after World War II” and expressed doubt that large numbers of Syrian migrants would return voluntarily.

But after receiving backlash from within his own party over the comments, Wadephul has sought to stress that his overall view remains in alignment with his party.

Other politicians, particularly on Germany’s left, have criticized the plans. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Lamya Kaddor, of Germany’s Green Party, said “to believe that mass deportations (to Syria) are now possible underestimates the reality on the ground.”

The Association of German-Syrian Aid Organizations has spoken out against the government’s plans, with its chairman Nahla Osman saying the debate represents a huge blow for Syrians who have integrated into German society, including skilled workers, in a recent interview with Deutschlandfunk radio.

Germany’s health sector, for example, employs over 6,000 Syrian doctors, according to official figures – making them an integral part of the country’s healthcare system. Late last year, then-Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned “whole areas” in Germany’s healthcare sector would fall away if the Syrians who worked there currently were to leave.

Countering the far right

Despite the opposition, it is clear that the days of “Wilkommenskulture” or “welcoming culture” regarding immigration to Germany under Merkel are gone.

The AfD came second in Germany’s federal election in February, securing an unprecedented number of votes after campaigning on an anti-migration platform and a manifesto that states that “Islam does not belong in Germany.”

Since the collapse of the Assad regime, the AfD has been calling for Syrians in Germany to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, the party has continued to enjoy strong popularity, even temporarily surging ahead of the CDU in some polls, leaving Merz’s government fighting to retain ground.

Merz – who had long been a critic of Merkel’s open-door policies – has taken a tougher stance on migration, in part to counter the AfD.

While his predecessor welcomed migrants into Germany under the slogan “Wir schaffen das” – “We’ll manage it,” Merz and his government announced sweeping revisions to migration policy after taking office.

“We clearly did not manage it. That is exactly why we’re trying to fix it,” he said of the situation.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-507772826.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-09 20:57:49.874528

The Trump administration continues its aggressive campaign to detain and deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Multiple cities are at the center of these efforts, including Chicago and Los Angeles. Now the Department of Homeland Security says the crackdown, which started shortly after President Trump took office, has resulted in the removal of more than half a million undocumented immigrants so far. To fact-check these numbers and put them in context, we're joined now by NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán. Welcome, Sergio.

SERGIO MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN, BYLINE: Hi, Ayesha.

RASCOE: So where does that figure - 500,000 people deported - come from, and is it accurate?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Well, the pace of deportations has clearly increased by a lot under Trump, but it's not clear that this half-million figure is accurate. This number comes from a DHS-issued press release, but it did not provide any evidence or additional information. Now, NPR repeatedly requested data from DHS to support that claim, and they have not yet responded.

RASCOE: Is it unusual for administrations to have this kind of lack of transparency on immigration figures?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: So administrations typically provide some evidence to back their deportation numbers, even if it's just annually. Look, ICE collects a lot of data on every person it arrests, detains, transports and deports. But this administration is not releasing all of that information. They have released some detention numbers that show people at a given time in immigration facilities, but they have not released a breakdown of deportation numbers.

I talked to Dara Lind with the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy group. She has compared these latest DHS deportation numbers to data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by the Deportation Data Project at UC Berkeley and UCLA. That data she looked at is through June, and Lind says there is a significant gap.

DARA LIND: They definitely are engaging in more removals in the data that we have toward the end of that period than at the beginning. We're still looking at fewer than 7,500 removals a week. That's a lot of people. It's a lot of people, but it's nowhere near the number that you would need to have gotten to 500,000.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Even if they have kept up that high rate of 7,500 deportations a week, that would have totaled 300,000 in the first 10 months of this administration. And as Lind says, that's way short of its aggressive goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants every year. The administration also says that more than 1.6 million undocumented immigrants have left the country on their own this year. But again, they have not provided any data to back that up.

RASCOE: The Trump administration regularly claims that the vast majority of those detained - 70% - are criminals charged with or convicted of a crime in the U.S. Here's DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin recently on Fox News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRICIA MCLAUGHLIN: We have 10,000 new ICE enforcement officers that are going to be hired in the coming days, so we know that we're going to continue to arrest the worst of the worst off of the streets of America's sanctuary cities and across the nation.

RASCOE: So, Sergio, worst of the worst, 70% criminals - is this accurate?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: No. Not really, Ayesha. According to DHS' own detention data, 53% of immigration detainees had either pending charges or a conviction. The rest had no criminal record. And it's important to note that the 53% includes violations like property theft and traffic violations. One report in June from the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute found that only about 7% of the people booked by ICE had serious or violent convictions. The other 93% either did not have a violent conviction or any convictions at all. Here's Dara Lind again with the American Immigration Council.

LIND: They don't see a particularly strong difference between people who have committed very serious crimes and people who have no contact with the criminal justice system whatsoever but who are in the U.S. without documentation.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: For context, two things to keep in mind here - first, entering the country illegally, coming in without documentation, is often a misdemeanor. And once in the U.S., if a migrant gets picked up without papers, that is often a civil offense.

RASCOE: That's NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán. Thank you so much for joining us.
