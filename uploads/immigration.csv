by Erica Bryant, Associate Director of Writing, Vera Institute of Justice

On July 8, the Trump administration announced a new policy that prevents judges from granting bond to anyone held in detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) who had entered the United States without documentation. This policy—in tandem with the Laken Riley Act’s expansion of mandatory detention and the One Big Beautiful Bill’s supercharged spending on immigration enforcement and new immigration prisons—threatens to send thousands more people into notoriously appalling conditions as they await their day in court.

What Trump’s policy does

Under existing law, immigration judges have the discretion to determine whether a person held in detention is neither a flight risk nor a danger to their community and is qualified for a bond hearing. At the hearing, the person could then argue that they should be released on bond as their case continues. However, judges are denied this discretion if the person falls under several categories, including how they entered the United States and whether they have been convicted of certain crimes. In these cases, the person is put under “mandatory detention” and forced to fight their case while incarcerated.

The Laken Riley Act, enacted in January, vastly expanded the criteria for mandatory detention to include people arrested for and accused of many nonviolent theft-related offenses and, for the first time, those arrested for and accused of criminal conduct but who have yet to be given a fair trial to determine their innocence. In July, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would further expand mandatory detention to anyone who entered the country without inspection.

This means that millions of people who might have been granted a bond hearing are now being denied one and kept in ICE detention. Meanwhile, as releases from immigration prisons have slowed to a trickle, daily detention numbers have reached record highs. By stripping even more people of the possibility of supervised release, Trump’s new actions will make things exponentially worse.

Immigration detention is unnecessary

Locking people away in immigration prison when they are suspected of being in the country without legal status is unjust and unnecessary. Decades of research shows that people do not need to be held behind bars to ensure that they appear for their immigration court proceedings.

We have also long seen how holding people in jail before trial in the criminal court system has made communities less safe. In criminal cases, pretrial release is typically conditioned on whether someone can pay a bail amount set by a judge at arraignment. This system ties a person’s freedom to their ability to pay for it. If a person is jailed before trial, it increases the likelihood they will lose work, fall behind on their bills, and lose custody of their children, compounding poverty and, with it, the drivers of crime.

Even for people with resources, the chaotic and dysfunctional immigration system already makes it difficult to get a hearing and be granted an affordable bond. Bond was only granted in 31 percent of cases heard during the first nine months of 2023, and the median bond amount that year was $7,000—an impossible sum for many.

And notably, many immigrants who will now face imprisonment without a chance to seek bond likely do have a path to legal residency in the United States. Under both U.S. and international law, for example, people who face danger in their home country have the right to go to other nations to seek safety and have their requests for asylum considered. Other people—such as survivors of trafficking, violent crime, and child abuse—may have the option to pursue residency through additional legal avenues.

The immigration system is already unfair and inhumane

The current immigration court backlog already exceeds 3.5 million cases; proceedings can take months, years, or even a decade to resolve. And now, the Trump administration is pouring even more money into locking more people up while simultaneously reducing the capacity of immigration courts and the legal service providers who defend immigrants’ due process rights. More than 50 judges have been fired, and dozens of others have taken advantage of incentives to resign voluntarily. Funding for legal service providers has also been gutted, even though people in detention already lack legal representation in nearly 50 percent of cases.

In 2023, more than 90 percent of the then-30,000 people in ICE’s deadly facilities on any given day were held in immigration prisons run by private corporations. These companies, which include GEO Group, CoreCivic, and LaSalle Corrections, have long lists of documented human rights abuses like forced labor, inhumane living conditions, sexual abuse, forced sterilizations, and medical neglect. And they’re now ramping up capacity as the number of people in detention balloons. State-operated facilities seem to offer no better treatment; people detained in the new, hastily constructed Florida Everglades facility (so-called Alligator Alcatraz) are being caged in chain-link enclosures and have reported health hazards, including floods of waste water, insects, and inedible food.

Trump’s aggressive enforcement since January has put more people in detention and will lengthen the time they’re forced to spend waiting for the resolution of their cases. Faced with the cruelty of immigration prison, many who have lawful claims to stay safely in the United States will have all the more incentive to instead accept deportation.

No one is made safer by keeping people in immigration prison

It is inhumane to make people fleeing danger await the outcome of their court proceedings while locked away in deadly immigration facilities. People who come to the United States deserve dignity, safety, and fairness of due process. They should be free to attend immigration court with the support of legal representation to help them understand their rights and prevent wrongful deportations.

This is a human rights crisis. Funneling thousands more people into an immigration detention system that is riddled with abuse and cruelty will cause immeasurable harm. The impact extends beyond the lives of immigrants themselves—it is separating families, destabilizing communities, and jeopardizing our economy. While Trump states that his mass detention and deportation agenda promotes public safety, the opposite is true. Sending masked agents into workplaces, courthouses, places of worship, schools, and homes to terrorize everyday people who pose no real threat to public safety is causing rippling harm and distrust. Instead of spending billions of dollars to expand pretrial detention, we should be devoting resources to programs that promote family unity, build strong communities and economies, and actually keep people safe.

The funding, drawn from the State Department’s economic support fund—typically reserved for development programs in allied nations—will be transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. DHS will coordinate with Costa Rican authorities to conduct deportations, though a timeline has not been disclosed.

“The Department intends to support the Government of Costa Rica in conducting deportation operations of migrants that do not have international protections or other legal grounds to remain,” the document reads.

The initiative appears to be modeled “in part” on a 2024 agreement between the Biden administration and Panama, in which the U.S. financed efforts by Panama to detain and deport migrants transiting north from Colombia. That agreement sparked criticism from Democratic lawmakers and migrant advocacy groups, who warned it could deny asylum access to vulnerable populations.

In this case, the State Department says the funding will primarily assist Costa Rica in removing migrants who are passing through the country en route to the U.S., rather than individuals deported directly from American soil.

“The program will build capacity of the Costa Rican immigration authorities to stop the flow of illegal migration through its borders, while also providing training and resources on asylum screening,” a State Department spokesperson said.

It remains unclear which countries Costa Rica would send deportees to under the new plan, raising the possibility that some could be relocated to third countries. Human rights groups have previously raised concerns about similar arrangements, especially when deportees have no clear legal or familial ties to the countries receiving them.

The Trump administration has increasingly leaned on foreign partnerships to facilitate deportations, including with governments in Panama, El Salvador, and Chile. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has traveled to several of these countries in recent months to negotiate immigration cooperation.

Gov. Mike Braun recently announced the Indiana State Police, Indiana Department of Correction and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security will join the Indiana National Guard in assisting the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement roundup of immigrants into the United States.

Braun said the state will make 1,000 beds available in the Miami Correctional Facility to imprison people who have been convicted of nothing and have been given no due process rights. The Marion County sheriff has said he will go along with the order, in part because the federal government pays him per detainee, while the state does not.

This is an affront to anyone who values liberty, limited government and human dignity. It wastes police resources — and Hoosiers’ tax money — in diverting them from searching for and prosecuting crimes against person and property by actual criminals to instead round up peaceful people who are seeking a better life. Immigrants work in our farms, factories and communities, shop at our stores, and contribute positively to our state’s economy and culture.

It’s also a gross violation of the words Braun said on Jan. 13, when he placed his hand on a Bible and swore an oath to God and the people of Indiana that he would uphold and defend both the Indiana and United States Constitutions.

Participating in President Trump’s scheme to systematically dismantle due process and the rule of law is a clear violation of that solemn oath.

While Braun and Trump claim this is a roundup of “violent illegal immigrants,” the witch hunt has gone far beyond that. Of those being arrested, 71% have no criminal convictions at all — and among those who do, most are for minor offenses — and only 8% have been convicted of violent crimes. The number of those without any conviction being arrested and detained keeps rising.

However, Trump has been eager to not just deport the “violent” criminals, but to round up anyone who is Latino, Asian or Middle Eastern, treating everyone as a potential illegal immigrant, to meet the quota of 3,000 arrests per day vocalized by White House adviser Stephen Miller, while the administration gleefully touts deplorable conditions in detention centers and violates due process rights.

To desperately reach that goal, it means rounding up people who aren’t criminals, but who have fled oppressive communist and socialist regimes and lawfully sought asylum, revoking visas and green cards for students without explanation, and sweeping up U.S. citizens and throwing them in jail.

People showing up for their visa appointments — doing the right thing in good faith — are being arrested in court and taken to faraway detention facilities where they know nobody and have little chance of contacting representation. One was a 20-year-old Purdue student from South Korea who was on an active student visa, but arrested, detained and shipped to Louisiana at her hearing.

This is the work of a banana republic, not a republic bound by a Constitution that has a very clear mandate to protect due process rights and a tradition of “innocent until proven guilty.”

Participating in such a system — and actively and enthusiastically doing so — is denying people their dignity, as well as their human rights.

As Libertarians, we believe in the sovereignty of the individual and the freedom to live, work and move in peace.

A state government deputizing local and state officers to participate in a federal scheme of rounding up people for the sole crime of looking different or speaking with an accent, on the hopes of “finding illegals,” violates that principle. It undermines state sovereignty and also sows distrust between our immigrant communities and local authorities.

The U.S. immigration system is irreparably broken. It is a Byzantine system with a number of hoops and steps someone must jump through to legally immigrate to the U.S., which incentivizes “illegal immigration,” and the Trump administration has doubled down on it by not only making legal immigration more difficult, but revoking visas and arresting and deporting people going through the process the right way for small paperwork errors.

Truly making America great would be living up to the words on the Statue of Liberty — “give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free” — not weaponizing local police to kidnap, detain and deport people trying to properly follow the system, while revoking visas and making the immigration system more difficult.

The Libertarian Party of Indiana calls for Gov. Braun to revoke this promise, to not allow Indiana prisons to be used to detain people who are not criminals, and to honor our tradition of federalism by refusing to comply with the federal authorities carrying out these heinous acts, while we call on the federal government to offer a bridge, not an alligator-infested moat, to those seeking a better life in the great melting pot of the United States.

While around 10 protesters stood outside the ICE field office, two vans left the building at 3:18 p.m., protected by a dozen uniformed ICE officers.

Confrontations between protesters and ICE vans at 630 Sansome St. have resulted in violent clashes in the past, with officers driving a van through protesters on July 8. But today, the ICE agents retreated into the garage that they had just exited, disappearing under the closing door, seeming to mock protesters by waving goodbye and shaking what appeared to be pepper-spray cans, in a video obtained by Mission Local.

As some protesters dispersed, others continued yelling outside the garage door. Mission Local has not been able to obtain video of the next two minutes, but protesters who were present, and have asked to remain anonymous, report that ICE agents fired pepperballs under the garage door at approximately 3:21 p.m.

Shortly thereafter, video shows ICE agents sprinting out of the field office. One protester is swiftly tackled by an ICE officer, who then cuffs him with the help of another.

Another officer, wearing a vest belonging to the Enforcement and Removal Operations division of ICE, then pulls a female protester onto the ground, before cuffing her.

The ICE officers then brought the two protesters through the side door of 630 Sansome St., while other officers pointed Tasers at protesters who attempted to approach them.

According to one protester, Lea, the female protester was a San Francisco resident and a community organizer for homelessness support networks in the city. “It’s horrible,” Lea said. “She has a huge heart.”

They didn’t know the identity of the man who was detained, but worried about what would happen to both of them, once they were brought into federal custody.

“When it’s SFPD, we can expect 850 Bryant,” said Cebo, a protester who is now working to organize a rally in support of the two detained individuals. “But because it’s federal, we don’t know where they’ll go.”

Immigration issues are complex. Discussing them is challenging, since key terms are often conflated and confused.

Clarifying these terms and their legal implications can help ensure people are talking about the same things – regardless of whether they agree about who should be in the country.

Some key immigration-related terms

Let’s start with terms describing different aspects of immigration.

Immigrant is a common term meaning a foreign national who intends to remain in the U.S. or another country where they weren’t born.

Migrant is a generic term that doesn’t have any specific legal meaning and is often used incorrectly as a synonym for immigrant.

Immigrants are considered documented if they’ve been issued an immigrant visa or a green card, thereby achieving lawful permanent resident status. Green cards and visas can be revoked – typically a consequence of certain criminal convictions. Visas allow foreign nationals to travel to a U.S. port of entry and request permission to enter but do not guarantee entry.

A lawful permanent resident generally can apply for U.S. citizenship after five years. This process is known as naturalization. In fiscal year 2024, 818,500 people were naturalized.

Once naturalized, revocation of U.S. citizenship – or denaturalization – is rare, traditionally resulting from fraud, omission during the application process or other extraordinary causes. Between 1990 and 2017, about 11 people annually had their naturalized citizenship revoked.

The Trump administration is reportedly expanding the scope of denaturalization and is being called out for allegedly weaponizing it against current political adversaries such as Elon Musk. However, denaturalization numbers remain low. The first Trump administration filed 102 denaturalization cases, and his current administration has filed five so far, according to NBC News.

In May 2025 – a typical month representing some of the most recent data available – about 47,000 immigrants entered the U.S. with one of the many kinds of immigrant visas. For example, the visas may be used for family-based immigration, including legitimate marriages to U.S. citizens and international adoptions. Immigrant visas are also available for employment-based immigration, including foreign nationals who invest substantial capital in the U.S. economy.

An array of nonimmigrant visas

Apart from immigrant visas, a variety of nonimmigrant or temporary visas are available.

For instance, there are visas for international students, although the Trump administration has expressed its intention to significantly restrict availability.

There are visas to facilitate travel and tourism, business, temporary workers, and for those with extraordinary abilities or achievements.

There are special visas for victims of human trafficking and other crimes who assist law enforcement.

There are even visas to facilitate international sports competitions.

In fiscal year 2024, the U.S. issued a record 8.5 million visitor visas. Stays are generally limited to six months.

In addition, visitors from more than 40 countries are allowed to travel to the U.S for tourism or business for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa.

Significantly, a foreign national entering the U.S. with a visitor visa, also known as a tourist visa, isn’t authorized to work.

What it means to be ‘undocumented’

The term undocumented essentially refers to people who didn’t obtain a green card or a visa – or stayed in the U.S. after their documents expired. An estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the U.S.

People in Los Angeles rally in support of undocumented immigrants. Noah Berger/AP PhotoVisa “overstays” represent approximately 40% of the undocumented population. As a matter of law, such overstays are civil rather than criminal violations.

Attracting more political attention are foreign nationals who cross U.S. borders outside of an authorized checkpoint without asserting a credible claims for asylum. The Border Patrol recorded an historic high of 249,741 encounters with such migrants in December 2023. That figure dropped 77% by August 2024, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.

The Trump administration’s deployment of the U.S. military at the border has reportedly further reduced the number of encounters to the lowest level in decades, but questions regarding the legality of the deployment remain unanswered.

The Trump administration is also encouraging voluntary departure by offering travel assistance and $1,000 to “illegal aliens” who self-deport.

Being undocumented can be legal

Being undocumented doesn’t necessarily mean a foreign national is in the U.S. illegally.

Some foreign nationals are admitted into the country without documentation. Asylum-seekers, also known as asylees, are people fleeing persecution in their home countries. They generally must present themselves to federal immigration authorities at a port of entry, or after entering the country by other lawful means, and eventually substantiate their claims.

The Trump administration’s action to ban asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border was recently limited by a federal appellate court. The court’s decision effectively curtails the administration’s practice of deporting people to places where they could be tortured or persecuted, subject to any further consideration by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Migrants escaping desperate economic circumstances are not eligible for asylum.

Refugees, like asylum-seekers, are fleeing a well-founded fear of persecution in their home countries and are protected under the 1951 Refugee Convention as amended by its 1967 Protocol. This identifies five forms of persecution for relief – race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. In 1980, Congress passed and President Jimmy Carter signed the Refugee Act, which incorporated these international standards into U.S. law.

Unlike asylum-seekers, refugees apply for relief and substantiate their claims through the United Nations. They generally don’t get to choose whether or where they may be resettled.

Refugees and people granted asylum may seek lawful permanent resident status and eventually apply for U.S. citizenship.

In 2024, the U.S. accepted about 100,000 of an estimated 43 million refugees worldwide. Refugees are among the 122 million estimated to be forcibly displaced worldwide.

With limited exceptions, the Trump administration has suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and narrowed relief for women seeking protection from domestic and sexual violence in their home countries.

Humanitarian parole and TPS

Foreign nationals admitted into the U.S. as humanitarian parolees are undocumented initially, but their presence is authorized.

The federal government has historically used humanitarian parole to facilitate the admission of people from countries confronting significant violence or other compelling humanitarian crises when other processes are unavailable, overwhelmed or simply too slow.

For example, the U.S. launched a new humanitarian parole initiative in late 2022 to admit foreign nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Humanitarian parole also was used to admit foreign nationals following U.S. intervention in Vietnam and in Iraq after 9/11; after American troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021; and following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Those granted temporary protected status, or TPS, by the federal executive branch are also believed to face extraordinary dangers if they return to their home countries. However, TPS can be granted only to foreign nationals who are already present in the U.S.

Generally, the federal executive branch has discretion to rescind both humanitarian parole and TPS, subject to certain rule-making requirements, if it concludes recipients can return safely to their home countries.

The Trump administration signaled its intent to terminate humanitarian parole and TPS broadly.

DACA recipients, or Dreamers, who arrived in the country without authorization as children, represent another protected category of undocumented foreign nationals legally living in the U.S. However, their status is uncertain due to ongoing litigation.

When it comes to FEMA, President Trump has said that disaster relief work should fall to the states and that he plans to eliminate the agency altogether.
President Jimmy Carter created FEMA in 1979, and in 2003, it was moved to DHS.
“We want to wean off of FEMA, and we want to bring it down to the state level,” Trump said in June.","On August 5, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as FEMA, told approximately 100 staffers that they had been reassigned to Immigration and Customs Enforcement — and that if they refused to comply with their reassignment, they could be fired.

The American Prospect published a copy of the email.

“If you choose to decline this reassignment, or accept but fail to report for duty, you may be subject to removal from Federal service as provided in 5 U.S.C. § 7513,” the email reads.

A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson told The American Prospect that “select FEMA employees will temporarily be detailed to ICE for 90 days to assist with hiring and vetting” of new ICE agents. The department has said it plans to hire 10,000 new agents, and is offering new recruits a signing bonus of up to $50,000 and student loan forgiveness of up to $60,000. Although the agency claims it’s been inundated with applications, soon after launching the recruitment campaign, DHS removed age restrictions on all positions. During an appearance on Fox & Friends, Noem encouraged 18-year-olds to apply.

“We want to wean off of FEMA, and we want to bring it down to the state level,” Trump said in June. “A governor should be able to handle it, and frankly, if they can’t handle it, the aftermath, then maybe they shouldn’t be governor.”

In April, the Trump administration eliminated FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, and sought to reallocate $4 billion in unspent funds that Congress had authorized for the program. On August 5, a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration’s plans. The program, the judge wrote in his ruling, “is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives.” An investigation by CBS News revealed that two-thirds of the counties that lost BRIC funding went to President Trump in the 2024 election.

FEMA’s response to the deadly flash floods that tore through Central Texas on July 4 was catastrophic, in part because Noem had instituted a policy that requires her to personally sign off on expenditures over $100,000.

The New York Times reported that DHS let contracts to the companies that staff its disaster relief hotline lapse on July 5, which led to hundreds of contractors being fired. The funding for the call centers was finally restored on July 10, but by then thousands of flood victims had been unable to access assistance from the hotline. An NPR investigation revealed that on July 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 FEMA answered just over 15,000 of the approximately 55,000 calls it received.

“Put yourself in the shoes of a survivor: You’ve lost everything, you’re trying to find out what’s insured and what’s not, and you’re navigating multiple aid programs,” Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told the Times. “One of the most important services in disaster recovery is being able to call someone and walk through these processes and paperwork.”

During this time, on July 6, Noem posted images of herself on Instagram, The Daily Beast reported. She asked her followers: “Which one do you like for the official Governor’s portrait to hang in the South Dakota State Capitol?”

Noem also delayed search and rescue efforts. Multiple sources told CNN that Noem did not approve the deployment of Urban Search and Rescue teams until July 7, and delayed approving the use of aerial imagery.

Ester Soliman came to the U.S. legally 25 years ago, according to a fundraising page posted online by her family. The page states Soliman, who started her green card application process last year through the sponsorship of her youngest daughter, was detained by ICE at a hearing on Monday.

Posted Thursday night, the fundraiser garnered almost 300 donations and $20,600 in the first 20 hours. The goal is to pay for the family’s legal fees, according to the online post.

“The community's response to this, I hope, helps the Soliman family to know and understand that we are as a community behind them, that we do understand them as our neighbors and our friends,” said state Rep. Izzy Smith-Wade-El, a Democrat whose 49th District includes half of Lancaster city.

Soliman received a notification to appear at an Alternatives to Detention hearing on Aug. 4, where she was detained by ICE. The family did not respond to requests for comment.

ICE uses the Alternatives to Detention program to monitor immigration cases “where detention is not necessary or appropriate,” according to their website.

Soliman is currently being held at the Clinton County Correctional Facility, an over two-and-a-half-hour drive from Lancaster. Administrators at the facility confirmed her detention, though she did not appear in the online ICE detainee lookup tool as of Friday afternoon.

ICE did not respond to questions about why Soliman was detained or why she was not in the public lookup system by the time of publication.

Lancaster Mayor Danene Sorace said she was shocked to hear how Soliman was arrested. Both she and Smith-Wade-El said they know Ester Soliman’s son, Sam Soliman, through city events where he attends as a photographer.

“The City of Lancaster is a tight-knit community and we care about our neighbors,” Sorace said. “Esther is a neighbor and she has been for a very long time. She's raised her three children here. They're part of our community.”

Both Smith-Wade-El and Sorace said they advised the family to contact their elected federal officials, as ICE is a federal agency. Smith-Wade-El said he reached out to the offices of U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker, a Republican. Fetterman’s office did not respond to questions by the time of publication.

A spokesperson for Smucker, Eric Reath, said the congressman’s office “is not able to publicly comment on actions we take to assist constituents” without their written approval, according to federal law.

Rios and volunteers set up tents and provided food, water and medical care to migrants, and they did it through the slats of the border wall.

Rios describes the undertaking of feeding countless migrants for such an extended time, and he shares some of the stories of people he met along the way.

A judge in California ordered the release of a Syrian national it has been seeking to deport while a federal Rhode Island judge blocked the imposition of new conditions on domestic violence programs as part of the president's campaign against ""gender ideology.""

Details of both cases were shared on X by Kyle Cheney, senior legal affairs reporter for Politico.

Newsweek contacted the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice for comment on Saturday outside of regular office hours via email and press inquiry form respectively.

Why It Matters

With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress as well as the White House the courts have emerged as one of the main impediments to Trump administration policy.

The administration has suffered a number of prominent legal defeats including courts striking down punitive measures introduced by Trump against law firms involved in proceedings against him, blocking a bid to strip thousands of Haitian migrants of legal protection and removing sanctions aimed at International Criminal Court employees.

Release of Salam Maklad

U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer Thurston, of the Eastern District of California, on Friday instructed the release of Salam Maklad, a Syrian from the Druze religious minority who arrived in the United States in 2002 without valid entry documents and claimed asylum, according to court documents seen by Newsweek.

Maklad went on to marry a man who was granted asylum, which her legal team argued made her eligible for legal immigration status.

On July 9, Maklad was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers after arriving for what she believed was a routine ""check-in"" meeting and subsequently placed in ""expedited removal proceedings"" seeking to deport her from the U.S.

Thurston noted that Maklad had no criminal history and wasn't considered a flight risk, and concluded that ""the balance of the equities and public interest weigh in favor of Ms. Maklad."" Consequently she ordered her release from custody and said authorities are blocked from rearresting her ""absent compliance with constitutional protections, which

include at a minimum, pre-deprivation notice—describing the change of circumstances

necessitating her arrest—and detention, and a timely bond hearing.""

Domestic Violence Funding

Friday also saw Senior District Judge William Smith of Rhode Island rule the Trump administration couldn't impose fresh conditions on funds granted by the Violence Against Women Act due to the president's Executive Order 14168 titled ""Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.""

This funding is distributed by the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women.

Trump's order stated that sex is a person's ""immutable biological classification as male or female,"" and that the federal government should ""prioritize investigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms"" associated with this position.

The Office on Violence Against Women updated its policy on what constitutes ""out of scope activities,"" and therefore should not be funded by its grants, after this order was issued in ""approximately May 2025,"" according to the court filing.

This added spending on ""inculcating or promoting gender ideology as defined

in Executive Order 14168"" to the prohibited list.

The case was brought by a coalition of 17 nonprofit groups which argued adhering to President Trump's position on gender was impeding their ability to assist victims of domestic violence.

Judge Smith backed the coalition's position concluding that the fresh requirements imposed by the Trump administration ""could result in the disruption"" of services for victims of domestic and sexual violence.

What People Are Saying

In the California case Judge Thurston ruled: ""Respondents are PERMANENTLY ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from re[1]arresting or re-detaining Ms. Maklad absent compliance with constitutional protections, which include at a minimum, pre-deprivation notice—describing the change of circumstances necessitating her arrest—and detention, and a timely bond hearing.

""At any such hearing, the Government SHALL bear the burden of establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that Ms. Maklad poses a danger to the community or a risk of flight, and Ms. Maklad SHALL be allowed to have her counsel present.""

In his ruling Judge Smith wrote: ""On the one hand, if the Court does not grant preliminary relief, then the Coalitions will face real and immediate irreparable harm from the challenged conditions, conditions which the Court has already concluded likely violate the APA.

""This could result in the disruption of important and, in some cases, life[1]saving services to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. On the other hand, if the Court grants preliminary relief, then the Office will simply have to consider grant applications and award funding as it normally does.""

After all, the Executive Order does not target only children born in Maryland; it seeks to deny citizenship to ‘persons born in the United States,’” she wrote.
The order was swiftly challenges and three judges, including Boardman, issued nationwide injunctions to halt the order.
Boardman’s approval of a class-action suit, and a national preliminary injunction, comes almost a month after a U.S. District judge in New Hampshire did the same thing.","A federal judge in Maryland ordered a nationwide halt — again — to a Trump administration order that would have denied citizenship to any baby born in the U.S. after February unless at least one of the parents is a citizen.

The ruling late Thursday by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman is the fourth to block President Donald Trump’s executive order since June, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges around the country had exceeded their authority by issuing nationwide stays.

But the justices said lower courts could issue nationwide injunctions if the lawsuits were class-action suits on behalf of all newborns in the U.S. who might be affected by the executive order. Which is what Boardman did Thursday

Boardman rejected a request to include parents in the class-action suit. But she identified a nationwide class of children born on U.S. soil who “unquestionably would be citizens but for the Executive Order,” an order the judge said is “almost certainly unconstitutional.”

She wrote that the plaintiffs — eight undocumented mothers who are pregnant or have children who were born in the U.S. — “are likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim because the Executive Order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth amendment,” which says that “all persons” born the U.S. are citizens of the country and of the state in which they were born.

While the immigrants would be harmed in the absence of an injunction, Boardman wrote, there would be little harm to the government to temporarily extending the practice of birthright citizenship that has been recognized in the U.S. for well over a century.

Boardman rejected the government’s argument that she should restrict her injunction just to Maryland.

“That relief must include every child in the United States who is subject to the Executive Order. After all, the Executive Order does not target only children born in Maryland; it seeks to deny citizenship to ‘persons born in the United States,’” she wrote.

A government attorney declined to comment Friday on the order, and emails seeking comment from the White House were not immediately returned. But immigrant advocates welcomed Boardman’s order.

“This is a national issue that affects every single one of us in this country,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA, which filed suit with the immigrant women.

The Maryland suit was one of several around the country that were filed soon after Trump’s order on “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which he issued on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that birthright citizenship was never meant to be a universal right, and it said that anyone born after Feb.19 — a month after the order was signed — would be denied citizenship unless one parent was a citizen or permanent legal resident.

The order was swiftly challenges and three judges, including Boardman, issued nationwide injunctions to halt the order. When those were upheld on appeal, the government took the case to the Supreme Court, which said a national injunction could only be issued in class-action suit with a legitimate nationwide class of plaintiffs.

Within hours of that ruling, attorneys for CASA were back in court, filing paperwork to turn their case into a class-action suit, adding women from North and South Carolina, among other states as plaintiffs.

Boardman’s approval of a class-action suit, and a national preliminary injunction, comes almost a month after a U.S. District judge in New Hampshire did the same thing.

Frimpong called Trump’s order “just a part of the usual fear tactics to make people afraid of what they believe the federal government will do — even though it will never happen because it is blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional.”

She said she anticipates that the Trump administration will again appeal the decision, but predicts that the case will go through the ordinary course of litigation.

“What we are looking forward to is, once and for all. putting the issue to bed and our courts making absolutely clear that the 14th Amendment is not up for debate, and it’s not up for subjective interpretation,” Frimpong said. “It is the law and it is going to remain the law.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/birthrightminister-1536x1153-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 11:57:39.665459

President Trump wants 10,000 new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents to be hired.
“We don’t know how many U.S. citizens are being detained beyond the media accounts,” he said.","American citizens have been increasingly caught up in the immigration crackdown: a 4-year-old boy with cancer deported to Honduras, a doctoral student filming a raid in Hollywood detained for 25 hours, an Illinois man held for 10 hours in detention.

Increasingly frustrated that the aggressive tactics are sweeping up American citizens, Democratic members of Congress have been pressing for a full accounting of the citizens detained.

On Friday morning 49 Congress members, led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), and Reps. Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana) and Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), sent letters to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph V. Cuffari and two other immigration oversight offices asking them to open an investigation into encounters with American citizens and “determine whether DHS is violating Americans’ civil rights.”

“ICE policy makes clear that, by law ‘ICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest and/or detain a U.S. citizen,” the legislators wrote. “However, in recent high-profile cases, ICE has erroneously arrested U.S. citizens, at times appearing to use violent physical force.”

“ICE has even deported U.S. citizens: in multiple cases, ICE has deported U.S. citizen children along with their undocumented parents, reportedly against the families’ wishes. Particularly in Latino and Native American communities, Americans increasingly fear that their citizenship will not protect them from being swept up in DHS’s immigration enforcement activities.”

For months Democratic members of Congress have been demanding the Trump administration answer pointed questions, to little avail.

The letters were sent to Cuffari, Troup Hemenway, acting officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and Joseph Guy, director for the Office of Immigration Detention Ombudsman. The latter two of those offices have been hollowed out under the Trump administration, which had attempted to abolish them completely.

“The administration owes the American people answers, particularly as Republicans in Congress just approved record funding for immigration enforcement, which threatens to put even more citizens at risk,” said Warren.

The Trump administration has adamantly defended its actions.

“DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted and are not resulting in the arrest of U.S. citizens,” said department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in response to The Times’ inquiry about the number of Americans detained, arrested and deported under the administration.

“We do our due diligence. We know who we are targeting ahead of time,” she said. “If and when we do encounter individuals subject to arrest, our law enforcement are trained to ask a series of well-determined questions to determine status and removability. “

In the case of Romero, the 4-year old with Stage-4 cancer, DHS said at the time that his mother had a final deportation order and said she chose to be deported with her children. Her lawyers contend the mother, who was arrested during a check-in with immigration officials in Louisiana, was never given a choice and was prohibited from talking to lawyers. They filed a lawsuit last month, along with another mother who also was deported with her 2-year-old citizen daughter.

Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, a policy expert at the National Immigration Law Center, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement used to publish data related to citizens booked-in and arrested, but that was mandated through appropriations and is no longer required.

Currently available data show that in fiscal year 2025 there were no citizens deported and seven arrested. There were 3,700 parents of citizens removed and 6,341 arrested. The data are aggregated and do not show the location, reason for enforcement, outcome or length of detention — as lawmakers are asking for.

Whitlock suspects the data are an undercount based on the number of cases she has seen in the media.

The immigration crackdown is expected to expand considerably. Congress approved a $170-billion budget for border and immigration enforcement earlier this summer, giving the agency the largest boost in generations. President Trump wants 10,000 new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents to be hired.

Immigrant advocates fear with more capabilities, enforcement levels will explode and exacerbate encounters with citizens. Already they said, the White House has given agencies wider latitude than they had before.

“We are seeing the agency unleashed like never before,” said Jesse Franzblau, associate director of policy of National Immigrant Justice Center. “ICE is just picking up people, whoever is nearby and there is a lot of racial profiling happening.”

He points to Julio Noriega, a 54-year-old U.S. citizen who was among those picked up in sweeps in early January in Chicago and placed in handcuffs.

Noriega had been looking for work when agents picked him up and took him to an ICE processing center before looking inside his wallet, according to court documents. The Center and the ACLU of Illinois attorneys said he was detained for 10 hours and then released without his arrest ever being documented. Lawyers argued DHS violated a 2022 settlement requiring agents have probable cause to believe that a person is in the country illegally before arresting them and then reporting it.

“We don’t have any transparency about warrantless arrests, we don’t have transparency about how many U.S. citizens are being swept up and being arrested, “ he said. The data on citizen detained, he said, aren’t always being captured.

“We don’t know how many U.S. citizens are being detained beyond the media accounts,” he said. “It’s incumbent on these agencies to produce this information. These are serious issues.”

The letter asks the oversight bodies to provide by Sept. 5 detailed information on stops, arrests, detentions and deportation of citizens including a breakdown by month, location, reason for enforcement action, outcome, and length of time in ICE custody.

“It should send chills down everyone’s spine if just one U.S. citizen is detained without due process during an ICE raid,” said Padilla. “This is not a question of rights of immigrants versus rights of Americans, it’s about ensuring that due process is afforded and protected for everyone, which the 5th Amendment guarantees.”

Debrorah Fleischaker, the former chief of staff at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said verifying somebody’s citizenship can sometimes be complicated, but officials should be explaining how that works.

“It’s not necessarily automatically inappropriate to have arrested or held a U.S. citizen, but they certainly should not be deporting them,” she said.

“My guess is that they are encountering U.S citizens much more often than they have historically just because the scope of their interior enforcement activities are so much larger than they ever have been.”

Eduardo Casas, an attorney for Job Garcia, the doctoral student who was detained after filming a raid at a Home Depot in Hollywood, said he has been asking immigration officials for information about citizens detained and arrested during the Los Angeles sweeps this summer, but has so far been rebuffed.

“They are not being transparent,” said Eduardo Casas, an attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “We know that citizens are being caught up in this broader enforcement paradigm that centers around mass deportation. The way they try to accomplish mass deportation is by pushing the boundaries of civil liberties in the same way that they’ve done for people like Job.”

Casas said he interviewed other citizens present during raids and a pattern emerged. People filming angered agents, who then arrested them and took them to detention centers.

“They’ll take people as far as detention centers, and then say that you may be charged, and then they let them go,” he said. “It’s also not always a very formal process.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a64aad8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+354/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0e%2Fce%2F4b23dce044b5bc1bb845f4d0f269%2F2219079226.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 09:57:01.565475

Plaintiffs including Friends of the Everglades argued the facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.","Further construction at the Everglades deportation facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz” must be halted for at least two weeks, a federal judge ruled Thursday.

The center, located on an old airport runway surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve, will continue to operate and process immigrants, however.

“We’re pleased that the judge saw the urgent need to put a pause on additional construction, and we look forward to advancing our ultimate goal of protecting the unique and imperiled Everglades ecosystem from further damage caused by this mass detention facility,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, in a news release.

The two-week restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams comes as the court considers a preliminary injunction against the facility.

“Today’s ruling by an activist judge will have no impact on immigration enforcement in Florida. Alligator Alcatraz will remain operational, continuing to serve as a force multiplier to enhance deportation efforts,” Alex Lanfranconi, a Gov. Ron DeSantis spokesperson, posted to social media Thursday afternoon.

The injunction stops filling, paving, new lights, and new infrastructure.

DeSantis previously claimed construction at the facility was temporary and all operations would be carried out using portable units.

Environmental advocacy groups and the Miccosukee Tribe joined together to oppose construction, including pavement laid despite DeSantis’ claims.

“This facility is not only a threat to one of the most environmentally sensitive regions in the country,” Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani said in a news release.

“It is also a glaring example of how far the State of Florida will go to criminalize immigrants and ignore the long-term health of our natural resources. Constructed in direct conflict with the Everglades restoration efforts supported by taxpayers for decades, this project represents both environmental negligence and human rights violations.”

There was a hearing Wednesday about the restraining order.

Plaintiffs including Friends of the Everglades argued the facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.

Williams took over the case after Judge Jose Martinez recused himself.

The center has been controversial, sparking this and other lawsuits with Democratic lawmakers strongly speaking out against it.

“It’s a relief that the court stepped in to protect the Everglades’ sensitive waters, starry skies, and vulnerable creatures from further harm while we continue our case,” said Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. “We’re ready to press forward and put a stop to this despicable plan for good.”

The center has generated national headlines. President Donald Trump visited the facility last month and the Republican Party of Florida is using the center’s moniker on merchandise while immigrant advocacy groups speak out against conditions inside the facility.

“The detention facility threatens land that is not only environmentally sensitive but sacred to our people,” Talbert Cypress, Cchairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida said in the news release.

“While this order is temporary, it is an important step in asserting our rights and protecting our homeland. The Miccosukee Tribe will continue to stand for our culture, our sovereignty, and the Everglades.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Aerial-Everglades-Detention-Center-1.png,N,,2025-08-09 09:57:05.119562

Ice said its officers arrested Beainy on 16 May – five years after he launched the first of multiple Trump Burger locations – and placed him into immigration proceedings, an agency statement said.
Trump Burger gained national attention after Beainy opened the original location in Bellville, Texas, in 2020, the same year Trump lost his bid for a second presidential term to Joe Biden.
He sued the landlord of a Trump Burger location in Kemah, Texas, whom Beainy claimed forcibly removed staff and took over the restaurant.
In 2022, Beainy told the Houston Chronicle he endured threats to have Trump Burger burned down when the first one opened its doors.","The owner of a Donald Trump-themed hamburger restaurant chain in Texas is facing deportation after immigration authorities under the command of the president detained him.

Roland Mehrez Beainy, 28, entered the US as “a non-immigrant visitor” from Lebanon in 2019 and was supposed to have left the country by 12 February 2024, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) spokesperson told the Guardian.

Citing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Texas’s Fayette County Record newspaper reported that Beainy applied for legal status after purportedly wedding a woman – but the agency maintained there is no proof he ever lived with her during the alleged marriage.

Ice said its officers arrested Beainy on 16 May – five years after he launched the first of multiple Trump Burger locations – and placed him into immigration proceedings, an agency statement said.

“Under the current administration, Ice is committed to restore integrity to our nation’s immigration system by holding all individuals accountable who illegally enter the country or overstay the terms of their admission,” the agency’s statement also said.

“This is true regardless of what restaurant you own or political beliefs you might have.”

In remarks to the Houston Chronicle, Beainy denied Ice’s charges against him, saying: “Ninety percent of the shit they’re saying is not true.” He is tentatively scheduled for a hearing in immigration court on 18 November.

Trump Burger gained national attention after Beainy opened the original location in Bellville, Texas, in 2020, the same year Trump lost his bid for a second presidential term to Joe Biden. Replete with memorabilia paying reverence to Trump as well as politically satirical menu items targeting his enemies, Beainy’s chain expanded to other locations, including Houston.

Trump won a second presidency in January, and his administration summarily began delivering on promises to pursue mass deportations of immigrants. Political supporters of Trump in the US without papers, at least in many cases, have not been spared.

One case which generated considerable news headlines was that of a Canadian national who supported Trump’s plans for mass deportation of immigrants – only for federal authorities to detain her in California while she interviewed for permanent US residency and publicly describe her in a statement as “an illegal alien from Canada”.

In another instance, Ice reportedly detained a Christian Armenian Iranian woman who lost her legal permanent US residency, or green card, after a 2008 burglary conviction and incarcerated her at a federal detention facility in California despite her vocal support of Trump. Her husband, with whom she is raising four US citizen children, subsequently blamed the couple’s plight on Biden’s “doing for open borders”, as Newsweek noted.

Beainy’s detention by Ice is not his only legal plight, according to the Houston Chronicle. He sued the landlord of a Trump Burger location in Kemah, Texas, whom Beainy claimed forcibly removed staff and took over the restaurant.

The landlord responded with his own lawsuit accusing Beainy of unpaid debts and renamed the Kemah restaurant Maga Burger.

In 2022, Beainy told the Houston Chronicle he endured threats to have Trump Burger burned down when the first one opened its doors. But the brand had since gained a loyal following and a portion of its profits were set aside to aid Trump’s fundraising, Beainy said to the outlet.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8363812e446f1121d6d93c9d1e54f939fc92f2b0/200_0_2857_2286/master/2857.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9d1bf9af3a22bbd85346104d76be3b9",N,,2025-08-09 09:57:18.078085

Rising ICE arrests in Washington and nationally The data shows 277 ICE arrests in Washington in June.
National figures compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse show a dip in ICE arrests in July, as public sentiment grew more critical about immigration enforcement.","Since President Donald Trump took office, promising mass deportations, many have been trying to assess exactly how dramatically immigration enforcement has changed in Washington state. Yes, immigration authorities have raided at least two worksites, smashed car windows, roamed immigration court hallways and detained people suddenly summoned to the Department of Homeland Security’s Tukwila office building.

But little has been known about whether the number of arrests and detentions in the state has ramped up as much as Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s aggressive tactics. Recently released data from the Deportation Data Project, collected through Freedom of Information Requests by the University of California, provides answers.

The data shows immigration enforcement has indeed scaled up in Washington. Arrests have climbed, most sharply in June, but not as much as they have nationwide. Most of those arrested in Washington and nationwide do not have a criminal record.

Perhaps even more noteworthy, immigrant advocates say, 100% of those arrested in Washington are now spending time detained in jail-like conditions, whereas some used to be released into the community with a form of monitoring, like ankle bracelets or periodic ICE check-ins.

It is striking to me to see such a clear pattern,” said Phil Neff, a researcher with the University of Washington Center for Human Rights, which is often critical of immigration enforcement policies. He tracked the number of local people who were detained through a unique identifier for each person that ICE supplied with the data.

The figures run from September 2023 through late June this year, so they don’t offer a complete comparison of enforcement patterns under Trump versus those under former President Joe Biden. The former president got tougher in some respects as the November 2024 election neared and his immigration policies faced ceaseless criticism from his opponent.

The data is also flawed, with obvious errors such as arrests not attached to Washington despite noted apprehension sites in the state.

Yet even with the data’s limitations, it’s possible to get an overall picture and put recent figures in perspective.

Rising ICE arrests in Washington and nationally

The data shows 277 ICE arrests in Washington in June. That’s more than twice the number of any previous month since Trump took office. The high point of arrests during the last 16 full months of the Biden administration was 202 in September 2023.

On average, the monthly number of ICE arrests in Washington rose from 93 during that period of the Biden administration to 145 so far during Trump’s (not including January, divided between the two presidents, with Trump taking office Jan. 20) – a nearly 56% increase.

Nationally, ICE’s monthly arrest average has more than doubled what it was in Biden’s last 16 full months. A University of California, Los Angeles research center last week released a report fleshing out the wide variation between states in the rate of ICE arrests between February and June. Washington had the second lowest rate, behind Oregon, while Mississippi had the highest rate.

That trend rings true to Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. “There is an uptick” of local arrests, he said. “But it’s not like this massive escalation.”

How many arrested in WA have criminal records

Of those ICE has arrested in Washington under Trump, the percentage with criminal convictions has declined from 43% in February to 31% in June, according to the data. An increasing share of those arrested had pending criminal charges during that time. Even so, most of the Washingtonians ICE arrested in June – 57% – had no criminal record.

Some of the criminal charges and convictions could relate to entering or re-entering the U.S. illegally, although such charges are not often brought in Washington as they are in border states like Texas and Arizona, according to Adams. Living in the country without authorization, for example by overstaying a visa, is not a crime.

The data on criminality, reflected in multiple stories of Washingtonians with clean records being arrested, contradicts Trump’s repeated statements that he is targeting immigrants who are the “worst of the worst.”

Asked to respond, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “This data is being cherry picked by the Deportation Data Project to peddle a false narrative. Many of the individuals that are counted as ‘non-criminals’ are actually terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters and more; they just don’t have a rap sheet in the U.S.”

McLaughlin did not say what evidence the administration had of such criminal activity.

While many have focused on the difference between rhetoric and reality in the current administration, Trump is by no means the first to arrest immigrants without criminal records. Immigration authorities under former President Barack Obama commonly did so before a policy change in his second term.

The Deportation Data Project numbers show the Biden administration did so too. In September 2023, 85% of those arrested by ICE in Washington lacked a criminal record. That number dropped throughout the rest of his term, to just 13% by December 2024. Trump immediately reversed the trajectory.

Changes in how many arrested are then detained

Trump has continued a trend that was underway during the Biden administration: detaining a greater share of people arrested. In September 2023, 27% of those arrested by ICE in Washington were detained. By the end of Biden’s term, 91% were. In June, everyone was.

The increase has contributed to a surge in population at the 1,575-bed Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, which had dropped dramatically during the height of the pandemic as the government scaled back immigration enforcement. The detention center became so full in June that ICE temporarily transferred 41 people to Alaska.

The government is supposed to make detention decisions based on whether immigrants are a danger to the community or a flight risk, noted Adams of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. But in practice, many people have been detained regardless, he said.

“With the big qualifying exception of the COVID period, this has been how immigration detention operates, Adams said. His organization in March filed a lawsuit challenging routine bond denials by most judges at the immigration court housed inside the detention center.

The Deportation Data Project hopes to receive updated state-by-state ICE figures soon. National figures compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse show a dip in ICE arrests in July, as public sentiment grew more critical about immigration enforcement.

According to a news release from Oregon For All, an immigrant and refugee justice coalition, a group of farmworkers were detained around 6 a.m. near Woodburn after ICE agents ""swarmed"" their van.

Three men and one woman were detained, according to a statement from Oregon For All. The coalition was alerted to the arrests after witnesses called the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition hotline. Witnesses reported agents had broken the driver's side window.

The workers were being held at the Portland ICE facility, where attorneys with Innovation Law Lab were denied access, the statement said.

""Imagine being arrested, unable to understand what’s happening, and cut off from legal help,"" said Puma Tzoc, director of the Collective of Indigenous Interpreters of Oregon at Pueblo Unido.

All four farmworkers are members of the Mam Nation and Indigenous Guatemalans, the statement added.

""As Mam speakers, these workers face additional barriers in understanding their rights and accessing legal help,"" Tzoc said. ""This is a violation of their rights. We demand that they respect our Indigenous nations.""

Isa Peña, director of strategy at Innovation Law Lab, said the workers' due process rights are being violated.

""We’re seeing a pattern: ICE acts with impunity, and communities are left to pick up the pieces,"" Peña said.

Peña told the Statesman Journal that legal advocates are still trying to get ahold of the rest of the group. The Innovation Law Lab was denied entry at the Macadam facility in Portland, Peña said.

The nonprofit organization has filed a habeas corpus petition on behalf of one of the farmworkers, identified only as L-J-P-L.

""The right to due process is one of the fundamental freedoms and cornerstones of democracy and we want to make sure that the right to due process is upheld regardless of where people were born or what their immigration status is,"" Peña said. ""As an organization, we cannot look away and are deeply saddened that this happened.""

The petition says the farmworker fled Guatemala after he was targeted by people who killed his brother.

The petition said L-J-P-L applied for asylum on Feb. 11. His next scheduled immigration court hearing was scheduled for Nov. 18, 2026. He has no criminal history, the petition said.

L-J-P-L was arrested and detained by ICE agents ""despite no material changes in his individual circumstances,"" his attorneys wrote in the court filing.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin J. Immergut issued an order on Aug. 7 saying L-J-P-L cannot be moved outside the District of Oregon without advance notice of the intended move, made in writing and filed with the court.

“ICE is terrorizing the very people who feed our communities, targeting farmworkers in their own neighborhoods on their way to work,” said Reyna Lopez, executive director of Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, Oregon’s farmworker union.

Lopez said people will be scared of working during the peak harvest.

""This not only affects farmworkers’ ability to support their families, but also the many growers who rely on migrant labor and our collective ability to put food on our tables,"" Lopez said.

Each of the three judges on the appellate panel in Washington, D.C., wrote their own opinions, contained in a document published Friday spanning over 100 pages. The upshot is that accountability is not likely to come for anyone in the administration who violated Boasberg’s order.

“The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders — especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,” Boasberg wrote in April, finding probable cause that government defendants had violated his order.

That sentiment was echoed by the dissent on Friday, with Judge Cornelia Pillard backing her fellow Obama appointee in writing that the panel majority “does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his effort to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust.”

Yet it was Boasberg who overstepped, according to the Trump-appointed judges in the majority, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao. While noting that the trial judge “was placed in an enormously difficult position” in dealing with fast-paced litigation, Katsas wrote that the government’s conduct “clearly and indisputably was not criminal.” Rao wrote that Boasberg “used the threat of criminal contempt to coerce the Executive Branch to comply with an order it had no authority to enforce.”

Pillard closed her dissent by citing legal principles regarding obeying court orders and the fair administration of justice. “The rule of law means those principles apply to officials in the executive branch just as they apply to all of us,” she wrote. But practically speaking, Friday’s ruling is the latest evidence that that might not be so.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250319-Judge-James-Boasberg-aa-547-9f893e.jpg",N,,2025-08-09 10:57:09.515513

Watch the full press conference above.

Congressman Jesús ""Chuy"" García statement

""Secretary Kristi Noem is lying and she knows it. The vast majority of people ICE has detained have no criminal record. ICE has been detaining and deporting hundreds of thousands of working people, mothers with children, student activists, tourists with visas and even U.S. citizens, all to meet the absurd quotas Trump has established, and fulfill the racist immigration policy Stephen Miller is directing.

""This week, Senator Durbin and I led all Democrats in the Illinois Congressional Delegation in a letter demanding an end to unlawful attacks on local policies that build trust between police and keep communities safe.

""Our communities deserve safety, dignity, and respect. Trust between police and neighbors makes us safer, and ICE has no right to take that away. The Trump Administration’s attacks have no basis, and the courts have already thrown out their lawsuit. We’ve told them loud and clear: respect our laws, stop targeting hard-working immigrants, and stop going after our communities.""

Alderman Gilbert Villegas statement

""As Secretary Kristi Noem and Donald Trump continue their discriminatory and unjust reign of terror against our immigrant communities, once again targeting the City of Chicago. Let it not be lost that the reason for this is petty, racist politics - led by the dark money donations of CoreCivic Corp and GEO Group Inc., who gave Donald Trump millions during his campaign and are now getting billions in no-bid contracts for their disgusting detention centers.

""It was never about public safety, and as this administration continues their uptick in antics to distract from the serious issues they are facing, like raising prices on everyday Americans for petty tariffs, covering up Trump in the Epstein files, and dismantling support for our Veterans, they will continue to target the most vulnerable in our country to keep the attention elsewhere. Shame on them.""

The backstory:

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents ""are now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them as they risk their lives to arrest the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.""

Noem said in a post on X that these ""acts of violence are fueled by sanctuary politicians' rhetoric vilifying our law enforcement.""

""We will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down. Everyday our law enforcement continues to enforce the law and arrest the most depraved criminals including pedophiles, terrorists, murderers, gang members, and sexual predators,"" she added.

It is unclear what the time period is for the 1000% increase in assaults. The Department of Homeland Security did not clarify the matter when asked about it by Fox News Digital.

In July, Fox News Digital reported that ICE officials faced an 830% increase in assaults between Jan. 21, 2025 and July 14, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024.

That timeframe began the day after President Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office.

Noem made the announcement Thursday as the Trump administration is removing the age cap for ICE law enforcement positions, opening up roles to many who may have aged out of the force.

Noem said Wednesday they are looking to make 10,000 hires, and she said ICE has already received 80,000 applications.

""We are ENDING the age cap for ICE law enforcement. Qualified candidates can now apply with no age limit,"" Noem wrote on X.

ICE is seeking to entice more applicants with a signing bonus of up to $50,000, options to repay or forgive student loans and other benefits.

Several groups, including 50501 and NYIC, as well as faith-based groups, were present at the protest.","Several protesters outside New York City’s 26 Federal Plaza government building were arrested on Friday for disorderly conduct, with demonstrators accusing the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency of operating a covert detention facility there, according to several reports.

Protesters marched to the largest federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan on Friday morning and chanted outside the building. Demonstrators demanded access to the site, which was denied, and they later held a sit-in outside the courthouse, according to Hunter Dunn, the press coordinator for the grassroots protest movement known as 50501.

Within a few minutes the New York City police department moved in to arrest about 15 protesters for disorderly conduct, according to Dunn , as activists could be seen blocking the street.

“No fear, no hate, no Ice in our state!” chanted demonstrators during their march to the site, where Ice agents routinely detain immigrants after immigration court proceedings, in a move that goes against previously normal practice.

“They were entirely peaceful,” Dunn told the Guardian. “It is not wrong to demonstrate against illegal, unconstitutional and immoral actions by the federal government.”

Demonstrators allege detainees are being held in overcrowded conditions without many basic amenities or legal access at 26 Federal Plaza’s 10th floor, where the agency denies it detains people, and are demanding unrestricted access for elected officials, journalists and faith leaders. Friday’s protest was one of several in the city this week.

Last month, footage from inside 26 Federal Plaza shared by the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC) showed two dozen men in bare rooms, some lying on the floor with emergency blankets and with few basic provisions.

“Just to be a presence, we’re here to say that the American people are opposed to these kinds of policies. And for Ice agents, maybe that will lead some of them to reconsider their career choice,” Jeffrey Courter, the chair of the Justice Ministries Committee of the Presbytery of New York City, told ABC7.

Authorities insist the facility is only a processing center.

Lawmakers have been denied access to the site. In June, Brad Lander, the city’s comptroller, was arrested while escorting an immigrant from a hearing.

The federal case is likely to address two questions: Are the Colorado laws in question constitutional and are they affected by the Supremacy Clause?
There’s also a question whether the county even has standing to sue the state in federal court since a county is a complete creation of the state.
Sounds strange, but Mesa County, the Sheriff’s Office and the attorney general are all angling for the same thing, which is legal certainty.
But if Mesa County doesn’t like the law, the legislature is the best place to change it, not the courts.","But the county had already signaled before Thursday’s filing in federal court that it would use public funds to defend a Mesa County deputy in a lawsuit Weiser filed in state district court last week — stemming from the now-infamous traffic stop of a Utah college student who was later detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Doesn’t that state court case offer the best chance for a deeper review of state law? The federal case is likely to address two questions: Are the Colorado laws in question constitutional and are they affected by the Supremacy Clause? The case could be dismissed summarily without offering any clarity on the issues raised in the federal suit.

In our opinion, the statutes don’t rise to the level of being void for vagueness as a matter of constitutional law. There’s also a question whether the county even has standing to sue the state in federal court since a county is a complete creation of the state.

If the federal lawsuit is DOA, as we suspect it will be, then filing it is nothing more than a partisan exercise, offering Mesa County’s all-GOP commissioner board an opportunity to show some defiance of Colorado’s Democrat-led legislature.

“When Washington open-border policies and Democrat border policies created this crisis, Colorado Democrat leadership made it worse by passing sanctuary laws that tie the hands of law enforcement and side with lawlessness instead of law and order,” Commissioner Bobbie Daniel said earlier this week as the commissioner board contemplated filing the suit.

Weiser announced a lawsuit late last month against MCSO deputy Alexander Zwinck for alleged violations of state law in relation to a June traffic stop he conducted on 19-year-old Caroline Dias Goncalves, in which Zwinck shared Dias Goncalves’ information in a Signal chat with federal agents. She would later be detained and spend 15 days in ICE custody.

State law bars government employees, including law enforcement officers, from sharing information for the purposes of “investigating for, participating in, cooperating with, or assisting in federal immigration enforcement.”

Weiser’s office said it took the action to establish enforceability of the laws on the books — to vindicate the legislature’s intent in passing them. As a civil action, the state’s lawsuit could lead to an injunction, fines or other remedies through litigation, but the AG’s office simply wants an acknowledgment of wrongdoing and a promise it won’t happen again.

Instead the county has chosen an adversarial proceeding.

Sounds strange, but Mesa County, the Sheriff’s Office and the attorney general are all angling for the same thing, which is legal certainty. The AG’s lawsuit and Zwick’s response — which will certainly be a reflection of the county’s position — will provide that.

These kinds of legal questions should be worked out in the course of ordinary litigation, not some Hail Mary claiming a violation of the federal Constitution. But if Mesa County doesn’t like the law, the legislature is the best place to change it, not the courts.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b32d0574-1b24-11ec-a31e-77e4d5ecaec6.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-08-09 10:57:38.078588

But arrests like the one in Maywood — at a criminal courthouse — are also happening across the country.
Many fear the criminal courthouse arrests have created a chilling effect not just for those accused of crimes, but for victims as well.
NPR spoke to more than a dozen immigration lawyers, criminal defense lawyers and prosecutors in multiple states where criminal court arrests have taken place.
But victims and witnesses' willingness to participate in criminal court proceedings especially worries prosecutors.","Samantha French was at the Maywood Courthouse in Cook County, Ill., when she noticed a group of men in plainclothes who seemed like they were looking for someone.

""I saw their attention peak when they saw someone walking toward them, and one of them very aggressively went toward this man and grabbed his wrist,"" says French, an assistant public defender in the county.

The man's lawyer, Rick Sotorrio, told NPR his client was facing misdemeanor charges for a domestic disturbance in the Chicago suburbs.

""His wife is there, his two kids are there, and as we're starting to leave down the hallway from the actual courtroom, there's like five or six guys standing there,"" Sotorrio says. ""I said, 'What's going on?' And [an officer] goes, 'I work for Homeland Security. We have a warrant for his arrest.'""

Sotorrio and French say they did not see the warrant or any identification. The federal officers arrested the man, and Sotorrio says he is in Mexico. He believes he left the U.S. voluntarily.

In the months since President Trump's second term began, a tactic his administration has increasingly deployed is arresting people at immigration court as they show up for routine hearings.

But arrests like the one in Maywood — at a criminal courthouse — are also happening across the country. Many fear the criminal courthouse arrests have created a chilling effect not just for those accused of crimes, but for victims as well.

NPR spoke to more than a dozen immigration lawyers, criminal defense lawyers and prosecutors in multiple states where criminal court arrests have taken place. Some said they hear about these arrests nearly every day; others, just a few times since Trump took office again. But they all said the fear of it happening has led to growing concern around court appearances.

""It means, to me, the destruction of our judicial system,"" says Brendon Woods, public defender in Alameda County, Calif. ""That might seem to be overdramatic to some people, but when people are coming to court, they expect to be able to litigate their case, fight their case, protect their rights, or come as a victim to court to testify against someone, without the federal government laying siege to them.""

Jason Blank, a criminal defense lawyer in Florida, says one of his clients has chosen not to be present in person at his hearings. The client, a legal permanent resident, Blank says, is concerned he could be deported. Blank is attending on his behalf.

Other lawyers told NPR they worry their clients are feeling pressure to accept plea deals, so they no longer have to appear in court.

Lazaro Salazar, an immigration lawyer in Fresno County, Calif., says it's not just defendants: Immigrant victims and witnesses are afraid to appear too — to testify against someone, for instance, or get a protective order.

""I just recently spoke to somebody who was a victim of road rage,"" Salazar says. ""The aggressor was yelling at her, claiming to call immigration.""

After the man was arrested, police told the woman, who is undocumented, that she might have to testify against him in court.

""She simply is deathly afraid of having to testify. She'd rather let the whole thing go and just let bygones be bygones because she wants nothing to do with the situation,"" Salazar says.

This chilling effect isn't new — police leaders have been concerned for months that ICE tactics are eroding the immigrant population's trust in them. But victims and witnesses' willingness to participate in criminal court proceedings especially worries prosecutors.

""For my purposes, I want justice to happen,"" says Jamie Mosser, the state's attorney in Kane County, Ill. ""If somebody commits a crime, I want to be able to prosecute that person in the way that we should. But I also like to see cases get resolved for victims. And if we have delayed justice, then that just negatively affects them.""

Mosser says arrests at courthouses do happen, but they're usually the result of a crime happening during court proceedings.

""We've had domestic battery cases. We've had stalking cases, things that have happened in the courthouse. It's not abnormal to have something like that happen, especially when you're bringing people together in this courthouse,"" she says. ""This is different, though, because this is more proactive, going to find individuals who are mandated to be here.""

If a defendant is deported, that also makes it harder to prosecute a case, says Tim Cruz, district attorney in Plymouth County, Mass., and president of the National District Attorneys Association.

""It's all contingent upon communication between the local enforcement agencies and the federal enforcement agencies, so that now when there is a serious matter, we can have a conversation about those cases to make sure that somebody is not deported prematurely,"" Cruz says.

""We've been successful, at least for now in Massachusetts, in having conversations with ICE to say, 'Listen, I want to make sure that the right thing happens here. I know you do, too. And I don't think anybody wants people to get away with murder.'""

Cruz said those conversations are rare. Most defendants in the U.S. are facing misdemeanor charges, and immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than their U.S.-born counterparts.

Judges are often less inclined to speak publicly, but after criminal courthouse arrests were documented during Trump's first term, dozens of retired state and federal judges wrote a letter to Ronald Vitiello, the acting ICE director at the time.

Federal authorities in Delaware and Gov. Matt Meyer’s administration have locked horns over a four-month-old subpoena from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for payroll records of 15 businesses suspected of illegally “employing undocumented aliens,’’ U.S. District Court records show.

Most records in the case filed last week in Wilmington are under seal, including the April subpoena and an affidavit by federal Homeland Security Investigations special agent Kimberly Caraway. Records that have been made public in the court file provide the general contours of the battle but not the names of the companies being targeted by ICE.

ICE has been “investigating reports that various businesses” have been breaking immigration hiring laws since February, according to a motion filed last week by Julianne Murray, the interim U.S. Attorney for Delaware, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Claudia Pare.

That’s one month after President Donald Trump began his second term with a pledge to mount a vigorous and sustained crackdown on illegal immigration. Raids and roundups by ICE agents, and subsequent deportations, have occurred frequently across the country, including a controversial effort in Los Angeles that saw Trump federalize and deploy the California National Guard and deploy U.S. Marines to the nation’s second-largest city.

The motion by Murray and Para sought to seal the subpoena to the state Department of Labor and Caraway’s affidavit. The subpoena sought “the production of wage reports for the third and fourth quarters of 2024 for fifteen Delaware businesses” that were identified “by their names, addresses, and file numbers,” the motion said.

The federal prosecutors wrote that Caraway explained in her subpoena that “wage reports can be useful to HSI’s investigation” because getting them covertly from the state “does not alert the business that they are under investigation.”

Should a company suspected of breaking the law “become aware they are under investigation, they may take action to negatively influence the investigation, including fabricating records and firing employees,’’ Murray and Pare wrote.

Murray was chair of the Delaware Republican Party until last month, when fellow Republican Trump made her the state’s chief federal law enforcement officer, at least for now. Murray, a former candidate for Delaware attorney general and governor, has not been formally nominated for the post, which requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.

Murray declined to comment through a spokesperson.

U.S. District Court Judge Colm Connolly consented to Murray and Pare’s motion to keep the subpoena and Caraway’s affidavit under seal.

The prosecutors want Connolly to enforce the subpoena for the businesses’ records, but an attorney for the Department of Labor told him in court this week that the state will be contesting it.

The judge has ordered the state and Murray’s office to file written arguments in support of their positions within the next two weeks. Connolly, a Republican and former U.S. attorney for Delaware, has given no indication when he would rule.

Meyer, a Democrat, issued a statement condemning the subpoena.

“Since taking office in January, our administration has consistently prioritized protecting Delawareans from federal overreach that undermines our core values of fairness, dignity, and community trust,’’ Meyer said. “The recent federal subpoena directed at the Department of Labor is precisely the kind of government intrusion that we have fought against. Hard-working Delawareans deserve to have their rights and privacy protected. Delaware will continue to uphold the law, protect individual rights, and promote a compassionate and inclusive state for every resident.”

Hard-working Delawareans deserve to have their rights and privacy protected. Delaware will continue to uphold the law, protect individual rights, and promote a compassionate and inclusive state for every resident.”

Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order targeting “sanctuary cities,” where cooperation with federal immigration enforcement is limited. This week, the Dept. of Justice published a list of jurisdictions that would face litigation as DOJ works “closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”

That list includes the entire state of Delaware and other nearby locations including Philadelphia and Baltimore County, Maryland.

On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift the court order barring federal agents from making immigration arrests.
According to Feldstein Soto’s office, the lawsuit is set for a hearing on a preliminary injunction scheduled on Sept. 24.

City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto announced today.

During a news conference at City Hall, Feldstein Soto said her office filed an amended complaint adding the cities of Pasadena, Santa Monica, Culver City, Pico Rivera, Montebello, Monterey Park and West Hollywood to their motion to intervene in the case of Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem.

The lawsuit was filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union, Public Counsel and other immigration and civil rights attorneys. Plaintiffs alleged ICE and Customs and Border Protection engaged in “unconstitutional and unlawful stops, roundups and raids without reasonable suspicion or probable cause.”

L.A. County and the city, alongside a coalition of regional municipalities such as Long Beach, Pomona, South Gate, Lynwood, Huntington Park, Paramount, Bell Gardens, Beverly Hills, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Santa Barbara, Carpinteria and Oxnard, quickly filed a complaint and joined plaintiffs.

“Since these illegal raids started in L.A. on June 6, I have maintained that every person in the United States, regardless of immigration status, is entitled to constitutional protection from the types of enforcement activities we have seen,” Feldstein Soto said.

“We will always stand up to protect our communities and to uphold the rule of law.”

Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse emphasized that ICE raids have caused widespread disruption across Santa Barbara County and neighboring communities.

“These actions have discouraged community participation, reduced access to essential services and negatively impacted the local economy,” Rowse said. “The city is particularly troubled by the use of masked law enforcement officers, which has raised concerns about false detainment by impersonators and undermined public trust.”

“While the city supports the enforcement of established laws, it strongly objects to the methods being used and is filing a petition to intervene in Vasquez Perdomo et al. v. Noem et al., joining other jurisdictions in defending constitutionally protected rights and ensuring accountability in enforcement practices,” Rowse added.

A Los Angeles federal court previously issued a temporary restraining order against the federal government to refrain from conducting so-called “roving raids.”

The roving raids targeting car washes, parking lots where day laborers gather and garment factories disrupted immigrant communities throughout the region for weeks in June and July, causing widespread fear.

Last week, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the federal government’s request to reverse the order prohibiting federal agencies — including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — from continuing what U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong determined were unlawful actions in Los Angeles and surrounding counties.

On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift the court order barring federal agents from making immigration arrests.

“This case involves a district-court injunction that threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop of suspected illegal aliens,” according to the Justice Department’s application to the Supreme Court to stay the lower court order.

The high court will decide whether to grant emergency relief pending further litigation.

According to Feldstein Soto’s office, the lawsuit is set for a hearing on a preliminary injunction scheduled on Sept. 24.

She said it seems like conditions should be improving but they “are deteriorating.”

“It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it’s willful,” said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama.

McCroskey said some children are being held for longer because Trump as part of his crackdown ended the Biden administration’s policy that allowed expedited releases of immigrants. McCroskey also pointed to logistical challenges that resulted from the closure of temporary facilities that were set up under President Joe Biden to handle an influx of immigrants.

In May, CBP held 46 children over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours. That included 14 children, including toddlers, who were held for more than 20 days in April.

Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep protections and oversight in place and submitted accounts from immigrants in Texas family detention centers who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam. The advocates also want the judge to expand independent monitoring.

“I have met children who have spent days in jail cells with barely more than ramen noodles to eat, lights on day and night, no sunlight or access to the outside world and the indignity of using the restroom in front of guards. On top of that trauma — then to be flown to family detention and locked up with no end in sight? It is truly shameful,” Leecia Welch, the deputy legal director at Children’s Rights, said in an interview after the hearing.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of immigrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s. It governs the conditions for all immigrant children in U.S. custody, including those traveling alone or with their parents.

In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement.

The administration is looking to expand immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. In court, an attorney for the government, Tiberius Davis, acknowledged that the agreement hampers the administration’s efforts, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Davis said the bill gives the government authority to hold families in detention indefinitely. “But currently under the Flores settlement agreement, that’s essentially void,” he said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa2%2F88%2F586cdc034fe8871019e3e7c98ae9%2Fimmigration-deportations-third-countries-60231.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 04:56:32.519975

Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in Perdomo v. Noem, Frimpong’s double standard regarding ICE and her own courtroom exemplifies how the elite establishment has treated race up to now.","The Justice Department just filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court to vindicate its authority to enforce immigration law. A federal judge in Los Angeles had declared ICE’s questioning of suspected illegal aliens unconstitutional. U.S. District Court Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ruled on July 11 that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had been impermissibly using race to decide whom to detain for questioning about immigration status. Yet Frimpong’s rules for litigating in her courtroom are themselves a violation of the principle of color-blindness.

According to the plaintiffs in Pedro Vasquez Perdomo v. Kristi Noem, ICE’s immigration operations in Southern California single out suspects based on race and three additional factors: a Spanish accent or inability to speak English; presence at a location, such as a day laborer pick-up site, known to harbor illegal aliens; and working at a job, such as at a car wash, known to be dominated by illegal aliens. Frimpong ruled that those four factors, alone or in combination with the other three, did not provide ground, known as “reasonable suspicion” in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, for stopping and questioning a suspect for illegal presence.

ICE had disputed the advocates’ characterization of its stops. Its officers have more particularized suspicion based on their experience and on additional observed facts about the setting and the suspect, ICE argued. Frimpong’s rushed briefing and hearing schedule had not provided the government sufficient time to make its defense, the Justice Department attorneys alleged, to no effect.

Frimpong issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) blocking ICE from using the four factors of race, language, location, and job type in deciding whom to detain for questioning, unless agents have additional grounds for suspicion. The TRO covers the counties of Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo—a huge area containing an estimated 1.5 million illegal aliens. Though Frimpong held that the four banned factors may in theory be used in tandem with other factors, her order in essence shuts down ICE’s ability to question suspects in her district.

The four factors describe the core situation of many illegal alien workplaces. That is not an artifact of the Trump administration’s allegedly biased views; those factors are objective features of the illegal alien subculture, which is now, as a practical matter, virtually off limits to government investigation. The opinion invites a constitutional challenge to any attempted deportation of an illegal alien who fits the profile of a Hispanic Spanish-speaker working at a location known to rely on illegal labor.

On August 1, a panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Frimpong’s decision. The panel coyly noted that if ICE is not, as it claims, conducting unconstitutional stops, it should not object to being enjoined from conducting unconstitutional stops—a silly simplification of how litigation and judicial power operate that would apply to every injunction.

Immigrant advocates greeted Frimpong’s order ecstatically, immediately grasping its implications for immigration enforcement. Mark Rosenbaum, for decades a lawyer with the ACLU of Southern California and now with Public Counsel, a public interest firm, called it “the most important decision in the history of the country about limitations on what immigration authorities can do when they carry out operations.”

President Donald Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, by contrast, called the ruling “another act of insurrection against the United States and its sovereign people.”

The Supreme Court has ordered the plaintiffs in Perdomo v. Noem to respond to the government’s emergency appeal by August 12. In the meantime, Judge Frimpong’s own relationship to race and government action deserves scrutiny. Frimpong has officially declared her “strong commitment” to fostering “diverse lawyers.” The standing order governing litigation in Frimpong’s courtroom states that she “strongly encourages” litigants to assign to oral argument lawyers “whose identities and/or backgrounds further the diversity of the legal profession.” Frimpong adds that the client ultimately decides who speaks on its behalf. But a litigant who brings a team of lawyers chosen on meritocratic grounds alone will worry if its “non-diverse” lawyers face off against black or Hispanic attorneys. A law practice that wants to avoid any possibility of judicial partiality will favor “intersectional” candidates over white male attorneys for oral argument .

Frimpong is herself likely the beneficiary of racial preferences. She was nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, who was explicit before and after his election about his intention to appoint nonwhites, especially black females, to the federal judiciary. The Biden White House announced early on that it would not submit Biden’s judicial nominees to the American Bar Association for preclearance, since the ABA did not sufficiently value “diversity.” This claim was absurd; the ABA obsesses about racial proportionality. The preclearance policy amounted to a confession that the White House would be lowering standards beyond even what the ABA could stomach in its own quest for diversity. Seventeen percent of Biden’s judges were black females, a large increase over the estimated 2 percent of American lawyers who are black female. That eightfold disparity would be magnitudes larger if one limited the benchmark to the percentage of black female lawyers who are judicial caliber—a minute subset of any group of lawyers.

Decades ago, a few maverick judges expressed a preference for “diverse” attorneys in large, multidistrict class-action lawsuits. Since 2020, that practice has picked up steam and has gone beyond the tort context. In 2024, America First Legal filed a judicial misconduct complaint against three Illinois district court judges for offering to provide extra oral argument time to female and minority attorneys. Two of the Illinois judges took down their pro-diversity orders in March 2024 in response to the complaint; the third, a Trump appointee, had already done so at the time that the complaint was filed.

Frimpong’s caveat about the choice of attorney ultimately residing with the client is intended to insulate her preference for diverse attorneys from challenge. But her standing order creates at the least the appearance of impropriety. Race and sex are irrelevant to the validity of a client’s case or to the opportunities for prosecuting a client’s case. By contrast, the factors that Frimpong has declared presumptively off limits for deciding whether to question a suspected illegal alien are logically and empirically related to illegal presence in the country. That does not mean that those factors are coterminous with illegal presence: some legal residents will fall into the four categories, and some illegal residents will not. But as a matter of common sense, they are a reasonable component of a decision to stop someone for questioning. As the government notes, when there is a one-in-ten probability that someone chosen randomly from the general population of Frimpong’s Central District is subject to deportation, the proscribed four factors, which describe the core illegal alien population, should support reasonable suspicion for a brief stop at least in some circumstances.

Fourth Amendment jurisprudence long since evolved past the realm of common sense, however, and law enforcement has had to adjust. In this case, the chilling effect on immigration enforcement from Frimpong’s TRO goes beyond what the law requires. The restraining order subjects every immigration “encounter between agents and potential illegal aliens to the threat of contempt,” argues the DOJ in its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. That chilling effect is precisely the point, of course.

Scrupulousness about the government’s use of race should apply across the board. Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in Perdomo v. Noem, Frimpong’s double standard regarding ICE and her own courtroom exemplifies how the elite establishment has treated race up to now. Dislodging that double standard will be a long battle.

Federal courts are currently weighing several lawsuits brought by the Trump administration against jurisdictions on the sanctuary list.
A federal judge last month threw out the Trump administration's sanctuary jurisdiction lawsuit against Chicago and surrounding Cook County.","DENVER ‒ The Trump administration is threatening to sue and withhold federal funds from more than 20 ""sanctuary"" states, cities and counties, because of their lack of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

""Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. ""The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.""

Inclusion on the list, which includes Democrat-run California and Colorado, but also Republican-led Vermont, comes with the explicit threat of lawsuits and federal funding halts. And border czar Tom Homan has previously promised to ""flood"" those jurisdictions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Several federal judges have blocked the administration's previous efforts to punish some of those jurisdictions, including Chicago and Portland, Oregon.

Earlier this year, the White House published and then almost immediately withdrew a significantly longer list after many communities on the list said they were erroneously included. In many of the jurisdictions included on the new list, local leaders have argued that allowing police to partner with ICE discourages crime victims and witnesses from coming forward regardless of their immigration status.

In announcing the new list, which also includes both New York City and the state of New York, Chicago and San Francisco, the White House highlighted how Louisville, Kentucky, had agreed to end sanctuary policies while facing threat of a lawsuit.

What is a 'sanctuary jurisdiction'?

There's no specific legal definition of a sanctuary jurisdiction, but Bondi's office said it considered things like failure to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, providing government benefits to undocumented immigrants, or refusing to share immigration information about jail detainees.

Federal officials argue local jurisdictions should at the very least honor what are known as ""detainers,"" in which people suspected of immigration violations and who are finishing jail sentences or being released back into the community are instead held until ICE agents come collect them.

In a statement, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said he agreed to participate in the detainer system in return for being taken off the sanctuary city list. City officials said the decision would affect about 100 people annually, and that they hoped agreeing to honor detainers would spare the city more aggressive street-level enforcement of the kind that sparked civil unrest in Los Angeles.

""I believe we will best protect our law-abiding community and our entire city by focusing the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement actions on the few inmates in our jail who have been arrested for committing crimes and are subject to deportation,"" Greenberg said.

Federal courts are currently weighing several lawsuits brought by the Trump administration against jurisdictions on the sanctuary list. A federal judge last month threw out the Trump administration's sanctuary jurisdiction lawsuit against Chicago and surrounding Cook County.

Which communities have been described as immigrant 'sanctuaries'?

According to the Department of Justice, the following communities are offering ""sanctuary"" to immigrants who lack the legal right to be in this country.

United States Attorney General Pam Bondi has said the list could change as cities, counties or states changed policies in the future.

“It seems impossible for a census of any kind to be done in time for the 2026 midterms,” Burden said.
Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution states that residents should be tallied every 10 years, as has been done since the first census in 1790.
Burden noted that during Trump’s first term in office, his administration attempted to include a citizenship question on census forms.
The bigger effects, Burden said, would be related to federal funding.","President Donald Trump says he’s ordering a new census that will exclude undocumented immigrants for the first time in U.S. history, a move that could have tangible implications for Wisconsin and other states if it were allowed to stand by the courts.

A social media post by Trump early Thursday claimed he’s instructed the U.S. Department of Commerce to “immediately begin work” on a new census “using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024.” Trump also said people in the country illegally “WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.”

According to estimates from the Pew Research Center, there were around 70,000 undocumented immigrants living in Wisconsin as of 2022. The analysis shows California had around 1.8 million undocumented residents, Texas had around 1.6 million and Florida around 1.2 million.

University of Wisconsin-Madison Political Science Professor Barry Burden told WPR it’s unclear whether Trump is talking about excluding undocumented residents before the 2026 midterms or the 2030 census, which has already been in the planning stages for years.

“It seems impossible for a census of any kind to be done in time for the 2026 midterms,” Burden said.

What’s more, Burden said, is the U.S. Constitution has clear language when it comes to when the census is supposed to happen and who gets counted. Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution states that residents should be tallied every 10 years, as has been done since the first census in 1790. The 14th Amendment of the Constitution specifies that “the whole number of persons” in each state shall be counted.

Burden noted that during Trump’s first term in office, his administration attempted to include a citizenship question on census forms. A panel of three federal judges in Manhattan unanimously rejected the idea in 2020, stating that the “merits of the parties’ dispute are not particularly close or complicated.” The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but justices dismissed it without ruling on the merits.

If Trump’s administration proceeds with trying to exclude undocumented residents of the U.S. from any census, Burden said it “would probably be tied up in court, maybe until the actual census happens in 2030 anyway.”

“Like so many things that Trump does, it’s possible this post doesn’t actually turn into any real policy actions from the administration,” Burden said. “It might be a way to change the subject from other things that are happening in current affairs that are not as favorable to him.”

Census data is used to determine US House, state legislative representation

Setting aside the political and legal questions, Burden said leaving millions of undocumented residents out of the census could have a range of impacts on Wisconsin. He said one effect might be the allocation of Wisconsin’s House seats.

“If the distribution of (congressional) districts was based only on citizens, some states in the south and the west would lose,” Burden said. “And so that might shift some districts back to the Midwest and the Northeast.”

Burden said it’s not clear that Wisconsin would gain U.S. House seats beyond the eight it has right now.

But Burden said there could be effects on Wisconsin’s 99 state Assembly and 33 state Senate districts if the Legislature were to draw districts using census data excluding people without legal status. In essence, he said parts of Wisconsin could lose legislative seats and others could see gains.

The bigger effects, Burden said, would be related to federal funding. He says many of the formulas to determine federal spending in states are based on census data, “and that includes minors and noncitizens and people who are here on visas and visiting and other kinds of things.”

“If some of those groups were to be excluded, maybe Wisconsin would be advantaged, because there’s some other states with larger numbers of noncitizens that would be affected more dramatically,” Burden said. “It remains to be seen exactly what this post from Trump turns into and whether his plans actually reach that far.”

Wisconsin’s congressional delegation largely silent, aside from Tom Tiffany

Most members of Wisconsin’s congressional delegation did not respond WPR when asked to comment on the president’s idea.

U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Minocqua, a potential candidate for governor, was the exception. In a written statement, Tiffany said “states that harbor illegal aliens should not be rewarded with extra congressional seats or federal funding.”

“The Census was never intended to inflate representation for those who break our laws,” Tiffany said. “To protect the integrity of our elections, it must count only U.S. citizens because anything else dilutes the voice of American voters.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25013537846391-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 04:56:44.766254

The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is a massive victory for the Trump administration, which has lambasted U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for overstepping his authority when he initiated criminal contempt proceedings in April.

The D.C. Circuit had issued a temporary pause of Boasberg's decision while it took more time to consider the issue. In an unsigned opinion issued Friday, Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both appointed by President Trump in his first term, granted a request from the Justice Department to toss out Boasberg's contempt order. Judge Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee, dissented.

The Alien Enemies Act case

The dispute over Boasberg's contempt order stems from immigration officials' efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants under the wartime Alien Enemies Act, which President Trump invoked in March to swiftly remove alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

In response to a fast-moving legal challenge brought by a group of migrants in Washington, D.C., over the removals, Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportations and issued an oral order directing the Trump administration to return Venezuelan migrants subject to Mr. Trump's declaration who were on planes bound for El Salvador back to the U.S. A written order issued shortly after prevented the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act.

But Boasberg said that despite his injunctions, the Trump administration did not stop the removals, and the planes carrying the migrants deported under the Alien Enemies Act landed in El Salvador. The planes were already outside U.S. airspace when Boasberg issued his order blocking U.S. officials from ""removing"" the detainees, a fact that the appeals court noted in ruling for the administration. Most of the people were transferred to El Salvador's notorious supermax prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

The administration's actions raised questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order, and the judge in April ruled that probable cause existed to find government officials in criminal contempt over what he was their defiance. Boasberg said the government's actions demonstrated a ""willful disregard"" for his order.

""The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory,"" Boasberg wrote in his decision. He said the Trump administration could remedy his contempt findings by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of his order, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability.

The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's contempt finding and asked the D.C. Circuit to vacate the decision, which it then agreed to do.

In a concurring opinion on Friday, Katsas wrote that the dispute over the removal of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March ""involves an extraordinary, ongoing confrontation between the Executive and Judicial Branches."" He noted that the proceedings do not involve the lawfulness of removals made under the Alien Enemies Act in March, and said the court may not decide at this time ""whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter.""

Still, Katsas wrote that a decision in favor of the Trump administration is appropriate because ""the government is plainly correct about the merits of the criminal contempt, and our saying so now would prevent long disputes between the Executive and the Judiciary over difficult, contentious issues regarding the courts' power to control foreign policy or prosecutions, or to impose criminal sanctions for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.""

""In circumstances much less fraught than these, courts have reviewed interlocutory orders through mandamus to prevent extended inter-branch conflict,"" Katsas said.

He wrote that Boasberg's contempt finding ""raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses.""

In her dissent, Pillard argued that Boasberg's contempt findings were appropriate, and said the majority's decision to throw out the contempt findings was ""in error.""

""Our system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt,"" Pillar wrote. ""When it appears that a judicial order has been disobeyed, the court's ability to learn who was responsible is the first step to accountability.""

ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Alien Enemies Act cases, said in a statement: ""We strongly disagree with today's decision regarding contempt and are considering all options going forward. Even DOJ's own lawyers have now stated publicly that they understood that they were not supposed to hand over these men to El Salvador. There was zero ambiguity in the moment.""

Since Boasberg's findings and the appeals court's stay of his order, 252 Venezuelans who were deported from the U.S. to CECOT were sent from El Salvador back to their home country as part of a prisoner swap involving the U.S.

Tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary have escalated across Mr. Trump's second term, as judges have issued decisions blocking implementation of many aspects of the president's agenda. But the clash between Boasberg and the president has been one of the most fierce, and the judge's contempt finding marked the most direct rebuke of the administration so far.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/08/b9c26c22-9b9b-4f32-9cd5-2bda0a74a501/thumbnail/1200x630g7/b0abc961d843a2653e48b349ddac2080/gettyimages-2228106587.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 04:56:48.006789

OK, turning now to immigration. ICE is increasingly arresting people at immigration court as they show up for routine check-ins. But federal agents are also now arresting immigrants at criminal courthouses across the U.S. Some legal experts are concerned that that creates a chilling effect, where people accused of crimes and victims are afraid to show up to court. NPR's Meg Anderson has more.

MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: Two weeks ago, Samantha French was at the Maywood Courthouse in Cook County, Illinois, when she noticed a group of men in plain clothes.

SAMANTHA FRENCH: And they looked like they were looking for someone.

ANDERSON: French is an assistant public defender in the county.

FRENCH: I saw their attention pique when they saw someone walking toward them. And one of them very aggressively went toward this man and grabbed his wrist.

ANDERSON: She took out her phone and started recording.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hey.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: That's a lawsuit.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: [inaudible].

FRENCH: The man whose wrist he grabbed onto looked terrified, like he had no idea who these folks were, why they were putting their hands on him and what was going on.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Are you his attorney?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: No.

ANDERSON: The man was in court for misdemeanor charges. French was standing nearby and kept trying to ask questions.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

FRENCH: Did they show you any documentation, any badges that they're officials, that they're allowed to put their hands on people and take them into custody?

ANDERSON: She says they never did. The officers arrested the man. His lawyer says he is now back in Mexico. NPR spoke to more than a dozen defense lawyers and prosecutors in multiple states where criminal court arrests have taken place. Some said they heard about these arrests nearly every day. Others - just a few times since Trump took office again. But they all said the fear of it happening has made people afraid to go to court.

JASON BLANK: Our criminal justice system is based on a premise of trust. Those types of situations don't do anything to support the baseline requirements for a working criminal justice system.

ANDERSON: Jason Blank is a criminal defense lawyer in Florida. He says immigrants convicted of serious crimes, like murder, have always faced the risk of being deported. Lower-level crimes didn't usually affect someone's immigration status. But now...

BLANK: It seems to me that it's a moving goalpost these days.

ANDERSON: One man he represents is a legal permanent resident, but...

BLANK: He has chosen not to be present in person at his hearings, which he otherwise would like to go to just to keep abreast of his case, because he is concerned, as a green card holder, that he could be disappeared.

ANDERSON: Other lawyers told NPR they worry their clients feel pressured to accept plea deals so they don't have to show up to court anymore. And it's not just defendants. Immigrant victims and witnesses are afraid to go to court, too, to testify against someone, for instance, or to get a protective order.

Lazaro Salazar is an immigration lawyer in Fresno County, California. He says he recently advised an undocumented woman who was the victim in a road rage incident.

LAZARO SALAZAR: The aggressor was yelling at her, claiming to call immigration.

ANDERSON: After the man was arrested, police told the woman she might have to testify in court.

SALAZAR: And she simply is deathly afraid of having to testify. She'd rather let the whole thing go and just let bygones be bygones because she wants nothing to do with the situation.

ANDERSON: That worries prosecutors, and judges, too.

JAMIE MOSSER: For my purposes, I want justice to happen.

ANDERSON: Jamie Mosser is the state's attorney in Kane County, Illinois. She says deporting someone charged with a crime can derail a case, and it can have consequences for victims, too.

MOSSER: If somebody commits a crime, I want to be able to prosecute that person in the way that we should. But I also like to see cases get resolved for victims. And if we have delayed justice, then that just negatively affects them.

ANDERSON: Officials with ICE did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump administration is fighting attempts to keep ICE agents away from court proceedings. This June, for instance, the Justice Department sued New York over a law there that restricts ICE from arresting people in or around the state's courthouses.

Last week, the appeals court sent the case back to Boardman so she could issue the ruling.
The high court still left the door open for nationwide blocks when needed to provide plaintiffs “complete relief” or when judges certify a nationwide class action.

The latest ruling marks the fourth time that a court has blocked Trump’s executive order nationwide following the Supreme Court’s decision.","A federal judge in Maryland blocked President Trump’s birthright citizenship restrictions nationwide late Thursday, the fourth such ruling following the Supreme Court’s decision clawing back universal injunctions.

U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman already signaled she would block the restrictions nationwide, but she did not have jurisdiction at the time because the case rested with an appeals court.

Last week, the appeals court sent the case back to Boardman so she could issue the ruling.

The new phase of litigation follows the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision along ideological lines curtailing judges’ ability to issue universal injunctions. The high court still left the door open for nationwide blocks when needed to provide plaintiffs “complete relief” or when judges certify a nationwide class action.

Boardman insisted she was not “resurrecting” a universal injunction and Thursday’s ruling “comports with old and recent Supreme Court precedent.”

“Here, the Court finds that the only way to afford complete relief to the certified class is to enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order as to each member of the class,” the judge wrote. “That relief must include every child in the United States who is subject to the Executive Order.”

She is an appointee of former President Biden.

Signed on Trump’s first day in office, his executive order curbs birthright citizenship for children born on U.S. soil if they don’t have at least one parent with permanent legal status. Every court to directly confront its constitutionality has found it violates the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause.

Boardman oversees a challenge brought by two immigration services organizations, CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, and eight women who are either pregnant or recently gave birth. The plaintiffs have argued an injunction that applies only in some areas or to some migrants is unworkable.

“I am proud to be a class representative in this lawsuit, and I will continue to proudly represent other families like mine who are fighting for their children’s constitutional rights,” Liza, one of the mothers suing, said in a statement. Her last name has not been made public.

“Today’s decision affirms that U.S.-born children have a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship, regardless of their parents’ immigration status,” she added.

The latest ruling marks the fourth time that a court has blocked Trump’s executive order nationwide following the Supreme Court’s decision.

An appeals court panel did so last month, as did two other federal district judges in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

“ICE is actively recruiting officers like you who are committed to serving with integrity, professionalism, and a deep sense of duty.” In addition to police officers, ICE is also looking to recruit military veterans and retired ICE employees.
Prospective employees are being offered eye-popping incentives from what is now the most well-funded federal law enforcement agency in the United States, including a recruitment bonus of $50,000 paid out in increments in exchange for five years of service.
Law enforcement leaders in Florida, which has more agencies partnering with ICE through the 287(g) program than any other state, are especially upset.
In late May, DHS posted a list of hundreds of so-called sanctuary jurisdictions – places that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement – on its website.","Armed with tens of billions of dollars in funding, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is working fervently to expand its ranks.

But some of the Florida law enforcement agencies that closely partner with ICE aren’t happy with the way the federal agency is going about its recruitment push: sending email blasts to local law enforcement who had been trained to work with ICE – a practice one department deemed “wrong.”

At the end of July, hundreds – possibly thousands – of sheriff’s deputies and police officers working at departments that partner with ICE received an email from the agency’s deputy director, Madison Sheahan, imploring them to consider joining ICE during a “critical time for our nation.”

“Your experience in state or local law enforcement brings invaluable insight and skills to this mission—qualities we need now more than ever,” said the email, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. “ICE is actively recruiting officers like you who are committed to serving with integrity, professionalism, and a deep sense of duty.”

In addition to police officers, ICE is also looking to recruit military veterans and retired ICE employees. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Fox News on Wednesday that ICE had removed upper age limits for applicants.

Prospective employees are being offered eye-popping incentives from what is now the most well-funded federal law enforcement agency in the United States, including a recruitment bonus of $50,000 paid out in increments in exchange for five years of service.

That’s a figure that less-funded local departments cannot compete with.

“I’ve seen bonuses being offered usually in about the $10,000-$20,000 range, but certainly not 50,” said Charles Ramsey, the former head of the Philadelphia and DC Metro police departments and a CNN contributor.

The incentives come as the agency is under tremendous pressure to deliver on Trump’s mass deportation campaign. While the White House has sought to ramp up immigration arrests, they continue to lag.

The agency also briefly floated the idea of offering cash bonuses for employees who quickly deport immigrants, according to two sources familiar with the proposal – an offer that was first reported by The New York Times and swiftly withdrawn.

Law enforcement officials who spoke with CNN said they weren’t necessarily upset by the fact that ICE is attempting to recruit their officers – it’s not uncommon for different agencies to try poaching from each other, or for officers to seek opportunities at departments that offer better pay, incentives or lifestyles.

Rather, it was the way the agency went about it.

The officers who received the email were trained through the 287(g) program, which allows local law-enforcement agencies to partner with ICE to enforce federal immigration law, and were required to provide their emails to log into training sessions as part of the certification process. An official from one Florida county said they had not previously received email blasts from ICE and did not anticipate those emails being used to head hunt their employees.

Law enforcement leaders in Florida, which has more agencies partnering with ICE through the 287(g) program than any other state, are especially upset.

“We have partnered with ICE like no other state to help ICE do its job of illegal immigration enforcement,” a spokesperson for the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. “ICE actively trying to use our partnership to recruit our personnel is wrong and we have expressed our concern to ICE leadership.”

Orange County Sheriff John Mina said in a statement he is disappointed “that any law enforcement agency would use information from our partnership to try and poach our deputies,” but added: “I am not concerned.”

“The Orange County Sheriff’s Office is an exemplary agency with great pay, excellent benefits, and a multitude of opportunities available to deputies – and those opportunities keep them engaged and excited about new challenges throughout their careers.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, said in a statement: “ICE is recruiting law enforcement, veterans, and other patriots who want to serve their country and help remove gang members, child pedophiles, murderers, terrorists, and drug traffickers.”

“This includes local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience,” said the statement, which did not address questions about criticism from law enforcement officials who described the agency’s recruitment tactics as heavy-handed.

ICE says their recruitment push is working. Noem said on Wednesday that the agency has received more than 80,000 applications since Trump signed his “big, beautiful bill” into law on July 4. ICE said on social media it has extended 1,000 tentative job offers. The agency has not said how many of those offers have been accepted.

The frustration extends to some sheriffs who are closely aligned with ICE and its mission. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who often speaks out about crimes committed by people in the United States illegally and is a strong supporter of Trump’s immigration crackdown, said in a video statement provided by his office that ICE is “biting the hand that’s feeding you.”

A spokesperson for Judd said hundreds of Polk County deputies received the recruitment pitch from ICE. And Judd noted that those deputies were ICE-trained on Polk County’s dime.

“It’s not professional,” Judd said in the video statement. “It’s bush league work is what it is.”

Ramsey, the former Philadelphia and DC chief, said he believed sheriffs like Judd have the right to be upset.

“At the time they provided [their deputies’ emails], I imagine they didn’t believe that this sort of thing was going to happen,” he said. “Those sheriff’s offices do more than just assist ICE. They have a lot of responsibilities and a lot of duties, and of course, if you lose your personnel, your ability to perform is impacted.”

“So I would imagine that’s one of the reasons they’re upset,” he added. “It certainly would be one of the reasons I would be upset.”

This is not the first time that ICE or DHS has upset jurisdictions with which it partners.

In late May, DHS posted a list of hundreds of so-called sanctuary jurisdictions – places that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement – on its website. DHS removed the list after receiving blowback from several agencies who appeared on it but said they do cooperate with federal authorities and that the list does not accurately reflect their policies.

Federal authorities told The Times on July 8 that federal agents had arrested 2,792 undocumented immigrants in the seven counties in and around L.A. since June 6. Homeland Security updated that number Wednesday, indicating that fewer than 1,400 immigrants have been arrested in the region in the last month.

“Since June 6, 2025, ICE and CBP have made a total of 4,163 arrests in the Los Angeles area,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement provided to The Times.

While 1,371 arrests across the L.A. region since July 8 is still a much higher figure than any recent month before June, it represents a notable drop from the 2,792 arrests during the previous month.

The new figures confirm what many immigration experts suspected: The Trump administration’s immigration agenda in L.A. has faltered since federal courts blocked federal agents from arresting people without probable cause to believe they are in the U.S. illegally.

McLaughlin said Wednesday that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s agenda remained the same.

“Secretary Noem unleashed ICE and CBP to arrest criminal illegal aliens including terrorists, gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and sexual predators,” McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday. “We will continue to enforce the law and remove the worst of the worst.”

Trump administration officials have long maintained they are focused on criminals. But a few days after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller announced in late May he had set a new goal of arresting 3,000 undocumented migrants across the country a day, federal agents fanned out across L.A. to snatch people off the streets and from their workplaces.

White House top border policy advisor Tom Homan suggested federal officials adopted the strategy of raiding streets and workplaces to get around “sanctuary” jurisdictions, such as Los Angeles, that bar municipal resources and personnel from being used for immigration enforcement.

“If we can’t arrest them in jail, we’ll go out to the communities,” Homan told CBS News.

But after local protesters rallied to resist and Trump deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the city, the administration’s ability to ramp up deportations across L.A. was dealt a blow in the federal courts.

On July 11, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, issued a temporary restraining order that blocks federal agents in southern and central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.

That decision was upheld last Friday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

“If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion,” the panel wrote, “they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion.”

It’s hard to know whether July numbers signal a permanent change in tactics.

On Tuesday, Border Patrol agent carried out a raid at the Home Depot in Westlake, arresting 16 people.

“For those who thought Immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again,” acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli posted on X shortly after the raid. “The enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.”

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said her office was looking into the matter but added: “From the video and from the stills, it looks like the exact same thing that we were seeing before.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eba6617/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4967x2608+0+352/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5e%2F01%2F74804a2e4e3ca6fb27ac8ac50a41%2F1509441-me-0611-ice-raid-protest-gem-008.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 07:56:29.633203

Oklahoma has agreed to stop providing in-state college tuition to illegal immigrant students after the U.S. Department of Justice sued the state this week.

State Attorney General Gentner Drummond filed a joint motion with the DOJ to abolish the Oklahoma law “that unconstitutionally gives in-state tuition to illegal immigrants,” according to a Tuesday news release from the AG’s office.

“Today marks the end of a longstanding exploitation of Oklahoma taxpayers, who for many years have subsidized colleges and universities as they provide unlawful benefits to illegal immigrants in the form of in-state tuition,” Drummond stated.

“Rewarding foreign nationals who are in our country illegally with lower tuition costs that are not made available to out-of-state American citizens is not only wrong—it is discriminatory and unlawful,” he stated.

Now the state and DOJ are awaiting a decision on the case from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, according to Inside Higher Ed.

In its lawsuit, President Donald Trump’s administration contended that Oklahoma’s state law breaches the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by granting in-state tuition benefits at colleges and universities to individuals illegally present in the U.S., while charging higher tuition rates to legal U.S. citizens from other states.

“This unequal treatment of Americans is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law, which expressly provides that ‘an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State … for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit … without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident,’” the lawsuit reads.

This is the first time in nearly 30 years that this 1996 law has been enforced, according to The Association of Mature American Citizens.

Currently, 23 states, including Oklahoma, offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, according to Higher Ed Immigration Portal. And Oklahoma is not the only state Trump has targeted for this policy.

In June, a federal judge blocked a Texas law that provided in-state tuition to illegal immigrant students at public universities who met certain requirements following a DOJ lawsuit, The College Fix previously reported.

Also in June, the DOJ sued Minnesota and Kentucky for favoring illegal immigrants over American students.

Still, Hans von Spakovsky, a former DOJ attorney, and Cully Stimson, a legal expert at the Heritage Foundation, argue the Trump administration should take further action.

“While the recent lawsuits against Minnesota and Kentucky are a great start, other states are also actively violating federal law by offering in-state tuition rates to illegal aliens while not offering the same to out-of-state students,” the two Heritage Foundation experts wrote in an article published by The Daily Signal.

“The scofflaws are Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Nebraska, New Mexico, Kansas, Illinois, Florida, Colorado, Virginia, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York,” they wrote.

Williams said Thursday that the detention facility was, at a minimum, a joint partnership between the state and federal government.
It makes no difference that the detention center was built by the state of Florida, since federal agencies have authority over immigration, the lawsuit said.
The lawsuits were being heard as DeSantis′ administration apparently was preparing to build a second immigration detention center at a Florida National Guard training center in north Florida.
At least one contract has been awarded for what’s labeled in state records as the “North Detention Facility.” This story has been updated with additional information.","A federal judge on Thursday ordered a two-week halt to construction at an immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” as she considers whether it violates environmental laws.

The facility was quickly built two months ago at a lightly used, single-runway training airport and can hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures. The site was continuing to be built out, but the order by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams temporarily bars any new filling, paving or infrastructure.

The order doesn’t include any restrictions on law enforcement or immigration enforcement activity at the center, which is currently holding hundreds of detainees. Williams issued the temporary restraining order during a hearing and said she would issue a written order later Thursday.

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe have asked Williams to issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction. The suit argues that the project threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars’ worth of environmental restoration.

“We’re pleased that the judge saw the urgent need to put a pause on additional construction, and we look forward to advancing our ultimate goal of protecting the unique and imperiled Everglades ecosystem from further damage caused by this mass detention facility,” said Eve Samples, executive director at Friends of the Everglades.

A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis decried the ruling but said it “will have no impact on immigration enforcement in Florida.”

“Alligator Alcatraz will remain operational, continuing to serve as a force multiplier to enhance deportation efforts,” spokesperson Alex Lanfranconi said in a statement.

The order is temporary, since arguments in the case are still pending

Plaintiffs presented witnesses Wednesday and Thursday in support of the injunction, while attorneys for the state and federal government were scheduled to present next week.

Following Thursday’s testimony, Paul Schwiep, an attorney for the environmental groups, asked Williams to issue a temporary restraining order that would at least prevent any new construction at the site while the preliminary injunction was argued.

Williams asked Florida attorney Jesse Panuccio if the state would agree to halt construction so that she wouldn’t need to issue the restraining order. She pointed out that anything built at the site would likely remain there permanently, regardless of how the case was ultimately decided.

Panuccio said he couldn’t guarantee that the state would stop all work.

This sparked an hour-long hearing about the temporary restraining order, which will be in place for the next two weeks while the ongoing preliminary injunction hearing continues. Temporary restraining orders are meant to maintain the status quo during a legal dispute for a short period of time, while preliminary injunctions are generally issued after a longer hearing and last until the final resolution of the case.

The legal fight centers on federal vs. state control of the site

The crux of the plaintiffs’ argument is that the detention facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects.

Panuccio said during the hearing that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the NEPA review wouldn’t apply.

Schwiep said the purpose of the facility is for immigration enforcement, which is exclusively a federal function. He said the facility wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for the federal government’s desire for a facility to hold detainees.

Williams said Thursday that the detention facility was, at a minimum, a joint partnership between the state and federal government.

Christopher McVoy, a soil physicist, hydrologist and wetlands ecologist, testified for the plaintiffs on Thursday that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt have been added to the site since the Florida Department of Emergency Management began construction, based on a tour that he took of the facility in June, just days before it opened, and subsequent aerial photos of the site. Tents, trailers and other heavy equipment have also been moved to the airport, which previously had just a few small structures.

Dillon Reio, a licensed professional geologist, testified that the new paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands and spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades.

A second lawsuit alleges violations of detainees’ rights

The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center, which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County.

A second lawsuit brought by civil rights groups says detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated since they are barred from meeting lawyers, are being held without any charges, and a federal immigration court has canceled bond hearings. A hearing in that case is scheduled for August 18.

In a court filing in the civil rights lawsuit on Thursday, the state of Florida said that detainees have been allowed to meet with their lawyers for three weeks at the detention center, which opened July 3, despite some initial delays due to logistical challenges in having private contractors build infrastructure and install equipment. Since July 15, the state has granted every request for a detainee to meet with an attorney, it said.

“More meetings are taking place every day and there have been no complaints,” according to the filing.

Construction, maintenance and operation of the detention center are done by the state of Florida, “without involvement of the federal government,” though the state is granted authority over the detainees through an intergovernmental agreement with federal agencies, the court filing said.

Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center’s construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe.

It makes no difference that the detention center was built by the state of Florida, since federal agencies have authority over immigration, the lawsuit said.

Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Williams had yet to rule on that argument.

The lawsuits were being heard as DeSantis′ administration apparently was preparing to build a second immigration detention center at a Florida National Guard training center in north Florida. At least one contract has been awarded for what’s labeled in state records as the “North Detention Facility.”

Though announced Thursday, the lawsuit was filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma.

The law, approved by the state's legislature in 2007, offers in-state tuition at the 25 state-run colleges and universities to anyone -- including undocumented migrants -- who graduated from an Oklahoma high school and resided in the state with a parent or legal guardian while attending the state high school for at least two years before graduation.

The lawsuit argues the rule violates two of President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration -- one signed Feb. 19 directing federal departments and agencies to ensure no taxpayer-funded benefits go to ""unqualified aliens,"" and one April 28 ordering ""appropriate"" actions to end enforcement of laws and practices ""favoring aliens over any groups of American citizens,"" including those in-state tuition to undocumented migrants.

The Justice Department sayd that the law favors undocumented migrants over out-of-state Americans, calling it ""unequal treatment,"" and argues it violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which holds federal law takes precedence precedence over state laws.

Prosecutors are asking the court to declare the law unconstitutional and issue a permanent injunction against its enforcement.

The state's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has filed a motion in support of the Trump administration lawsuit, saying Tuesday marked ""the end of a longstanding exploitation of Oklahoma taxpayers.""

""Rewarding foreign nationals who are in our country illegally with lower tuition costs that are not made available to out-of-state American citizens is not only wrong -- it is discriminatory and unlawful,"" Drummond said in a statement.

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has led a renewed crackdown on immigration, seeking to conduct mass deportations and limiting the protections of migrants already in the country.

This is the fourth lawsuit since since June challenging state laws offering in-state tuition or tuition benefits to migrants that are unavailable to out-of-state-Americans.

In early June, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against a similar Texas law. As in Oklahoma, the Republican-led state sided with the Trump administration, and the two reached an agreement to halt its enforcement.

Similar lawsuits have also been filed in Kentucky and Minnesota.

According to a social media post by Trump, that census would exclude millions of people living in the country without legal status — an unprecedented change to how the country has conducted population tallies since the first U.S. census in 1790.

The 14th Amendment requires the ""whole number of persons in each state"" to be included in a key set of census numbers used to determine how presidents and members of Congress are elected.

The Trump administration has released no details about the plan. As a result, much is unclear, such as whether Trump — who, according to the Constitution, does not have final authority over the census — is referring to the regularly scheduled national head count in 2030 or an earlier tally.

Trump said he's instructed the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, to ""immediately begin work"" on a census using ""the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024."" It's unclear why the election results would matter to the census.

The press office for the White House did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.

In a statement, the Commerce Department said: ""The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.""

The Constitution did not grant a president final authority over the census

Article 1 of the Constitution empowers Congress — not the president — to carry out the ""actual enumeration"" of the country's population in ""such manner as they shall by law direct."" In Title 13 of the U.S. Code, Congress directed the secretary of commerce to follow a once-a-decade census schedule.

Under that same law, the commerce secretary can conduct a mid-decade census, in 2025, but the results can't be used for redistributing each state's share of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and votes in the Electoral College. And the question topics for such a 2025 census would have needed to be reported to Congress years ago.

Still, while the Constitution requires a census every 10 years for the once-a-decade redistribution of congressional seats, it's not clear whether a head count could be conducted another year, with results used for reapportioning each state's share of House seats and Electoral College votes.

Trump's demand for a new census appears to align with a House bill that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, introduced last month. That bill calls for not only excluding noncitizens from the apportionment numbers, but also a new census and round of congressional redistricting before the 2026 midterm election.

Asked about the bill, Trump said in July, ""It's going to get in. It's going to pass, and we're going to be very happy.""

This year, other Republicans in Congress have reintroduced bills that call for excluding either people without legal status or all people without U.S. citizenship, including green card holders, from the regularly scheduled 2030 apportionment counts.

Trump's census comments on Thursday also come after his vocal push for Republicans in various states to redistrict in an attempt to pick up more seats in the U.S. House. The GOP's gambit to redraw the congressional map in Texas has set off a national political battle, with Democrats in other states preparing potential responses, including their own partisan gerrymandering.

""It is no coincidence that President Trump wants to manipulate the census data at the same time he is pressuring Republican states to gerrymander even more,"" says John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, in a statement. ""This is a comprehensive campaign to flout the U.S. Constitution in order to predetermine election outcomes so he can consolidate his power and avoid accountability to the American people.""

Hours after Trump's post, the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that led lawsuits over Trump's failed efforts to change who was counted in the 2020 census, signaled another legal battle may be on the horizon. In a statement, Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said any attempt by the Trump administration to exclude U.S. residents without legal status from a census ""would defy the Constitution, federal law, and settled precedent.""

""We won't hesitate to go back to court to protect representation for all communities,"" Lakin added.

If Trump is referring to the 2030 census, legal experts say that Trump's successor or Congress may — in 2029 — have an opportunity to get rid of any added question about a person's immigration status before it's printed on paper forms for the 2030 census.

The Census Bureau is in the middle of a years-long process to gear up for that census. Last month, it released the first version of its operational plan for that count, and it has been scheduled to start recruiting this fall for temporary workers to carry out the ""2026 Census Test,"" a major field test for its 2030 plans that's set to take place in six areas in the South and West.

Coming days after Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner after the release of a weaker-than-expected jobs report, Trump's call for a census ""using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024"" resurfaces concerns about the integrity of the data the federal government produces, says Meeta Anand, senior director of census and data equity at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

""To me, that represents an attempt to undermine and sow doubt on existing data and to raise the specter of manipulating data going forward,"" Anand says. ""It's all part and parcel of the same playbook of telling people not to believe what is existing already and what has been collected and tabulated and reported in accordance with scientific standards and principles, and instead to believe what is being put in front of them without evidence for the purposes of political gain.""

Trump's 2020 census bid to exclude people without legal status was stopped

Trump's latest push renews similar efforts from his first administration. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately stopped a question about a person's U.S. citizenship status from being added to 2020 census forms but declined to rule on whether people without legal status can be, for the first time in U.S. history, excluded by the president from apportionment counts.

Former President Joe Biden affirmed the longstanding practice of including the total number of persons residing in the states in those tallies with a 2021 executive order, which Trump revoked on the first day of his second term.

Using the census to ask about a person's immigration status has yet to be tested by the Census Bureau.

But research by the bureau shows that using the once-a-decade tally by the federal government to ask the question ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?"" is likely to produce faulty self-reported data and discourage many households with Latino or Asian American residents from getting counted. Population totals are also used for dividing up trillions in federal funding for public services in communities across the country.

The bureau's researchers have also warned that attempting to produce neighborhood-block level citizenship data with a new census question would be ""very costly,"" harm the quality of other demographic statistics the census produces and yield ""substantially less accurate"" data than information available from existing government records about people's citizenship status.

The Supreme Court found the first Trump administration's stated justification for a census citizenship question — to better enforce the voting rights of racial minority groups — appeared ""contrived.""

As a result, Trump issued a 2019 executive order that spelled out other reasons for producing citizenship data, which would be more detailed than the estimates the bureau already releases. They included informing immigration policy and eligibility rules for public benefits, and coming up with a count of people in the U.S. without legal status. Another reason the order outlined was allowing state and local governments to draw voting districts that do not account for children and non-U.S. citizens. That radical departure from current standard redistricting practices would be ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,"" a 2015 report by a Republican redistricting strategist concluded. Its legality is an open question before the Supreme Court.

A 2020 presidential memorandum ultimately confirmed another goal for Trump's first push for a citizenship question — data that would allow for the unprecedented exclusion of immigrants in the U.S. without legal status from the congressional apportionment counts.

While officials in the first Trump administration often emphasized that some past national head counts have asked about people's U.S. citizenship status in some way, census records going back to 1820 show that Trump's proposal bucks centuries of precedent. The federal government has never before used the census to directly ask for the citizenship status of every person living in every household in the United States.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4480x2520+0+382/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F08%2F5ee8064b46929c3862e04baec3f3%2Fgettyimages-1138922782.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 02:56:38.411083

The restrictions, initially handed down in a July 11 order, bar masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Los Angeles and cities in seven other counties without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.

Under the 4th Amendment, reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on race, ethnicity, language, location or employment, either alone or in combination, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong of Los Angeles found in her original decision.

The Trump administration said in its appeal to the high court that Frimpong’s ruling, upheld last week by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.”

Lawyers behind the lawsuits challenging the immigration tactics immediately questioned the Trump administration’s arguments.

“This is unprecedented,” said Mark Rosenbaum of Public Counsel, part of the coalition of civil rights groups and individual attorneys challenging cases of three immigrants and two U.S. citizens swept up in chaotic arrests. “The brief is asking the Supreme Court to bless open season on anybody on Los Angeles who happens to be Latino.”

The move comes barely 24 hours after heavily armed Border Patrol agents snared workers outside a Westlake Home Depot after popping out of the back of a Penske moving truck — actions some experts said appeared to violate the court’s order.

If the Supreme Court takes up the case, many now think similar aggressive and seemingly indiscriminate enforcement actions could once again become the norm.

“Anything having to do with law enforcement and immigration, the Supreme Court seems to be giving the president free rein,” said Eric J. Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law and a prominent scholar of the country’s highest court. “I think the court is going to side with the Trump administration.”

The Department of Justice has repeatedly argued that the temporary restraining order causes “manifest irreparable harm” to the government. Officials are especially eager to see it overturned because California’s Central District is the single most populous in the country, and home to a plurality of undocumented immigrants.

In its Supreme Court petition, the Justice Department alleged that roughly 10% of the region’s residents are in the U.S. illegally.

“According to estimates from Department of Homeland Security data, nearly 4 million illegal aliens are in California, and nearly 2 million are in the Central District of California. Los Angeles County alone had an estimated 951,000 illegal aliens as of 2019 — by far the most of any county in the United States,” the petition said.

President Trump made mass deportations a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign, and has poured billions in federal funding and untold political capital into the arrest, incarceration and removal of immigrants. Though Justice Department lawyers told the appellate court there was no policy or quota, administration officials and those involved in planning its deportation operations have repeatedly cited 3,000 arrests a day and a million deportations a year as objectives.

District and appellate courts have stalled, blocked and sometimes reversed many of those efforts in recent weeks, forcing the return of a Maryland father mistakenly deported to Salvadoran prison, compelling the release of student protesters from ICE detention, preserving birthright citizenship for children of immigrant parents and stopping construction of “Alligator Alcatraz.”

But little of the president’s immigration agenda has so far been tested in the Supreme Court.

If the outcome is unfavorable for Trump, some observers wonder whether he will let the justices limit his agenda.

Why It Matters

Trump's directive for a new census that excludes undocumented immigrants from the count threatens to reshape how congressional representation is allocated across the United States. If implemented, it would mark a significant departure from long-standing census practice, potentially shifting political power, especially in states with large immigrant populations.

Legal, logistical, and constitutional questions surround the move, with historical precedent and recent court decisions casting uncertainty on its ultimate fate. The development comes as several states, led by Texas, consider early or mid-decade redistricting based on changing population data.

What To Know

Trump's directive cited the 2024 presidential election data as providing the impetus for an overhaul of current census methodologies.

Redistricting in the United States traditionally follows the decennial census, where the U.S. Census Bureau counts every person residing in the country, regardless of immigration status. This count is then used to determine how the 435 House seats are distributed among the 50 states, a process called reapportionment.

In Texas, Republicans have supported a plan, backed by Trump, that relies on new census data to propose redistricting before the end of the current decade. This plan would reportedly deliver five additional Republican seats in Congress, significantly affecting the Democratic Party's ability to reclaim a majority in the House.

The proposal echoes Trump's prior attempt in 2020 to exclude undocumented immigrants from census counts used for apportionment. This effort was blocked in the courts and sidestepped by the Supreme Court, which declared the case premature due to unresolved facts and implementation challenges.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump in a Truth Social post on Thursday morning: ""I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024. People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, at a press conference on August 1, regarding undocumented immigrants: ""I think it's wrong. I think it's unconstitutional that they're counted in the census.""

New York Law School Adjunct Professor and Senior Fellow Jeffrey Wice told Fox13: ""The Congress debated whether or not to count citizens only, and the decision was made back in the 1860s that the reapportionment was to be based on the whole number of persons, regardless of their status.""

What Happens Next

The fate of Trump's order depends on multiple factors: legal challenges, administrative capacity, and the positions of state and federal courts.

The Supreme Court previously hesitated to endorse similar measures, and lower courts have ruled such exclusions unconstitutional or illegal under federal law. If the administration attempts to move forward, renewed litigation is likely.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem decided last month to revoke the status, saying conditions in those countries improved enough to no longer warrant Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, eligibility.

TPS provides work authorization and immunity from deportation to immigrants fleeing wars or natural disasters in their home nations. The designation was set to expire for Nepalese Aug. 5 and for Hondurans and Nicaraguans Aug. 8.

Countering Noem, Judge Trina Thompson ruled July 31 the plaintiffs in National TPS Alliance II v. Noem made a strong case when they claimed their protections were rescinded due to race. She scheduled a hearing Nov. 18 to consider the merits of the case.

“The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty and the American dream,” Thompson said. “That is all plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names and purify their blood.

“In totality, plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence demonstrating racial and discriminatory animus in support of their Fifth Amendment claim. Color is neither a poison nor a crime.”

The Fifth Amendment provides for key legal rights, such the guarantee of due process

The administration … wages a mass deportation campaign against undocumented migrants and seeks to end birthright citizenship for those born in the United States to non-citizen parents.

The administration also has sought to terminate TPS for immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela, even as it wages a mass deportation campaign against undocumented migrants and seeks to end birthright citizenship for those born in the United States to noncitizen parents.

The Department of Homeland Security has been targeted in multiple lawsuits by groups of TPS recipients, resulting in delays imposed by federal judges. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has sided with DHS in two cases.

“Judge Thompson’s editorializing is not only disgusting but also ignores the plain meaning of federal law,” the department said. “TPS was always intended to be temporary. Both Nicaraguan and Honduran TPS have been in place for over 20 years following natural disasters. Since then, the countries have made tremendous strides to recover, and as a result, it is safe for their nationals to return home.”

Terminating TPS helps keep the nation safe from immigrant criminals, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin added.

“This is yet another example of how out-of-control judges are race-baiting to distract from the facts and the president’s constitutionally vested powers under Article II,” she said. “We will appeal, and we expect a higher court to vindicate us.”

But any legal move the administration makes will be swiftly opposed, said Emi MacLean, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California.

“The Trump administration is aggressively, and illegally, seeking to dismantle TPS. But they will not do so without a fight,” MacLean said in response to Thompson’s ruling. “Today is a good day (because) 60,000 long-term residents of the U.S., who have followed all the rules, will be allowed to remain in the U.S. and continue to defend their rights inside and outside of court.”

The decision was a win for due process, said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy.

“Under the court’s order, these long-time lawful residents will have an opportunity to show that the federal government’s rush to strip their protections violates the rules Congress set in place.”

“These individuals have been working and contributing to their communities in the United States for decades. Under the court’s order, these long-time lawful residents will have an opportunity to show that the federal government’s rush to strip their protections violates the rules Congress set in place,” he said.

In her decision, Thompson drew connections between the revocation of TPS and the American slavery era.

“For example, the United States was an active participant in the transatlantic slave trade, which uprooted individuals in Africa and brought them to this continent,” she said. “The emancipation of slaves saw the same pattern, but in reverse. Many whites were uncomfortable with the idea of free nonwhite people in their communities, even if they had lived in the United States for generations.”

Recent polling, meanwhile, shows Americans are dissatisfied with the administration’s immigration policies as a whole, according to America’s Voice.

“Images of masked ICE agents violently detaining U.S. citizens and longtime residents; business voices highlighting the economic fallout of mass deportation; and the detentions and deportations of Dreamers and other long-settled immigrants are fueling the opposition to the mass deportation machine,” it said.

Gallup, for example, reported a significant majority of voters are opposed to current immigration policies.

“Perhaps because of Americans’ opposition to immigration policies that Trump has enacted to remove undocumented immigrants from the U.S., their evaluation of his work on immigration is mostly negative,” Gallup reported. “Thirty-five percent approve of his handling of the issue, including 21% strongly approving, while 62% disapprove, including 45% strongly.”

Among Hispanic voters, 80% disapprove of the president’s handling of immigration, while nine out of 10 support the creation of pathways to citizenship for some undocumented migrants, Gallup reported.

“Trump’s immigration approval is underwater, mass deportation is unpopular, and Americans are recoiling from witnessing it in action,” America’s Voice added. “When gauged head-to-head, legal status for undocumented immigrants is decidedly more popular than mass deportation.”

Trump lawsuit, which challenged President Donald Trump's January 20 executive order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead denied the government's motion to dismiss and ruled that IRAP may create a class-action suit to allow all parties to ""seek…broad relief from government policies.""

IRAP litigation fellow Megan Hauptman said that this decision does not ""alter the scope of the preliminary injunction currently in place,"" meaning that at present, the government is only required ""to process cases of refugees who had travel booked on or before January 20, 2025.""

However, Hauptman also said that ""recent court decisions allow the litigation to move forward on behalf of all refugees harmed by the unlawful refugee ban."" An IRAP press release names the suit's three subclasses as all USRAP applicants awaiting processing, any Afghan or Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) recipients who did not receive resettlement support following a January 24 stop work order, and refugees awaiting the resettlement of family members through the follow-to-join program.

The news may provide hope to Afghan refugees facing deportation in Pakistan and uncertainty at Camp As Sayliyah in Qatar. Stateside, however, Afghans who have lost parole or status continue to await an unknown fate.

Currently, parole has been revoked for a portion of the 8,100 Afghans who entered the U.S. through the southern border using the Customs and Border Protection's now defunct One app, and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was revoked from around 11,700 Afghans in July. Additionally, Afghans who arrived in the U.S. during Operation Allies Refuge in August 2021 were granted two years of humanitarian parole. Their parole was extended in 2023 but is soon set to expire, which will leave an unknown number of parolees in precarious legal standing.

Jill Marie Bussey, director for legal affairs at Global Refuge, told me that Afghans with TPS began receiving notices of termination in early August. For those without additional protections, Bussey said she suspects ""the next step…will be the issuance of Notices to Appear"" in immigration court.

Though bipartisan legislation proposed in the Senate on August 1 may provide eventual support for Afghans who require additional protections, a number of Afghans have already faced arrest and await possible deportation in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities.

On June 12, Sayed Naser was arrested by masked ICE agents outside his immigration court hearing. Though he has an SIV application underway, Naser entered the U.S. through the southern border after the Taliban killed his brother.

A judge dismissed Naser's asylum case on June 26, which placed him in expedited removal proceedings. However, Naser demonstrated that he faced a threat to his life if returned to Afghanistan during his credible fear interview and has since been allowed to resubmit an asylum application, his lawyer Brian McGoldrick said on a Zoom call.

In late 2024, Nasrin, who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity, fled to the U.S. to escape her abusive ex-husband, who sought to marry her daughter to a member of the Taliban after the terrorist group's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. Upon arrival in the U.S., Nasrin, along with her daughter and two of her sons, was placed in ICE detention. Nasrin and her daughter were released, but both of her sons remain in ICE facilities. Nasrin ""worries a lot"" about the unknown future of her sons.

Former interpreter Mahmud, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, entered the U.S. in 2014 through the SIV program. His brother, Fawad, applied for an SIV through work for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and fled to Mexico after his half-brother was murdered. After waiting eight months in Mexico for a CBP One app appointment, Fawad crossed the border in March 2025 and was immediately detained. ICE rejected his claim for asylum and now insists Fawad must be deported to Afghanistan.

Mahmud reports that Fawad has not been granted a credible fear interview and is being moved to different ICE facilities around the country, which makes it difficult for his family to acquire expensive legal representation. Mahmud says Fawad's depression and other health issues are ""getting worse in detention centers.""

Zia S. was arrested by masked ICE agents in Connecticut on July 16 during an immigration appointment and placed in a Massachusetts detention facility. Zia did not arrive in the U.S. through the southern border but came by plane in October 2024 after receiving humanitarian parole.

Though Zia's parole protections extend until October 2026, CT Insider reported that an ICE acting deputy field office director claimed they learned that ""Zia poses a risk to national security from the FBI around May 24 as part of its work with a Joint Terrorism Task Force."" The Department of Homeland Security has also stated that Zia is ""under investigation for a serious criminal allegation.""

Zia's lawyer Lauren Petersen told CT Insider that Zia ""has never and does not now pose a threat to national security.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/08/dreamstime_xxl_119921585-scaled-e1754589406176.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 04:56:45.037997

Here's how ... - CBS News,Aaron  Navarro,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-census-2030-undocumented-immigrants/,"President Trump on Thursday said he had instructed the Department of Commerce to ""immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate"" census that would exclude undocumented immigrants.
In fact, the Census Bureau said it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.
Asked for comment on Mr. Trump's post, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement: ""The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data.
The Bureau says they started planning for the 2030 Census in 2019.
There is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the Census Bureau conducts that does measure this in election years and then after an election.","President Trump on Thursday said he had instructed the Department of Commerce to ""immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate"" census that would exclude undocumented immigrants.

But the census is a massive undertaking and has huge repercussions nationally, including on congressional seat alignment — so it's not something that can be changed quickly. In fact, the Census Bureau said it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.

Asked for comment on Mr. Trump's post, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement: ""The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.""

Here's what to know about the census process:

The Constitution requires the Census be taken every 10 years

Per Article I, Section 2: ""The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct."" Congress codified the decennial census into law in 1954. The Constitution also mandates that reapportionment (the designation of how many Congressional seats a state gets) happens every 10 years, in line with the Census. Redistricting then uses that apportionment and then states are supposed to redraw lines every 10 years, when they know how many Congressional seats they will have for the decade.

The actual data collection for the 2030 Census is supposed to start in ... 2030

It's a long process to design the Census process, send out the Census forms and then have enumerators physically go out to collect the rest of the data for people who don't mail their form back or fill it out online. The Bureau says they started planning for the 2030 Census in 2019. But the actual surveys and collection of data at a large scale begins on Census Day, April 1 of each decade year. Currently, the bureau's timeline has them in the ""Development and Integration Phase"" which includes more design planning, and small-scale field tests.

Citizenship question in the Census?

In Mr. Trump's first term, his administration tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but that was rejected in a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court. But that decision kept the door open to including that question in the future, but concluded that the reason given by the administration and then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was ""contrived"" and ""pretextual."" Because of a tight timeline for when Census forms had to be finalized in 2019, the Trump administration didn't have time to appeal and find another avenue to get the citizenship question on the Census. With Census collection for 2030 still years away, there's a longer runway to legally try and get a citizenship question on the form.

The Census Bureau does take annual surveys/data gathering, but not for population count that would impact redistricting

Since 2005, the Bureau conducts the ""American Community Survey"" every year to collect social, economic, housing and demographic information from a sample of households in all 50 states. This survey does ask about place of birth, citizenship and year of entry into the U.S. But the Bureau maintains that the data remains anonymous.

""No one is able to figure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce,"" the Census website states.

Is political party collected in the Census?

No. There is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the Census Bureau conducts that does measure this in election years and then after an election. But the decennial Census does not ask about political party, income or religion.

Black, Latino and Indigenous populations were undercounted in the 2020 census

The Bureau and experts cited delays caused by COVID-19 and a chilling effect by Mr. Trump's attempt to introduce a citizenship question on the Census form, as the reason for the undercount. Latinos saw about a 5% undercount in 2020, compared to 1.54% in the 2010 Census. The undercount rate for the Black population was 3.3% in 2020, compared to 2% in 2010. Overall, the Census Bureau's post-enumeration survey found that there was a net coverage undercount of 0.25% or 782,000 for the nation.

How do Congressional seats work with the Census?

In 1911, Congress set the number of seats at 435, a number which was permanently set by the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act. The number of seats each state gets is determined by population, with a minimum of one. California has the most with 52, followed by Texas with 38 and Florida with 28.

Given population changes, the number of Congressional seats each state gets is determined by the census. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in July suggested that the census should be redone since he believed Florida should have gotten two new seats instead of just one.

Based off the number of seats each state receives, the Congressional districts are then set, either by the state legislature or an independent commission. Mr. Trump is currently locked in a redistricting battle in Texas, where he has instructed the state's Republicans to redraw the districts to give the GOP an advantage in up to five more seats.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/07/7efd0f5b-9cf1-4ad8-a1ad-a160e50bccc5/thumbnail/1200x630/3ba06971291b7c03351e0c5d44a73b46/ap25013537846391.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 02:56:51.067704

""I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,"" the president wrote on Truth Social. ""People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.""

Asked to clarify Trump’s plan and what information from last year’s presidential election the president was referring to, a Commerce Department spokesperson did not directly answer those questions.

“The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

The U.S. Constitution dictates certain terms for the decennial census, with Article 1, Section 2 saying that representation in Congress will be determined by “adding the whole Number of free persons” and that the apportionment of congressional representation shall be conducted “every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.”

The 14th Amendment to the Constitution expands the qualifications for being counted in the census and in reapportionment to ""the whole number of persons in each state.""

A census plan that leaves undocumented immigrants out of the count would likely face legal challenges.

In a statement, John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, condemned Trump's statement and predicted the proposal would be blocked by federal courts.

""This is a comprehensive campaign to flout the U.S. Constitution in order to predetermine election outcomes so he can consolidate his power and avoid accountability to the American people,"" Bisognano said. ""The U.S. Constitution is clear: all persons must be counted every decade as part of the census. This attempt to manipulate the census data was stopped in court in 2020, and if he follows through with this authoritarian proposal, it will be stopped again.”

Trump has long pondered the question of citizenship as it relates to the census. During his first administration, he sought to have a citizenship question on the 2020 census, but was shot down by the Supreme Court.

At the time, the Trump administration planned to include all people in the U.S. in the census regardless of citizenship. But Trump and then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also planned to ask whether respondents to the census were citizens of the U.S.

Independent analyses, including by the Census Bureau at the time, found that millions of people could go uncounted if they were presented with a citizenship question on the census.

In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the federal government has the right to ask about citizenship on the census, but that the administration did not properly justify why it hoped to change the long-standing practice of not including the question in the census.

Afterward, Trump sought to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census, and he was buoyed by the Supreme Court's dismissal of a challenge to that plan in December 2020. Although the decision would have allowed Trump to move forward with the plan, the subsequent swearing-in of Joe Biden as president prevented him from implementing it.

Other questions about the census — including whether it should be conducted by random sampling or by a direct count — have long plagued presidential administrations confronted with the task of counting every person in the U.S. every 10 years.

Though the next presidential administration would be in charge of administering the 2030 census, the Trump administration would still oversee the beginning of the process, including a determination about what questions would be asked.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-01/230129-census-form-jm-1608-a491c0.jpg",N,,2025-08-08 02:56:55.805342

U.S. law allows migrants applying for this visa to continue the visa process in the countries to which they were deported.

“I’m in the process for a U visa and they detained me, but I don’t know why they’re detaining me. I’m following all their rules,” Mendoza Méndez, a 45-year-old Mexican immigrant, said in a video call with Noticias Telemundo from the Freeborn County Correctional Facility in Minnesota.

In 2013, Mendoza Méndez, who had crossed the border 13 years earlier, was the victim of a violent robbery in Minnesota, which was recorded and investigated by police. The type of assault he suffered is included in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services list of crimes that qualify for a U visa, a measure designed for victims of criminal acts in the U.S. who agree to help authorities investigate the crime.

However, as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, some immigrants who've applied and are in the process of waiting for a U visa have been detained.

“I feel sad. I’m trying to gather my strength, but there are so many things happening here. Many of us are having our rights violated,” said the married father of three children, adding that he's been in the process of obtaining a visa since 2021.

Magdalena Metelska, the immigration attorney handling Mendoza Méndez’s case, said that other administrations didn’t take coercive measures against victims applying for U visas, but that has changed with the second Trump administration.

Now, if someone has a visa pending and even been given a work permit notification, like Mendoza Méndez, ""it doesn’t really matter because these people are also being arrested and detained,” she said.

In April, Jose Madrid-Leiva, a Guatemalan immigrant who was waiting for a U visa, was detained in Kansas City. That same month, Guatemalan immigrant Gerber Mazariegos Dávila, who was applying for a U visa, was detained by ICE agents in Atlanta. In June, Esvin Juárez and Rosmeri Miranda-López, a Guatemalan couple with four children whose U visa application had been approved were deported to their homeland.

A benefit and a law enforcement tool — with a big backlog

The U visa was created by Congress in 2000 through the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act and is reserved for victims of certain crimes who “have suffered physical or mental harm” and who cooperate with law enforcement or government officials “in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity,” according to USCIS.

“The U visa is a humanitarian benefit, but it’s also a law enforcement tool,"" explained Hannah Shapiro, supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society, which provides legal help to low-income families and individuals. ""It requires the individual to cooperate in an investigation or prosecution related to the visa-qualifying offenses, which can be recent or have occurred several years ago.”

She added the visa was designed to make communities safer by incentivizing undocumented survivors of domestic abuse and other crimes to contact police and cooperate in investigations, thus helping make abusers accountable.

The U visa's benefits include the ability to live and work in the U.S. and a chance to apply for a green card in the future. However, as with other visas for victims of abuse and crime, such as the Special Immigrant Juvenile program, the U.S. government only grants 10,000 U visas per year, which has created a considerable backlog for applicants.

There are more than 300,000 people waiting, in addition to qualifying family members, Shapiro explained, and the process can take up to 15 or 20 years.

According to USCIS numbers, the government received 266,293 primary U visa applications from fiscal year 2017 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.

“This means that if all U visa applications were halted today, it would take more than 20 years to resolve the pending cases. Since fiscal year 2009, USCIS has seen a 2013% increase in pending cases,” USCIS said in a statement sent to Noticias Telemundo.

Since June 2021, USCIS has been granting “good faith determinations” — official documents that validate the legitimacy of the U visa application and protects applicants from deportation while giving them work authorization.

Recent changes, fewer protections

Immigration experts and attorneys say the Trump administration is now asserting that “good faith determinations” do not protect people from deportation, leading to detentions of U visa applicants.

“I always carried in my wallet the letter of good faith that ICE had approved for me, which states that I have the right to be in the United States without fear of deportation. But the agents told me they were no longer respecting that. And they took me away,” said Mendoza Méndez.

Matthew J. Tragesser, chief of USCIS' Office of Public Affairs, said in a statement to Noticias Telemundo that “a good faith determination on a pending application for U nonimmigrant status does not protect a foreign national from immigration enforcement.”

Tragesser also stated that “the U visa program is being exploited by foreign scammers and criminals, their corrupt lawyers, and law enforcement officers,” though he did not provide specific figures or cases.

Last month, USCIS announced that five Louisiana men, including four active and retired law enforcement officers, had been charged with bribery, conspiracy to commit visa fraud and mail fraud following a federal investigation that uncovered a pattern of inconsistencies in U visa applications. According to the agency, the defendants filed false police reports so that foreign nationals who were supposedly victims of the thefts could apply for U visas.

A shift away from victims' protections

Although the fundamental structure of the U visa program remains intact (since it was created by Congress, it can't be unilaterally eliminated), several experts and applicants say its practical implementation has become significantly harder.

“Shortly after Trump returned to power, they repealed a memorandum that considered victim status a discretionary factor that, except in extenuating or more serious circumstances, should not be a priority for removal. This is even true if their case was pending and had not been approved,” Shapiro said.

The attorney refers to Memorandum 11005.4, which changed the agency’s approach to immigration enforcement related to U visa applicants. Among other things, this new directive eliminates proactive victim identification, so ICE officers are no longer required to look for clues or evidence suggesting a foreign national is a victim of a crime when making enforcement decisions.

“With the new Department of Homeland Security rules, these cases are being reopened. So people who were helping the police, who had suffered some type of crime, or were victims of a very serious crime are now in deportation proceedings,” immigration attorney Benjamín Osorio said.

One such case is that of Fredy Hernández Cedillos, a Salvadoran immigrant who has lived in the U.S. since 2009. He was injured during a violent robbery in Virginia in 2010 and has been waiting for a U visa since 2020.

""My lawyer received a letter from DHS saying they’re going to reopen our case, even though we’ve already gone to court. So our fear is that we can’t return to our country because gangs are after us. And we don’t know if we’ll have to leave our children,” said Cedillos.

U.S. law allows migrants applying for this visa to continue the visa process in the countries to which they were deported. However, lawyers like Osorio warn of the difficulties involved in this process.

“Yes, they can continue their procedures. But the problem is that if the waiting list is more than 10 years long, people have to spend that time in the country to which they were deported, and they are often in danger there. Furthermore, if they have American children, they will suffer without their parents, because deportation affects the entire family,” Osorio said.

'Harmed by these delays'

The prosecution of these cases made headlines in January, when a Michigan court ruled that a group of crime survivors applying for U visas could move forward with a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for unjustifiable delays in receiving initial good faith determinations, which, among other things, has prevented them from accessing work permits.

""We have several clients who have waited nearly six years without any updates or news, not even an initial acknowledgment of the legitimacy of their case. The court ruled that our clients have been harmed by these delays,” Meredith Luneack, the plaintiffs’ attorney, said in a statement. This case is still being reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

The Trump administration has demanded a drastic increase in the immigrant detentions and deportations, with a daily quota of 3,000 arrests. Shapiro, along with other experts, says this pressure has resulted in hundreds of people being detained while attending their immigration court appearances.

""You want to do things right and work in this country, but what I see is that the government wants to remove as many people as possible. The fear is going to court and, once we’re there, they won’t let us out,” Cedillos said.

Mendoza Méndez remains detained as he battles in court to stay in the U.S. With a broken voice, he said he hasn’t lost hope of returning to his family in Minnesota. ""I still have faith and I know we’ll be able to get through all of this,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-domingo-mendoza-vl-1014a-359c80.jpg",N,,2025-08-08 02:57:00.771970

It's unclear if Trump is trying to tweak the current plan for the 2030 census or start a new one altogether.

The White House and the U.S. Census Bureau did not immediately respond to Axios' requests for comment.

Reality check: The Constitution laid out the Founding Fathers' vision for the census and how populations were meant to be counted.

What the Constitution text says about the census

The Constitution's Article 1, Section 2 stipulated how the population would be counted, though it also featured the ""three-fifths compromise.""

The Constitution says the census should happen ""within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.""

How it works: The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, requires the ""whole number of persons in each state"" to be counted in the census.

""Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed,"" the amendment reads.

The text gave the government a tool to help empower the people according to the United States Census Bureau.

""The plan was to count every person living in the newly created United States of America, and to use that count to determine representation in the Congress,"" the bureau says on its website.

Yes, but: There's debate about how the ""actual enumeration"" for the census is meant to happen. Some contend the language gives Congress a wide net for its methodology.

Who is included in census population counts?

Zoom in: The US Census Bureau says the resident population includes ""all people (citizens and noncitizens) who are living in the United States at the time of the census.""

""People are counted at their usual residence, which is the place where they live and sleep most of the time,"" the bureau explains.

The intrigue: Defenders of the census say the current process helps states represent and serve everyone in their state. But critics contend that the Constitution was written ""before tens of millions of migrants resided in the country illegally,"" according to Benjamin Weingarten of RealClearInvestigations.

Can Trump order a new census?

It's unclear. Trump said in his TruthSocial post Thursday that he urged the Department of Commerce to start working on a new census without specifics.

Preparing for the census count is an arduous process that can take several years of planning.

The Census Bureau has already started preparing a test census for 2026 and a rehearsal in 2028. ""This iterative approach will give the Census Bureau an evidence-based design for the 2030 Census,"" the bureau says.

Flashback: Trump floated a similar idea during his first term. He tried to erase unauthorized immigrants from population counts, while also moved to add a citizenship question a citizenship question to the census. The latter act was blocked by the Supreme Court.

Research from the Census Bureau says that questions about one's immigration status could lead to faulty self-reported data, which could mess with population totals.

Trump also signed a memo in 2020 that aimed to omit undocumented immigrants from the census count. A lower court deemed the policy unlawful. The Supreme Court later dismissed a lawsuit that challenged the Trump administration's plans.",https://images.axios.com/Ay2XhJsEBvYL44W7HyIsSUm9TI4=/0x115:5669x3304/1366x768/2025/08/07/1754577952976.jpeg,N,,2025-08-08 02:57:04.820570

Why It Matters

The Trump administration has been fighting many legal battles in an effort to push through President Donald Trump's sweeping legislative agenda, which met immediate resistance in courts across the country.

According to the Associated Press, the administration has fought over 250 different cases over Trump's orders, with 91 pending, 109 partially or fully blocked and 74 left in effect.

California has been one of the most significant opponents to the president's immigration agenda, resulting in a major showdown between protesters and law enforcement in Los Angeles. The clashes prompted Trump to deploy the National Guard and Marines to quell the demonstrations against the wishes of California Governor Gavin Newsom.

Trump's move proved highly controversial, raising questions about appropriate force and presidential versus state authority.

What To Know

Maame E. Frimpong, the U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California, issued an injunction last week blocking the Trump administration's immigration stops and arrests in Southern California. Frimpong cited a ""mountain of evidence"" suggesting that the federal government's immigration enforcement tactics violated constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The administration argued in its emergency request to the Supreme Court that Frimpong's order poses a significant barrier to enforcing federal immigration laws. The Justice Department contended that the decision unjustly restricts the ability of federal agents to carry out lawful enforcement operations.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Frimpong, questioning the logic of the federal government's argument that the stops did not lack reasonable suspicion and were not part of the injunction.

Jacob Roth, a lawyer for the government, argued that Frimpong's ruling was too broad and there isn't sufficient evidence proving the government's policy amounts to unconstitutional search and seizure.

""Legally, I think it's appropriate to use the factors for reasonable suspicion,"" Roth said, referring to race, language, presence at location, and occupation, which were all listed in the temporary restraining order.

What People Are Saying

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously in a statement to the Associated Press: ""Unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people. President Trump and Secretary Noem are putting the American people first by removing illegal aliens who pose a threat to our communities.""

Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a statement: ""Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design...The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.""

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in a statement: ""These sanctuary city politicians are endangering Americans and our law enforcement in order to protect violent criminal illegal aliens.""

What Happens Next

The administration has appealed Frimpong's order to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to immediately halt the injunction.

A hearing for a preliminary injunction, which would be a more substantial court order as the lawsuit proceeds, is scheduled for September.

In a social media post, Trump also called for an unprecedented exclusion of millions of people living in the U.S. without legal status.

The 14th Amendment requires the “whole number of persons in each state” to be included in a key set of census numbers used to determine how presidents and members of Congress are elected.

It’s unclear if Trump is referring to the regularly scheduled national head count in 2030 or an earlier tally.

Trump said he’s instructed the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, to “immediately begin work” on a census using “the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024.” It’s unclear why the election results would matter to the census.

The press offices for the White House, Commerce Department and Census Bureau did not immediately respond to NPR’s requests for comment.

While Article I of the Constitution has required a census every 10 years since 1790 for the once-a-decade redistribution of congressional seats, it’s not clear whether the results of a census taken years before 2030 can be used for reapportioning each state’s share of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and votes in the Electoral College.

Trump’s latest push renews similar efforts from his first administration that sparked legal battles. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately stopped a question about a person’s U.S. citizenship status from being added to 2020 census forms but declined to rule on whether people without legal status can be, for the first time in U.S. history, excluded by the president from apportionment counts.

Former President Joe Biden affirmed the longstanding practice of including the total number of persons residing in the states in those tallies with a 2021 executive order, which Trump revoked on the first day of his second term.

Using the census to ask about a person’s immigration status has yet to be tested by the Census Bureau.

But research by the bureau shows that using the once-a-decade tally by the federal government to ask the question “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” is likely to produce faulty self-reported data and discourage many households with Latino or Asian American residents from getting tallied in official population totals, which are also used for dividing up trillions in federal funding for public services in communities across the country.

The bureau’s researchers have also warned that attempting to produce neighborhood-block level citizenship data with a new census question would be “very costly,” harm the quality of other demographic statistics the census produces and yield “substantially less accurate” data than information available from existing government records about people’s citizenship status.

The Supreme Court found the first Trump administration’s stated justification for a census citizenship question — to better enforce the voting rights of racial minority groups — appeared “contrived.” As a result, Trump issued a 2019 executive order that spelled out other reasons for producing citizenship data that would be more detailed than the estimates the bureau already releases.

They included informing immigration policy and eligibility rules for public benefits, and coming up with a count of people in the U.S. without legal status. Another reason the order outlined was allowing state and local governments to draw voting districts that do not account for children and non-U.S. citizens. That radical departure from current standard redistricting practices would be “advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,” a 2015 report by a Republican redistricting strategist concluded. Its legality is an open question before the Supreme Court.

A 2020 presidential memorandum ultimately confirmed another goal for Trump’s first push for a citizenship question — data that would allow for the unprecedented exclusion of immigrants in the U.S. without legal status from what are known as the congressional apportionment counts.

Trump’s call for a new census comes amid growing support among Republican members of Congress in recent years to use the next decennial head count to tally non-U.S. citizens living in the country and then subtract some or all of those residents from the apportionment counts.

The action also follows sweeping executive orders by Trump aiming to curb illegal immigration and expand requirements for proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote.

The Trump administration’s latest push to change the census is expected to be challenged with lawsuits.

Additionally, if Trump is referring to the 2030 census, legal experts say that Trump’s successor or Congress may — in 2029 — have an opportunity to get rid of any added question about a person’s immigration status before it’s printed on paper forms for the 2030 census.The Trump administration’s renewed focus on excluding U.S. residents without legal status from the census, however, could fuel public reluctance to participate in the national count, particularly among immigrant communities and Latinos.

While officials in the first Trump administration often emphasized that some past national head counts have asked about people’s U.S. citizenship status in some way, census records going back to 1820 show that Trump’s proposal bucks centuries of precedent. The federal government has never before used the census to directly ask for the citizenship status of every person living in every household in the United States.

The Trump administration has rescinded guidelines that previously limited immigration enforcement actions at what were considered sensitive areas, including schools.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested a parent outside of an elementary school in Chula Vista Wednesday morning as families dropped off students for the school day, according to the school district.

The arrest happened just weeks into the new school year on a “public roadway” near Enrique S. Camarena Elementary school in east Chula Vista, Giovanna Castro, a spokesperson for Chula Vista Elementary School District, told inewsource.

Immigration officials have been accelerating arrests in recent weeks under President Donald Trump’s deportation agenda. Earlier this year, his administration rolled back a policy that once limited ICE activity at schools and other sensitive locations.

Multiple district officials said this was the first they’ve heard of ICE activity around Chula Vista schools.

The district’s superintendent, Eduardo Reyes, sent an email to parents notifying them of the arrest and the district’s policy for handling interactions with law enforcement.

“We understand this may cause concern, and we want to reassure you that our schools remain safe spaces,” Reyes said in the letter.

ICE officials did not immediately respond to questions from inewsource about the person who was arrested and whether officers had a warrant.

By Wednesday afternoon, news of the arrest had reached some parents who came to pick up their children from school. Most who talked to inewsource said they were surprised to hear of the arrest. Some expressed more concern about the incident.

One grandparent who did not want to be named said he felt “sorry” for the family of the person arrested.

“You come to drop off your kids at school and it could be the last day,” he said.

Another parent of two Camarena students who was pushing a stroller into school that afternoon said she was scared by the news. She said she is a U.S. citizen, but she’s worried about immigration officials stopping her because she is Mexican.

Zach Rhoads, who came to pick up his son that afternoon, read the email from the superintendent aloud to his wife earlier in the day. He said he was encouraged by the district’s response and that the arrest didn’t happen inside the school campus.

Rhoads isn’t worried about immigration enforcement affecting his family, but said “we definitely feel for the people that do have to go through that.”

ICE officials in San Diego have been increasing arrests recently, mostly of people who have no criminal records, only immigration violations.

Wednesday’s arrest wasn’t the first ICE incident near a school in San Diego County recently.

In June, two parents returning home after dropping off their child at Laurel Elementary in Oceanside were pulled over by ICE officials in SUVs. The father was handcuffed and arrested, Voice of San Diego reported.

Immigration advocates have criticized Trump’s rollback of the sensitive locations policy, saying it will lead parents fearful of immigration enforcement to keep their kids home from school.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta released guidance earlier this year for schools to prepare for potential immigration enforcement on campuses. School districts across the country have released their own policies for handling interactions and requests from immigration officials and pledged to keep their schools safe for students.

“The Chula Vista Elementary School District is committed to supporting every student, regardless of immigration status, and our highest priorities are our students’ safety, education, and well-being,” Castro wrote in an email to inewsource.",https://inewsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_8798-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 07:57:15.374554

The workers had seven days to accept the reassignment, under threat of being removed from the civil service.

According to sources familiar with the matter, those reassigned were probationary employees with less than one year at FEMA, who because of presumed weaker civil service protections were fired early in the Trump administration but reinstated after a court order. Like at many federal agencies, these employees had been on paid administrative leave for months, among the over 100,000 men and women across the federal government who have been collecting a salary yet doing no work.

But now, these probationary FEMA employees on leave are apparently being shifted as a stopgap maneuver to bolster the ranks of ICE, which received tens of billions of dollars in the GOP mega-bill but faces the daunting task of hiring thousands of new agents to an unpopular agency with plummeting morale.

More from David Dayen

The Prospect reviewed an email from Sara Birchenough, an acting division director in staffing at the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer. The email, with the subject line “Management Directed Reassignment Effective August 5, 2025,” notified recipients that they would be reassigned to ICE “due to the mission requirements of the Department.” The Department refers to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); both FEMA and ICE are under its umbrella.

It’s unclear how many employees were reassigned from FEMA in this manner and exactly how they would serve. Employees were told that the position description would be explained to them separately. They were given seven calendar days from receipt of the letter to accept or decline the appointment; a non-response would be considered acceptance. “If you choose to decline this reassignment, or accept but fail to report for duty, you may be subject to removal from Federal service as provided in 5 U.S.C. § 7513,” the email reads, referring to a portion of the U.S. Code.

In a statement, a DHS spokesperson told the Prospect, “Under President Trump’s leadership and through the One Big Beautiful Bill, DHS is adopting an all-hands-on-deck strategy to recruit 10,000 new ICE agents. To support this effort, select FEMA employees will temporarily be detailed to ICE for 90 days to assist with hiring and vetting. Their deployment will NOT disrupt FEMA’s critical operations. FEMA remains fully prepared for Hurricane Season. Patriotic Americans are encouraged to apply at join.ice.gov.”

Under federal rules, executive branch agencies do have the authority to involuntarily reassign employees within departments, as long as the employee gets notice and has the ability to reject the reassignment. Removal is allowable as a disciplinary measure for rejecting a reassignment.

AFGE Local 4060, the union local for FEMA employees, could not be reached for comment.

Reassigning dormant employees to ICE in particular signals how difficult it has been to add employees to an agency tasked with controversial abductions throughout the country.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act more than tripled ICE’s budget, allowing for the hiring of up to 10,000 new agents. But experts immediately questioned how successful this effort would be. In Trump’s first term, a proposed hiring surge failed to come close to reaching its goals. There’s less margin for error this time, with White House officials making brutal demands to round up, detain, and deport millions of people living in the country.

Since the law’s passage, ICE has advertised hiring terms that look increasingly desperate. It has offered signing bonuses as high as $50,000 as part of a program to lure back recent retirees. It has dangled student loan forgiveness and generous repayment plans for new recruits, while tightening student loan options for everyone else. It briefly offered cash bonuses to agents for rapid deportations before canceling the proposal.

Reassigning employees from FEMA who likely have no experience with immigration enforcement appears to be yet another attempt to bolster the ICE head count. If their task is to assist with hiring and vetting, as DHS says, it suggests a deficit of human resources professionals to vet new ICE agents. But the workers coming from FEMA are not necessarily trained in human resources, particularly in vetting agents who go out into the field for immigration operations.

A rushed process to boost staffing levels by any means necessary is likely to lead to relaxed hiring standards and improper practices. Already, American citizens have been detained and deported, numerous human rights violations have been alleged, and several detainees have died in custody.

The number of migrants being placed in removal proceeds has been increasing over the last five years, but will like see larger numbers in fiscal year 2025.

Immigration courts across the United States have been in a crisis for over a decade, research shows. This comes as the number of cases reaches nearly 4 million.

The number of immigrants appearing for their immigration court hearings in El Paso is declining, courthouse observers said.

Sister Leticia Gutiérrez, the director of the Diocese of El Paso's immigrant hospitality ministry, has been visiting the immigration court in the Richard C. White Federal Building as an observer since late May. She began just after masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began arresting immigrants upon leaving the courtroom, but in the last month she said that the number of migrants appearing is declining.

""The first day we arrived, the room was full of people for their court hearing, but since then, the presence of immigrants has been declining,"" Gutiérrez said. ""I don't know if it is because people are no longer following their process out of fear, because it is always difficult to proceed. But the truth is that every day ICE agents come.""

The migrants are either choosing to appear digitally or are not appearing at all out of fear of being detained for expedited removal after the judge dismisses their case.

She documented only three of 28 immigrants with appointments on July 30 who arrived for their morning hearings. The day prior, four of the sixteen immigrants appeared, with two appearing online and only two appearing physically.

The El Paso Times also observed a near-empty waiting room in the immigration court. Of 30 individual cases, only seven appeared for their afternoon hearing on June 25.

This trend has been increasing as news spreads about ICE officers arresting immigrants following their hearings as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to ramp up arrest numbers and deportations.

In some cases, federal lawyers ask immigration judges to dismiss migrants' cases, and then ICE agents apprehend migrants as they leave courtrooms and transport them for deportation.

At least 83% majority of immigrants historically appeared for their hearings, according to research. These numbers increase to 93% if they have a lawyer representing them.

But the current uptick is likely attributed to the high-profile arrests, but also to a lack of communication from the court, Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an immigration policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, said.

""Arrests are deterring people,"" Bush-Joseph said. ""But also I think the lack of information and the overwhelmed DHS and immigration courts are also contributing (to people not showing up).""

Increasing 'in abstentia' removal orders

The number of ""in absentia"" removal orders — which are deportation orders issued if a migrant fails to appear for their hearing — has been increasing since 2022, with 62,791 orders being issued that fiscal year. Two years later, the number increased to 222,921 orders in fiscal year 2024, which ended Sept. 31, 2024, according to data from the U.S. Department of Justice.

'In absentia' orders have increased in fiscal year 2025, with 133,223 removal orders issued between October 2024 and March 2025. The number of orders in the third quarter of 2025 will likely be higher, Bush-Joseph said.

""Even under Biden, we were issuing record numbers,"" Bush-Joseph said, ""and they are on track to issue even more this fiscal year.""

The majority of the immigrants arriving at the El Paso immigration court lack legal counsel.

A crisis in immigration courts

The U.S. immigration court has faced a crisis over the last decade, seeing massive backlogs of cases, limited legal counsel for migrants and insufficient staffing. The Migration Policy Institute found in a 2023 report that the crisis has grown worse during the first Trump administration.

There were 1,979,313 pending immigration cases as of April 2023, according to the Department of Justice. Two years later, there were 3,923,439 pending immigration cases.

""The crisis at the immigration courts means that the system doesn't work well for anyone,"" Bush-Joseph said. ""It doesn't work for the judges who are under a lot of pressure to be quickly deciding these really complex cases, and it doesn't work for immigrants who are trying to navigate this extremely complex system.""

Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" does little to ease the pressure on the courts, Bush-Joseph points out. The new law, which was approved by congressional Republicans in July, provides billions for the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement and deportations, but it caps the number of immigration judges at 800 and does not provide any more funding for the courts.

The Trump administration has removed judges as the administration seeks to carry out its expedited deportation policy. It is estimated that the courts would require 1,300 judges for at least 10 years to process the current backlog.

Lawsuits against ICE courthouse arrests

As immigrants have slowly stopped appearing for their hearings, courthouse arrests by ICE officers have continued. Ten immigrants were arrested during the afternoon hearings on July 31, Gutiérrez said.

But immigrant rights groups are seeking to block this rapid removal of immigrants following their hearings.

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, UndocuBlack Network and CASA filed a lawsuit against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on June 11. The lawsuit was included in a previous complaint that looks to stop the stripping the parole that was granted to Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.

The San Antonio-based RAICES, the National Immigrant Justice Center and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area filed another lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for courthouse arrests on July 16. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a dozen individuals who were detained across the country after they were arrested by ICE officers after their hearings were dismissed.

The BIA added that a social group defined by sex and nationality also fails to meet the PSG definition.
U.S. asylum law is based on the United Nations’ guidelines for refugee programs.
This three-part test is supposed to distinguish between social groups that are like race, religion, nationality, and political opinion, and social groups that are unlike asylum law’s other protected groups.

On July 18, the BIA published its decision in Matter of K-E-S-G-, finding that people persecuted solely on account of their sex are unlikely to qualify for asylum because sex alone does not meet the definition of a particular social group (PSG), one of the five categories protected from persecution under U.S. asylum law. The BIA added that a social group defined by sex and nationality also fails to meet the PSG definition.

The case involved the asylum application of Ms. S.G., a woman who fled El Salvador for the United States after she was stalked and threatened by gang members in her community. Like many women who flee gender-based violence, she feared returning to El Salvador because of the persecution she suffered, and because her government would not protect her.

U.S. asylum law is based on the United Nations’ guidelines for refugee programs. When these guidelines were created in 1951, member states had just emerged from the horrors of the Holocaust. It is no surprise that they focused on protecting people persecuted for their race, religion, nationality, or political opinion.

However, the United Nations’ guidelines also included a broad term, PSG, to describe people persecuted on account of an identity that did not fit into, but was similar to, the listed categories. After all, societies classify people in different ways over time, so no list could account for all the ways humans target each other for persecution.

Which groups of people meet the PSG definition — and which don’t — has been the subject of debate ever since, particularly when it comes to victims of domestic violence.

To gain asylum in the United States, a noncitizen like Ms. S.G. must show she is part of a listed protected category — race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a PSG — or that other people around her think she belongs to one of these protected groups. The immigration court or asylum officer then assesses whether the harm the noncitizen suffered, or fears, is “on account of” her protected group membership, and assesses a number of other factors.

If an asylum applicant claims membership in a PSG, she must prove that her PSG meets three criteria. Since 2014, the BIA has defined a PSG as a group of people who share a common characteristic they cannot, or should not, have to change (an immutable trait). The group must have defined boundaries (particularity), and others in the same society must view the group as set apart from the rest of the population (social distinction). This three-part test is supposed to distinguish between social groups that are like race, religion, nationality, and political opinion, and social groups that are unlike asylum law’s other protected groups.

In Matter of K-E-S-G-, the BIA decided that sex fails this three-part test. Even though it found that sex is an immutable trait, the BIA ruled that the PSGs comprised of “women” or “Salvadoran women” lack particularity because these groups are too diverse and have no unifying characteristic that unites their experiences. In particular, the BIA argued that women “encompass[] a diverse cross section of society of widely varying ages, socioeconomic statuses, marital statuses, family backgrounds, and lifestyles.”

But this justificationis troubling since racial, religious, national, and political groups also contain diverse cross-sections of society. Furthermore, the idea that women encompass a diverse cross section of society may be true in some cultures, but certainly does not apply where cultural norms punish women for straying outside expected behavior and block women from accessing specific parts of society, such as positions of religious, economic, and political authority. Nevertheless, K-E-S-G- states that “[g]roups defined solely by the characteristics of sex and nationality contain no narrowing features” — regardless of context.

The BIA also reasoned that if it were to decide that sex is a PSG in Ms. S.G.’s case, it would improperly create a new protected ground in asylum law, contrary to the intent of Congress. However, the BIA itself previously noted that an asylum applicant who seeks protection based on membership in a PSG must prove the existence of her PSG using information about her own social context. Before K-E-S-G-, for example, the BIA found that whether or not “married women in Guatemala unable to leave their relationship” was a PSG depended on “the facts and evidence in each individual case” because “any claim regarding the existence of a particular social group in a country must be evaluated in the context of the evidence presented regarding the particular circumstances in the country in question.”

The BIA also justified its ruling by stating that the U.N. didn’t think about sex when it created its refugee guidelines. But the PSG category often is used to capture categories of persecuted people the U.N. failed to anticipate. The K-E-S-G- decision approvingly cites other PSGs the U.N. drafters certainly did not consider, such as the gay community and victims of female genital cutting.

Importantly, as the BIA acknowledged in its K-E-S-G- decision, some circuit courts have previously expressed skepticism about prior BIA decisions finding that PSGs defined by sex and nationality are too broad and thus lack particularity. Under the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Loper Bright, courts need not defer to the BIA’s interpretations of the asylum statute. Advocates whose clients are denied asylum based on K-E-S-G- and ordered removed can therefore argue in petitions for review that the agency reading of the statute warrants no deference, and instead argue for an interpretation of “particular social group” that accords with the plain text, statutory context, legislative history and purpose, and any prior helpful circuit case law.

Nevertheless, to gain asylum in an immigration court or with an asylum officer, victims of gendered violence will now have to prove a more specific reason for their suffering. For example, a Salvadoran woman fleeing an abusive partner will no longer be granted asylum at this level based on her status as a Salvadoran woman, despite El Salvador’s status as the country with the world’s highest rate of intentional female homicides. But if she can show she’s being targeted as a single mother, and that single mothers are a distinct group in Salvadoran society, her asylum claim still has a chance. As a result, people fleeing gender-based violence are placed in a precarious position where they have to explain why they were targeted for persecution in more detail than their neighbor’s fleeing on account of other protected grounds.

The BIA’s decision in Matter of K-E-S-G- gives asylum seekers persecuted on account of their gender an uphill climb, and their advocates now have a great deal of work cut out for them in an environment where more is demanded of them.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-impact-kesg-gender-violence-asylum.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 04:57:08.646948

“The court’s powerful opinion rejects the UC’s attempt to justify its policy discriminating against undocumented students.
The UC system does allow the hiring of undocumented students with work authorization.
This prompted the plaintiffs to file their lawsuit in October seeking a writ of mandate requiring the UC system to consider undocumented students for on-campus jobs.","In a key win for immigrant rights organizations, a California Court of Appeal ruled that the University of California has not provided sufficient legal grounds to justify its “discriminatory policy” barring the hiring of undocumented students from on-campus jobs.

A UCLA alumnus and a lecturer filed a lawsuit in October arguing that the UC system’s hiring policy violates state law because it discriminates against students based on their immigration status.

Plaintiffs said that, without access to campus jobs, many undocumented students struggle to meet tuition costs and cover basic needs such as housing and food. These students are often forced into the underground economy and miss out on career-advancing opportunities such as research assistant positions.

Attorneys representing the UC system argued that its policy is justified because hiring undocumented students could run afoul of a federal law that bans the hiring of people without legal status and may provoke retaliation from the federal government.

A three-judge panel, however, ruled that the system’s policy violates California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act and that fear of federal litigation is not sufficient grounds to uphold it.

“The University does not assert that it relied on the requirements of a federal statute or regulation in deciding to not to amend its policy — only on the risks associated with adopting a policy that the federal government might consider unlawful,” states the ruling. “Accordingly, we conclude that the University abused its discretion by relying on an improper justification for continued application of its facially discriminatory policy.”

The panel stopped short of ruling that UC must overturn its policy; rather, it ordered that the university system reconsider the policy based on proper legal criteria.

Attorneys representing the plaintiffs consider the ruling a victory and are calling on UC to open jobs to undocumented students.

“The court’s powerful opinion rejects the UC’s attempt to justify its policy discriminating against undocumented students. It is wrong — both morally and legally — to bar our state’s most talented students from access to crucial educational employment opportunities based on their immigration status,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of UCLA’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, in a statement. “We call on the UC to comply with state law and treat all its students equally, regardless of immigration status.”

The UC system said it is reviewing the court’s ruling but has not commented on whether it will change its hiring policy.

“To the extent it’s compliant with the law, the University continues to believe undocumented students deserve the same opportunities as our other students,” said UC spokesperson Stett Holbrook in a statement.

University officials have previously expressed fear that changing the system’s hiring policy could result in civil fines, criminal penalties and the potential loss of billions of dollars in federal funding. Last week, the Trump administration announced it was freezing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding to UCLA, citing concerns over antisemitism and the university’s handling of pro-Palestinian protests.

Tuesday’s court ruling comes after a years-long push to open campus jobs to students lacking documentation.

The debate over whether it is legal to do so revolves around the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which bars the hiring of people without legal status.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit argue that this federal law does not apply to government employers such as the UC system. Attorneys representing UC did not argue that the IRCA applies to public universities but said that the federal government might believe it does.

In Tuesday’s ruling, the three-judge panel noted that UC had the option to file a lawsuit against the federal government to secure a court ruling on whether the university system is subject to the IRCA.

Under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy — better known as DACA — undocumented youth who were brought to the United States as children could get work permits. The UC system does allow the hiring of undocumented students with work authorization.

President Trump, however, terminated the DACA program in 2017, and although courts have challenged that decision, the program is no longer accepting new applicants.

There are now around 64,300 undocumented college students who are not eligible for DACA in California and, therefore, not eligible for work authorization — or campus jobs.

“As someone who was undocumented and a UC lecturer, I know firsthand the transformative power of on-campus work opportunities,” said plaintiff Iliana G. Perez in a statement on the court ruling. “UC must now act with urgency to dismantle exclusionary policies and ensure all students, regardless of immigration status, can fully participate in their education, contribute to their campuses, and shape California’s future.”

Students and faculty began advocating for the UC system to open jobs to all students regardless of their immigration status in 2022.

The UC regents established a working group to consider change its hiring policy in 2023, but the group suspended its work due to fear that doing so would violate the IRCA.

A year later, the California Legislature passed the Opportunity for All Act, requiring state public universities to open up employment to all students, but Newsom vetoed the bill, citing legal concerns over the IRCA.

This prompted the plaintiffs to file their lawsuit in October seeking a writ of mandate requiring the UC system to consider undocumented students for on-campus jobs. A court initially denied this request, but the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the California Supreme Court, which then ordered the state Court of Appeal to rule on the merits of the case. The Court of Appeal heard oral arguments in May and issued its ruling Tuesday.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/46fe4b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6224x3268+0+441/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcf%2Fe4%2F76102e404d92a4cf28be9d5e89ab%2F1297686-me-uc-board-of-regents-daca-students-jlc-0517-10947.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 04:57:16.161804

As with their previous earnings call, GEO Group had much to celebrate. Notably, Zoley has donated thousands of dollars to Republican candidates and PACs, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has defended Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda at every turn, is a former GEO Group lobbyist.

“Congrats on the quarter and all the positive news” and the “fantastic growth opportunities ahead of us,” one participant told executives during the question and answer session.

For the second quarter of 2025, GEO Group reported total revenues of $636.2 million compared with $607.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, although the company’s expenses increased by approximately 7 percent. The company’s net debt totals approximately $1.7 billion, compared with $1.68 billion in debt at the end of the first quarter of 2025.

“We have increased our budget to approximately $100 million in physical plant and technology improvements to better position GEO in responding to ICE’s expanding needs,” said GEO Group CFO Mark J. Suchinski.

The Trump administration’s mass detention and deportation agenda has meant lucrative contracts for GEO Group. The company is under contract for approximately 20,000 beds at 21 facilities, “the highest level of ICE utilization in our company’s history,” Zoley said. The company’s contracts represent “more than one-third of the current ICE detention levels, which we estimate to be approximately 57,000 beds nationwide.”

In 2024 alone, Zoley contributed more than $150,000 dollars to Republican candidates and causes, including Trump, the Republican National Committee, and Republican PACs, according to Truthout’s analysis of Open Secrets data.

Since January, GEO Group has entered into government contracts for an 1,800-bed immigration jail in Baldwin, Michigan, and a 1,000-bed immigration jail in Newark, New Jersey, which are expected to bring in more than $85 million and $60 million in annual revenues, respectively. In June, the company announced that it was reopening a lock-up in Georgia that can hold more than 1,800 people and, when operating at full occupancy, is expected to generate approximately $66 million in annual revenue. GEO Group also announced that month that it had entered into a five-year contract with the U.S. Marshals Service to provide transportation services across 14 states. The contract is expected to bring in approximately $29 million in annual revenue.

Zoley said that the Trump administration’s plan to detain people on military bases is another potential source of revenue for the company, and that they’re identifying “existing ICE facilities where we can add approximately 5,000 combined beds using temporary and permanent facilities.”

“All of these efforts are aimed at placing our company in the best competitive position possible to pursue what we continue to believe are unprecedented growth opportunities as a long standing support services provider for ICE with a 40 year long track record,” he said.

GEO Group also expects to profit from increased electronic monitoring of immigrants.

“We’ve stocked up the inventory of our monitoring devices, and are well-positioned to scale up the use of GPS tracking for non detained illegal aliens once the ICE detention capacity has been maximized,” Zoley said.

In July, GEO Group gave raises to Zoley and the company’s CEO. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company wrote that it had approved increasing the target bonus and target stock award from 100 percent to 150 percent of their base salary, in part because of the “unprecedented business opportunities that the Company is experiencing.” The chair’s base salary is $1.1 million, while the CEO’s is $1 million.

That good fortune comes at the expense of the thousands of people locked up in GEO Group’s immigration jails. The company has been repeatedly accused of detaining people in inhumane conditions. People imprisoned at Delaney Hall, the lock-up in Newark, New Jersey, have reported that they’re denied food, access to clean water, medication and visits with their family.

But on the call, there was no mention of human rights abuses or families torn apart. With good reason, executives were optimistic about the company’s future. “On a personal note, I would like to thank the GEO board for extending my employment contract to April 2029, allowing me to participate in guiding our company through the remainder of this presidential administration,” Zoley said.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/2025-8-6-Delaney-Hall.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 04:56:29.722925

José Pineda's attorneys have filed a complaint letter with the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement recounting his ordeal. The letter is a required precursor to filing a lawsuit.

Pineda's attorneys say there's no clear explanation as to why he was pulled over and held, despite having on his person paperwork showing his right to be in the U.S.

"" It seems like the only reason why they actually did this is because of their racial animus and because he looked like a Latino man,"" Pineda's attorney, Victoria Miranda, said.

Pineda, 61, was born in El Salvador and has spent the last 30 years in the U.S. He is here under what's known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, according to Lawyers for Civil Rights, who are representing him. That humanitarian status gives Pineda and other TPS holders the right to live and work in the U.S.

Despite that, on May 27 while Pineda was driving in Weymouth to a landscaping job in a company vehicle, he was stopped by ICE, according to the complaint letter. Five armed officers surrounded the vehicle. Pineda explained he was legally authorized to be in the U.S. and presented his driver's license to an officer.

""The same officer then disrespectfully and incorrectly insulted Mr. Pineda in both English and Spanish, saying that if someone was not born in the United States, they do not have any rights,"" the complaint states.

Pineda was arrested, cuffed and taken to an ICE facility in Burlington, a site that other detainees have called ""abysmal"" and ""inhumane."" WBUR has reported that the Burlington office, which was designed to hold people for just a few hours, has been used to hold some people for days or for more than a week.

Pineda was held in Burlington for 36 hours before he was released. During that time, he said he was kept in an overcrowded room with 40 to 60 people and only a small sink and one toilet. According to the complaint, Pineda had to stand for most of his time there and there was no room to lie down to sleep.

""This is someone who has been complying for 30 years and simply got pulled over, arrested, chained, cuffed, brought to a facility with inhumane conditions for no reason at all,"" his attorney, Miranda, said.

ICE officers confiscated Pineda's license, social security card, employment authorization card and credit card. The also seized $600 in cash, which was not returned, according to the complaint letter.

ICE declined to comment on Pineda's complaint.

In June, Lawyers for Civil Rights filed a similar complaint letter to DHS and ICE for a Chelsea family. Federal agents smashed he window of the family's vehicle and pulled Daniel Flores-Martinez out of the car in front of his wife and children on the way to church.

Miranda said Pineda had to ""succumb"" in the moment to ICE agents, despite his legal status. But she hopes other immigrants worried about similar stops will know their rights and be able to state them to authorities.

Perhaps, she said, ""immigration enforcement will get the message that this type of practice is not okay.""",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/0716_burlingtonice-3-1-1000x530.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 04:56:34.176465

Germany has its own list of safe countries of origin.
In the future, safe countries of origin are to be determined by decree.
She added that the plan to classify safe countries of origin by means of a legal directive without oversight by the Bundestag and Bundesrat is not possible.
Classifying these countries as safe would conflict with a key criterion established by the European Court of Justice's ruling: countries deemed safe third countries must ensure the safety of their entire population.","Safe countries of origin are those whose citizens do not have to fear state persecution, according to assessments by the German government or the European Union. Whether such assessments are accurate is a matter for debate that often ends up in court.

Last week, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that EU countries are allowed to designate safe countries of origin to fast-track asylum procedures if authorities disclose the sources for their assessment. The court also found that for a country to be designated as safe, it must offer adequate protection to the entire population, including minorities.

The Luxembourg-based court also said that while having a fast-track procedure does not violate EU law, the designation of safe countries must be subject to judicial scrutiny so migrants can challenge decisions made on their asylum claims.

Germany has its own list of safe countries of origin. Asylum seekers from these countries hardly stand a chance of being granted asylum in Germany. Currently, eight European non-EU and two African countries are on this list.

Safe country candidates: Algeria, India, Morocco, Tunisia

The new German coalition government of center-right Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) had agreed to add more countries to the list. ""We are continuously assessing whether more countries meet the requirements. In particular, a country will be classified as safe if fewer than 5% of asylum seekers from that country have been accepted over at least a five-year period.""

It remains to be seen whether these plans will be as easy to implement as it sounds in the coalition agreement following the ECJ ruling. A spokesperson for the interior ministry, which is responsible for asylum policy, said that the ruling will be reviewed.

Yet the German government still intends to reform the process for determining whether a country of origin is safe. In the future, safe countries of origin are to be determined by decree. This would mean that neither the Bundestag nor the Bundesrat (the upper house of parliament representing the 16 federal states) would have a say in the matter.

Interior Minister calls for reform to asylum law

The coalition has already submitted a draft bill on this issue, which is to be voted on after the parliament's summer recess. The first debate already took place last July. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt took that opportunity to criticize what he sees as an insufficient number of deportations of rejected asylum seekers: ""Our goal now is to remove the obstacles to effectively limiting illegal migration,"" he said.

One such obstacle that the CSU politician highlighted was the fact that, under current law, people who have been ordered to leave the country are entitled to legal representation before their planned deportation can be enforced. This is one of the regulations that is to be abolished. Dobrindt hopes that this will also speed up deportations to countries already listed as safe.

Within the European Union, there are already discussions about setting up joint centers for the repatriation of rejected asylum seekers. The interior ministers of EU member states discussed this at their meeting in Copenhagen last July.

This is an idea that Dobrindt is in favor of. He pointed out that it can be difficult for individual member states to reach deals with non-EU countries, while it could be more expedient when several EU countries work together. Several countries already have concrete plans in place. ""I wouldn't rule this out for Germany either,"" said the German interior minister.

'Those who cannot stay should not come in the first place'

In Dobrindt's view, many of the people who came to Germany in the past were not eligible for asylum. He hopes that the planned reform will send a clear message: ""People who come from a safe country of origin should not make the journey. Those who cannot stay should not come in the first place.""

Some members of the political opposition in Germany hope that the European Court of Justice's ruling will force the federal government to change its course on asylum policy.

""The ECJ ruling on safe countries of origin is a major success for human rights and the individual right to asylum in Europe,"" said Green Party MP Filiz Polat. She added that the plan to classify safe countries of origin by means of a legal directive without oversight by the Bundestag and Bundesrat is not possible.

The Left Party: Georgia and Moldova are not safe third countries

Clara Bünger of the Left Party has also called on the governing coalition to carry out a comprehensive review of the list of safe countries of origin.""Georgia and Moldova should be removed from this list immediately.

The reason given was the precarious human rights situation in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Also, the EU member state Czechia considers only parts of Moldova as safe, while the Transnistria region is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and therefore considered unsafe.

The ECJ ruling, according to Bünger, ""also represents a clear repudiation of the federal government's plans to classify other countries, such as Tunisia and Algeria, as safe.""

Same-sex sexual relations are punishable by law in both Tunisia and Algeria. Classifying these countries as safe would conflict with a key criterion established by the European Court of Justice's ruling: countries deemed safe third countries must ensure the safety of their entire population.

The lawsuit, filed at a federal court in California, represents the latest legal challenge to two provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that have been key to the State and Homeland Security Departments’ so-called ideological deportation policy. In several other cases brought around the country, judges have also been asked to weigh the constitutionality of the INA provisions and the administration’s policy around them.

The California case was brought by the organization that publishes The Stanford Daily and two noncitizen former college students who fear their pro-Palestinian views or advocacy could put them at risk of being deported. Attorneys for the newspaper said in the lawsuit that international students on staff are turning down assignments related to the war in Gaza or “seeking removal of their previous articles about it.”

“Since the Trump administration began targeting lawfully present noncitizens for deportation based on protected speech in March 2025, lawfully present noncitizen students working at and contributing to Stanford Daily have self-censored expression for fear of visa revocation, arrest, detention, and deportation,” attorneys from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which brought the new case, wrote in court papers.

One of the INA provisions at issue gives Secretary of State Marco Rubio the authority to decide that a noncitizen is removable if he “personally determines” that the individual’s views “would compromise a compelling United States foreign policy interest.” The other gives the secretary the power to “at any time, in his discretion” revoke a visa.

The Stanford Daily and the two unnamed former students are asking a federal judge to bar the administration from using the pair of provisions to deport them and any noncitizen members of the newspaper’s staff based on their “protected speech.”

“The First Amendment cements America’s promise that the government may not subject a speaker to disfavored treatment because those in power do not like his or her message. And when a federal statute collides with First Amendment rights, the Constitution prevails,” the attorneys wrote.

The lawsuit comes on the heels of a weekslong bench trial in a separate case in Boston during which members of the Trump administration testified under oath about the government’s targeting of noncitizen pro-Palestinian students and scholars.

The trial, which concluded on July 21, highlighted how DHS began taking orders from the State Department as it went after certain professors and students to change their immigration status and work to have them deported. US District Judge William Young, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, is now deciding whether the government’s “ideological deportation policy” had the effect of unlawfully chilling the speech of certain professors.

Hundreds of migrants departed from Chiapas state in southeastern Mexico on Wednesday with the intention of reaching the nation’s capital, Mexico City, to settle there.

As foreigners and asylum seekers continue to be turned away under US border and immigration policies, many migrants now see Mexico as a destination rather than just a transit country.

Local reports estimate the caravan at around 300 people, primarily from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The group departed from Tapachula -- a city on Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala that has become a key point in hemispheric migration.

Unlike previous caravans, the newly formed group aims to reach Mexico City rather than the northern border as US President Donald Trump continues his crusade against immigrants.

Speaking to Anadolu, Gabriela Hernandez, the director of Casa Tochan -- a migrant shelter in Mexico City – explained the reason for the shift in destination for many asylum seekers.

“Because Trump has been decisive. Not only did he remove the CBP One app, but he also toughened the entire process of migrating legally.

“Obviously, those coming in that caravan can't return to their countries, which is why they see Mexico as an option. Besides, we already know -- even if it’s kept under wraps -- that Mexico has been accepting deportees from the United States who aren’t even Mexican. So Mexico ends up with both those being returned and those trying to arrive,"" she said.

Beyond the dismantling of legal pathways such as CBP One -- the US Customs and Border Protection app launched during President Joe Biden’s administration to help migrants schedule asylum appointments -- the Trump administration has also resumed deporting non-Mexican migrants to Mexican territory.

“The Mexican government continues with its approach of ignoring migrants. In no speech or political discourse does it address foreign migration, as if it didn’t exist. This makes it clear that it won’t take them into account, which is the most serious issue for people who have no other option but to stay in Mexico,” Hernandez added.

Echoing the US government’s tough approach, Mexico has increasingly moved to restrict migration. In an effort to placate Trump’s threats of imposing tariffs, President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration has deployed large numbers of military troops to control both borders. Raids on migrant camps at key entry points such as Tapachula and Mexico City have also intensified.

The caravan itself has been targeted by these policies. Mexican authorities recently arrested Luis Garcia Villagran, a well-known human rights defender of immigrants and organizer of the caravan.

Villagran, who has been vocal in criticizing the Mexican government’s anti-immigrant stance, was detained by local police on Aug. 5 in Tapachula after announcing the caravan's formation.

Human rights groups and migrant advocacy organizations have condemned his arrest as part of a persistent pattern of criminalization against those who defend migrants and asylum seekers in Mexico.

“Civil society organizations, collectives and human rights defenders express our concern over a pattern of criminalization against those who defend and support migrants, as part of the growing crackdown on immigration worldwide,” said a joint statement by several civil organizations in response to Villagran’s arrest.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/08/07/thumbs_b_c_ae6e9f1e5fd6d7299f8e5bdc92077c2f.jpg?v=080609,N,,2025-08-07 04:56:57.531553

The department said in a news release that it would waive age limits for new applicants so “even more patriots will qualify to join ICE,” the agency responsible for finding, arresting, detaining and removing people who are in the U.S. illegally.

The agency is at the center of the Trump administration’s efforts to carry out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. Earlier this summer Congress passed a spending bill that gives ICE money to hire 10,000 more staff.

Currently, ICE applicants must be 21 years old and no older than 37 or 40, depending on what position they are applying for.

In an interview with Fox & Friends, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said applicants could be as young as 18.

“We no longer have a cap on how old you can be or you can continue at age 18, sign up for ICE and join us and be a part of it. We’ll get you trained and ready to be equipped to go out on the streets and help protect families,” Noem said.

The department said all recruits would have to go through medical and drug screening and complete a physical fitness test.

The agency promoted the age-limit changes on social media with enthusiastic tones, casting the immigration-enforcement efforts as not only patriotic but also epic and even cinematic.

One post was accompanied by an image that looked like a recruiting poster showing images of a young man and an older man, both wearing military style tactical gear and holding weapons with the words “NO AGE CAP JOIN ICE NOW” emblazoned on the bottom. “We’re taking father/son bonding to a whole new level,” it said.

Another showed an advertisement for a Ford Club Wagon — a large van once popular for how many people it could carry — with the words: “Think about how many criminal illegal aliens you could fit in this bad boy?”

Written at the bottom of the image was the words “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” Absolute boys is a slang term used to praise someone.

ICE earlier announced a recruiting campaign aimed at finding and hiring the deportation officers, investigators and lawyers it will need to meet its hiring goals.

As part of that campaign the agency is offering an eye-catching bonus of up to $50,000 for new recruits as well as other benefits like student loan forgiveness and abundant overtime for deportation officers.

Until the laws are followed, environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe said U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams should issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction. The suit claims the project threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars’ worth of environmental restoration.

The lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County.

A second lawsuit brought by civil rights groups says detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated since they are barred from meeting lawyers, are being held without any charges, and a federal immigration court has canceled bond hearings. A hearing in that case is scheduled for Aug. 18.

The detention facility has ignored a review process required by the National Environmental Policy Act, and the lawsuit was meant to assert the public’s rights to make sure environmental harm does not occur, Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, testified in court Wednesday. Samples noted that her organization was founded in 1969 by environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas in response to a failed effort to build a massive airport in the same location.

An attorney for the state of Florida questioned Samples during cross examination about whether Friends of the Everglades had filed any lawsuits or taken legal action against the airport or its owner, Miami-Dade County, over the past decade. She acknowledged they had not.

“Victories are sometimes imperfect,” she said.

When the attorney asked Samples if she agreed with the political decision to detain and deport immigrants, the judge shut down the question, saying the trial would be limited to environmental issues.

Under the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center’s construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe.

It makes no difference that the detention center holding hundreds of detainees was built by the state of Florida since federal agencies have authority over immigration, the suit said.

“The construction of a detention center is an action that is necessarily subject to federal control and responsibility,” they said in a recent court filing. “The State of Florida has no authority or jurisdiction to enforce federal immigration law.”

Attorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Judge Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district, they said.

Williams had yet to rule on that argument.

The lawsuits were being heard as Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ′ administration apparently was preparing to build a second immigration detention center at a Florida National Guard training center in north Florida. At least one contract has been awarded for what’s labeled in state records as the “North Detention Facility.”

As a DACA recipient, Bautista Martinez is authorized to work in the U.S. and possesses a Social Security number.

MALDEF (Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund) filed the lawsuit on behalf of Luis Saul Bautista Martinez, 29, of Los Angeles, a DACA recipient, and other immigrants who comprise the settlement class.

“Demonization of immigrants in the rhetoric of irresponsible national leaders does not justify unlawful discrimination in any area of the economy,” said Thomas A. Saenz, MALDEF president and general counsel. “The resolution of this case approved today should help to lead others engaged in discriminatory practices to cease that activity.”

As part of the agreement, preliminarily approved today, NuVision has agreed to create a settlement fund of $108,800 to compensate the class of immigrants affected by the challenged practice. NuVision has also ended the use of the challenged practice. The settlement is one of more than a dozen MALDEF has reached with financial institutions that deny services to DACA recipients and other immigrants because of their immigration status rather than their creditworthiness.

The settlement provides for $3,200 payments for each of the 34 class members. All class members are residents of California. NuVision must also pay attorneys’ fees and other costs.

“The court’s preliminary settlement approval represents a crucial step towards compensating class members and recognizing their harm,” said MALDEF attorney Luis Lozada. “Importantly, financial institutions are starting to promptly change their policies and practices, as well as resolve any lingering problems with us.”

In April 2023, Bautista Martinez applied for an auto loan from NuVision, based in Huntington Beach, California. According to the lawsuit, NuVision denied Bautista Martinez a $35,000 auto loan after giving initial approval to his application because he is not a permanent resident of the United States. As a DACA recipient, Bautista Martinez is authorized to work in the U.S. and possesses a Social Security number.

“This preliminary approval is a meaningful step toward justice, not just for me but for many others facing the same barriers,” said Bautista Martinez. “It reinforces that what happened was wrong and that financial institutions must be held accountable when they discriminate. I spoke up because I knew it wasn’t just about me, and I hope this shows others that no one should accept being denied what they’ve earned.”

The suit challenged NuVision’s denial of a loan to Bautista Martinez as a violation of Section 1981 of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, immigration status, age, and other characteristics.

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, Western Division.

NuVision is a federally insured, member-owned credit union serving 160,000 members in Alaska, Arizona, California, Washington, and Wyoming with $3.3 billion in assets.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, immigration agents would separate families at the southern border as they crossed into the United States.
Now, with illegal crossings notably low, the Trump administration is focusing on immigrants who are in the United States and have been ordered to leave.
That means officials are under pressure to deport families quickly, or the United States would have to spend money and resources to track them.
For the families who are still in the United States — like Evgeny, Evgeniia, Mr. Snegir and their children — the path ahead is uncertain.","Evgeny and Evgeniia faced an excruciating choice.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers told the couple they could leave the United States with their child and return to their native Russia, which they had fled seeking political asylum. Or they could remain in immigration detention in the United States — but their 8-year-old son, Maksim, would be taken away and sent to a shelter for unaccompanied children.

In the end, they chose the agony of limbo in the United States over a return to a place where they saw no prospect for freedom or any future for their family.

“Interior separation is approved,” ICE officials concluded in writing after the couple insisted they could not return to Russia. The last time Evgeny and Evgeniia saw Maksim was on May 15, in a room at Kennedy International Airport in New York City, as ICE agents led them back to detention in New Jersey.

“A few days, right?” Maksim begged his parents that day. “A few days?”

The couple, who asked to be identified only by their first names out of fear for their family back in Russia, said they tried to keep their son calm. Maksim pleaded with his father, who told the boy what he wanted to hear. “I said, ‘Yes, yes, it will be just a few days,’” Evgeny said, recounting the moment in an interview.

Their case is an example of a little-known tactic the Trump administration is using to pressure undocumented immigrants to leave the United States. Officials have begun separating children from their families in small numbers across the country, in what appears to be a more targeted version of one of the most explosive policies of President Trump’s first term.

The New York Times has uncovered at least nine cases in which parents have been separated from their children after they refused to comply with deportation orders, according to internal government documents, case files and interviews.

The practice is not as widespread as the “zero tolerance” policy of Mr. Trump’s first term, when thousands of children were systematically taken from their parents as they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and sent to shelters and foster homes.

But the new cases suggest that the administration has decided to use family separation as a tool, at least in some instances, to persuade families to leave and to create a powerful deterrent for those who might come to the United States illegally.

“The parents had the right and the ability to depart the country as a family and willfully choose to not comply,” she said.

She denied that there was any new policy on family separations.

Previous administrations separated undocumented families for reasons including national security concerns, public safety and child endangerment. But Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former ICE official who has served in Republican and Democratic administrations, said that previous administrations, to her knowledge, did not use the threat of family separation as leverage to get people to leave the country.

“I’m not aware of ICE previously using family separation as a consequence for failure to comply” with deportation orders, Ms. Trickler-McNulty said.

Instead, she said, past administrations typically would have released such families into the United States with ankle monitors to track them as they awaited court dates, a practice that has contributed to enormous backlogs in the immigration system.

The notion of choice touches on a key difference between the separations from the first Trump administration and now.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, immigration agents would separate families at the southern border as they crossed into the United States. Adults were criminally charged with illegally entering the country and imprisoned, while their children — some of them babies, just months old — were taken away.

The family separation policy was enormously divisive. Wrenching images of children being pried from the arms of their parents stirred global outrage, but administration officials argued privately that was the whole point — the policy was meant to deter people from making a dangerous and illegal journey.

Mr. Trump ultimately relented to pressure and ended the policy in 2018. The Biden administration later agreed to a settlement that blocked family separations at the border, with some exceptions, including if children were in danger.

Now, with illegal crossings notably low, the Trump administration is focusing on immigrants who are in the United States and have been ordered to leave.

The Trump administration insists that it is simply enforcing the law. Mr. Trump has made aggressive enforcement a key part of his deportation campaign and says the American people elected him in part to get tough on immigration.

“To be clear, refusing a judge’s deportation order is a crime,” Ms. McLaughlin said. “If law enforcement pulled an American citizen over with kids in the back seat and they chose to not comply with lawful orders, the parents would be arrested, and the children would be placed in safe custody.”

Still, deporting families has always been a struggle for presidential administrations, Republican and Democratic alike. Children, for the most part, cannot by law remain in federal custody for more than three weeks. That means officials are under pressure to deport families quickly, or the United States would have to spend money and resources to track them.

At that point, the deportation challenge only grows. ICE agents would have the difficult task of arresting people with established ties to communities, who had been working or going to school and building lives in the United States.

During the Biden administration, officials considered various ideas, including arresting one parent or fining families who refused to comply with deportation orders, although they never put those policies in place, a former U.S. official said.

Evgeniia, speaking through an interpreter from ICE detention, said her family traveled to the Mexican border in hopes of getting an appointment under a Biden-era program that allowed people to enter the United States at a port of entry after registering with a government app. Mr. Trump canceled that program on Jan. 20, so she and her husband decided that driving to a port of entry and asking for asylum was the only way to reach safety.

They were immediately put into detention.

The American Civil Liberties Union is investigating the legality of the separations, said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the group.

“That the Trump administration has found a new form of family separation is hardly surprising given they have yet to acknowledge the horrific harm caused by the original policy and are now blatantly breaching provisions of the settlement designed to provide relief to those abused families, many of whom to this day still remain separated,” he said.

The court settlement banning separations specifically referred to the practice at the southern border. Now, however, the separations are not happening at the border — they are happening inside the country, so there may be legal wiggle room.

In at least one of the cases, ICE officials wrote that the separation fell outside the scope of the settlement, saying there were no “implication/requirements” when it comes to the court case.

Ms. McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said immigrants were taking advantage of the system and in some cases creating a public disturbance.

“We have seen recently illegal alien families have started to use a tactic where they refuse to board a commercial flight, often lashing out and posing a threat to the safety of their own children,” she said. As a result, Ms. McLaughlin added, the authorities “must ensure the children are safe and not in harm’s way until the family can soon be removed from the country.”

Regarding the case of Evgeny and Evgeniia specifically, Ms. McLaughlin said the couple “were acting so disruptive and aggressive they endangered the child’s well-being.”

The couple denied those allegations, and there was no mention of such a disturbance in the internal case file describing the separation, which was obtained by The Times. The file says that “since there is no other option to enforce the removal order in a safe manner as a family unit, interior separation is approved.”

A separate document, a referral of Maksim’s case to the agency that oversees custody of unaccompanied migrant children, said, “Subject was separated from his family on 5/15/2025 due to his parent’s refusal to board an aircraft for removal from the United States in violation of US law.”

Evgeny said he was trying to save his son from a longer separation in Russia because of what he believed to be a sure prison sentence there.

“I was explaining to them, to the officers, that our lives are in danger and our livelihood would be in danger,” he said. “And at some point, I kind of lost my bearings and started to cry.”

“I was explaining that I could not be deported, because I will face grave danger in Russia,” he said.

The couple had crossed the border with another Russian family, Pavel Snegir and his 11-year-old son, Aleksandr. They, too, were hoping for political asylum in the United States after Mr. Snegir’s wife was locked up in Russia for her political views, he said.

But after several weeks in border custody together, Mr. Snegir and his son were transferred to ICE custody in May and taken to an airport in San Diego. There, he was told he could take Aleksandr to New York City for a court hearing.

But once they got to the airport, Mr. Snegir refused to board the plane, having become convinced that he would be deported to Russia once he got to New York. Later that day, after the flight had left, an ICE official told him he would be separated from his son because he refused to be deported.

“I’m not giving my son away,” Mr. Snegir said, moving to shield Aleksandr.

The ICE official, Mr. Snegir recalled, told him that he would be taken to the ground, handcuffed and taken away if he did not relent.

“I did not move. I did not agree to do what she was asking, and everything she promised happened,” he said of the ICE official.

Aleksandr, who had witnessed his mother being arrested in Russia, appeared to be in shock, Mr. Snegir recalled: “He was asking why.”

After several weeks of separation, Mr. Snegir was visited by an ICE official who offered him another option: Go with your son, or we will deport you by yourself and you might not see him again.

This time, Mr. Snegir agreed to go back to Russia with his son.

But in a twist, the next day it emerged that Mr. Snegir had passed a protection screening for his claim of fearing torture in Russia. That means he can still be deported — just not to Russia.

For now, ICE is trying to deport him to a third country, but none have agreed to take him yet, according to internal agency documents. Until then, the two are being held separately, the father in ICE detention and the son in a shelter for unaccompanied children.

As it turns out, Evgeny and Evgeniia also passed their protection screening, which means the United States has determined that they, too, cannot be deported to Russia.

But as they wait for the next step, they remain in ICE detention. And Maksim is now in a foster home.

“It’s terrible, that’s what I can say,” Evgeniia said. “I wouldn’t wish it even to an enemy. It’s a constant grief and longing.”

She is allowed to speak on the telephone to her son, but she has no real answers to the first question he asks her: “Mama, when are you going to take me out of here?”

But for some parents, the danger is too great.

An Indian couple who were separated from their three children after they refused to board a commercial flight decided, in the end, to go back to India without the children, according to internal ICE records and their lawyer.

The couple asked not to be identified, but their case records showed that the first attempt to deport the family as a group had failed. The family unit, or FAMU, “refused to board the removal flight (commercial).”

The record went on to state that the family’s failure to comply with deportation orders was “a clear violation of law and hindrance to execute the removal order.”

“This is an interior enforcement separation,” it continued.

After several weeks, the couple were deported to India. In response to a request for comment, an ICE official said the agency was working to send the children back, too.

For the families who are still in the United States — like Evgeny, Evgeniia, Mr. Snegir and their children — the path ahead is uncertain.

But inside her ICE detention facility, Evgeniia tries to think of a hopeful future.

“I’m imagining how I will hug him when we meet again,” she said of Maksim. “I even saved a couple of candies, because that’s what I was planning to give to him when I see him again. That’s what I imagine.”

Luz Rivas took her oath of office in January, she didn’t anticipate that the most devastating fires in Los Angeles history would ignite that same week.

Luz Rivas took her oath of office in January, she didn’t anticipate that the most devastating fires in Los Angeles history would ignite that same week. She knew, however, that the move from the California State Legislature to Washington – with an unpredictable president and Republican congressional majority – would test her prowess as an elected official.

Just over six months into her first year as a congresswoman, Rivas has already faced a direct attack on her community, with the increase of federal immigration raids that began in June targeting her district and other Latino communities across the Southland.

“I feel like it’s been six years,” Rivas said.

“It is challenging to be a new member of Congress during this time,” she continued. “But that’s our job – to protect and defend our communities.”

Rivas said she is “all in” on defending the San Fernando Valley community and becomes more motivated every time she is back at home in her district.

On Monday, Rivas visited the City of San Fernando City Council to speak directly with councilmembers and constituents about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and what her office is doing to combat President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy.

“It’s important for elected officials on all levels of government to stand together against the threat that ICE poses to our communities,” Rivas told the San Fernando Valley Sun/el Sol in an exclusive interview.

She noted that her office is partnering with local organizations, distributing “Know Your Rights” information, connecting constituents to legal aid and can help locate missing loved ones by calling federal facilities on behalf of residents who reach out to them for help.

Although witnesses have documented masked federal agents indiscriminately kidnapping people off the street and disregarding the rule of law, Rivas believes it’s still important for our communities to be informed of the rights available to them.

“If you don’t know that your rights have been violated, how do you know whether you can complain or file a lawsuit?” Rivas pointed out. “Someone should know if their rights were not respected. Like me – I knew that [my rights were violated] when they didn’t let me into the detention center.”

The day after federal immigration officials’ first show of mass force in LA, conducting multiple raids across the county, Rivas joined three fellow members of Congress in downtown LA at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building to exercise their right as elected officials to conduct an oversight visit of the federal detention center. The congressmen were checking on the conditions of detainees after reports surfaced of immigrants being held with limited legal access and restricted access to food, water and medicine.

They were illegally denied entry for a tour and blocked by U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE personnel.

“My colleagues and I have been trying to get information regarding their operations and decision-making process before, during or after ICE raids occur,” said Rivas. “We will continue asking these questions and demanding answers.”

Rivas has also visited the Adelanto Detention Facility and has since joined colleagues in writing letters to DHS and ICE to demand accountability.

Rivas Calls for an In-Person Meeting with Immigration Authorities

Most recently, Aug. 4, Rivas drafted a letter to Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, and Rodney S. Scott, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), requesting an in-person meeting to “conduct direct and constructive oversight to ensure accountability and transparency into the recent raids that have taken place in Los Angeles.”

“ICE has used intimidation tactics that have sown fear and chaos in communities,” wrote Rivas. “This sharp uptick in arrests and detainments by agents who are masked and in unmarked vehicles has not only instilled fear in communities, it has also not met the stated goal of this administration to target the ‘worst of the worst.’”

According to ICE detention data as of July 27, approximately 71% of those detained have no criminal conviction, and many of those convicted have committed only minor offenses, including traffic violations.

In the letter, Rivas questions how and who is conducting the often violent operations, since agents refuse to identify themselves with visible labels or identification.

“Without the ability to properly identify agents involved, there is no way to adequately file detailed complaints or requests for investigation. In addition, the lack of transparency is leading to confusion and misinformation about the use of ‘bounty hunters’ to conduct these raids,” Rivas continued.

The congresswoman highlighted multiple incidents in the district, including inappropriate use of force by CBP agents during a raid in Pacoima, and individuals complying with government orders at the Van Nuys Courthouse having their cases dismissed and being turned over to ICE.

“As an elected official not just representing the hard-working immigrant communities of the San Fernando Valley, but as someone who grew up here, I seek transparency and accountability from all federal agencies,” she concluded.

The Push for Legislation

Lawsuits against the Trump administration have made some progress in protecting immigrants and citizens alike from being targeted and racially profiled by federal agents. Last Friday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the federal government’s appeal, upholding an LA district judge’s ruling granting temporary restraining orders (TRO) that prevent the government from stopping individuals in violation of the Fourth Amendment and require the government to provide detained individuals with access to counsel.

“It’s a good step forward. I think it gave constituents or residents of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County hope that this could end,” said Rivas about the ruling. “But we need to keep our foot on the gas pedal.”

The Trump administration is expected to eventually appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the majority of the justices were appointed by Republican presidents. If the case is overruled, the onus would once again fall on Congress to create protective legislation.

Rivas noted that she has signed off on seven bills aimed at curbing ICE’s power and holding the administration accountable. These include the No Secret Police Act, which would require ICE, DHS and CBP agents to display proper identification and would ban the use of face coverings; the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, which would prevent federal agents from showing up at sensitive locations like schools, hospitals and churches; and the Born in the USA Act, which would prohibit any funds from being used to implement Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship.

The congresswoman has also cosponsored a bill, the American Dream and Promise Act, that aims to build pathways to citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients.

It’s been almost 40 years – with both Democrat and Republican led legislatures – since the last comprehensive piece of legislation for immigration reform was passed.

Being the minority party in Congress, Rivas acknowledged that passing these laws can be more difficult than when she was a State Assemblywoman working with a supermajority in the state legislature.

“The mission stays the same. The issues and priorities I have are the same as I had as a state legislator,” she reassured. “It’s just going to take longer to achieve them and work towards them in Congress.”

Rivas said she is learning from and collaborating with her colleagues, and is determined to keep fighting for the Latino communities in the San Fernando Valley.

“It’s obvious that these agents are our racial profiling in our communities, and that’s one of the biggest reasons that I’m involved – because it’s directly affecting the 29th district,” said Rivas.

Constituents who are legal permanent residents and even U.S. citizens born in this country have expressed concern to the congresswoman – afraid that if they are not carrying proof of their legal status or a birth certificate, they too will be unjustly detained simply because of the color of their skin or the language they speak.

“We can’t let Trump define who an American is,” Rivas said.",https://i0.wp.com/sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_04567_Page_2-e1754535598593.jpg?fit=1613%2C1095&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-07 02:56:47.176926

The Justice Department has been suing states to end tuition breaks for students without legal residency, starting with Texas in June. It has also filed lawsuits in Kentucky, Minnesota and, most recently, Oklahoma. Last year, Florida ended its tuition break for students living there illegally,

“Federal law prohibits aliens not lawfully present in the United States from getting in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state U.S. citizens,” the Justice Department argued in a lawsuit this month in Oklahoma. “There are no exceptions.”

The tuition breaks once enjoyed wide bipartisan support but have increasingly come under criticism from Republicans in recent years.

Here's what to know about the tuition breaks:

Texas' tuition policy was initially passed with sweeping bipartisan majorities in the Legislature and signed into law by then-Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, as a way to open access to higher education for students without legal residency already living in the state. Supporters then and now say it boosted the state’s economy by creating a better-educated and better-prepared workforce.

The law allowed students without legal resident status to qualify for in-state tuition if they had lived in Texas for three years before graduating from high school and for a year before enrolling in college. They also had to sign an affidavit promising to apply for legal resident status as soon as possible.

Texas now has about 57,000 qualifying students enrolled in its public universities and colleges, according to the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a nonpartisan nonprofit group of university leaders focused on immigration policy. The state has about 690,000 students overall at its public universities.

The difference in tuition rates is substantial.

For example, at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, a 34,000-student campus along the border with Mexico, a state resident will pay about $10,000 in basic tuition for a minimum full-time class schedule in the upcoming school year. A nonresident student will pay $19,000.

Texas' law stood mostly unchallenged for years, but it came under fire as debates over illegal immigration intensified. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, Perry apologized after saying critics of the law “did not have a heart.”

The law withstood several repeal efforts in the Republican-dominated Legislature. During the legislative session that ended June 2, a repeal bill did not even get a vote.

But the ax fell quickly. After the Trump administration filed a lawsuit calling the law unconstitutional, state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a key Trump ally, chose not to defend the law in court and instead filed a motion agreeing that it should not be enforced.

In Oklahoma, Attorney General Gentner Drummond, also a Republican, filed a similar motion.

“Rewarding foreign nationals who are in our country illegally with lower tuition costs that are not made available to out-of-state American citizens is not only wrong — it is discriminatory and unlawful,"" Drummond said in a statement.

At least 21 states and the University of Michigan system have laws or policies allowing tuition breaks for the immigrant students, according to the National Immigration Law Center, which favors them. Those states include Democratic-leaning ones such as California and New York, but also GOP-leaning ones such as Kansas and Nebraska.

According to the center, at least 16 states allow the immigrant students to receive scholarships or other aid to go to college.

Obama calls GOP redistricting plans in Texas a 'power grab'

Former President Barack Obama criticized the GOP's congressional redistricting plans in Texas on social media this evening, saying the proposed revisions would undercut democracy.

""We can’t lose focus on what matters — right now, Republicans in Texas are trying to gerrymander district lines to unfairly win five seats in next year’s midterm elections."" Obama wrote on X. ""This is a power grab that undermines our democracy.""

Texas Democrats left the state to delay votes on the plans, which would almost certainly give the GOP five more House seats in Congress. Their departure has outraged Republicans, with Gov. Greg Abbott suing to remove Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu from office.

Rhode Island lawmakers grilled about Gaza during town hall

and

Rep. Seth Magaziner and Sen. Jack Reed — two Democratic lawmakers from Rhode Island — have been interrupted numerous times at a joint town hall in Johnston by people asking about Israel's war in Gaza.

Several people have asked them to take tougher stances against Israel and to call the loss of life in Gaza a “genocide” and for them to stop taking money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

Reed called the conflict “complicated,” which elicited an audible laugh from an audience member who yelled in response that it wasn’t.

Magaziner called the scenes in Gaza “horrific,” adding later that neither he nor Reed had “anything kind to say about” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Sen. Michael Bennet tells town hall he’s 'incredibly angry' at Democratic Party for losing 2024 election to Trump

and

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told a supportive crowd at a town hall today that he is “incredibly angry” at his party for losing last year's presidential election to Trump.

“We should never have lost this election,"" Bennet said at the event in Durango, part of the congressional district represented by GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd.

Bennet, who is running for governor, said that the election loss has been ""catastrophic"" and that the party was unprepared last year when it came to its policy platform.

""You tell me what the Democrats’ education policy was in the last election. You tell me what the Democrats’ health care policy was. You tell me if Democrats had an immigration policy that made any sense,"" Bennet said.

Bennet added that he is ""not here to blame them for that, but that’s part of what we have to figure out, as well.""

Responding to a question about Medicaid cuts by the Trump administration, Bennet said he would fight “to the death” for protections, adding that Democrats should message on the consequences of cuts to health care programs.

“People need to know what these Medicaid cuts are doing to our community. They have to know the unfairness of the tax bill that Donald Trump just pushed through, the cult of personality that he has in the U.S. Senate and other places. And we have to carry that message forward,” he said.

An attendee said Colorado “needs” Bennet in the Senate and shared her concerns about finding “someone equally competent” to replace him should he become governor.

“This decision was, for me, a matter of conscience. This was a moral decision,” Bennet said.

“This is not about quitting. It’s not about being worn out. It’s not about giving up. It’s not about even not wanting to spend one more day in the Senate with Ted Cruz, even though I don’t honestly want to do that,” he continued as the audience laughed. “It’s about being in the fight that you want to be in and making sure we can win that together.”

Texas governor sues to remove Texas House Democratic Caucus chair

Gov. Greg Abbott filed an emergency petition today with the Texas Supreme Court to remove state Rep. Gene Wu from office after Wu and other Democrats left the state to delay efforts by Republicans to redraw congressional district lines.

The lawsuit argues that Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus chair, violated the state Constitution and that his absence amounted to his abandonment of office.

Wu did not immediately respond to a request for comment this evening.

Abbott said in a statement that Wu and more than 50 other Democrats who left the state had failed to meet quorum requirements in refusing to return.

""Representative Wu and the other Texas House Democrats have shown a willful refusal to return, and their absence for an indefinite period of time deprives the House of the quorum needed to meet and conduct business on behalf of Texans,” Abbott said. “Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences.”

Abbott had warned in a statement Sunday that he would seek Democrats' removal if they weren't present when the House convened the next day.

Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin urges fellow Democrats to ‘go nuclear’ in redistricting fight

and

Reporting from Benton Harbor, Mich.

Sen. Elissa Slotkin, a rising Democratic star from Michigan, told NBC News that Democrats should “go nuclear” to counter Republicans’ push in Texas and other red states to redraw congressional maps in their favor.

Slotkin, a first-term senator who was chosen to deliver the Democratic rebuttal to Trump’s joint address to Congress this year, said Democrats have to fight fire with fire.

“I’m going to urge and encourage blue states like a California or Chicago or Illinois to do the same thing. I don’t want to do that. I want the country to have a completely nonpartisan drawing of the lines based on the census. But if they’re going to do that and go nuclear, so am I,” she said in an interview after her first and only town hall of the August congressional recess last night.

Trump says FBI 'may have to' get involved in locating and arresting Texas Democrats who left state

Trump said federal authorities ""may have to"" get involved in locating and arresting Texas Democrats who absconded from the state to block Republicans from moving forward with mid-decade redistricting plans.

Asked by a reporter today whether the federal government and the FBI should get involved in locating and arresting the more than 50 Democratic lawmakers, Trump said, ""Well, they may have to, they may have to.""

“A lot of people have demanded they come back. You can’t just sit it out. You have to go back. You have to fight it out. That’s what elections are all about,"" he added.

Yesterday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state’s Department of Public Safety to arrest Texas Democrats who left the state after the Texas House voted to compel the sergeant-at-arms to “send for” the return of the lawmakers “under warrant of arrest, if necessary.”

Government agencies get access to AI from Anthropic, Google and OpenAI

The General Services Administration announced a partnership today with three artificial intelligence companies — Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT — that will allow federal agencies to use AI tools across the federal government.

“Thanks to the amazing work of the Federal Acquisition Services team, these transformative AI projects are available for agencies to procure immediately,” Federal Acquisition Services Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum said.

The uses of AI technology will vary. The AI tools can support a wide variety of applications, from back-office automation to critical mission functions, such as real-time translation, cybersecurity support and large-scale data analysis, a GSA spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said GSA adopted the technology first, claiming that the use of AI has saved more than 365,000 staff hours this year. The hope is that when it spread among the federal government — and when the workforce becomes more proficient and the AI technology improves — the time savings will allow more efficiency and innovation across the government.

On concerns about Americans’ data, the GSA spokesperson insisted the government is taking a cautious, security-first approach to AI that will ensure sensitive information remains protected but did not provide specifics.

GSA’s hope, according to the spokesperson, is that it will immediately translate to agencies, giving them access to tools that can improve workflow and citizen services — and for the AI companies, going through GSA gives them an entry point for offering services and products to the federal government.

Massachusetts governor hosts fleeing Texas Democrats but rules out mid-decade redistricting in her state

Reporting from Boston

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey this afternoon hosted nine Texas Democratic legislators who’d come to Bostonafter they left theirhome state amid Republican redistricting efforts.

Healey, a Democrat, offered her support to the Texas lawmakers but also ruled out pushing for redistricting in Massachusetts.

At a news conference in the Massachusetts state House, Healey, flanked by two Texas representatives and eight senators, called Texas Republicans’ efforts to push ahead with mid-decade redistricting a “partisan, craven, political power-grab attempt” by Trump, Gov. Greg Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton. She added that the GOP move was meant to “further an agenda that’s about protecting them and their power.”

Healey offered her “support” to the lawmakers who left Texas, though she ruled out helping fund the fines they’ll incur as a result of abandoning the in-session Legislature.

And unlike her Democratic counterparts in New York and California — Govs. Kathy Hochul and Gavin Newsom, respectively, who've said they’d move forward with efforts that would allow their blue states to possibly also conduct mid-decade redistricting — Healey said she’d let Massachusetts’ existing congressional maps stand.

“We’re going to follow the rules. We just went through a customary and orderly process just a few years age,” she said.

Massachusetts, following the process that is typical in most states, redrew its congressional maps in 2021, after the 2020 census. The redistricting process in most states occurs at the start of each new decade, when new census data is available.

“We just did that,” Healey said. “The Massachusetts maps, in my view, are fair. They were drawn after a robust process and signed into law by a Republican — Gov. Charlie Baker.”

Meanwhile, Texas state Rep. Ana Hernandez, who, like her House colleagues, has been threatened by Texas Republicans with arrest and expulsion, told reporters that when it came to those threats, “that is not what we’re concerned about.”

“When we left, it was to make sure that our constituents have a voice, because that’s what this process is doing, it’s silencing our constituents,” she said.

Trump says for now JD Vance is 'most likely' successor of MAGA movement

Trump said this afternoon that Vice President JD Vance would ""probably be favored at this point"" to take up the helm of the MAGA movement when he concludes his second term in office.

The comment came in response to a reporter's question to Trump about whether he views Vance as the ""heir apparent.""

""Well, I think most likely, in all fairness, he's the vice president. I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,"" Trump said, referring to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

""It's too early, obviously to talk about it, but certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favored at this point,"" Trump added.

The president's remarks came after he signed an Olympics-related executive order at the White House.

State Department announces program requiring some foreign visitors to pay bonds of up to $15,000

Reporting from Washington

The State Department is set to launch a new pilot program later this month that will require foreign visitors planning travel to the U.S. from certain countries to post bonds of up to $15,000, according to a temporary final rule published in the Federal Register today.

The program, scheduled to begin Aug. 20 and last until Aug. 5, 2026, will specifically apply to people in certain foreign countries applying for B-1 or B-2 visas for business or tourist travel to the United States. Each of those visas allows for a maximum stay of six months, though extensions are permitted in some cases.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has another White House meeting with Trump

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she met with Trump today at the White House.

It was the Democratic governor's third meeting with the president there this year — and fourth overall when counting their appearance at an April event to announce a new mission for a Michigan air base.

In a statement provided to NBC News, Whitmer said she told Trump “and his team about the impact tariffs are having on Michigan’s economy, especially our auto industry, the harm Michigan will face due to changes in the Medicaid program, and ongoing recovery efforts following the ice storm in Northern Michigan this year.”

Whitmer, seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, has faced criticism from other Democrats for cultivating a closer working relationship with Trump. And she caught grief after a New York Times photographer captured an image of her shielding her face with folders while visiting the Oval Office in April.

Whitmer and her allies have pointed to what they see as tangible wins from her visits, including the new mission for the Selfridge Air National Guard Base and a commitment to combating invasive carp in the Great Lakes.

“I’ve always said that I’ll work with anyone to get things done for Michigan,” Whitmer said in today’s statement. “That’s why I’ve continued to go to Washington, D.C. to make sure that Michiganders are front and center when critical decisions are being made.”

She added: “I will always do whatever I can to make life a little easier for Michiganders and strengthen our economy. We should do everything in our power to lower costs and grow more good-paying jobs in Michigan. I appreciate the president’s time and attention to the matters we discussed.”

Ghislaine Maxwell’s transfer to cushy prison camp is a ‘travesty of justice,’ ex-BOP official says

Not long after it was first reported that Ghislaine Maxwell was moved to one of the cushiest federal detention facilities in the country, a private Facebook group dedicated to current and former federal prison staffers erupted in shock and outrage.

The federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, is one of seven minimum security, dormitory-style federal security facilities that do not typically hold inmates like Maxwell, 63, who are convicted of sex crimes and serving lengthy sentences.

“As a retired BOP employee, this makes me sick,” wrote one person on the “Bureau of Prisons staff and retirees” Facebook page.

“Since when are sex offenders allowed at the camp?” another wrote. “I don’t care who she snitched on, she’s a damn human trafficker.”

Trump admin ends '5 things' email requirement for federal workers

The Trump administration is officially ending the Elon Musk-led “5 Things” program, which required federal employees to send five bullet points of their work accomplishments to HR each week.

“We communicated with agency HR leads that OPM was no longer going to manage the five things process nor utilize it internally,"" U.S. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said in a statement to NBC News. ""At OPM, we believe that managers are accountable to staying informed about what their team members are working on and have many other existing tools to do so.”

Since its inception in February, agencies have exercised discretion as to whether and how their employees should comply with the requirement, with many phasing it out entirely.

Texas state House still lacks quorum amid redistricting clash

Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows quickly gaveled the state House in and out of session today, lacking the minimum number of state lawmakers to move on to regular business after dozens of Democrats fled the state in protest of a GOP-led bill that would redraw congressional boundaries to benefit Republicans.

Addressing the 94 members who attended today's session, shy of the 100 needed for a quorum, Burrows criticized Democrats and accused them of shirking their responsibilities in the wake of terrible floods that killed more than 100 people outside of San Antonio earlier this summer.

""Today, the disaster preparedness committee is meeting to consider five priority pieces of legislation. Each will address the catastrophic flooding that has devastated homes and entire communities,"" he said. ""That's the kind of important work that's being done in the House and all elected members should be here representing their districts in those conversations.”

Democrats have argued that the GOP's focus on redistricting over flood response in the early days of the special session undercuts Burrows' argument.

Democratic legislators in 3 states unveil bills banning use of face masks by ICE agents

Reporting from Boston, Mass.

A group of Democratic state legislators across three states unveiled a series of bills today that would ban the use of face coverings by law enforcement officers — an attempt to curtail the much-criticized use of such items by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

As part of Trump’s promises to deport undocumented immigrants, ICE officers have ramped up their presence in cities and towns across the U.S., conducting an expanded number of raids and enforcement actions — and increasingly doing so while wearing face masks that shield their identities.

The bills from Democratic state lawmakers in New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania would ban the use of such coverings. Enforcement of the laws, if enacted, would be overseen by the attorneys general in those states.

“The biggest problem is with ICE federal agents who are appearing as if they are masked militia,” New York Democratic state Sen. Pat Fahy, who’s sponsored the bill in her state, said at a news conference on the sidelines of the National Conference of State Legislatures’ annual summit in Boston. “We think a dangerous line is being crossed here, and that immigration enforcement is really turning into more of a paramilitary type secret police,” she added.

Massachusetts state Rep. Jim Hawkins, who sponsored the bill in his state, said his proposal “is a step towards mending the divide and fostering trust between law enforcement and the public with transparency identification and reason.”

“There should be no need for disguises while performing their duties to the communities they serve,” he added.

“You don’t see our local police running around masked up,” Pennsylvania state Rep. Paul Friel, who sponsored the bill in his state, said. “You don’t see judges making decisions behind shields, behind the curtain. You don’t see lawmakers making bills anonymously.”

All three lawmakers acknowledged that their proposals have no support from Republicans in their legislatures. That might not be a problem in New York and Massachusetts, where Democrats control both legislative chambers and the governorship. But Pennsylvania’s split state government — the state has a Democratic governor and a GOP-controlled state Senate, while Democrats hold only a one-seat majority in the state House — effectively ensures no movement on the bill.

GAO says that the NIH violated law by withholding funds

The Government Accountability Office said in a report today that the National Institutes of Health ""violated"" the Impoundment Control Act by withholding funds that had been appropriated by Congress.

NBC News reported in May that an analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicated the Trump administration had cut more than $1.8 billion in NIH grants. The legality of the funding cuts is playing out in court.

The GAO, which is the watchdog arm of Congress, emphasized in its 21-page report that the president does not have ""unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation.""

The report said that HHS' resumption of meetings to review grants ""alone does not ensure"" that funds were not being improperly withheld.

""If the executive branch wishes to make changes to the appropriation provided to NIH, it must propose funds for rescission or otherwise propose legislation to make changes to the law for consideration by Congress,"" the report concluded.

Reached for comment, an HHS spokesperson relayed the department’s submitted response to GAO, indicating that the NIH has ""moved rapidly to reschedule and hold meetings impacted by the short pause, and to process grant applications."" The response also pointed to thousands of new grants issued by the NIH, which is housed within HHS.

Greg Abbott threatens to arrest Democrats who left Texas over redistricting

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott threatened to arrest Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to stall a controversial redistricting plan with national implications. The House speaker also issued civil arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers, though these are largely symbolic moves as the warrants can’t be enforced outside the state and lawmakers won’t face civil or criminal charges from the possible arrests. NBC’s Ryan Chandler reports for ""TODAY.""

Pritzker says he would consider a redistricting special session

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said today he would consider calling a special session to reopen his state’s congressional maps.

The state is already one of the most gerrymandered in the country, with Democrats holding 14 of the state’s 17 seats.

When asked if he would consider calling a special session to redraw the state’s map, Pritzker said, “Donald Trump is a cheater, so is Gov. Greg Abbott, and Texas Republicans are carrying out their will.”

“If they’re going to cheat, then all of us have to take a hard look at what the effect of that cheating is on our democracy, and that means we’ve all got to stand up,” he said, adding that “everything’s on the table.”

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who attended the same news conference, told NBC News that his party should use “all tools at their disposal,” noting the possibility that other GOP-controlled states like Ohio and Missouri could try to change their maps, too.

Rwanda says it reaches a deal with U.S. to take in up to 250 migrants

The United States and Rwanda have agreed for the African country to potentially accept hundreds of migrants deported from the U.S., the spokesperson for the Rwandan government and an official told Reuters, as the Trump administration takes a hardline approach toward immigration.

“Rwanda has agreed with the United States to accept up to 250 migrants, in part because nearly every Rwandan family has experienced the hardships of displacement, and our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation,” said the spokesperson for the Rwandan government, Yolande Makolo.

How Trump is reshaping government data

Meteorological data collected by some weather balloons has been halted. Statistics for HIV among transgender people were scrubbed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website. And basic public figures, like how many people work for the federal government, have been frozen or delayed for months.

Across the federal government, Trump has been wielding his influence over data used by researchers, economists and scientists, an effort that was playing out largely behind the scenes until Friday, when he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

GOP lawmaker says Speaker Johnson needs to 'show some leadership' and end redistricting 'chaos'

Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., is calling on Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to ""show some leadership"" and end the redistricting ""chaos"" that is unfolding in several states across the nation.

""The old saying is that voters should choose their representatives; representatives shouldn’t choose their voters,"" Kiley said in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Jansing. ""And I think that what’s happening right now across the country, and especially in California, is a very unhealthy thing for democracy.""

Kiley has introduced legislation in the House to nullify any new redistricting maps adopted by states before the 2030 census.

He argued the latest redistricting efforts in Texas and his home state of California are ""not a good thing for the current members of Congress, it’s not a good thing for voters, it’s not a good thing for either Democrats or Republicans, it’s certainly not a good thing for the country.""

""I think that the speaker and Leader Jeffries need to show some leadership here to bring this chaos to an end,"" he said, referring also to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

The speaker's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Zelenskyy says he had 'a productive conversation' with Trump

and

Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke today, according to Zelenskyy and a White House official.

Zelenskyy said in a post to X that the call was ""productive"" and the two spoke about sanctions against Russia, aid from Europe and defense cooperation with the U.S.

""Of course, we spoke about sanctions against Russia,"" Zelenskyy said in the post. ""Their economy continues to decline, and that’s exactly why Moscow is so sensitive to this prospect and President Trump’s resolve. This can change a lot.We discussed joint European decisions that can help our defense.""

The White House official did not share details on the discussion.

GOP Sen. John Cornyn urges FBI to locate or arrest Democratic legislators who fled Texas

and

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is urging the FBI to assist Texas law enforcement agencies in findingor arresting Democratic legislators who fled the state over the weekend to block a Republican redistricting plan from proceeding.

In a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel today, Cornyn said he wants the FBI to aid in the efforts ""to locate or arrest potential lawbreakers who have fled the state.""

""I request the FBI’s assistance, as federal resources are necessary to locate the out-of-state Texas legislators who are potentially acting in violation of the law,"" Cornyn wrote. ""The FBI has tools to aid state law enforcement when parties cross state lines, including to avoid testifying or fleeing a scene of a crime. Specifically, I am concerned that legislators who solicited or accepted funds to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative duties may be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses.""

Cornyn is running for re-election next year and is facing a GOP primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who called for the arrest of the lawmakers yesterday.

There are no plans to use federal agents to arrest the Democratic lawmakers, a Trump administration official said yesterday. “Gov. Greg Abbott can handle his own state,” the official said.

House committee subpoenas the Clintons and several top former DOJ officials for testimony on Jeffrey Epstein

and

The House committee investigating the Jeffrey Epstein case announced it issued subpoenas today to former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and several top former Justice Department officials for their testimony.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said it had sent out the deposition subpoenas to the Clintons; former Attorneys General Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Bill Barr, Merrick Garland, Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales; and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller “for testimony related to horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein.”

Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., also issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for “records related to” Epstein, a convicted sex offender who was found dead in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

DNC Chair Ken Martin says his party is bringing a 'knife to knife fight'

Reporting from Chicago area

AURORA, Ill. — Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said today that his party is “not rolling over” to Trump as he warned that Texas Republican attempts to go through with emergency redistricting would only spur other states to do the same.

Martin joined Gov. JB Pritzker and a throng of Texas House Democrats who have been taking refuge in the blue Midwestern state since Sunday to break a legislative quorum back home.

He pledged to help Democrats fight attempts by Texas Republicans to redraw the state political map to yield its party potentially up to five more congressional seats, a request that publicly came from the president.

“This is not the Democratic Party of your grandparents, who would bring a pencil to a knife fight,” Martin said. “This is the new Democratic Party that will bring in a knife to a knife fight.”

Democrats have said that if Texas goes through with its plan, they would attempt to take similar steps in California and potentially other states.

Trump says JPMorgan, Bank of America didn't want him as a customer

Trump told CNBC this morning that two of the nation's largest banks closed his bank accounts or rejected him as a customer.

Speaking in a wide-ranging interview, Trump said JPMorgan Chase told him he had to take ""hundreds of millions of dollars in cash"" out within 20 days. Trump then said Bank of America's CEO told him he could not open an account there despite what he characterized as its CEO's kowtowing to him ""when I was president.""

""So I went to another one, another one, another one,"" Trump said.

""The banks discriminated against me very badly, and I was very good to the banks,"" he said.

Bank of America declined to comment on the president's comments, but JPMorgan Chase said in a statement: “We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed. We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right.”

Ex-Russian president warns enemies of ‘new reality’ as Kremlin ditches nuclear treaty

Former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev has warned that the country’s rivals now faced a “new reality” as the Kremlin formally announced it was no longer bound by a treaty limiting the use of short- and medium-range nuclear missiles.

Medvedev, who now serves as the deputy chairman of the country’s Security Council and is known for issuing frequent apocalyptic threats on social media, was continuing a war of words that prompted Trump to redeploy two nuclear submarines last week.

Modi was ready to ‘make India great again,’ then Trump put America first

The U.S. and India’s blossoming friendship is at risk of fracturing, observers have warned, as Trump threatens to substantially increase tariffs on Indian goods over its purchases of Russian oil.

At the start of the year, India seemed to be one of the countries most likely to win Trump’s favor, given its growing role as an Asian counterweight to China and Trump’s close relationship with its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But U.S. relations with India have instead come under strain over trade and other issues. Trump has threatened Apple and other companies that manufacture in India, moved closer to its biggest rival, Pakistan, and mocked India’s “dead” economy.

State Department unveils plan for travelers from certain countries to pay thousands before entering the U.S.

The State Department unveiled plans that will make travelers from certain countries to pay a $5,000 to $15,000 bond in order to visit the U.S.

The one-year program, which targets people from countries with “high visa overstay rates” and other factors, aims to prevent people from overstaying visas, according to the documented published today in the Federal Register.

Travelers would have the funds returned if they leave the U.S. on time and comply with travel permission rules.

Most affected people will be expected to pay a $10,000 bond, although the amount can be set at $5,000 or $15,000 depending on travelers’ circumstances. The program is set to go into effect Aug. 20, and the State Department will announce affected countries on its website.

The program is “intended to encourage foreign governments to take immediate action to reduce the overstay rates of their nationals when traveling to the United States for temporary visits, and to encourage countries to improve screening and vetting and the security of travel and civil documents, including in the granting of citizenship,” the document said.

The first Trump administration also initiated a temporary bond program, but the plan was not fully implemented because of the impact of the Covid pandemic on travel.

Trump says he'd 'like to run' for president again but will 'probably not'

Trump takes Scott Bessent off the shortlist for Federal Reserve

Trump said in an interview on CNBC that he's taking Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent off the shortlist for Federal Reserve chair.

Trump said Bessent wants to remain at the Treasury Department.

""I asked him just last night, is this something you want? 'Nope. I want to stay where I am,'"" Trump said Bessent told him.

For Fed chair, Trump said he was considering current Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller, former Fed official Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, and at least two other unnamed people.

U.S. bans travelers from Burundi, citing 'repeated' visa violations

U.S. visas for travelers from Burundi are temporarily banned, the U.S. embassy in the East African country said, citing “repeated violations” of visa rules.

“Every Burundian who travels carries the hopes of their family and community. Respecting visa rules isn’t just personal, it is national,” the embassy said yesterday in a post on X. “Sadly, due to repeated violations, U.S. visas for Burundians are temporarily banned.”

Burundi, one of the poorest countries in the world, was among seven countries whose citizens were partially blocked from entering the U.S. in a June proclamation by Trump. The proclamation cited a U.S. government report saying Burundi had an overstay rate of more than 15% for business and tourism visas.

Rep. Adam Smith says an aide was ‘physically assaulted’ at his town hall

and

Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said in a post on X last night that one of his staff members was “physically assaulted” during his town hall at Renton Technical College in Washington, calling it “an act that crosses every line of civil discourse.”

“Today’s town hall was intentionally disrupted to attempt to silence a democratic conversation between a Representative and his constituents,” Smith said in the post. He emphasized that while peaceful protest is protected, “violence and coordinated efforts to shut down public dialogue are not.”

Kshama Sawant, a socialist running for Smith’s seat, posted a video on X of what appeared to be individuals being handcuffed. Sawant called them “3 peaceful anti-genocide activists” who she said were merely chanting at Smith's event.

In a statement, Sawant criticized Smith's voting record on Israel: ""Adam Smith has blood on his hands. He needs to be thrown out of office and put on trial for war crimes.""

Smith's office declined further comment.

Workers Strike Back, which Sawant co-founded, shared her post, saying the activists were from their group.

A spokesperson for the Renton, Washington, police department confirmed that three people were arrested on trespassing charges. They were booked into jail, spokesperson Meeghan Black said.

Nine protesters ""took over the stage at the town hall, shouting and disrupting the meeting,"" which was then canceled by Smith, Black said. Three of the protesters refused to leave, she said, adding, ""They were warned they’d be arrested if they didn’t leave.""

""They didn’t go and were arrested,"" she said.

Two officers were at the event when it began, and other officers began to arrive an hour later, she said.

Switzerland says it will make U.S. a ‘more attractive’ trade offer

Switzerland, which was surprised to find itself facing one of the highest U.S. tariff rates in the world, says it is determined to continue talks and that it is ready to make a “more attractive” trade offer to the Trump administration.

“Switzerland enters this new phase ready to present a more attractive offer, taking U.S. concerns into account and seeking to ease the current tariff situation,” its government said in a statement yesterday.

Trump said last week that he would impose a 39% tariff on imports from Switzerland, below only Laos (40%), Myanmar (40%) and Syria (41%). Swiss officials said the rate is far higher than those on comparable U.S. trading partners such as the E.U. (15%), Japan (15%) and Britain (10%).

Switzerland said over 99% of U.S. goods have entered the country tariff-free since the start of last year and that its trade surplus with the U.S. is not the result of any unfair trade practices. It said it was not considering any retaliatory measures.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250802-trump-ch-1628-cb3f01.jpg",N,,2025-08-07 02:56:56.505120

To fully understand the implications of the June 2025 travel ban, it’s essential to revisit the effects of the travel ban issued by the first Trump administration.
Under the June 2025 travel ban, many of these people will not be able to see family members living abroad.
Conclusion Unlike the public outcry following the first travel ban in 2017, the response to the June 2025 travel ban has been notably subdued.","Executive Summary

On June 4, 2025, the Trump administration announced a new travel ban targeting 19 countries. This marks a significant expansion of the travel bans President Trump issued during his first term, and reflects a more aggressive use of the president’s authority to limit the entry of foreign nationals who would otherwise qualify to come to the United States. Media reports have confirmed the administration is weighing imposing restrictions on 36 additional countries—primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.

Banning immigrants from these countries, many of whom come to the United States to reunite with family, will cause hardship and emotional stress for them and their relatives. Because many also come to study or work, it will also lead to major disruptions in higher education, labor markets in essential U.S. industries, and tax revenues and consumer spending.

The targeted immigrant groups hold significant economic clout, and the travel ban will have adverse impact on local businesses and communities across the United States. This report analyzes the scope, stated rationale, and consequences of the June 2025 travel ban, drawing on recent and historical data to assess its potential impact on the U.S. economy and on American communities and families.

Help us fight Trump’s travel ban and protect immigrant rights.

Which Countries Did the June 2025 Travel Ban Target?

The June 2025 travel ban is concentrated on two regions of the world: the Middle East and North Africa; and sub-Saharan Africa. The five countries covered by the new bans (full or partial) in the Middle East and North Africa are home to 45 percent of the region’s population. The eight countries affected by full or partial bans in sub-Saharan Africa are home to 6.4 percent of that region’s population.

Additionally, the administration has signaled it may further target sub-Saharan Africa for future travel bans. Twenty-four of the 36 countries that have been identified as future ban candidates are in sub-Saharan Africa. If all 24 were to be hit with bans in the future, an additional 71 percent of the region’s population would be affected.

How Many Visas Were Issued to the Affected Countries Last Year?

In fiscal year (FY) 2024, the U.S. government issued 161,987 visas in categories that would be subject to the June 2025 travel ban. These included both immigrant and non-immigrant visa categories, such as tourist and temporary worker visas, and were led by visas issued to nationals of Venezuela, Iran, and Cuba.

Half of the immigrant visas issued in the categories affected by the June 2025 travel ban, 12,738, were for extended family members of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, including adult children and siblings of U.S. citizens and spouses or unmarried children of lawful permanent residents. The next largest numbers were for diversity visas and employment-based visas.

Of the non-immigrant visas in the affected categories, 86.5 percent were for tourists and business travelers, followed by students (7 percent) and commercial sea or international airline crewmembers (2.6 percent).

What Was the Impact of the Previous Travel Bans?

The number of immigrant visas issued to the six countries most affected by the Trump administration’s previous travel bans—Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen—dropped by 69.9 percent between FY 2016 and FY 2019, with Iran and Somalia seeing the biggest declines.

The number of non-immigrant visas issued for these six countries plunged even further, by 84.7 percent, between FY 2016 and FY 2019, led by Libya and Yemen.

What Could Be the Direct Economic Impact of the 2025 Travel Ban?

At least 298,600 nationals of the 19 countries named in the most recent travel ban arrived in the United States in 2022. These new arrivals made significant contributions to the U.S. economy. In 2023 alone, households led by these recent arrivals earned $3.2 billion in household income, paid $715.6 million in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $2.5 billion in spending power.

These nationals made important contributions in U.S. industries that are facing labor shortages and rely on foreign-born workers. Those who worked were concentrated in hospitality (15.9 percent), construction (13.8 percent), retail trade (11.6 percent), manufacturing (11.4 percent), and professional services (11.2 percent). The manufacturing industry alone could face a shortage of 1.9 million workers by 2033.

An additional 88,900 nationals of the 36 countries that might be subjected to future travel bans also entered the United States in 2022. Households led by these immigrants collectively earned more than $1.4 billion in income, paid $359.9 million in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $1 billion in spending power the following year.

What Could Be the Indirect Impact on the Broader Immigrant Population?

Under the June 2025 travel ban, many foreign-born individuals already living in the United States will be unable or afraid to reunite with family members living overseas. Even those who need to travel abroad will face uncertainty about whether they’ll be allowed to return.

About 4.3 million immigrants from countries affected by the ban lived in the United States in 2023, making up 9 percent of the overall immigrant population. They included 2.4 million naturalized citizens. More than one-third (41.8 percent) lived in Florida, followed by California, Texas, and New York.

The expansion of the previous travel bans for 19 countries—and potentially 36 more—will have far-reaching consequences for the country, disrupting family reunification, discouraging international talent from coming to the country to study and work, and threatening key sectors of the U.S. economy that depend on immigrant labor. It also undermines the economic and social contributions that long-standing immigrant communities have made across the country.

As this administration weighs future actions on the June 2025 travel ban, it is critical that policymakers pay close attention to the humanitarian and socioeconomic costs of such sweeping restrictions and hold the administration accountable for the consequences of its actions.

Introduction

On June 4, 2025, the Trump administration announced a new travel ban to restrict or prohibit entry for individuals from 19 countries.

It follows a series of bans President Donald Trump enacted during his first term, beginning in 2017, when the federal government barred entry for nationals from several Muslim-majority countries. That first ban set off protests at airports, sparked a flurry of court challenges, and underwent multiple revisions before a final version was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018. Two years later, the administration added six additional countries to the ban, citing purported national security and screening concerns. The Biden administration fully repealed the ban in January 2021.

The newly implemented travel ban targets a greater number of countries and has a broader geographic scope than the earlier bans. But it bears structural similarities to the previous iteration—specifically in exemptions like for legal permanent residents—that was upheld by the Supreme Court and has a slower roll-out period, a combination that could make it harder to successfully challenge in the courts.

Days after the new travel ban took effect on June 9, reporting revealed that the Trump administration had written an internal memo about the possibility of adding 36 more countries—primarily in Africa—to the travel ban list, if they are unable to meet the U.S. government’s requirements on vetting and screening within 60 days. The U.S. Department of State has reportedly indicated that a nation’s willingness to accept third-country nationals deported from the United States will play a factor in the decision.

State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce declined to discuss the specifics of the cable. However, she confirmed that the administration is urging countries to strengthen their passport vetting procedures, cooperate in accepting deported nationals from the United States, and take additional measures to ensure their citizens do not pose a threat to American security.

The June 2025 travel ban, and its potential expansion, have broad implications for immigrant communities. Reports have already emerged about children unable to reunite with their parents in the United States, foreign doctors kept away from patients awaiting them in U.S. hospitals, and immigrant entrepreneurs hesitating to take international trips needed for their businesses. This report examines how this ban will have consequences that ripple across American society.

Which Countries Did the June 2025 Travel Ban Target?

The June 2025 order imposes a full ban on twelve countries. Individuals from these countries cannot seek either an immigrant visa, which results in lawful permanent residency after entry to the United States, or any non-immigrant visas, which are temporary in nature and for specific purposes like tourism, work, or study.

It imposes a separate, partial ban on an additional seven countries. People from countries under the partial ban may be eligible for certain non-immigrant visas only. They will still be banned from all immigrant visas as well as some non-immigrant visas.

People with current visas are exempt from the new travel ban, along with other groups, including legal permanent residents; dual nationals; immediate relatives (spouses, minor children, or parents) of U.S. citizens; refugees; Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders; and members of athletic teams traveling for major sports events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The 19 countries included in the June 2025 travel ban were home to about 429.6 million people—roughly 5.3 percent of the world’s population—in 2023. Thirteen of these countries, or 68 percent, are in Africa and the Middle East. Combined, the populations of the affected countries made up 45 percent of the total population of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and 6.4 percent of the total population of sub-Saharan Africa.

Adding the 36 countries being considered for the travel ban would add 1 billion people to the affected population. These countries include a higher representation of sub-Saharan Africa, with 24 of the 36 making up 71 percent of the region’s population.

Furthermore, the administration will have the option to add or remove countries from the list of banned nations. Starting on September 2, 2025 (90 days after the announcement of the June 2025 ban), the secretary of state can forward recommendations to the president every 180 days with any suggested adjustments to the order. As a result, the number of people ultimately affected by the ban could fluctuate.

What Are the Stated Justifications for the Travel Ban?

In the text of the June 2025 order enacting the travel ban, the Trump administration gives three main reasons for targeting the 19 countries: inadequate vetting and information sharing; high rates of visa overstays; and recalcitrant countries refusing to accept their nationals who have been ordered deported from the United States. Specifically, the order claims that 10 of the 19 countries conducted inadequate vetting and information-sharing; 15 had high overstay rates; and eight were recalcitrant.

While the first justification, claiming inadequate vetting and information sharing, has legal precedent—affirmed by the Supreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii—the others are new and are arguably questionable. To start, existing immigration law already provides mechanisms to address recalcitrant countries, such as visa sanctions. This proclamation appears to bypass those statutory tools in favor of a more aggressive use of presidential authority.

Next, the connection between visa overstay rates and the imposed restrictions is often tenuous. For example, the administration bans the issuance of immigrant visas for several countries based solely on non-immigrant overstay rates, even though immigrant visas are intended for permanent immigrants and are therefore not subject to overstays.

Moreover, the administration’s claims rely on Department of Homeland Security estimates that have faced criticism for failing to accurately reflect unrecorded departures or instances where individuals legally extended or adjusted their immigration status. The government is limited in its ability to match immigration records across agencies, leading to some individuals falsely being deemed “suspected overstays.”

Finally, most of the countries cited for high overstay rates (all but Haiti and Venezuela) actually have a relatively small number of overstayers that is likely an overcount: In FY 2023, an average of 545 people per country reportedly overstayed their visas. As an example, Chad, with a population of over 19 million, had only 451 suspected visa overstays in FY 2023.

Exemptions in the current travel ban raise additional questions. While the ban exempts immediate relatives of U.S. citizens who can prove identity through DNA, it denies similar flexibility to individuals in other family-based categories, such as the children of green card holders or the siblings of U.S. citizens.

Taken together, these inconsistencies cast doubt on the ban’s stated purpose of improving vetting and reducing visa overstays. The policy’s overinclusive design sweeps in individuals whose entry poses no clear risk, while its exceptions allow many others to continue entering the country—undermining the administration’s own security rationale. Rather than a narrowly tailored national security measure, the ban appears to function primarily as a tool to restrict immigration from countries disfavored by the administration.

How Many Visas Were Issued to the Affected Countries?

In FY 2024, the U.S. government issued 161,987 immigrant and non-immigrant visas to nationals of the affected countries in the categories that would be subject to the new travel ban, excluding immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders, and visas covered by the exemptions. These visas included 68,557 visas issued to individuals from countries under the full travel ban and 93,430 visas issued to countries under the partial travel ban. The highest number of visas were issued to nationals of Venezuela (39.4 percent), followed by Iran (12.6 percent), and Cuba (10.7 percent).

The number of all visas issued included 25,086 immigrant visas: 14,263 to people from the 12 countries under the full travel ban; and 10,823 to people from the seven countries under the partial travel ban.

About 51 percent (12,738) of the immigrant visas were issued in the family-based categories, including adult children and siblings. The greatest number of these were to people from Cuba (5,540), Yemen (1,714), and Haiti (1,485).

More than one-third of the immigrant visas (42 percent) were diversity visas, granted through lottery to people from countries with low immigration rates. These primarily went to people from Sudan, Iran, and Cuba. Just 4.7 percent were employment-based immigrant visas, for individuals sponsored by a U.S. business, notably to nationals of Venezuela and Iran.

In the same fiscal year, the U.S. government issued 136,901 non-immigrant visas to people from these countries: 54,294 to individuals from countries subject to full visa restrictions; and 82,607 B-1, B-2, F, M, and J visas to individuals from countries under the partial travel ban.

About 86.5 percent of the non-immigrant visas were B-1 and B-2 visas, for visitors like tourists, business travelers, and those visiting family temporarily, with Venezuela and Iran receiving the largest number.

F visas, for international students, made up 7 percent of non-immigrant visas issued to affected countries; D visas, for crewmembers (workers on commercial sea vessels or international airlines), made up 2.6 percent; J visas, for exchange students and scholars, comprised 1.9 percent; and K visas, for the fiancés of U.S. citizens, comprised 1.3 percent. These are diverse groups of people who would not have been allowed into the country had they entered after June 9, 2025, constituting an abrupt shift that would disrupt international tourism and transportation, hurt educational and cultural exchanges, and separate families.

What Was the Impact of the Previous Travel Ban?

To fully understand the implications of the June 2025 travel ban, it’s essential to revisit the effects of the travel ban issued by the first Trump administration.

The executive order was signed on January 27, 2017, and went into effect mere hours after the text was published. Within 24 hours, around 375 travelers were affected, with 109 people detained while in transit and 173 people prevented from boarding flights to the United States before a court blocked the order. Within the first seven days, the State Department said, “roughly 60,000 individuals’ visas were provisionally revoked.” The ban was later revised, going through four iterations during the first Trump administration. The third version was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018, and in 2020 a fourth version added six more countries. Many of these countries saw their visa issuance drop significantly, even before the COVID-19 pandemic heavily restricted international travel.

The third version of the travel ban had targeted eight countries, although Venezuela was included only in a limited form, banning travel for government officials and their families; and Chad was removed in 2018 after the White House claimed that the country improved its information-sharing and identify-management practices.

The remaining six countries—Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen—were under a broad travel ban for at least 30 months, until the Biden administration repealed it in January 2021. These six countries bore the brunt of the ban and are the focus of the Council’s subsequent analysis.

Between FY 2016 and FY 2019, the total number of immigrant visas issued to nationals of these six countries dropped by 69.9 percent. Iran saw the biggest decline, of 79 percent, from 7,727 visas to 1,634 visas, while Yemen’s visa issuance dropped to one-third of its FY 2016 level, from 12,998 visas to 4,379 visas.

The issuance of non-immigrant visas to these countries plunged even further, by 84.7 percent between FY 2016 and FY 2019. Under a full travel ban, Iran saw the number of non-immigrant visas issued to its nationals fall from 29,404 in FY 2016 to 4,244 by FY 2019, a decline of approximately 85.6 percent. Meanwhile, Libya, under a partial travel ban, experienced a drop of business and tourism visas issued to its nationals from 1,445 to 96.

The relatively few visas that were issued in this time period were due to the limited exemptions and waivers set for the previous travel ban, such as the exemptions for dual citizens and representatives of international organizations.

Meanwhile, these sharp declines in visa issuance highlight the immediate and profound impact of the administration’s travel ban.

Because the first Trump administration’s travel ban primarily targeted Muslim-majority countries—and was sometimes known as the “Muslim Ban”—it may have affected travel decisions throughout the Middle East. For instance, research from 2017 revealed that after the first travel ban, tourism from the Middle East to the United States dropped by one-quarter.

If tourists were anxious about traveling to the United States, so, too, apparently were students. A study of two Texas universities found that the 2017 travel ban significantly reduced the number of applications from international graduate students, especially those from Muslim-majority nations. Most notably, the universities experienced more than a 50 percent drop in applications from nationals of the seven countries specifically named in the first version of the travel ban. Prior research also revealed that the previous travel ban alarmed international doctoral students, leading to stress, confusion, and worries about travel, visa stability, and future job prospects.

International students often fill critical gaps in the workforce—particularly in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields—furthering the ability of American researchers and businesses to succeed. Policies that limit their ability to study and work in the United States not only hamper local economies but also hamstring the research and innovation pipelines in American universities and companies—ultimately undermining U.S. global competitiveness.

What Could Be the Direct Economic Impact of the June 2025 Travel Ban?

While government records provide the most up-to-date counts of visa issuance, their insights into the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of those new arrivals are limited. To fill in the gaps, we use the latest American Community Survey (ACS) microdata, from 2023, which provides detailed information about the non-citizens who entered the United States in 2022 and lived in the country in the following year. This approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the populations most directly comparable to those who will likely be affected by the new travel restrictions.

At least 298,600 nationals of the 19 countries targeted by the June 2025 travel ban arrived in the United States in 2022.i

About 69,700 nationals of countries named in the full travel ban arrived in the country in 2022, with the majority from Haiti (34.9 percent), Afghanistan (33 percent), and Iran (17.4 percent). About 228,900 people from countries named in the partial travel ban arrived in the country in 2022, with almost all from Cuba (65.2 percent) and Venezuela (33.8 percent).

At least 5 percent of these new arrivals, or 15,700 people, were enrolled in colleges and universities in 2023. This population represents a significant pipeline of international talent tapped by American businesses and organizations.

About 34 percent of the new arrivals had already received at least a bachelor’s degree, and 10 percent held an advanced degree.

Banning people like this from coming to America to study, work, and reunite with family will not only cause hardship; it will also lead to a loss in tax revenues and consumer spending that could support local American businesses and communities.

In 2023 alone, households led by recently arrived nationals of the affected countries earned $3.2 billion in income, paid $715.6 million in combined federal, state, and local taxes, and held $2.5 billion in spending power.

These new arrivals were also more likely to be of working age than U.S.-born residents, and, as such, were key contributors to the U.S. labor force. About 77 percent were between the ages of 16 and 64, compared with 60.9 percent of the U.S.-born population, and most worked.

These new arrivals had an employment rate of 82.8 percent, helping to ease critical labor shortages in America’s vital industries.

These workers were mostly concentrated in hospitality (15.9 percent), construction (13.8 percent), retail trade (11.6 percent), manufacturing (11.4 percent), and professional services (11.2 percent). The June 2025 travel ban threatens to exacerbate labor shortages in these industries, many of which have trouble recruiting enough U.S.-born workers and rely on foreign-born employees.

The most common occupations for these new arrivals included construction laborers (6.1 percent), cooks (4.3 percent), truck drivers (3.7 percent), maids and housekeeping cleaners (3.7 percent), and janitors and building cleaners (3.3 percent)—jobs vital to the construction, transportation, and hospitality industries.

The manufacturing industry alone is projected to experience a shortage of 1.9 million workers by 2033. Meanwhile, construction laborers, janitors and building cleaners, and cooks are among the top occupations with the most potential for job growth between 2023 and 2033; they are projected to add 115,400, 75,800, and 244,500 jobs, respectively.

In 2023, there were already 1.7 job openings for every available worker nationwide, with an aging population expected to exacerbate the labor crisis. A drop in the number of new arrivals due to the June 2025 travel ban could further strain the workforce, hindering business growth, destabilizing wages, and intensifying inflation—raising prices for goods and services for American consumers.

Furthermore, 88,900 people from the 36 countries that may soon be added to the travel ban entered the United States in 2022; 24.1 percent were from Nigeria, 18.6 percent were from Ghana, and 9.2 percent were from Ethiopia.

Collectively, households led by nationals of these 36 countries who arrived in 2022 earned $1.4 billion in income, paid $359.9 million in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $1.0 billion in spending power in the year after their arrival. Placing more countries on the new travel ban would significantly amplify the economic consequences.

What Could Be the Indirect Impact on the Broader Immigrant Population and the U.S. Economy?

In 2023, about 4.3 million immigrants from the 19 countries named in the June 2025 travel ban lived in the United States, making up 9 percent of the overall immigrant population. They included 2.4 million naturalized citizens and 1.9 million non-citizens.

Under the June 2025 travel ban, many of these people will not be able to see family members living abroad. Even those who need to travel internationally will have to worry about whether they can return.

Under the June order, existing visas cannot be revoked, but those who need to leave the United States and renew their visas after they expire could be subjected to the ban instead of being allowed to return.

Foreign-born residents from Cuba make up the largest share of those affected by the June 2025 travel ban, with over 1.4 million individuals: 832,600 naturalized citizens and 598,900 non-citizens. Haiti follows with 775,000 foreign-born residents, 58.8 percent of whom are naturalized citizens. Venezuela ranks third, with 766,400 individuals, while Iran and Afghanistan have 421,600 and 226,100 people, respectively. Myanmar and Laos also have sizable numbers, particularly among naturalized citizens.

The majority of foreign-born residents from the affected countries (60.9 percent) have been in the United States for at least a decade, building their lives and raising families.

These immigrants and their families hold significant economic clout. In 2023 alone, households led by immigrants from the affected countries earned $175.7 billion in income and paid $45.3 billion in federal, state, and local taxes. After taxes, they retained a spending power of $130.4 billion, money used to pay for food, housing, and supplies from American businesses, fueling broader economic activity across the country.

Households headed by Cuban immigrants stood out, with $12.3 billion in tax contributions and $39.6 billion in spending power, followed by households headed by immigrants from Iran and Haiti, who combined paid $17.9 billion in taxes and held $45.8 billion in spending power.

Nearly 95 percent of immigrants from the countries affected by the June 2025 travel ban were employed in 2023, most often in healthcare (16.3 percent), professional services (11.7 percent), transportation and warehousing (11.1 percent), manufacturing (10.3 percent), and retail trade (10.3 percent).

These foreign-born residents were heavily concentrated in a few key states. In 2023, 41.8 percent of immigrants from the affected countries—including both recent arrivals and long-term residents—lived in Florida, an immigrant hub due to its established support networks, economic opportunities, and proximity to countries like Haiti, Cuba, and Venezuela.

California, Texas, and New York also have significant populations, together making up nearly a quarter of the immigrant population from the affected countries. The travel ban’s effects—such as family separation, labor shortages, and reduced tax contributions and consumer spending—will be felt most acutely in these regions.

If the administration expands the travel ban to the 36 additional countries listed in the leaked memo, the shocks will be even more far-reaching. About 2.2 million foreign-born residents from those countries lived in the United States in 2023, including 1.4 million naturalized citizens. The following year, households led by these foreign-born residents collectively earned more than $107.3 billion in income, paid $29.1 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, and held $78.1 billion in spending power.

Conclusion

Unlike the public outcry following the first travel ban in 2017, the response to the June 2025 travel ban has been notably subdued. However, this muted reaction does not mean the public approves.

Legal advocates and civil rights organizations remain engaged, but many are stretched thin by a dizzying volume of immigration-related challenges, from visa revocations to arrests and deportations. Additionally, the more deliberate rollout of the June 2025 ban—with exemptions and a publicly announced implementation timeline—has both removed the element of surprise that fueled the 2017 backlash and made the ban harder to successfully challenge in the courts.

However, this quieter reception should not obscure the policy’s far-reaching implications. The expanded scope of the June 2025 ban means it will affect an even larger and more diverse population, and it will bring significant consequences for American families, educational institutions, and labor markets. The absence of mass protests should not be mistaken for the absence of harm.

Furthermore, the ban—and its consequences—may be expanded even further, with 36 more countries under consideration and the potential for more to be added at each mandated 180-day review.

Each country added to the ban compounds the strain on American communities, institutions, and economies. A broad ban not only deepens the economic and humanitarian consequences already observed but also threatens to undermine U.S. diplomatic relations and global standing. This underscores the urgent need to ensure that future decisions are grounded in evidence, aligned with national interests, and mindful of the broader socioeconomic costs.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airport-passengers-1024x385.png,N,,2025-08-07 02:57:03.434336

The Democratic-controlled city has frequently clashed with Trump over federal interventions and has long sought statehood, which would grant it full self-governance and congressional representation – which Republican lawmakers have opposed.","Donald Trump is threatening to strip Washington DC of its local governance and place the US capital under direct federal control, citing what he described as rampant youth crime following an alleged assault on a federal employee who worked for the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

In a post on his Truth Social platform, the president said he would “federalize” the city if local authorities failed to address crime, specifically calling for minors as young as 14 to be prosecuted as adults.

“Crime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control,” Trump wrote. “If D.C. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run.”

The threat received backing from Elon Musk, after the billionaire described an incident in which a member of the Doge team was allegedly “severely beaten to the point of concussion” while defending a woman from assault in the capital.

“A few days ago, a gang of about a dozen young men tried to assault a woman in her car at night in DC,” Musk posted on X. “A @Doge team member saw what was happening, ran to defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion, but he saved her. It is time to federalize DC.”

The victim was identified by friends and the police as Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old known as “Big Balls”, one of Doge’s most recognizable staffers who joined Doge in January. He reportedly left in June, and is currently employed at the Social Security Administration. According to a police report obtained by Politico, Coristine was assaulted at approximately 3am on Sunday by about 10 juveniles near Dupont Circle.

Police arrested two 15-year-olds from Maryland, a boy and a girl, as they attempted to flee the scene, and charged them with attempted carjacking. A black iPhone 16 valued at $1,000 was reported stolen during the incident.

Trump’s post, which included images of a bloodied and shirtless Coristine, concluded: “If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

Washington DC currently operates under “home rule”, established in 1973, which grants the city an elected mayor and council while maintaining ultimate congressional oversight. No president has attempted to revoke this arrangement since its creation.

Trump’s threat could theoretically take several forms. The constitution grants Congress broad authority over the federal district, though completely suspending local governance would probably require congressional legislation. Trump could also deploy federal law enforcement officers or national guard troops under executive authority, as he did during 2020 protests when federal forces cleared Lafayette Square outside the White House over local officials’ objections.

But fully stripping the city’s home rule would probably face fierce Democratic opposition in Congress. Any such move would require congressional legislation that Democrats could block or attempt to challenge in federal courts.

The president targeted DC’s juvenile justice system specifically. “The Law in D.C. must be changed to prosecute these ‘minors’ as adults, and lock them up for a long time, starting at age 14,” he wrote, referring to alleged attackers he described as “local thugs” and putting the word “youths” in quotation marks.

Washington DC, with a population of about 700,000, has seen violent crime decline in the first half of 2025 compared with the previous year, and 2024 marked a 30-year low, according to a pre-Trump January report by the Department of Justice. The Democratic-controlled city has frequently clashed with Trump over federal interventions and has long sought statehood, which would grant it full self-governance and congressional representation – which Republican lawmakers have opposed.

The office of the DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, declined a request for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c7d4709cd11f9a042d85495903f4fab17c50033/240_0_3587_2870/master/3587.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b68f4772fae6ec44a999ab424301bede",N,,2025-08-07 02:57:07.708745
