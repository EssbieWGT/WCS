Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats were plunged into political crisis, especially splintered on immigration and border security, after their thorough defeat last year in an election in which President Donald Trump made hard-line immigration action a centerpiece of his campaign.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It’s putting a spotlight on Trump’s agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats are ramping up visits to detention centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration’s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado’s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It’s a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president’s deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump’s administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans hold firm even as public opinion shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump’s success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We’ve never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it’s one of the most secure southern borders we’ve had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they’re out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump’s approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There’s still a search for consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America’s security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration’s handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we’ll see if now’s the time.”

Canada must be committed to upholding human rights and restoring justice in the immigration system.

Over the past year, the federal government has rolled out a series of policy changes that tighten and securitize every major immigration stream—decisions which deepen long-standing inequities in the system. Racialized migrants and refugees, women, 2SLGBTQI+ people and disabled persons, many of whom rely on community sponsorships, open work permits or low-wage streams, now face longer family separations, greater precarity and heightened surveillance.

Over the last two decades, Canada moved decisively towards “two-step” immigration. It does so by selecting permanent immigration candidates primarily from among temporary study and work permit holders. The cumulative effect is an immigration and refugee architecture that claims to celebrate diversity while operationalising exclusion, reinforcing historic patterns of racism and structural disadvantage—even as Canada brands itself an immigration success story.

By entrenching precarity and racialized gatekeeping, Canada undermines its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The federal government must re-align its migration framework with human rights principles, equity, and global justice.

Overview

Federal policymakers introduced extensive changes to immigration rules over the past 12 months. In September 2024, Ottawa announced a two-year cap that will cut new study-permit approvals to 437,000 for 2025 and curtail spousal work-permit eligibility, part of a wider plan to drive the share of temporary residents from seven per cent down to five per cent of Canada’s population. The October 2024 Immigration Levels Plan lowered permanent-resident targets by almost 20 per cent (to 395,000 in 2025) and formalised ceilings on temporary residents , while January 2025 allocations imposed a further 10 per cent drop in study permits. Other measures restricted open work permits for spouses and dependants of most international students and low-wage workers (Jan 2025). These shifts have left thousands of students and workers scrambling for status, as asylum claims by international students alone jumped 22 per cent in the first quarter of 2025 as other pathways closed.

Policymakers simultaneously narrowed refugee streams, implementing a temporary pause on private “Groups of Five” sponsorships (in which five Canadians together can “sponsor” a displaced person) from November 2024 to December 2025. Expired Refugee Protection Claimant Documents were declared invalid after April 2025, adding paperwork hurdles for people already waiting years for hearings. Ottawa simultaneously launched a multilingual digital campaign warning potential claimants about Canada’s “difficult” asylum process, and granted officers new powers to cancel visas, study permits and work permits on the spot (Feb 2025).

Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act introduced on 3 June 2025, would dramatically expand executive control over immigration. It proposes to grant cabinet the authority to pause, terminate or cancel entire classes of applications (as opposed to individual cases) or existing immigration documents “in the public interest,” and introduces stringent new requirements on the timing limits for making certain refugee claims. The bill also bolsters cross-border intelligence-sharing, lets Canada Post and CBSA open mail, and gives the Coast Guard police-style enforcement powers.

Canada also continues to be a signatory to the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA), which bars asylum seekers from making refugee claims if they have already set foot in a designated safe country—a designation it applies the U.S., despite that country having closed nearly all refugee intake streams. Despite the U.S. government’s recent predilection to send migrants to overseas concentration camps in places like El Salvador, Djibouti, and Guantanamo Bay, the Canadian government continues to designate the U.S. as a “safe” country for refugees—effectively preventing large numbers of asylum seekers from making legitimate claims in Canada.

Actions

Refugee protection and asylum

The AFB will rescind the Canada–U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA). The agreement undermines equitable refugee protection; the U.S. is not a safe country for all asylum seekers.

The AFB will withdraw Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act.

The AFB will end immigration detention. In the interim, the AFB will implement alternatives to detention, such as community-based supervision models managed in partnership with non-profit organizations.

Status and regularization

The AFB will launch a comprehensive regularization program for everyone with undocumented or precarious immigration status—including a one-step Permanent Residency pathway for undocumented individuals, rejected claimants, and people on precarious temporary status.

The AFB will restore permanent-resident targets and dismantle the “two-step” system. It would reverse the shift to mass temporary migration.

The AFB will reinvest in robust humanitarian, family-class, and economic immigration.

The AFB will guarantee permanent-status-on-arrival and open work permits for all workers.

The AFB will guarantee a predictable permanent residence pathway for study permit holders who were made ineligible because of immigration policy and regulation changes.

The AFB will eliminate closed/employer-specific permits for all foreign worker programs, including temporary foreign workers, to ensure labour mobility and full legal protection.

Labour rights and mobility

The AFB will establish binding national employment standards and housing regulations for migrant agricultural and low-wage workers as recommended in the guidance document, “National Housing Standards for Migrant Agricultural Workers.”

The AFB will ensure full access to federal benefits and social insurance (such as Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan, and so on, for all contributors regardless of immigration status, including migrant workers.

Justice and due process

The AFB will reform criminal inadmissibility and end immigration consequences of minor charges or protest-related arrests.

The AFB will introduce humanitarian discretion, a right of appeal, and a ban on deporting anyone brought to Canada as a child, regardless of immigration status.

The AFB will mandate an independent racial-equity audit of the entire immigration and refugee system.

The AFB will investigate systemic disparities in approval rates by country of origin, particularly for African, Caribbean, and Black applicants. As a result of that study, the AFB will mandate corrective measures, transparency, and binding equity reforms at IRCC and partner agencies as needed.

Health and human rights

The AFB will guarantee universal, provincial/territorial health coverage and treatment to all migrants living in Canada regardless of immigration status, including for people who are undocumented.

The AFB will guarantee culturally informed mental-health coverage and services to all migrants living in Canada regardless of immigration status, including for people who are undocumented.

The AFB will legislate national standards for Interim Federal Health Program and direct provider compensation to remove barriers to care and treatment for refugees and refugee claimants.

The AFB will protect and invest in legal aid, settlement agencies, and migrant worker support centres.

System reform and international commitments

The AFB will eliminate IRCC application backlogs and meet timely processing standards.

The AFB will create a new oversight body for Canada Border Services as per Bill C-20, An Act establishing the Public Complaints and Review Commission which received royal assent in October 2024.

The AFB will reverse IRCC staffing cuts, modernize systems, and publish regular processing metrics with disaggregated demographic data to ensure timely access and transparency.

The AFB will ratify the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Migrant Workers Convention (No. 97), the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No. 143) and Domestic Workers Convention (No. 189).

The AFB will reaffirm Canada’s global commitment to migrant rights and align domestic policy with international human rights obligations.

Settlement services

The AFB will adopt a National Plan for Asylum with Dignity. It will model refugee reception on the holistic support provided to Ukrainians in 2022-23, including intake centres, immediate work permits, and federal housing/shelter support.",https://www.policyalternatives.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CCPA-Site-Image.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 04:57:36.911411

Jose de Jesus Ortega, 38, of Highland and Danielle Nadine Davila, 33, of Corona have been charged with assaulting, resisting and impeding a federal officer, a felony, according to a news release Wednesday from the U.S. attorney’s office for the Central District of California. A trial date has been scheduled for Oct. 6.

Ortega and Davila were charged last month by the U.S. attorney’s office on the same matter. By returning an indictment, the grand jury indicated that it believed federal prosecutors had proved that there is probable cause the defendants violated federal law and that the case can proceed to trial.

According to court documents, two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were conducting raids in Ontario on July 8 while wearing government-issued equipment, including law enforcement vests, the release states.

The agents followed a truck with three men inside and approached them after the men exited the truck in the parking lot of the surgery center, according to the release. Two of the men ran away; one of them, an allegedly unauthorized immigrant from Honduras, was detained near the facility’s front entrance and tried to pull away, causing him and the ICE officer to fall to the ground.

A medical staffer helped the landscape worker off the ground and pulled him away from the officers, according to the release. The man went into the surgery center and was chased by the ICE agent, who eventually stopped him.

According to video obtained by KTLA-TV Channel 5, staffers told the two agents to leave because they didn’t have a warrant to enter the property. The agents were trying to detain 30-year-old Denis Guillen-Solis and two other landscapers, according to the release.

In the video, Guillen-Solis is shown holding onto the doorway at the surgical center and asking the agents to present identification. The agents then pulled Guillen-Solis from the doorway and detained him.

Davila allegedly interfered with the arrest by wedging herself in front of the officer and saying, “Let him go!” and, “Get out,” according to the release. Ortega allegedly interfered by grabbing the officer’s arm and vest.

Another ICE officer arrived to help and allegedly saw staff members grabbing one of the officers, according to the release. They detained and handcuffed the alleged unauthorized immigrant.

The charges against the two staffers continue U.S. Atty.

Bertran suffered a broken finger, along with other injuries, while protesting a July raid at Glass House Farms in Camarillo.

Bertran, who plays guitar and piano, claims immigration agents hit him with less-lethal rounds numerous times, with one of the projectiles hitting his hand and breaking his left ring finger.

""I did not interfere. I stood where I was allowed to stand, and I made my voice known,"" Bertrand said at the news conference. ""I was more than happy to tell them what I thought about them, but that's within my right. I did not interfere in any way. We just stood there and peacefully assembled.""

Civil rights attorney James DeSimone is representing Bertrand in his lawsuit against DHS, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

During the raid, immigration agents fired tear gas and non-lethal rounds at protesters.

Bertrand's legal team says immigration agents were supposed to give the protesters a warning that they were going to fire tear gas and non-lethal rounds into the crowd.

""No warning was given to those individuals,"" DeSimone said. ""Alec Bertrand did not know that he was going to be shot five times in a matter of 15 seconds when he was standing there protesting the activities.""

Alec Bertrand added, ""They created a war zone that day. A war zone in a peaceful farming town in a California suburb.""

DHS issued the following statement to Eyewitness News:

""DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities. We will continue to fight tooth-and-nail to remove the worst of the worst from American streets,"" DHS said in a statement to CBS News.

Earlier Wednesday, the Associated Press reported a top Florida emergency official had told a South Florida rabbi last week that Alligator Alcatraz would likely be empty ""within a few days.""

The facility, run by Florida's state government on a largely abandoned airstrip, is part of a wider push by the Trump administration to ramp up the number of immigration detention beds by partnering with Republican-led states willing to aid its escalating mass deportation efforts.

Republican officials in Indiana and Nebraska have also offered to convert state prisons into immigration detention centers, and the Trump administration has been eyeing similar facilities in other states.

The administration has cast ""Alligator Alcatraz"" as a cost-effective way of holding immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and suggested the treacherous terrain around the site could serve as a deterrent. But advocates have described inhumane conditions at the facility, including a lack of access to water, scarce and unsanitary food and limited access to attorneys — allegations that federal and state officials have denied.

Last week, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered an indefinite stop to all new construction at ""Alligator Alcatraz"" and barred the transfer of new detainees to the facility. She also directed state officials to remove all fencing, light fixtures, generators and certain other equipment at the site within 60 days, siding with environmental activists who said the facility skirted federal environmental laws.

The ruling did not require the facility to be shut down immediately.

Florida's state government quickly appealed Williams' ruling last week. Late Wednesday evening, Williams declined to halt her ruling pending appeal, rejecting a request by the Trump administration and Florida.

In her new order Wednesday, Williams said federal and state officials had failed to present ""new evidence"" showing the detainees at ""Alligator Alcatraz"" are particularly dangerous or that a pause in operations at the facility would thwart immigration enforcement efforts.

""Alligator Alcatraz"" is also the subject of two other lawsuits. One of them alleges that detainees have been unable to meet with their lawyers confidentially. A federal judge earlier this month dismissed one part of the suit that alleged the government had prevented detainees from filing legal challenges by not making clear which immigration court oversaw the facility, but he left the rest of the suit intact — though he moved the case from Miami to Orlando.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/20/b3882359-72fc-4928-bc4a-2b071da6af6c/thumbnail/1200x630/046d9e37d9355ed918d6e0d88c793143/gettyimages-2229637781.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 01:56:44.373901

There, Dann opined that counties can only hold people for 48 hours (not counting Saturdays, Sundays or holidays) as a “detainer” until federal law enforcement claims custody of the person.
Yost said once a county and ICE reach a contract, the county can lawfully hold them for longer periods of time until ICE executes a deportation.","Ohio county commissions can legally enter contracts with federal officials to detain immigrants subject to deportation, GOP Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said in an advisory opinion Tuesday

If such a contract is in place, detainees are not subject a traditional 48-hour time limit for the state to hold subjects awaiting federal law enforcement.

Federal law allows the counties to enter the contracts, Yost said, and state law doesn’t prohibit it.

The net effect of the ruling is more counties could reach financial deals with ICE calling for them to hold people awaiting deportation in jail, even though immigration is a civil and not a criminal offense.

“Local officials’ authority to confine such persons in a county jail would derive, instead, from a lawful agreement with federal immigration authorities to detain aliens subject to removal from the United States,” he wrote.

Advisory opinions don’t carry the force of law, but they function as an important form of blanket advice for government actors who rely on legal counsel or services of the attorney general.

The request to Yost came at the behest of Michael Gmoser, the prosecuting attorney for Butler County, near Cincinnati. There, the county jail is holding about 400 people on “ICE detainers,” and 92% of them are only held on immigration offenses as opposed to violent ones, according to WCPO9.

Yost’s opinion comes with a wrinkle. It holds that only county commissions, not sheriff’s offices, can enter such contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The ACLU has previously filed lawsuits against sheriffs of Geauga and Seneca counties, claiming they’ve illegally refused to provide copies of their contracts to transport and house immigrants for ICE.

On Wednesday, attorneys with the advocacy group issued a letter to nine sheriffs around the state, warning them that only their county governments can contract with ICE. Such contracts with the sheriffs but not their county commissions would be “invalid,” the ACLU said.

“As Attorney General Dave Yost has made clear, these agreements were invalid at their inception and have no legal force,” wrote Freda Levenson, legal director for the ACLU. “For you to continue holding anyone under that invalid authority is unlawful, and a violation of these individuals’ constitutional rights.”

The ruling from Yost also comes as President Donald Trump’s administration wages an aggressive, mass deportation campaign across the nation that includes targeting those with no criminal records as well.

Yost’s writing deviates from a 2007 advisory opinion from his Democratic predecessor, Marc Dann. There, Dann opined that counties can only hold people for 48 hours (not counting Saturdays, Sundays or holidays) as a “detainer” until federal law enforcement claims custody of the person.

DHS issued a similar proposed rule in September 2020, toward the end of the first Trump administration.
And for I nonimmigrants, “duration of status” is generally the duration of the foreign media representative’s assignment/employment in the United States.
Some aspects of the proposed rule could be revised during the review and finalization process, based on public feedback.
If your organization wishes to comment on the proposed rule, please contact your designated Fragomen professional or the firm’s Government Strategies and Compliance Group.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has released an advance copy of a proposed regulation that would replace the current “duration of status” (D/S) policy for international students (F status), exchange visitors (J status), representatives of foreign information media (I status), and their dependents with a policy that would set a finite expiration date for their authorized stay. The proposed rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register tomorrow. DHS will accept public comments on the proposal for 30 days after publication.

If the proposal becomes final, F, J, and I nonimmigrants would be admitted to the United States for a specific period of stay, and like other nonimmigrants, they would be required to apply for an extension of stay if they need more time to complete their program, employment, or assignment.

The proposed rule would also result in a change to current policies on how and when F, J, and I nonimmigrants begin accruing “unlawful presence,” for purposes of the three- and ten-year bars applicable to foreign nationals who have been unlawfully present in the United States for over 180 days or over one year. Currently, F, J, and I nonimmigrants only begin to accrue unlawful presence if USCIS or an immigration judge formally finds that the individual has violated their nonimmigrant status. Under the proposed rule, F, J, and I nonimmigrants would generally begin accruing unlawful presence as soon as their specified admission period expires, as is currently the case for other nonimmigrant categories.

DHS issued a similar proposed rule in September 2020, toward the end of the first Trump administration. The incoming Biden administration withdrew the proposal in July 2021, and the second Trump administration is now seeking to resurrect the initiative with additional provisions that have not previously been proposed.

While most nonimmigrants are admitted to the United States until a specific date, F, J, and I nonimmigrants have long been admitted for the duration of the individual’s status in that visa classification. Under current rules, a “duration of status” (D/S) admission for F-1s is the time it takes the individual to complete their academic program and any post-completion optional practical training (OPT), plus a 60-day grace period. For J-1s, “duration of status” is the time it takes the exchange visitor to complete their J-1 program, plus a 30-day grace period. And for I nonimmigrants, “duration of status” is generally the duration of the foreign media representative’s assignment/employment in the United States.

Nonimmigrants admitted for duration of status are not required to apply for an extension of stay with USCIS if their program or employment lasts longer than initially anticipated. For Fs and Js, the sponsoring educational institution or exchange program can extend the student’s or exchange visitor’s ability to remain in the United States simply by issuing a revised Form I-20 or DS-2019 with a later program completion date, and foreign media representatives in I status can remain in the United States as long as they remain employed in their qualifying employment.

The proposed rule would end this longstanding practice of admitting F, J, and I nonimmigrants for duration of status and would bring these classifications in line with other nonimmigrant categories, by subjecting them to defined periods of stay and requiring them to apply to USCIS for extensions of status if they wish to remain in the United States beyond that defined period.

If F, J, or I nonimmigrants require additional time to complete their program, practical training, or employment, they would need to apply for an extension of stay with USCIS and complete biometrics screening. The rules governing the duration of approved extensions would mirror the rules above for the initial admission periods.

The proposed rule indicates that in order for an extension of F-1 status to be approved, the foreign national would need to present either a currently issued Form I-20 indicating that additional time is needed to complete their program or documentation demonstrating compelling academic reasons (e.g., change of major or research topic, unexpected research problems, etc.); illness; or other circumstances beyond the foreign national’s control (e.g., natural disaster, national health crisis, closure of institution).

If an F, J, or I nonimmigrant fails to depart or apply to change or extend their status before their status expires, they would begin to accrue unlawful presence upon expiration of their authorized admission period, in the same manner as other nonimmigrants.

The proposed rule contains complex transition provisions for the treatment of foreign nationals admitted for duration of status (D/S) prior to the effective date of the rule.

After the rule is published in the Federal Register tomorrow, the public will have 30 days to comment. DHS will then review the feedback and prepare a final rule for issuance in the Federal Register. Some aspects of the proposed rule could be revised during the review and finalization process, based on public feedback. There is no set timeframe for publication of a final rule, though the process typically takes several months.

Comments from the academic and business communities will be important to make the agency aware of the impact of the rule on schools, businesses, and U.S. competitiveness in the market for global talent.

The Wednesday letter to State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln calls on Bosn to use her authority to call a hearing on the planned repurposing of the Nebraska Work Ethic Camp in McCook. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a state-federal plan Aug. 19 to convert the nearly 200-bed dormitory-style, rehabilitative-focused prison facility into a 300-bed ICE detention facility over the next 45 days.

Pillen, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and other state officials called the rebranded facility the “Cornhusker Clink.”

“There was no meaningful notice to the Legislature, local officials or the public about this agreement,” the senators wrote Wednesday in a letter shared publicly and with the Nebraska Examiner. “The governor’s disregard for including the Legislature — the people’s branch — is deeply problematic. Nebraskans deserve answers.”

Almost every legislative committee introduces a resolution each year to examine any issues that might arise between legislative sessions within a committee’s jurisdiction. Bosn’s committee has Legislative Resolution 108, which is signed by all eight committee members.

Bosn said she received the letter late Wednesday afternoon and was still reviewing it. She said she would have a response Thursday.

‘How democracy works’

Lawmakers signing the letter were State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Machaela Cavanaugh, Danielle Conrad, George Dungan, John Fredrickson, Dunixi Guereca, Megan Hunt, Margo Juarez, Terrell McKinney, Dan Quick, Jane Raybould, Victor Rountree and Ashlei Spivey.

“This is not about partisanship. It is about process, constitutional authority and protecting Nebraskans,” Hunt, a nonpartisan progressive, said in a statement. “The governor cannot secretly cut deals to hand over state facilities to ICE without public input or legislative oversight. That is not how democracy works.”

The other dozen lawmakers who signed are Democrats in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.

Asked for a response on the lawmakers’ letter, Laura Strimple, a Pillen spokesperson, said the lawmakers had not posed the questions to the Governor’s Office and that if the lawmakers want answers, they’re welcome to ask.

“The governor has always been transparent and would be more than happy to answer questions,” she said. “However, the administration cannot answer questions when they are not asked. Rather than engaging in political theater, these Democrat senators should simply send these questions to be answered.”

Three legislative Democrats did not sign the letter: State Sens. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Wendy DeBoer of Omaha and Jason Prokop of Lincoln. DeBoer is vice chair of the Judiciary Committee, which is split 5-3, majority Republicans. McKinney and Rountree also serve on the committee.

DeBoer could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

Hunt said on social media Wednesday that a reason some Democratic lawmakers didn’t sign was because of a “quick turnaround.” She said she thought there were “for sure” some Republicans who would have signed.

Nebraska’s plans to keep the repurposed Work Ethic Camp state-owned and operated would likely leave it open to legislative oversight, a power that lawmakers have worked to clarify and strengthen over the past two years.

Legal authority

Some of the lawmakers’ questions revolve around whether the governor has the authority to enter an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to convert a state prison into an ICE detention facility without legislative action. They also want to probe whether the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services can house ICE detainees at all.

The letter notes Article IV, Section 19 of the Nebraska Constitution, which gives the Legislature power over the “management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”

Senators argued Pillen is “unilaterally” bypassing the Nebraska Constitution and multiple state laws that dictate the prison system’s powers and outline the purpose of the Work Ethic Camp in statute.

While the letter alludes to fiscal questions, lawmakers did not include any specific questions on the finances of the new facility.

Pillen and State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the budget-writing Appropriations Committee, have said the federal government will fully reimburse Nebraska for the $9.5 million facility plus daily bed costs. They have said the deal could financially benefit Nebraska.

Previous Judiciary Committee reactions

Rountree, who represents a purple legislative district that elected him and voted for President Donald Trump in November, previously told the Examiner that he approaches immigration enforcement from a “humanitarian viewpoint” and from his 30 years as a veteran.

“There’s a place for the rule of law to exist along with humanitarian effort,” Rountree said.

What to know about Nebraska-ICE plan to retool McCook Work Ethic Camp

State Sens. Tanya Storer of Whitman and Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, who also serve on the Judiciary Committee, said they had been briefed on the federal plan and were more confident in its direction. Both said they were assured Nebraska facilities would not be hurt by the plan.

“I think if Nebraska is in a position to help be part of that effort in a positive way, that’s a good thing,” Storer said at the time.

Hearing requested with ‘deliberate speed’

Among the letter’s other questions Wednesday:

What impact does this agreement have on Nebraskans who are incarcerated and front-line prison system employees, who are already facing overcrowding and staffing issues?

Will employees at the Work Ethic Camp be reassigned to work at other facilities? Will they be trained to work at the converted facility? Will federal officials also work at the converted facility? Will federal officials replace or supplement current staff at the Work Ethic Camp?

Where will the incarcerated Nebraskans now housed at the Work Ethic Camp be moved to? How does the recent significant damage and forced relocation of inmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary impact prisoner relocation efforts? What impact will the relocation have on rehabilitation-focused programming and eligibility for parole?

Who will be detained or placed in the converted ICE detention facility?

If Nebraska has prison space to give away to the Trump administration, why are state lawmakers spending more than $313 million to build a new state prison?

“These and other subjects are deserving of a public hearing on the record at which officials can provide additional information and answer questions, and where Nebraskans can be heard,” the letter states.

The senators asked Bosn, a former prosecutor appointed to the Legislature in 2023 and elected in 2024, to inform her colleagues and the public of the answers to these questions if she can.

If Bosn cannot answer, the letter adds, “We encourage you to stand in your power and set and publicize the hearing date to take this matter up with all deliberate speed as the governor notes this transition will be happening within a few short weeks.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/progressives-PSL-huddle_ZJW_032625-02.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 22:57:23.542704

A child developed a rash after he was prevented from changing his underwear for four days. A little boy, bored and overcome with despair, began hitting himself in the head. A child with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was forced to go without his medication, despite his mother’s pleas.

“I heard one officer say about us ‘they smell like sh–,’” one detained person recounted in a federal court filing. “And another officer responded, ‘They are sh–.’”

Attorneys for immigrant children collected these stories, and more, from youth and families detained in what they called “prison-like” settings across the U.S. from March through June, even as the Trump administration has requested a federal district court judge terminate existing protections that mandate basic rights and services — including safe and sanitary conditions — for children held by the government.

The administration argues that the protections mandated under what is known as the Flores Settlement Agreement encourage immigration and interfere with its ability to establish immigration policy. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, who is in California, is expected to issue a ruling on the request after an Aug. 8 hearing.

With the agreement in place, children are being held in “unsafe and unsanitary” U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities such as tents, airports, and offices for up to several weeks despite the agency’s written policy saying people generally should not be held in its custody longer than 72 hours, according to the June court filing from immigrants’ attorneys. In addition to opposing the U.S. Department of Justice’s May request to terminate the Flores consent decree, the attorneys demanded more monitoring for children in immigration detention.

“The biggest fear is that without Flores, we will lose a crucial line of transparency and accountability,” said Sergio Perez, executive director of the California-based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. “Then you have a perfect storm for the abuse of individuals, the violation of their rights, and the kind of treatment that this country doesn’t stand for.”

The Flores agreement has set minimum standards and oversight for detained immigrant children since 1997, when it brought an end to a decade-long lawsuit filed on behalf of unaccompanied immigrant minors who had been subjected to poor treatment in unsafe and unsanitary conditions without access to medical care. It is named for Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old from El Salvador who was taken into U.S. custody in the mid-1980s, subjected to strip searches, and housed alongside unrelated men.

The agreement established national standards for the protection of immigrant children detained by federal authorities, with requirements for safe and sanitary detention facilities, access to clean water, appropriate food, clothing, bedding, recreational and educational opportunities, sanitation, plus appropriate medical and mental health care. Children in immigrant detention range from infants to teens.

In 2015, Gee ruled that the agreement includes children accompanied by adults.

The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which includes both the Customs and Border Protection agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to respond on the record to questions about the administration’s intent to end the Flores agreement or about the conditions in which kids are detained. In a May court filing, government attorneys argued, among other points, that the agreement improperly directs immigration decisions to the courts, not the White House. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also has said that the Flores agreement has “incentivized illegal immigration,” and that Congress and federal agencies have resolved the problems Flores was designed to fix.

ICE detention facilities have the “highest standards,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in an email to KFF Health News. “They are safe, clean, and hold illegal aliens who are awaiting final removal proceedings.”

Immigration lawyers and researchers have pushed back on the idea that the Flores agreement encourages migration, arguing that the conditions in people’s homelands are driving them to move.

Trump is not the first president to seek to modify, or end, the agreement.

In 2016, President Barack Obama’s administration unsuccessfully sought to exempt accompanied minors from the Flores agreement, arguing that an influx of immigrants from Central America had overwhelmed the system.

In 2019, following a policy that caused family separation, the first Trump administration announced it would replace Flores with new regulations to expand family detention and eliminate detention time limits. The courts rejected that plan, too.

In 2024, President Joe Biden’s administration successfully requested to remove the Department of Health and Human Services from the agreement after the Office of Refugee Resettlement incorporated some Flores standards into agency regulations.

Allegations of unsafe conditions under the agreement also predate this latest immigration crackdown under Trump. One court filing from 2019 said that attorneys visiting two Texas detention centers found at least 250 infants, children, and teens, some of whom had been held at the facility for nearly a month. “Children were filthy and wearing clothes covered in bodily fluids, including urine,” the filing said.

Seven children are known to have died while in federal custody from 2018 to 2019, according to media reports.

And in 2023, 8-year-old Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez became sick and died while in Customs and Border Protection custody in Texas for nine days. Her parents had turned over medical records detailing the girl’s medical history, including diagnoses of sickle cell disease and congenital heart disease, upon their detention. Yet her mother’s repeated pleas for emergency medical care were ignored.

Her family filed a wrongful death claim in May.

Advocates attributed the deaths partly to prolonged detention in increasingly crowded facilities and delayed medical care. Officials have said they increased medical services and acknowledged failures in the wake of the deaths.

But with the Trump administration’s unprecedented push to detain and deport migrants — including families — the threat to the health of children caught up in those sweeps is alarming child advocates.

“Very rarely do you have spikes in populations of detained folk that you don’t see a drastic decrease in the quality of their medical care,” said Daniel Hatoum, a senior supervising attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, one of the groups that filed the wrongful death claim for Anadith’s family.

Recent reports from court-appointed monitors cite continued lack of access to appropriate medical care; temperature extremes; few outside recreational opportunities; lack of appropriate food and clothing; and an inability to dim lights to sleep.

Terminating the Flores agreement would remove all outside oversight of immigration detention facilities by court-ordered monitors and attorneys. The public would have to depend on the government for transparency about the conditions in which children are held.

“Our system requires that there be some oversight for government, not just the Department of Homeland Security, but in general,” Hatoum said. “We know that. So, I do not believe that DHS could police itself.”

In the months after Trump took office and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency began cuts, the administration shuttered DHS’ Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which were intended to add a layer of oversight. After a lawsuit, the Trump administration reversed action and noted the offices would remain open, but it is unclear how those offices have been affected by shifts in policy and cuts in staffing.

Leecia Welch, an attorney with the legal advocacy group Children’s Rights, said the Flores agreement itself, or efforts to hold the government responsible for abiding by its requirements, are not rooted in partisan politics. She said she raised concerns about conditions during Biden’s administration, too.

“These are not political issues for me,” Welch said. “How does our country want to treat children? That’s it. It’s very simple. I’m not going to take it easy on any administration where children are being harmed in their care.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-08-28 05:57:03.095452

“We’ve had reports about folks being unable to get adequate food. Either they were going hungry or they were … forced to purchase their own food from the commissary,” Scanlon said.

Despite a provision in a 2024 federal appropriations bill giving members of congress the authority to make unannounced oversight visits, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials refused her request to enter the facility.

“They said they would not be letting me in specifically to do the oversight visit, because they were under orders not to do so by the secretary of DHS Kristi Noem,” Scanlon said. “And they repeatedly said they were aware of the fact that there is a federal law.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment on Scanlon being denied entry to the facility.

Scanlon is the second member of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation to be turned away by officials at Moshannon Valley this week. On Monday, U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (D-12th District) was denied entry to the center to conduct oversight after the death earlier this month of a Chinese national being held there.

Lee said in a statement Monday her denied entry into Moshannon Valley is an example of the Trump administration’s executive overreach.

“With numerous allegations of human rights abuses, our communities deserve to know how people are being treated inside these taxpayer-funded facilities,” Lee said. “Transparency and accountability are non-negotiables in a democracy, and ICE cannot be allowed to operate in the shadows.”

Similar scenes have played out at detention centers elsewhere in the nation in recent months. Notably, Democratic New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver and other lawmakers were involved in a confrontation with federal officials outside a recently reopened facility in Newark in May.

McIver was later indicted on three counts of “assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering” with federal officers, which she has said are politically motivated.

Moshannon Valley, which Scanlon said has recently housed between 1,200 and 1,700 people, is a former federal prison operated on behalf of ICE by private prison operator GEO Group. The company operates 97 facilities, including the one in Newark where McIver was denied entry.

GEO Group’s contract is with Clearfield County, which provides the space to ICE in an arrangement that circumvents a Biden-era ban on for-profit prisons.

Scanlon said the complaint the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, Legal Services of New Jersey and the University of Pennsylvania law school filed with the Department of Homeland Security has not been resolved. That’s in part, she claimed, because the Trump administration gutted the DHS Office of Civil Rights that was handling it.

The Sheller Center for Social Justice at Temple University Beasley School of Law and the immigrant rights group Juntos also released a report last year based on interviews with 70 people held at Moshannon Valley.

It called for the center to be closed, alleging immigrants and asylum seekers are subject to physical and psychological abuse, lack adequate access to health care, and face retaliation for standing up against mistreatment.

“There are problems that we’re hearing about from a variety of sources, and that’s why we need to be able to get in there and see what the situation is,” Scanlon said.

Scanlon said federal immigration officials have historically been willing to work with members of Congress and advocates to address concerns about conditions in immigration facilities. With the Trump administration’s “rampant ramp up” of deportation and the Republican budget reconciliation bill adding $45 billion to ICE’s budget, Congressional oversight is more important than ever, she said.

“What we’re seeing now is, first of all, a total lack of transparency,” Scanlon said, noting that families, their lawyers and advocates are having difficulty locating people within the immigration system. “There’s a whole host of issues which, if you have transparency, you can then begin to address all of this,” she said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_8034-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 21:56:45.267876

Mike Kehoe is weighing a request from the Trump administration to deploy the state's National Guard to support federal immigration enforcement in Missouri.

If approved, Guard members would help handle administrative and logistical tasks for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — not arrests — according to Kehoe's spokesperson Gabby Picard.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Defense said assistance could include case management, transportation and clerical support for the in and out processing of detainees without legal status.

The Missouri National Guard did not respond to a question on how many troops were requested from the Trump administration.

The request follows a July 25 order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to bring members of military under the command of state governors and authorized them to support immigration enforcement. That adjustment added 500 troops to help the immigration agency, bringing total DoD support to about 1,700 service members.

Picard said Missouri is among 10 new states that could get that extra support. While federally funded, the Guard would remain under Kehoe's authority.

""By providing these crucial services, DoD military personnel directly enable ICE to dedicate more trained agents to core law enforcement activities, significantly enhancing overall effectiveness,"" said Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell in a statement. ""The Department of Defense is committed to supporting the Department of Homeland Security in its mission to maintain the security of our borders and enforce immigration laws.""

As of Friday, 20 states — all led by Republican governors — were either carrying out ICE's request for troops or considering it, according to Stars and Stripes.

Earlier this year, Kehoe declared a state of emergency and activated the state's National Guard ahead of immigration protests in St. Louis that ended up being peaceful. The Guard was ultimately not deployed.

""While other states may wait for chaos to ensue,"" the governor said at the time, ""the State of Missouri is taking a proactive approach in the event that assistance is needed to support local law enforcement in protecting our citizens and communities.""

The Guard deployment would mark the latest expansion of federal law enforcement's presence in St. Louis.

Last week, U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced the FBI would be getting extra staffing to help fight violent crime in the region.

The deployment of the National Guard to help ICE across the U.S. is separate from President Donald Trump's recent decision to send nearly 2,000 federal troops — and counting — to address crime in Democratic-led cities such as Washington, D.C.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials Wednesday denied U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Delaware County, entry to the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania.

A Chinese citizen died in early August while in custody inside the ICE facility. Scanlon said she was there to conduct a congressional oversight visit.

“The private prison director and the ICE manager for the facility came out and told me they knew there was a federal law requiring them to let me in — but that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had ordered them not to allow members of Congress to visit these facilities,” Scanlon said in a video posted to X.

Neither ICE nor the U.S. Department of Homeland Security immediately responded to a request for comment.

Members of Congress are legally allowed to conduct unannounced oversight visits to ICE facilities. The Moshannon Valley Processing Center is the largest in the region. Officials also denied U.S. Rep. Summer Lee, D-Allegheny County, access to the compound Monday.

Scanlon told WHYY News that she’s received complaints about the facility from her constituents. She said she plans to join Democratic lawmakers suing the Trump administration over similar entrance denials.

“There’s a lot of concerns that arise when you have the government incarcerating people and hiding what’s going on behind those walls — and that’s the purpose for doing oversight,” Scanlon said.

While President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown continues, DHS has asserted that members of Congress must provide advanced notice to be granted entry for tours.

Scanlon said there’s a lot at stake in regards to Trump’s immigration policies. She pointed to the administration’s history of detaining and deporting people without a criminal record. ICE is receiving $45 billion from Trump’s latest spending bill, and private prison contractors are benefitting, Scanlon said.

“​​They’re spending an estimated $3.4 million a month at Moshannon in taxpayer dollars, and I think people have a right to know what that money’s being spent on,” she said.

In his separate opinion, Justice Gorsuch rebuked the district court (and other district courts) for failing to follow Supreme Court precedent.
She also expressed concern that the government’s rushed cancellation of funding grants would halt life-saving biomedical research.","On August 21, 2025, the United States Supreme Court allowed the federal government to proceed with the cancelation of $783 million in funding grants from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to universities and research institutions. Previously, a federal district court declared the government’s cancellation of the grants, and the NIH guidance documents on which it relied to cancel those grants, to be unlawful and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied the government’s application to stay the district court’s rulings pending appeal. A closely divided Supreme Court left in place the district court’s ruling vacating the guidance documents while simultaneously staying the district court’s order that invalidated the government’s move to terminate the funding grants.

The justices issued a complicated series of opinions relating to the court’s order. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the majority, concluding that the Court’s split opinion was necessary to ensure the government’s claims are channeled to the appropriate venue in the lower courts. Justice Barrett said the government’s claim regarding its ability to cancel the funding grants belonged before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (“CFC”), which handles contract disputes involving the federal government. But Justice Barrett said the challenge to the NIH’s guidance documents was properly before the federal district court. “Two-track litigation,” she wrote, “results from the jurisdictional scheme governing actions against the United States, which often requires plaintiffs to file two actions in different courts to obtain complete relief in connection with one set of facts.”

The Court also stated in its opinion that the government must be allowed to cancel the funding grants because the funds may not be recoverable after the recipients expended them. The Court reasoned that “the plaintiffs’ contention that they lack the resources to continue their research projects without federal funding is inconsistent with the proposition that they have the resources to make the Government whole for money already spent.”

Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh agreed with Justice Barrett to the extent the Court vacated the district court’s order terminating the NIH funding grants, but they would have also stayed the portion of the district court’s order that declared the NIH’s guidance documents unlawful.

In his separate opinion, Justice Gorsuch rebuked the district court (and other district courts) for failing to follow Supreme Court precedent. Justice Gorsuch wrote that “[l]ower court judges may sometimes disagree with this Court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them.”

Chief Justice Roberts did not agree that the district court was required to split the case into two parts. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson agreed that the plaintiffs were not required to proceed before separate courts.

Justice Jackson, in a sharply worded opinion, criticized the Court for “sending [the] plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief.” She did not agree that the Court’s precedents required allowing the government to terminate the funding grants. She also expressed concern that the government’s rushed cancellation of funding grants would halt life-saving biomedical research.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12073_3056.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 21:56:54.232517

Migrants and refugees deserve the same access to justice and protection under the law as anyone else in this country.","Human rights organisations have condemned the Government’s Home Affairs legislation tabled in Parliament this week, as yet another baseless attack on the rights of migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum.

In a move the organisations say shows blatant disregard for the law, the Albanese Government has introduced legislation that would strip migrants and refugees of their legal rights when sending them to third countries like Nauru, legislating their way out of cases currently before the courts.

The Bill is yet another attempt at rushed law-making, this time stripping protections from migrants and refugees that make sure bungled bureaucratic decisions that affect people’s safety and family integrity can be challenged. It is designed to limit government accountability for making sure those decisions are fair and based in fact.

The Bill also has a retrospective effect – validating incorrect decisions that were made in the past, preventing the right for these decisions to be corrected. The Bill even allows the government to continue to prosecute criminal charges that were brought as a result of incorrect decisions.

Jana Favero, Deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said:

“The decisions are serious and lifelong. We are talking about people being permanently deported to places like Nauru. Decisions like this must not be made without fundamental legal safeguards. This legislation is clearly designed to manipulate the law so that the Government is not accountable to the courts.”

“If the idea of people being deported without the ability or right to challenge the decision makes you think of ICE and Donald Trump – you’d be right. The Albanese government is setting a dangerous precedent of removing people’s legal rights to question when the government has made serious mistakes.”

Sarah Dale, Centre Director and Principal Solicitor at the Refugee Advice and Casework Service said:

“All people are entitled to have such serious legal decisions made about them using the correct facts and law, to have an opportunity to respond, and to be protected from unilateral and unjustified changes to that law by the Government after the fact. These decisions are often life and death. They must be correctly and fairly made, and the Government must not be given power to override the protections of the law in this way.”

“The Courts have already recognised one man was not afforded due process prior to an attempt to forcibly exile him to Nauru. The Government now seeks power to override fair processes – and even the established law – in order to facilitate their powers to remove people, including to harm. It’s dangerous law-making to erode these fundamental protections, that are for all members of the Australian community. It’s a disturbing precedent that attacks the core of our fundamental rights.”

Josephine Langbien, Associate Legal Director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“Just weeks ago, the United Nations’ Human Rights Committee agreed there are serious questions that the Australian Government must answer about its Nauru deportation plans, and the consequences for the people subjected to them. Yet now the Albanese Government wants to permanently exile people to Nauru without having to consider the consequences. This legislation would save the Government from having to consider basic questions like whether someone can access the medical care they need in Nauru, or whether they would be permanently separated from their families. By eliminating safeguards that are designed to ensure fairness and accuracy, the Government is showing that it does not care if it gets these life-changing decisions wrong.”

The group of human rights organisations say this Bill is a blatant attempt at removing scrutiny, stripping people of rights, and shielding the Government from accountability. Migrants and refugees deserve the same access to justice and protection under the law as anyone else in this country. They call on Parliament to reject this dangerous legislation in its entirety.

The lawsuit seeks a $1 million damage claim from the Trump administration, alleging that the student, who is disabled, was waiting for his sister in front of Arleta High School when the “conduct of ICE agents and Border Patrol agents caused the false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, [and] battery” of the boy on Aug. 11, the Los Angeles Times reported.

“Allegations that Border Patrol targeted Arleta High School are FALSE,” said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in response to the lawsuit. “Agents were conducting a targeted operation on [a] criminal illegal alien.”

Andreina Mejia, the student’s mother, said during a Tuesday news conference that at least two masked men with guns approached her and her son from a white truck, separated the two, placed him in handcuffs, and pulled weapons on him.

“I looked at my son’s reaction, and I saw that he was scared,” Mejia said. “He didn’t know what was going on, so I just told him: ‘Don’t make any movement. Don’t move. Just follow instructions.’”

Mejia’s son receives special services for difficulty processing language and expressing himself, she said, and could be at greater risk of being targeted by ICE agents.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claimed that immigration agents had later arrested an undocumented immigrant and suspected ‘MS-13 member’ found to be the boy’s cousin. On Tuesday, attorneys for the Mejia family said the man arrested was not a member of their family and was of a different nationality altogether.

“There’s no resemblance, except for the brown color,” said attorney Michael Carrillo. “That’s why they were confused, thinking that this — her boy — was the gang member when there was never a case.”

Why It Matters

The arrest comes as President Donald Trump's administration ramps up immigration arrests in a bid to deport millions of undocumented immigrants as part of a hard-line deportation operation. Critics says the government has not been abiding by due process rights for immigrants.

What To Know

Obed Elias Gonzalez-Morales, 36, a long-time U.S. resident with children who are U.S. citizens, was arrested on August 10, 2025, while fishing with his family on the Hooper Islands, Maryland, according to his attorney.

Law enforcement reportedly ran his license plate, identified an immigration issue, and detained him as he returned to his vehicle, the family said.

""I didn't even get to ask what crime I had supposedly committed. They just took me away,"" Gonzalez-Morales told Newsweek in an exclusive interview.

""My family was there—my kids. When they saw that, they were shocked and traumatized. They had never seen me like that before. They handcuffed me and took me away right in front of them,"" he said.

Gonzalez-Morales was transferred to Adams County Detention Center in Natchez, Mississippi. On August 15, Judge Thanos Kanellakos of the Hyattsville Immigration Court approved a $15,000 bond, allowing him to be released. His family had been preparing to post the bond on Monday morning.

Instead, Gonzalez-Morales was removed from his cell late Saturday and sent to Guatemala overnight.

""We got a call on Sunday from Mr. Obed that he was in Guatemala,"" family attorney Tilman Dunbar Jr. told Newsweek.

""He was taken from his cell late Saturday night and put on a plane to Guatemala sometime Sunday morning,"" he added.

""Obed Gonzalez-Morales, an illegal alien from Guatemala, was issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge on August 9, 2025. He never posted bond and remained in ICE custody until he was removed to his home country, Guatemala, on August 17, 2025,"" a senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told Newsweek.

A judge-approved bond typically allows detainees to be released pending further hearings.

Gillett said that Gonzalez-Morales was never served with a Notice to Appear or scheduled for a Master Calendar hearing. He added that Gonzalez-Morales has ""strong ties"" to the U.S., including U.S. citizen children, has lived in the country since 2012, and would have sought relief through a Section 42B Application for Cancellation of Removal.

Section 42B allows certain long-term U.S. residents to seek cancellation of removal if they meet specific criteria, including demonstrating strong family and community ties.

Gonzalez-Morales's attorney said he would have been eligible under immigration law.

""The president is doing a lot of harm, separating families. My children are traumatized. They still don't understand why I'm here in my country and not with them. I've always tried to be a good father,"" Gonzalez-Morales said.

He has five children in total, three born in Guatemala and two born in the United States.

What People Are Saying

Chris Yonushonis, a family friend and retired combat veteran, told Newsweek he was ""livid"" following Gonzalez-Morales's removal from the county.

Yonushonis also accused the DHS of violating court orders.

""ICE ignored the orders of a federal judge. We have laws. They apply to the government, too,"" Yonushonis told Newsweek.

""He just disappeared from the ICE detainee lockup after he was trafficked out of the country. We shouldn't say he was deported. Deportation is a legal process that didn't happen here,"" he said.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2710560/ice.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 20:57:01.005462

Even among those who condemn ICE’s presence in state courts, it’s become common to distinguish between “good” immigrants and “bad” ones.
We validate the idea that deportation is a fair consequence in the criminal legal system.","Capitol Weekly welcomes Opinions on California public policy or politics. Click here for more information about submitting an Op-Ed.

OPINION – Since January, ICE agents have arrested at least 22 people at California state courthouses in Fresno – with no regard for due process or dignity. These individuals were not fugitives. Some were awaiting trial and had not been convicted of any crime.

All of them were exercising their right to appear in court.

These raids sabotage the integrity of our courts and undermine our democracy. People miss hearings, delay trials, or plead to charges they would otherwise fight, just to avoid an encounter with ICE and deportation without due process. This shuts down access to courts for an entire class of people. Having access to a judicial system is an integral part of a working democracy. Thus, for many in our community a fundamental pillar of democracy has been removed.

California has tried to resist this intrusion. Our state’s laws and courts have repeatedly said that local law enforcement and courts must not cooperate with immigration enforcement. But ICE has proven willing to bypass those guardrails with brute force. Local law enforcement has turned a blind eye to ICE intrusions.

ICE agents in state courts are an affront to the rule of law. Beyond threatening safety and trust, these raids highlight a deeper moral failure in how our immigration system—and too often, our public discourse—treats people with past criminal convictions.

Even among those who condemn ICE’s presence in state courts, it’s become common to distinguish between “good” immigrants and “bad” ones. Immigrants with no criminal record are seen as deserving of protection, while those with prior convictions are cast aside – as though any contact with the criminal legal system forever forfeits a person’s humanity or right to remain.

Such a belief is to ignore how the war on drugs and the continuing scourge of mass incarceration has created a legal system that is deeply flawed. Communities of color, including immigrant communities, are disproportionately targeted, surveilled, arrested, and prosecuted for crimes that white people commit at similar or higher rates. From widespread stop-and-frisks to massive over policing, the U.S. legal system has created criminal records for generations of people of color, particularly in low-income communities.

To then turn around and say those records justify permanent banishment from the country only deepens the harm.

Consider this: many of the people being picked up by ICE throughout the state because of their contact with the criminal legal system are longtime residents with deep ties to their families and communities. Many of their convictions are years, even decades, old. And many of those convictions are not grounds for removal under federal immigration law. But ICE doesn’t care. Their tactics are aggressive, their targets broad, and their discretion virtually unchecked.

If we continue to draw a line between “innocent” immigrants and “criminal” ones, we cede ground to a system that was never just to begin with. We validate the idea that deportation is a fair consequence in the criminal legal system. We ignore the racial and economic disparities that drive that system. And we forget that redemption, rehabilitation, and belonging are core American values.

The answer is recognizing that every immigrant, every person in our society, deserves due process, dignity, and the opportunity to stay rooted in their community.

When we accept deportation as a natural extension of a criminal conviction, we are punishing entire communities, turning courtrooms into trapdoors, and undermining the very idea of justice.

Public defenders, immigrant rights organizations, and community members have been sounding the alarm for years: ICE’s presence in our courts is a threat to public safety and the very foundation of equal justice. It’s time we listen—and act—not only to stop these raids, but to challenge the false hierarchy of human worth they represent.

Newsweek reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security via email for comment.

Why It Matters

Levit's case spotlights the Trump administration's broader illegal immigration crackdown, which includes apprehending non-violent individuals who lack the proper credentials to remain in the United States.

His family claims he was never provided with green card interviews for the majority of the last decade.

In February, a lawsuit was filed against ICE representing 276 immigrants from ex-Soviet countries, including Russia, Georgia and Kazakhstan, who claimed that they were detained and locked up for extended periods of time, violating federal law and internal policies, according to the Louisiana Illuminator.

In June, ICE reported its arrest of a 39-year-old, Tajikistan-born Russian national in Philadelphia who was wanted overseas for being suspected of being a member of the Al-Qaeda terrorist organization.

What To Know

Levit and his Slinger, Wisconsin-based family, which includes his wife and four children (ages 8, 6 and 4-year-old twins), fled Russia over eight years ago to seek asylum in the U.S. due to Levit ""facing persecution for refusing to participate in corrupt practices,"" according to a GoFundMe started by his wife. As of Wednesday morning, $1,650 had been raised of its goal of $5,500.

The husband and father has been detained for over three weeks. Photos show him wearing a hard hat and safety gear as part of his job. The job title was never mentioned.

""As a dedicated public servant, he always upheld the values of honesty and integrity,"" the GoFundMe states. ""However, this commitment came at a devastating cost. Our family was forced to leave behind a life we cherished, filled with love and hope, as threats, searches and even an assassination attempt made it clear that our safety was in jeopardy.

""The fear for our lives pushed us to start anew in a foreign land, without connections and with limited English. We faced countless challenges, losing everything multiple times, yet we persevered.""

The crowdfunding campaign alleges that Levit was taken into custody ""in handcuffs and chains, without explanation"" as he left for work one day. It also alleges that Russian authorities issued an Interpol request for his arrest, seeking to deport him back to a country ""where he would face certain death or imprisonment for his beliefs.""

""The Russian government is relentless in its pursuit of those they deem undesirable, and they have taken away my beloved husband and the father of our four young children,"" says the GoFundMe. ""Throughout our time in the U.S., we had an attorney who was supposed to guide us and represent us, but on that fateful day he abandoned us, leaving us without support when we needed it most.

""We lost all the money we had paid him, and now we find ourselves in desperate need of funds to hire a new attorney.""

They added that ""without legal representation, the odds are stacked against us,"" saying that individuals in his position who lack counsel ""almost always lose.""

The Trump administration is restoring an immigration policy that was last used under former President George H.W. Bush's tenure to conduct neighborhood investigations related to immigrants applying for U.S. naturalization, according to a policy memo released Tuesday by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

""U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is resuming personal investigations of aliens applying for naturalization in accordance with section 335(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" the memo, dated Aug. 22 but released publicly Tuesday, states.

The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act abolished immigration quotas and championed welcoming ""those who can contribute most to this country — to its growth, to its strength, to its spirit,"" according to President Lyndon B. Johnson's remarks at the time of him signing the act into law.

The administration's revitalization of personal investigations, also called ""neighborhood checks,"" will include U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services requesting information from immigrants seeking naturalization, such as ""testimonial letters from neighbors, employers, co-workers, and business associates who know the alien and can provide substantiated information about the alien, including any of the requirements for naturalization.""

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is an office under the Department of Homeland Security's umbrella that oversees the nation's legal immigration processing.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO VET LEGAL IMMIGRANT APPLICANTS FOR 'ANTI-AMERICANISM' AND ANTISEMITISM

The memorandum stated that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ""generally waives the requirements for neighborhood investigations"" under the 1965 law and historically had relied instead on FBI background checks to determine an ""applicant’s good moral character and eligibility for naturalization.""

The personal investigations will now include interviewing a naturalization applicant's neighbors and employment history stretching back at least five years before an individual applied for naturalization, according to the memo. The checks are to ensure ""scrutiny of an alien’s residency, good moral character, attachment to the U.S. Constitution, and disposition to the good order and happiness of the United States.""

TRUMP ADMIN TO WEIGH US CITIZENSHIP APPLICANTS' 'POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS,' GOOD MORAL CHARACTER

Such investigations were last conducted in 1991 during the first Bush's tenure, according to the memo. Similar investigations were carried out on immigrants applying for naturalization as far back as 1802, the memo added.

""From 1802 to 1981, petitioners for naturalization were required to present two witnesses who could testify to their qualifications for citizenship,"" the memo stated. ""In 1981, Congress eliminated the requirement for witnesses, a change justified in part by the fact that a petitioner’s character could be better determined by an investigation, including a neighborhood investigation, if necessary.

""However, by 1991, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service had essentially stopped conducting neighborhood investigations.""

TOP DHS OFFICIAL CALLS CITIZENSHIP TEST 'TOO SOFT,' URGES MAJOR OVERHAUL OF NATURALIZATION PROCESS

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services celebrated the return of the personal investigations.

Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in comments provided to Fox News Digital Wednesday that the office ""is working to ensure that only the most qualified applicants receive American citizenship.""

""The Immigration and Nationality Act directs USCIS to conduct personal investigations, and incorporating neighborhood investigations will help enhance these statutorily required investigations to ensure that we are meeting congressional intent,"" he continued. ""Americans should be comforted knowing that USCIS is taking seriously its responsibility to ensure aliens are being properly vetted and are of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.""

The invitation, which came in an email sent last week by DHS to North Carolina’s GOP-controlled election board, appears to signal the administration’s latest step to encourage states to use data managed by the federal government to hunt for noncitizens on the rolls.

In the August 21 email, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) official invited North Carolina to participate in the limited rollout, which the official called “an exciting opportunity.”

The email was sent to the North Carolina board’s associate general counsel and posted online as part of the agenda for a Wednesday board meeting.

“This soft launch is by invitation only—we are not announcing its availably [sic] for widespread use at this time,” wrote the USCIS official, Timothy Benz. “SAVE needs to throttle the intake of these cases at the outset, as we know the demand will be high and want to ensure the system’s ability to meet the increased demand. We are prioritizing your state due to prior participation and engagements between our agencies.”

At Wednesday’s regularly-scheduled public meeting, the North Carolina State Board of Elections tabled discussion of participating in the DHS soft launch after returning from a lengthy closed session.

After returning to public session and voting on other matters, board chair Francis X. De Luca (R) said the board would “skip” the SAVE agenda item.

“We are going to put that off for another day. We’re not dealing with that issue,” De Luca said. “We discussed some of the [legal] details in closed session and decided that we weren’t ready to deal with that issue.”

The email requested North Carolina upload their citizenship confirmation request to SAVE on Wednesday, and provide in advance the number of registrations the Board would upload in bulk for verification.

By tabling the matter, the Board effectively declined the offer to test the system’s new capabilities, although the email did say rescheduling may be possible.

President Donald Trump ordered DHS in March to make the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program available for free to state election officials for confirming the citizenship status of registered voters. SAVE uses various federal databases to flag whether someone is a non-citizen, and was originally developed to check eligibility for federal benefits programs through one-by-one queries.

Since the order, CIS integrated data from the Social Security Administration and added the ability to perform citizenship checks in bulk. The latest upgrade allows election officials to use just the last four digits of a social security number — rather than requiring all nine — along with the individual’s name and date of birth when submitting a citizenship check request.

Under the federal Help Americans Vote Act, when someone registers to vote, state election officers must ask for either their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their social security number. Allowing election officials to use SAVE with just the last four social security number digits, rather than all nine, would let them rely on readily available data to use SAVE.

State election officials were invited to the White House last month where CIS officials pitched them on an untested solution for a nearly nonexistent problem. Before that, the administration provided a briefing on using SAVE to the Election Integrity Network, a far-right anti-voting group founded by lawyer Cleta Mitchell.

Using SAVE for purging voter registration rolls has led voting-rights groups and Democratic officials to question whether DHS has complied with federal data laws, which generally require federal agencies to give public notice before using personal data in novel ways.

The expansion also comes amid renewed concerns about the Trump administration’s cybersecurity lapses. The Department of Government Efficiency uploaded a database with every American’s name, date of birth and social security number to an unsecured cloud server in June, according to a recent whistleblowing complaint filed by the Social Security Administration’s chief data officer.

According to CIS records, twenty states, as well as a few dozen local election offices, are currently registered to use the SAVE program for voter roll maintenance.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration’s attempt to work with North Carolina’s elections board comes as no surprise.

After the GOP lost the North Carolina gubernatorial race in 2024, the Republican-dominated legislature transferred the power to appoint members of the elections board from the Democratic governor to the Republican state auditor. That maneuver led to Republicans controlling three of the Board’s five seats.

The Republicans on the board quickly ousted its longtime executive director, a respected nonpartisan election administrator, and replaced her with Sam Hayes, a GOP operative who was serving as chief counsel to the House Speaker.

Under Hayes, the board coordinated with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in response to a lawsuit filed by the DOJ aiming to require the state to tighten its rules on what identifying information votes must provide. Voting advocates have expressed concern that the board’s new requirement that some voters provide additional information could lead valid voters to be removed from the rolls and disenfranchised.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/North-Carolina-State-Capitol-in-Raleigh-AdobeStock_161544367-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 18:57:44.133738

Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday said ""masked ICE agents"" have ""not worked"" and called National Guard troops sent from other states inefficient under President Trump's federal takeover.

The big picture: Despite the critique, Bowser's 20-day review of the crackdown was overwhelmingly positive — a significant tone shift for the mayor, who suggested she and Trump are on the same page when it comes to ""priorities around safety and investment in infrastructure.""

Driving the news: Bowser pledged support for Trump's $2 billion request to Congress to ""beautify"" D.C. parks, fountains, streets and more.

She also praised what she calls the ""federal surge"" for reducing crime in D.C. Bowser said having more federal law enforcement on city streets has helped tamp down on illegal guns, carjackings, and homicides.

""We think that there's more accountability in the system, or at least perceived accountability in the system, that is driving down illegal behavior,"" Bowser said at the Wednesday press conference.

By the numbers: There's been an 87% drop in D.C. carjackings over the 20-day period compared to the same time last year, per the mayor.

D.C.'s data also shows a 15% decline in overall crime from the same period in 2024.

Yes, but: While the mayor painted a Trumpian gold lining on much of the enforcement, she specifically targeted masked ICE agents and out-of-town National Guards members as examples of ""what's not working.""

She also called out ""a break in trust between police and community,"" as federal officers team up with D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

What they're saying: ""I am devastated by people living in fear,"" Bowser said, acknowledging that ""there's tremendous anxiety in the District.""

Between the lines: D.C.'s sanctuary city status has come under question, amid a spike in noncriminal ICE arrests and MPD's cooperation with immigration authorities.

Bowser clarified: ""There's been no change to the law,"" nor ""sanctuary values.""

Bowser also noted D.C.'s small but ""highly visible"" homeless encampment population, which has been targeted in clearings under the federal takeover.

She plans to take a census later this week to quantify and locate homeless individuals, and connect people to shelters and services.

Zoom out: Bowser, who had previously called federalizing D.C.'s police force an ""authoritarian push,"" was notably deferential toward Trump days after he issued a warning shot from the Oval Office:

""Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor very long because we'll take it over with the federal government, run it like it's supposed to be run,"" the president said Friday.

Bowser held Wednesday's press conference after speaking with Trump, a meeting she compared to one during his first days in office, ""where we discussed shared priorities for the District.""

Bowser noted that Trump's ""knowledge of D.C. had significantly increased from the first time he was in the White House.""

What we're watching: Bowser highlighted more long-term solutions for effective local control: more MPD, prosecutors, judges, and effective prevention programs.

A big priority: recruiting 500 new MPD officers over the next few years.

The bottom line: What the Trump administration calls a takeover, Bowser is framing as an investment in D.C.'s future.

Take Union Station. On Wednesday, the Department of Transportation took control of its management.

Bowser said a ""total transformation"" of the station would be an ""amazing initiative,"" and told Trump it could be ""a very significant and good investment for this region.""

In its holding, the Seventh Circuit emphasizes “flexibility” because “a plaintiff is not automatically entitled to notice” even if a “material dispute” exists.
Other circuit courts have departed from Lusardi and established their own approaches.
The Seventh Circuit declined to adopt either approach in Richards.
Consequently, the Seventh Circuit’s decision marks a shift in how collective actions are evaluated, and it offers a better opportunity for employers to challenge whether a proposed collective is truly similarly situated.","In a recent decision, the Seventh Circuit favorably revised the standard for defendant employers faced with a putative collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). In Richards v. Eli Lilly & Co., the court departed from the widely-adopted lenient standard used to analyze a plaintiff’s request to send notice to putative collective action members set forth in Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. The Seventh Circuit, which governs district courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, has instead adopted a balanced approach that requires district courts to consider evidence from both sides with respect to similarity and allows them to issue notice to potential plaintiffs only when there is “at least a material factual dispute” of whether individuals are indeed similarly situated.

The Basics

Section 216(b) of the FLSA allows employees to bring wage actions against their employer on behalf of themselves or other “similarly situated” employees, and the ADEA incorporates this provision to allow employees to form collective actions when suing an employer for age discrimination. However, without a national standard from Congress or the Supreme Court, district courts have been left to decide how and when to permit notice to go out to other potential plaintiffs. This vacuum gave rise to the two-step approach from Lusardi.

In Lusardi, a 1987 decision from the District Court in New Jersey, the court split the collective action into two steps. The first step requires a plaintiff seeking to send notice to make a “modest factual showing” that they and the potential plaintiffs were subject to the same unlawful plan or policy by their employer. Once a plaintiff has met this low burden, the court then authorized notice to those individuals, who could then opt into the collective action. The second step occurs once discovery is complete, when the employer typically challenges whether the collective is indeed similarly situated by moving to decertify the collective action.

The New Seventh Circuit Approach

In declining to follow Lusardi, the Seventh Circuit held that a plaintiff must at least show that a “material factual dispute” exists as to whether the proposed collective is similarly situated. This is viewed as a higher evidentiary burden on the named plaintiffs, who must demonstrate that they and the proposed collective were subject to the same unlawful plan or policy. Additionally (and crucially), district courts must now permit defendants to submit evidence rebutting a plaintiff’s claim that a collective is appropriate. By doing so, courts will evaluate the extent to which plaintiffs engage with and respond to opposing evidence.

This differs from the Lusardi standard in two ways. First, plaintiffs must now cross a higher evidentiary threshold to justify issuing notice to a potential collective. Second, courts will consider evidence by both parties—not just a “modest” showing by the plaintiff—before deciding whether notice is appropriate.

In its holding, the Seventh Circuit emphasizes “flexibility” because “a plaintiff is not automatically entitled to notice” even if a “material dispute” exists. District courts may still use the two-step approach and issue notice to the proposed collective if they believes that necessary evidence is in the hands of potential plaintiffs. Alternatively, if a court believes that a similarity dispute can be resolved before authorizing notice, it may allow limited discovery to decide whether or not notice is appropriate.

Other circuit courts have departed from Lusardi and established their own approaches. For example, the Fifth Circuit demands plaintiffs prove by a “preponderance of the evidence” that the individuals are similarly situated before the court permits notice to issue. This means the plaintiff bears the burden from the outset of a case to definitively prove that certification is warranted. The Sixth Circuit, on the other hand, requires a “strong likelihood” that the potential plaintiffs are similarly situated, and a court may expedite discovery to decide whether notice is appropriate. The Seventh Circuit declined to adopt either approach in Richards. With a range of approaches emerging, this could set the stage for resolution by the Supreme Court.

Conclusion

Before Richards, defendants were left with very few options, while plaintiffs were permitted to form potentially oversized collectives that may have included both eligible and ineligible plaintiffs. As the Seventh Circuit admitted, this meant defendants were susceptible to higher discovery costs, premature settlements, and an influx of potential claimants who may choose to bring their own individual lawsuits.

Consequently, the Seventh Circuit’s decision marks a shift in how collective actions are evaluated, and it offers a better opportunity for employers to challenge whether a proposed collective is truly similarly situated. Employers who respond strategically could see reduced litigation and/or settlement costs and increase the odds of defeating the certification of a collective action. Affected Employers should reach out to their employment counsel with any questions or explore this development further.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15069_1440.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 18:57:56.249320

The rule would set the initial admission period for foreign media representatives at up to 240 days.

WASHINGTON, DC – Wednesday, the Trump Administration announced a proposed rule that, if finalized, would limit the length of time certain visa holders – including foreign students– are allowed to stay in the United States, thereby curbing visa abuse and increasing the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to properly vet and oversee these individuals.

“For too long, past Administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the U.S. virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amount of taxpayer dollars, and disadvantaging U.S. citizens,” said a DHS spokesperson. “This new proposed rule would end that abuse once and for all by limiting the amount of time certain visa holders are allowed to remain in the U.S., easing the burden on the federal government to properly oversee foreign students and their history.”

Since 1978, foreign students (F visa holders) have been admitted into the U.S. for an unspecified period known as “duration of status.” Unlike other visas issued, those with a “duration of status” designation are allowed to remain in the U.S. for an indefinite amount of time without further screening and vetting.

In turn, foreign students have taken advantage of U.S. generosity and have become “forever” students, perpetually enrolled in higher education courses to remain in the U.S.

Under President Trump’s proposed rule, the federal government would set the authorized admission and extension periods for foreign students and exchange visitors up to the duration of the program they are participating in, not to exceed a 4-year period. The rule would set the initial admission period for foreign media representatives at up to 240 days. Foreign media representatives would be eligible for an extension period of up to 240 days, but no longer than the length of the temporary activity or assignment.

Additionally, admitting foreign students, exchange, and foreign media classifications for a fixed period of time would require said aliens to for apply for authorization to extend their stay with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), therefore requiring regular assessments by DHS for the alien to remain in the U.S. for a longer period.

This would allow DHS to conduct proper oversight as part of SEVP and SEVIS by making access to necessary information more accessible and reducing the number of individuals here on visas.

This proposed rule was first proposed under President Trump in 2020 but was withdrawn by the Biden Administration in 2021 much to the detriment of U.S. citizens and taxpayers.

Local officials, however, said the cost of holding ICE detainees was too much for the county to bear.","As President Donald Trump ramps up immigration enforcement efforts and arrests multiply statewide, Nevada's main immigration detention center has become one of the most over-capacity immigration facilities in the nation.

As of April 2025, the Nevada Southern Detention Center, located in Pahrump, exceeded its contractual capacity with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by more than 40 people per day, according to data obtained by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC). The facility — which houses a mix of detainees from ICE, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshals and can hold up to 1,064 people overall — is only contracted to hold a maximum of 250 ICE detainees per day.

At its peak this fiscal year, the center had exceeded its ICE capacity by more than 200 at 462, making it among the 10 most-overcrowded immigration facilities out of the nation's 180 ICE detention centers, according to TRAC.

Contractual capacity measures the number of detainees a private prison agrees to hold — so it doesn’t necessarily mean an entire building is physically crowded. ICE also doesn’t release capacity figures in real time, so TRACs data lags behind current conditions. And TRAC’s latest measure showed that across all facilities nationwide, ICE is only using about 76 percent of its contractual capacity.

But the situation in Nevada could be part of the rationale for creating more detention facilities in the state.

The findings were released a few weeks before The Washington Post revealed that ICE was eyeing creating a new facility in Nevada, called a “soft-side” facility, which is a makeshift structure composed of tents. Such a facility would double detention capacity in Nevada, adding space for an additional 450 people, per documents obtained by The Washington Post that The Nevada Independent has not been able to independently verify.

Arrests, detention spending on the rise

Officials from CoreCivic, the private company that oversees the Nevada Southern Detention Center, have said that ballooning immigration arrests have increased demand for detention space. They said they expect demand to increase even more with the passage of Trump’s budget bill, which pumps more than $45 billion into expanding detention capacity nationwide and $29.9 billion towards the agencies’ enforcement operations through 2029.

Already in the first six months of Trump’s term, immigration arrests in Nevada have jumped nearly 300 percent compared with the same time period in 2024. Seventy percent of those people had not committed a violent or sex crime.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill has changed dramatically the activity of ICE and securing bed capacity,” Damon T. Hininger, the CEO of CoreCivic, said during an Aug. 11 earnings call. “This increase in law enforcement personnel will obviously raise the level of individuals arrested and the requirement for detention capacity.”

CoreCivic already entered a new contract in February to increase capacity at the Nevada Southern Detention Center.

In a recent earnings report from CoreCivic, company officials said they had several “soft-side” contracts in the works, although they did not provide details about where and when the contracts would take effect.

“We are in various stages of negotiation on multiple idled facilities to provide additional bed capacity to ICE,” Hininger said during the August earnings call.

The number of ICE detainees at the Nevada Southern Detention Center marks a dramatic increase from the number of people detained during former President Joe Biden’s administration. At the end of 2023, 163 people were detained at the facility, according to an ICE end-of-year report.

The other facilities to most exceed daily detention capacity are the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami, the Clay County Justice Center in Indiana, and Kandiyohi County Jail in Minnesota.

CoreCivic referred The Indy to ICE for additional information on any contracts and said in a statement that it stays ""in regular contact with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and all our government partners to understand their changing needs, and we work within their established procurement processes.”

ICE responded “acknowledging receipt of your query. Thank you.""

Elected officials raise questions

Officials have recently raised concerns about access to resources at the detention center. Last week, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) put out a statement calling for increased oversight of the facility after being denied a visit, and the Latino Legislative Caucus, which visited earlier this summer, raised concerns about access to legal services. Last year, more than 30 reports of medical negligence, racial discrimination and verbal assault prompted a federal investigation into the facility.

“I spoke with nine detainees today, and what they shared with me is deeply concerning,” Horsford said in a statement. “Medical treatment can take weeks; detainees do not have reliable access to immigration attorneys or resources; and many have been moved across state lines in the dead of night without advanced notice or understanding of where they were going.”

Discussion of a new facility comes as local jails have struggled to keep up with the fiscal demands of supporting ICE operations. In November, the Nye County Detention Center in Pahrump terminated a contract in place from 2019 to house ICE inmates alongside the county’s other inmates. Before the contract ended, it was the state’s second largest ICE holding facility. Local officials, however, said the cost of holding ICE detainees was too much for the county to bear.

“I don’t think it's to anyone’s advantage except ICE,” former Republican Commissioner Donna Cox said about the contract during a county meeting.

The Henderson Detention Center, which also holds a mix of local detainees and people arrested by ICE, has only seen a slight uptick in people detained by the agency. At the end of fiscal year 2023, 69 people were held there on behalf of ICE, in comparison to the 76 people held by the fiscal year 2025 to date, according to ICE data.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2025/07/fcc17134-nllc-ice-visit-1-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 20:57:04.789171

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has denied the allegations.
If Abrego Garcia is sent by passenger jet, it would be unusual if he were the only deportee on the flight, he says.
More than 250 Venezuelans were repatriated following detention in the same Salvadoran prison that housed Abrego Garcia.
It's unclear what would happen to Abrego Garcia once in Uganda, says Nelson Kasfir, an emeritus professor of government at Dartmouth who studies Africa.","The Trump administration says it intends to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia — the man who was wrongfully sent to El Salvador in March before being returned to the U.S. — to Uganda, a country with which he has no connection, in what experts describe as a costly, complex and legally questionable move.

A federal judge in Maryland has set a next hearing for Oct. 6 and blocked his deportation before then. In the meantime, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said Wednesday that he wants to seek asylum in the U.S. as part of a new claim based on a fear of persecution.

In a statement on Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem justified the administration's targeting of Abrego Garcia by repeating allegations against him. ""President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator, to terrorize American citizens any longer,"" Noem said.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has denied the allegations. He has not been convicted of any crimes and has not been formally charged with being a gang member.

Abrego Garcia, who has a family in Maryland, returned to the U.S. in June, after spending several weeks in El Salvador's notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo prison — known as CECOT. He was then immediately detained, after being indicted on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. Last week, he was released from pretrial detention but then was re-arrested by ICE agents on Monday in Baltimore.

U.S. officials said they would send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty and served any sentence in the U.S., but he declined the offer.

For now, he's being held at a detention center in Virginia. But his ultimate fate remains unclear.

If the courts ultimately approve his removal, here is the process by which that might occur.

An escorted flight

Abrego Garcia would likely be placed on a chartered passenger plane or military transport, accompanied by ICE agents who are part of the agency's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) unit, according to César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at the Ohio State University who studies immigration.

""He would be physically shackled — most likely at the ankles, sometimes also handcuffed — for the entire length of the flight, which could be many, many hours,"" García Hernández says.

If Abrego Garcia is sent by passenger jet, it would be unusual if he were the only deportee on the flight, he says. ""Most of the aircraft ICE uses are large passenger aircraft — Boeing 737s — and that's why we typically do not see ICE deport one person at a time. These flights are simply too expensive.""

Jacqueline Stevens, a political science professor at Northwestern University, says that when people were deported to South Sudan, some were flown as far as Djibouti on a private jet, and then from Djibouti to South Sudan on a military plane. (However, those flights also faced legal challenges and may not be indicative of what happens on future flights.)

She says the optics of sending Abrego Garcia on his own wouldn't be good, especially for an administration that has billed itself as using taxpayer money wisely. ""That's not going to be a good look"" for ICE, she says.

Earlier this year, immigration officials admitted that deporting Abrego Garicia to El Salvador was due to an ""administrative error."" It occurred in violation of an immigration judge ruling in 2019 that he was deportable, but not back to El Salvador, where he had a ""well-founded fear"" of gang persecution.

Uganda's foreign ministry said last week that it reached a ""temporary"" agreement with the U.S. to accept deportees, saying it was meant for people ""who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin.""

It said as a condition of the agreement, ""individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted."" It also said that Uganda ""prefers"" to take individuals from other African countries.

NPR reached out to the Ugandan embassy and the Department of Homeland Security for specific information about how Abrego Garcia's removal and transfer might occur. Ugandan officials did not immediately reply. DHS referred back to Noem's original statement without providing details.

Although Abrego Garcia's case is still being adjudicated, he wouldn't be the first migrant to be deported to a third country in recent months. In July, the U.S. removed five migrants to Eswatini, a landlocked kingdom in Southern Africa formerly known as Swaziland. That same month, eight men were sent to South Sudan, only one of whom was from there. More than 250 Venezuelans were repatriated following detention in the same Salvadoran prison that housed Abrego Garcia.

Anwen Hughes, director of legal strategy for refugee programs at Human Rights First, says that it isn't illegal for the U.S. to try to deport a person to a third country, but the law ""requires them to run through a hierarchy of countries before deciding to send, for example, a Vietnamese person to South Sudan,"" she says. ""They do not seem to be operating that way.""

Hughes is part of a legal team that filed a motion for a class certification and a temporary restraining order in March challenging ICE's policy on removing individuals to third countries without notice.

""It's highly unusual for the United States to deport someone to a country to which they have no ties,"" says García Hernández. ""Almost always, deportations are to a person's country of citizenship or prior residence.""

Handover upon landing in Uganda

Once the plane carrying Abrego Garcia and his ICE escorts lands in Uganda, the agents will likely hand over paperwork attesting to his identity, criminal history and medical records, according to García Hernández. ""At that point, the U.S. is essentially done.""

From there, it would be up to Uganda to decide what to do, he says.

""Any claims of criminal activity are fair game for Ugandan officials,"" he says, adding that ""it's a tough sell for a foreign government to welcome into their community someone the U.S. president and his Cabinet have repeatedly described as horrifically dangerous,"" despite Abrego Garcia's lack of criminal record.

It's unclear what would happen to Abrego Garcia once in Uganda, says Nelson Kasfir, an emeritus professor of government at Dartmouth who studies Africa. ""I do not think they would detain or harm him,"" Kasfir says. ""I also doubt they would promptly re-deport him, but that's harder to say.""

Kristof Titeca, a professor at Antwerp University in Belgium who studies African governance, notes that it's not the first time Uganda has hosted ""failed asylum seekers"" from other countries. In 2018, for example, it hosted Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers deported from Israel. In that instance, they were allowed to stay in a Kampala hotel for a few nights, ""then left to their own devices,"" he says. ""Contrary to what they were promised, they also didn't get a residence permit. Many of them decided to flee to Europe.""

Opposition figures in Uganda pushed back on the scheme, saying parliament in the largely authoritarian country had not been given a say in the agreement with the U.S. Details remain largely unknown about the deal brokered between President Yoweri Museveni — who is seeking to extend his nearly 40-year rule in next year's elections — and the U.S.

""We don't know the exact arrangement, the circumstances, who is being brought, how many are being brought,"" Joel Ssenyonyi, the leader of opposition in parliament, told NPR. ""If these are being considered misfits in the U.S., what makes them fit to be here in Uganda?""

García Hernández thinks that by sending Abrego Garcia to Uganda, ""the Trump administration is trying to circumnavigate an immigration judge's order barring deportation to El Salvador by triangulating — sending him to Uganda first.""

Sandoval-Moshenberg, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, tells NPR that Uganda has given no assurances that his client can stay in that country and ""not be quickly re-deported to his country of citizenship.""

As the administration aggressively pursues its immigration enforcement agenda, it is creating a crisis in the nation’s education system—one that’s leaving thousands of children behind academically and emotionally.

Short-Term Impact: Absenteeism and Fear in the Classroom

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has significantly increased enforcement through workplace raids, neighborhood sweeps, and community targeting, including near schools and places of worship. Policies that once protected these “sensitive locations” were revoked in January 2025. As a result, the second half of the 2024-2025 school year saw a chilling effect where families were pulling their children out of school, terrified that a parent, family member, or child could be detained or deported as some students and families have been.

When students are too afraid to go to school or are too distracted by the threat of family separation to focus, their education suffers. And these aren’t isolated cases. As of 2023, approximately 5 million children in the U.S. live with at least one undocumented family member. The scale of the impact is national.

Long-Term Consequences: A Threat to the Right to Education

Another insidious threat lies in how Trump-era policies and rhetoric have emboldened some states to go further and challenge the very right of immigrant children to receive an education. This year, lawmakers in states like Oklahoma and Tennessee proposed legislation that would require school districts to report undocumented students, charge them to attend school, or deny enrollment to children without legal immigration status. Neither of these efforts passed, yet other threats persist.

These efforts are a clear attack on the landmark 1982 Supreme Court case Plyler v. Doe, which ruled that all children, regardless of immigration status, have the right to a free public education. If these state efforts were to succeed, hundreds of thousands of children (there were about 1 million undocumented children aged 5-18 in 2023) could be barred from education, creating devastating cycles of poverty, social exclusion, and growing inequality.

Community Resistance and Local Advocacy

In the face of these threats, many states, local school districts, community organizations, and grassroots leaders continue to show up for their students and their families. Across the country, states like Illinois have passed legislation that preserves access to education, regardless of immigration status. School districts like Los Angeles have introduced policies to protect immigrant families. Teachers can also undergo training on how to support undocumented students and respond if enforcement actions occur.

The dedication of local leadership and grassroots mobilization sends a clear message: schools should be safe spaces for learning, not sites of fear and exclusion.

The Role of AI in Surveillance and Deportation

Adding another layer of complexity is the increasing use of artificial intelligence in immigration enforcement. Under contracts with tech companies, ICE has gained access to powerful AI tools that aggregate data from sources such as IRS records, Social Security files, passports, and license-plate readers. These systems often operate without transparency or oversight and can disproportionately impact immigrant communities.

There are growing concerns that AI-driven surveillance could be used to track migrants, refugees and asylum seekers who engage with public services, including school enrollment. AI is already being used to track and revoke the visas of international students across the United States.

Though the full impact of the technology is still being assessed, its usage and reach are expanding rapidly. Without safeguards, these tools risk deepening mistrust in public institutions and further alienating vulnerable families.

Moving Forward: Protecting Every Child’s Right to Learn

Trauma, disrupted schooling, and the erosion of trust in institutions have long-term consequences for both individuals and the broader society. But hope remains in the resilient and compassionate responses from communities across the country, dedicated to keeping schools as safe spaces where everyone can learn.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-impact-learning-classroom-shadows-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 16:56:54.409377

In a statement, Valerie Zink said, “By repeating Israel’s genocidal fabrications without determining if they have any credibility … Western media outlets have made possible the killing of more journalists in two years on one tiny strip of land than in WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine combined.”

Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch is saying that U.S. forces and personnel can be held liable for Israeli war crimes for “providing intelligence for Israeli strikes and conducting extensive coordination and planning.”

In Israel, nationwide protests are continuing. On Tuesday, more than 350,000 people gathered at Tel Aviv’s public plaza calling on the government to accept a ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza. Large protests were also held in Jerusalem. This is Michal Gomel Blank, a protester in Jerusalem.

Michal Gomel Blank: “We are here demonstrating in front of the Cabinet, the government meeting that is supposed to discuss a deal, a deal for returning the hostages and end the fighting and the war. And we are here to remind our government that the deal needs to be sealed. All the hostages need to come back home, and we need to stop the war in order to do this.”

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces are conducting a raid on Nablus. At least 80 Palestinians have been injured. This comes a day after Israeli forces raided Ramallah and al-Bireh. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, 58 people were injured, eight by live fire and 14 by rubber-coated bullets. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said that a child had to receive surgery after being hit by live fire. Israeli forces detained three Palestinians in the raid.

Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley visited the West Bank Tuesday and stopped at a Palestinian church in Taybeh that was attacked by Israeli settlers. Senator Van Hollen called for an end to settler violence.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen: “Well, we’re here, overall, because we want to focus on the really terrible situation throughout this area, including the war in Gaza. And one of our messages, we need to end the war in Gaza and bring the hostages home. But we also need to end this continued settler violence on the West Bank, which people here in this town of Taybeh witnessed and experienced firsthand.”

A coalition of 100 human and civil rights groups are calling on Secretary of State Marco Rubio to secure the release of Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian American who has been held in Israeli prison for six months. The coalition includes the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Center for Constitutional Rights and Pax Christi USA.

In a joint letter, the groups say, “Mohammed is suffering from scabies and has not received any medication; he has also lost over 30 pounds due to Israel denying him food and medical treatment.” He was abducted from his family home in the West Bank over allegations of rock throwing and is currently being held in Israel’s Ofer Prison, known for its human rights abuses. Mohammed Ibrahim is the cousin of Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian American who was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in July.

A Democratic National Committee panel has rejected a resolution calling for an arms embargo on Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza. The vote came during a DNC meeting in Minneapolis. A second resolution on Israel was initially approved but then withdrawn by its author, DNC Chair Ken Martin. Martin then called for a task force to be formed to help build party unity on the issue. We will speak to the sponsor of the arms embargo resolution later in the program.

In a memo obtained by CBS News, the administration detailed plans to interview neighbors and colleagues of citizenship applicants, reviving a procedure last used by the George H.W. Bush administration. The government had previously waived neighborhood investigations, instead relying on the FBI to conduct background checks of immigrants. The investigations would focus on the moral character of applicants and whether applicants are “well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.”

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has asked a federal appeals court to put on hold a judge’s ruling last week that could force the closure of a new immigration jail in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge had ordered the Trump administration to stop transferring immigrants to the jail. Meanwhile, weekly vigils are continuing to be held outside the immigration jail to protest what organizers have described as the inhumane treatment of people detained inside.

Republican governors in 19 states have begun mobilizing the National Guard to assist ICE with immigration enforcement efforts. The Pentagon has confirmed reports up to 1,700 National Guard members will be deployed in the states. This comes as President Trump is threatening to send the National Guard to police Chicago against the wishes of local officials.

In other immigration news, The Lever reports ICE is shielding details about its deportation flights by taking advantage of a regulatory loophole that was designed to make it harder to track the private flights of celebrities, including Taylor Swift. In recent months, a number of private charter airlines working with ICE have added their planes to a special list developed by the private jet lobby to keep flight data more secret.

On Tuesday, during a three-hour Cabinet meeting, President Trump said that his administration will seek the death penalty in all murder cases in Washington, D.C. He failed to provide any details on the policy, considering the fact that the District of Columbia does not authorize capital punishment.

President Donald Trump: “Anybody murders something in the capital, capital punishment. Capital? Capital punishment. If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington, D.C., we’re going to be seeking the death penalty.”

During the Cabinet meeting, President Trump also said the U.S. would accept up to 600,000 Chinese students — an announcement that quickly drew backlash from his MAGA base, including from Steve Bannon and Laura Loomer. Trump said he liked having Chinese students in the U.S.

President Donald Trump: “But I like that their students come here. I like that other countries’ students come here. And you know what would happen if they didn’t? Our college system would go to hell very quickly. You’d have — and it wouldn’t be the top colleges. It would be colleges that struggle, on the bottom. And you take out 300,000 or 600,000 students out of the system.”

The president’s comments are a shift from his administration’s policy. Back in May, the State Department announced that it was vetting Chinese students for connections to the Chinese Communist Party.

Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook says she will file a lawsuit against President Trump’s attempts to remove her from her post. Cook is the first Black woman to sit on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Trump is claiming, without evidence, that Cook committed mortgage fraud. Cook’s attorney says the president “lacks any factual or legal basis” to fire her. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been pressured by the president to lower interest rates. We’ll have more on this story after headlines.

Lebanese journalists are demanding an apology from Tom Barrack, the U.S. envoy to Syria, for demeaning comments he made at a press conference in Beirut.

Tom Barrack: “The moment that this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we’re gone. So, you want — you want to know what’s happening? Act civilized, act kind, act tolerant, because this is the problem with what’s happening in the region.”

The Union of Journalists in Lebanon called for a boycott of all future events with Barrack unless he apologizes for his comments, saying, “the content of his remarks reflects ingrained colonial arrogance towards the peoples of the region and constitutes a blatant violation of basic diplomatic etiquette and the values that diplomacy should represent — chief among them respect for press freedom and the people’s right to knowledge.”

FEMA is suspending staff members who signed a letter criticizing the Trump administration for gutting the agency’s ability to handle natural disasters. The letter came just days before the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in U.S. history. At least 36 employees have signed their full names to the letter, titled the “Katrina Declaration,” and about 150 others have signed the letter anonymously. On Tuesday, FEMA told the staffers that they were put on administrative leave in a “non-duty status while continuing to receive pay and benefits.”

The Social Security Administration’s chief data officer has said the personal information of hundreds of millions of Americans was uploaded onto a vulnerable cloud server by members of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency. The claim appears in a whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday. In the complaint, the official, Charles Borges, writes, “Should bad actors gain access to this cloud environment, Americans may be susceptible to widespread identity theft, may lose vital health care and food benefits, and the government may be responsible for reissuing every American a new Social Security number at great cost.”",https://assets.democracynow.org/assets/default_content_image-354f4555cc64afadc730d64243c658dd0af1f330152adcda6c4900cb4a26f082.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 23:56:30.127811

U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer made the remarks during a televised cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.

“Thank you for what you are doing with your agents on ICE, and thank you for the prosecution, and I hope you will come to Portland, Oregon and crack down,” Chavez-DeRemer said.

Seated nearby were Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who controls the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has touted the arrest of cartel members in Oregon.

“We are expecting a crackdown,” Chavez-DeRemer added, glancing at the two other officials.

So far, ICE activity has largely focused at the agency’s base in South Portland, where black-clad protesters have appeared on a nightly basis, leading to several clashes.

ICE agents detained four farmworkers during a traffic stop in Marion County earlier this month. Others have been detained immediately after their immigration hearings at the federal courthouse. ICE officials also arrested a 38-year-old chiropractor originally from Iran outside his child’s Montessori school last month.

Bondi memorably crossed swords with U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, in June when Merkley peppered Bondi with questions about Trump’s cryptocurrency and the risk of influence peddling.

The former mayor of Happy Valley, Chavez-DeRemer rose to prominence when she was elected to the U.S. House representing Oregon’s 5th District in 2022.

Janelle Bynum entered the race two years later and unseated Chavez-DeRemer by just over 10,000 votes. Chavez-DeRemer was then confirmed as head of the U.S. Labor Department in March.

Trump held court for over three hours Monday, exchanging effusive praise with many top officials. Chavez-DeRemer spent most of her five minute exchange discussing an ongoing 50-state tour of American industry and workplaces.

“There are still good people” in Oregon, she said. “I was able to visit Buckeye Pacific, really a trading floor for the timber industry.”

In response, the Trump administration did what any responsible government would do.
Last month, about 140 employees at the EPA who signed an opposition letter were placed on administrative leave.
It remains to be seen what other actions could come as a result of the FEMA employees' letter.","Reports that the Trump administration placed some employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on leave after they signed an open letter of dissent earlier this week has sparked criticism on social media.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter sent to the FEMA Review Council and Congress on Monday, critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warning that FEMA's capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished. Only 36 signed their names, while others withheld their names for fear of retribution.

The Washington Post first reported that by Tuesday evening, some of those employees had received letters informing them that they were being placed on paid administrative leave, effective immediately. About 30 employees were told they were being placed on leave, according to The New York Times.

Stand Up for Science, the advocacy group that helped publicize the letter, told Newsweek that ""many"" of the FEMA employees who publicly signed the letter have been placed on administrative leave, including some who were responding to July's deadly floods in Texas.

Newsweek has contacted the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, for comment via emails sent outside regular business hours.

Why It Matters

The letter raised concerns about FEMA's ability to respond to disasters, which can mean life or death during such emergencies.

While the administration has said its decision to place some FEMA employees on leave was not meant as a punishment, the action has raised concerns over whistleblower protections. When employees face consequences for speaking out, it may prevent others from doing so in the future and erode public trust in leadership.

What To Know

According to the Associated Press, it has confirmed that at least two of the signatories received notices on Tuesday evening informing them that they would be placed on indefinite leave. The notice said the decision was ""not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive.""

In a statement to Newsweek, Stand Up for Science said the government was retaliating against the employees ""for whistleblowing—which is both illegal and a deep betrayal of the most dedicated among us.""

On social media, some also called it an act of retaliation.

Podcast host Brian Allen said, ""Whistleblowers are being purged for trying to protect disaster response.""

Ron Filipkowski, the editor-in-chief of MeidasTouch, commended those who ""had the courage to sign their names to it knowing the consequences of a highly vindictive Trump.""

In their letter, sent ahead of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the current and former FEMA employees listed six ""statements of opposition"" to current policies at FEMA, including an expenditure approval policy by which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem must approve contracts exceeding $100,000. The signatories said the policy reduces FEMA's ability to perform its mission.

The letter also critiqued the DHS's decision to reassign some FEMA employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator as required by law, and cuts to mitigation programs, preparedness training and FEMA's workforce.

The signatories wrote that they hoped their warnings would ""come in time to prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.""

What People Are Saying

Stand Up for Science said in a statement to Newsweek: ""This situation is developing, but this decision underscores the many issues these public servants described in their declaration and their bravery in standing up for Americans in need.

""Once again, we are seeing the federal government retaliate against our civil servants for whistleblowing—which is both illegal and a deep betrayal of the most dedicated among us. DHS said that these employees are simply 'afraid of change' which is an insult to anyone working at FEMA, the agency directly responsive to rapidly intensifying and changing circumstances. Stand Up for Science is proud to have hosted their Katrina Declaration and we stand by the FEMA 36.""

Podcast host Brian Allen wrote on X: ""This isn't governance. It's retaliation. Whistleblowers are being purged for trying to protect disaster response.""

Richard Hanania, the president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, wrote on X: ""36 FEMA employees put their names to a letter to Congress saying we were underprepared for future emergencies. In response, the Trump administration did what any responsible government would do. It put them on paid leave.""

FEMA spokesperson Daniel Llargues told the Associated Press on Monday that the Trump administration had ""made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help.""

He added: ""It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard.""

What Happens Next

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency, have issued similar statements against the Trump administration's policies. Last month, about 140 employees at the EPA who signed an opposition letter were placed on administrative leave.

It remains to be seen what other actions could come as a result of the FEMA employees' letter.

Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press.
“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.
It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats were plunged into political crisis, especially splintered on immigration and border security, after their thorough defeat last year in an election in which President Donald Trump made hard-line immigration action a centerpiece of his campaign.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It’s putting a spotlight on Trump’s agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats Ramping Up Visits to Detention Centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration’s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado’s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It’s a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president’s deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump’s administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans Hold Firm Even as Public Opinion Shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump’s success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We’ve never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it’s one of the most secure southern borders we’ve had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they’re out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump’s approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There’s Still a Search for Consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America’s security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration’s handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we’ll see if now’s the time.”",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump_Congress_Deportations_25221593402141-1568x1048.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:56:32.757126

Reform have done none of this work and needless to say Labour voted against all our proposals.
Besides disapplying the Human Rights Act from immigration matters, Conservatives have already launched a full review of the ECHR and the associated treaties, led by Lord Wolfson KC.","Firstly, they have no idea what follows once the Human Rights Act and associated treaties are disapplied. It is easy to talk about leaving, but far harder to build the framework that comes after. Without this work being done, it risks the system being left even weaker than before.

And second, they run the risk of shattering public trust, when people vote for plans that don’t work in practice. If a plan collapses on contact with reality, it hands victory to those who say the crisis cannot be solved at all. Dangerous amateurism could discredit the entire cause of immigration control.

The contrast could not be sharper. Earlier this year, the Conservatives introduced the Deportation Bill – a detailed, workable plan to end this illegal immigration crisis. Our Deportation Bill will take back control of our country’s borders and, importantly, would ensure that every single illegal immigrant would be automatically deported. It would also disapply the Human Rights Act in immigration cases, double the residency requirement for Indefinite Leave to Remain and impose a binding annual cap on legal migration, set each year by Parliament at very low levels.

We laid amendments to legislation that would have raised salary thresholds, capped family visas, mandated age testing and removed foreign criminals as a matter of course. These were carefully worked provisions drafted as primary legislation. Reform have done none of this work and needless to say Labour voted against all our proposals.

We began a new approach in government with the Rwanda plan, backed by a permanent ban on re-entry for anyone entering illegally. But I will honestly say that the last government should have gone a lot further and a lot faster. Under new leadership, we now will. The Conservatives will restore deterrence. If an illegal arrival cannot be removed to their home country, they will be immediately removed to a safe third country. Without returns there is no deterrence, and without deterrence the boats will never stop.

And this is only the beginning. Besides disapplying the Human Rights Act from immigration matters, Conservatives have already launched a full review of the ECHR and the associated treaties, led by Lord Wolfson KC. That review is examining in precise detail how Britain can reassert sovereignty in ways that do not leave us trapped in endless legal quagmires or open to destabilisation. It is easy to talk about a “Bill of Rights”, but easy slogans can create new dangers, handing judges sweeping licence to reinterpret vague concepts of “liberty” and “freedom” against the will of Parliament. We will not risk compounding failure with shortcuts.

Real work means drafting clauses, forcing votes, designing enforcement, and standing ready to deliver on day one of government. It means commissioning an eminent KC to look at the legal challenges so that easy slogans and promises don’t fall apart on contact with reality.

That is what the Conservatives have done. We are not waiting for Nigel Farage to catch up with the detail, we are not waiting for Labour to discover courage, but we will keep pressing for the measures Britain desperately needs.

That is the choice that will be before Britain. A weak Labour Government that won’t do the tough things needed. A Reform party who talk tough but haven’t done the details. Or a changed Conservative Party that has both the willpower and the plan to fix this crisis.

“Is the American dream worth this?” I’d ask along the trek.
For decades, the American dream has been framed as an open-ended quest that had yet to be fully realized.","This article was produced in partnership with Rolling Stone and the Marguerite Casey Foundation.

As soon as they take off from the Panamanian coast, there is a sigh of relief. Surrounded by 30 other Venezuelan migrants, packed inside an overloaded midsize speedboat, Edinson holds on tightly to the edge. The 37-year-old is tall and slender and has a presence that stands out as he towers over everyone. Over the past couple of weeks, he’s become the de facto captain of a group of migrants making their way back to Venezuela.

At this point in their long journey, they sit in silence under blue skies and a blazing morning sun. The end is in sight. Sporting a black Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap and a blue T-shirt, Edinson stares out to the crystal clear Caribbean Sea. He knows these waters can be deadly. A couple of months ago, a boat carrying 19 migrants capsized not too far from here, but Edinson tells himself he has survived worse.

The boat is being piloted by two local operators, also known as lancheros, who constantly scoop water to avoid flooding. Dressed in black from head to toe, these lancheros now make a living transporting migrants from Panama’s Colón province in the central, northern part of the country to La Miel, a small town close to the Colombian border. This 12-hour sea route is the only way for migrants to bypass the dense, swampy, deadly Darién jungle that connects the two countries — the only spit of land linking North and South America via Central America. Each person making the voyage had risked their lives once to trek north through the jungle in their attempt to reach the United States. This time, on their way back to Venezuela, they want to avoid it at all costs, even if it means facing those rough Caribbean waters.

It’s 9:19 a.m. by now, the warm water splashing into the boat as it travels parallel to the shoreline, where you can still see lush tropical rainforests in the distance. While Edinson grabs onto the metal handles, one woman in a light-blue plastic poncho, hair flying with the wind, locks arms with her young daughter. In front of them, a young father holds his five-year-old son in his lap, squeezing him tightly as we slam through the big waves. Everyone on board manages to suppress their fear with the simple prospect of returning home. “Solo pienso en llegar, llegar, llegar (I’m just thinking of arriving, arriving, arriving),” Edinson says.

Unbeknownst to him, Edinson is part of a growing trend of “reverse migration” emerging throughout the American continent. A year ago, this movement would have been unimaginable. In 2024, during the Joe Biden administration, more than 300,000 north-bound migrants traversed the Darién Gap. After Donald Trump effectively dismantled the asylum-seeking process during his first administration, hundreds and thousands of migrants, precipitated by the pandemic and critical conditions in their homelands, headed toward the U.S. Those numbers plummeted once Trump took office again and began doubling down on his anti-immigrant agenda. According to the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, only 2,831 people crossed the Darién between January and March 2025, representing a 98 percent decrease compared with 2024. In March, Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino declared that the Darién Gap was effectively closed, proudly noting that his country’s migration crisis was over. Yet that statement overlooks a new, invisible crisis slowly forming in plain sight, miles away from the Darién. Migrants are still risking their lives; they are simply doing it on their way south, not north.

As Reuters first reported in March, more than 2,800 U.S.-bound migrants in Mexico requested assistance from the United Nations International Organization for Migration (IOM) to return to their homelands in January and February, just weeks after Trump stepped into the White House. Many of those migrants had been waiting in limbo to enter the United States. By June, the IOM estimated that approximately 7,696 southbound migrants had traveled from Panama to Colombia since February. While tracking this data is challenging, the movements on the ground point to a monumental new chapter in the history of migration: the disintegration of the American dream.

“By turning a refugee population into priorities for enforcement, it’s ending a chapter the United States aspired to. It aspired to be a place of refuge,” Andrea Flores, vice president of Immigration Policy and Campaigns at FWD.us, a bipartisan immigration-advocacy group, tells me. “The American dream meant that, regardless of background, our Constitution protected all of these identities and believed that, through our immigration system and the concept of naturalization, you could become an American. That idea of the American dream is ending.”

So, what happens when migrants stop looking north?

Starting Over in the U.S.

Seven months ago, Edinson never imagined he’d be returning to Venezuela.

Like millions living under President Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian regime, Edinson, who is the father of two young boys, struggled to provide for his family as a street-market seller of secondhand goods. For decades, Venezuela has undergone a sociopolitical crisis that has stripped citizens of basic civil rights and economic opportunities. Since 2014, close to 8 million Venezuelans have left the country, making it the largest recorded forced-displacement crisis in the Western Hemisphere, and one of the largest in the world.

Edinson watched neighbors pack their bags and flee to the United States, but the idea of leaving his children behind kept him anchored in his hometown of Caja Seca, a small, rural community. He was at peace with the idea of leading a simple life and found joy in the small things — playing basketball with his kids, taking his eldest to practice, and eating dinner with his mother every night. Miles away from Caracas, surrounded by forests, Edinson managed to stay away from the capital’s political turmoil, even as massive protests against Maduro’s crackdown erupted in that city.

But in the summer of 2024, Edinson’s three-year-old son got sick. To help pay for hospital visits and medicine, Edinson traveled to the capital, almost nine hours away, where he sold used clothes and sneakers for quick cash. A couple of weeks and many trips later, Edinson’s savings were gone and he could barely afford to buy groceries. Blaming Madu­ro’s regime, Edinson recognized that the only way for his family to survive was for him to leave Venezuela and go north.

Jorge, one of Edinson’s childhood best friends, had left Caja Seca a couple of years ago and, after receiving humanitarian parole under the Biden administration, ended up working at a tire shop in Indianapolis. Jorge told Edinson about what better opportunities looked like, what it could feel like for Edinson to have enough money in his pockets to help his son. Things weren’t perfect in Indiana, Jorge would tell Edinson, but that sense of suffocation and paranoia was gone, and that was enough to inspire Edinson to start planning. Suddenly, the motivation wasn’t just economic, but the realization that life could be different — free of misery and oppression. He would join Jorge, send cash to his family and, eventually, bring them to America. “That’s the only solution I could find,” Edinson says.

On Oct. 1, 2024, Edinson left Venezuela, beginning a trek north as the United States was in the midst of a heated presidential election with Vice President Kamala Harris’ lead over Trump slowly shrinking. The day Edinson left, Trump held a campaign rally in Milwaukee, warning the crowd about a “mass migrant invasion.” By that point, Trump calling Venezuelan migrants “criminals” and “gang members” had become a core part of his stump speech.

While Trump bet on his nativist, anti-immigrant rhetoric to mobilize voters, Edinson held onto the hope that Americans would be able to see past the fearmongering and baseless attacks. “A lot of people in Caja Seca told me not to go [to the U.S.], and to wait until the election results,” Edinson says. He was convinced that, like previous generations of Venezuelan migrants, he would eventually find a pathway to legalization. Regardless of the political outcome, Edinson trusted the American system.

During 2024, at the height of the migration wave toward the U.S., an average of 3,000 people trekked through the Darién Gap each day. Known as “the world’s most dangerous jungle,” millions of migrants and refugees risked their lives and attempted to cross it during the Biden years, despite the administration’s attempts to restrict asylum. Still, Edinson thought he would have the chance to start a new life in the U.S.

The American Dream

In October, it took Edinson almost four days to cross the Darién Gap by foot, passing four corpses during the last stretch of the jungle: the emaciated remains of a mother and daughter who died hugging; a woman who looked like she’d just been shot in the head; the decomposed body of what appeared to be an elderly man; and many, many human bones and skulls lined the edges of the swampy, overgrown paths.

As soon as Edinson emerged from the Darién Gap and reached the small Panamanian town of Bajo Chiquito, he called his mother back in Caja Seca. “Don’t ever do this,” he told her. He rested for a few days in the town’s makeshift migrant camp full of asylum seekers who had just braved the jungle and were in dire need of urgent care. From there, Edinson would take several buses through Central America to Mexico, where he would begin the process to request asylum in the United States.

Back in 2021, a couple of days after Biden’s inauguration, I spent a week reporting from the Darién Gap. What haunted me wasn’t what I could see and hear around me — the dangerous wildlife, the gasps of pain from Haitian mothers as they carried their weeping children through the hills on bloody, blistered feet, the trails of abandoned backpacks — rather, it was everything I couldn’t see. What haunted me the most was migrants’ blind loyalty to the ideals that pushed them toward the U.S. Their capacity to face any risk — even death — in the pursuit of freedom, justice, and liberty. Having lived through authoritarianism, gang violence, and/or poverty, they understood how sacred America’s rights were, how vital our Constitution was, and the privilege our democracy represented. “Is the American dream worth this?” I’d ask along the trek. The answer was always a resounding yes.

In 1931, author and historian James Truslow Adams was one of the first to introduce the concept of the American dream in his book The Epic of America. Adams, who was born into a wealthy Brooklyn family, originally explained it as a “dream of a better, richer, and happier life for all our citizens of every rank.” Many scholars took issue with this limited characterization, pointing to its materialistic and capitalistic nature. Since, generations of ordinary Americans, presidents, politicians, and historians have continued to redefine the term, using it as an anchor to unify our perpetually polarized nation. For decades, the American dream has been framed as an open-ended quest that had yet to be fully realized.

Historically, immigrants trekking to the U.S. each day have carried the aspiration of that dream. From the more than 30 million Europeans who arrived between 1815 and 1915 to the birth of the Chicano movement and the rise of Cesar Chavez’s farmworkers to the mass mobilization of Dreamers, generations of immigrants have shaped America’s own commitment to that vision. But as hundreds of migrants begin to self-deport and as thousands of asylum seekers turn away from the southern border, choosing new paths for themselves, it seems that Adams’ American dream was just that — simply a dream.

Edinson came to that conclusion shortly after he arrived in Mexico, now just miles away from the U.S. After surviving the Darién jungle and crisscrossing through Central America, Edinson arrived in the Mexican city of Tapachula on Oct. 14, 2024, less than three weeks before the U.S. presidential election. He applied for asylum through CBP One, a controversial mobile application allowing migrants at the southern border to schedule appointments at designated U.S. ports of entry. This process became one of the only ways to legally enter at the U.S.-Mexico border under Biden, as the administration attempted to handle a surge of new arrivals.

Based on a lottery system, migrants would sometimes wait months for their appointment in extremely dangerous conditions. The cartels often run these border towns and have historically subjected migrants to kidnappings, extortions, and sexual violence. Yet, once migrants were screened and vetted by immigration officers, many were eventually released on parole in the U.S.

“In Mexico, you live in fear every single day,” Edinson says. “There’s no peace of mind there. But the plan was always to wait and get to the U.S.” As Edinson waited in limbo, he got a job as a tire repairer. He shared a tiny two-bedroom apartment with 14 other Venezuelan migrants. Each night, he slept on a thin foam mattress on a floor, surrounded by strangers connected by the hope that America would reject Trump’s vision. Paralyzed by fear from Tapachula’s cartel violence, Edinson barely left that apartment.

By Nov. 5, Edinson understood that the land that lured him didn’t want him there. Like his roommates, Edinson found out about the election results through social media, as he anxiously scrolled Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. In the immediate aftermath of the election, Edinson received conflicting advice. His friend Jorge encouraged him to continue his journey, even if it meant paying coyotes to get smuggled through the southern border. Edinson’s mom urged him to go back home to Caja Seca. With Trump in power, she no longer saw a pathway for her son.

Edinson stayed the course. He wasn’t alone. As the Associated Press reported, more than 2,000 migrants in southern Mexico began walking toward the U.S. the morning Trump was sworn in. By the time the sun set, his administration had declared a national emergency at the border, shut down the CBP One application, revoked key humanitarian parole programs, attempted to repeal birthright citizenship, and laid the groundwork for its mass-deportation machine. A couple of days later, as millions of immigrants went back into the shadows, American military planes started deporting dozens of migrants to Guatemala. As FWD.us’ Flores says, “Trump’s unique targeting of Venezuelans during the 2024 campaign was the preview of everything you are seeing now.”

From Indianapolis, Jorge kept Edinson abreast of the news. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids were picking up, more deportation flights were taking off, and local police were starting to act like federal immigration agents. Even though Jorge had legal status, it felt like a matter of time until someone came knocking on his door. By mid-March, Jorge’s tone changed when the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act and deported 137 Venezuelan men to El Salvador without due process, accusing them of being gang members and national-security threats. Haunted by the demeaning photo ops of Venezuelan men paraded around El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s mega-prison, Jorge told Edinson he was scared to leave his house and end up behind bars in a foreign country.

Few things can quell an immigrant’s determination. Some will hide in corners, others will walk with more caution, many will perpetually wait in limbo until better opportunities arise. I’ve met Cuban migrants who have waited more than two years along the southern border for a chance to enter the U.S. Immigrants have historically held on to a form of unwavering hope that dissipates only when their luck runs out.

While Edinson watched the way Jorge’s life was at the mercy of immigration officials, however, he decided the chance for a new life in America wasn’t worth it. “When I saw that they [the U.S. government] were taking away my own people, the same anxiety I felt in Venezuela started to sink in,” Edinson says. “To leave a dictatorship only to walk into that? It’s preferable to leave that behind.” After waiting in Mexico for six months, Edinson decided to turn back.

As Edinson thought through the logistics of his return home, he had one condition: No matter what, he wouldn’t go through the Darién Gap again. Dead people. Hills. Wild animals. Criminals preying on migrants. As he planned another way back, he came across a small group of Venezuelans also plotting their return. They spent weeks hustling for money around Tapachula. During the days, some worked as street vendors, construction workers, or in factories, packing mangoes. In the evenings, they came together to talk about the different routes around the Darién Gap. Through word of mouth, they learned migrants were boarding small boats by Panama’s Caribbean coast and taking a long sea route to Colombia that allowed them to bypass the jungle. They also heard that back in February, an eight-year-old Venezuelan child died after one of those boats sank. But Edinson suddenly felt the same way he did as he migrated north: The risk was worth it.

Against the Tide

On April 19, 2025, at 9 p.m., Edinson boarded a bus in Tapachula and began the first stretch of his trip, a three-day journey that would take him all the way to Costa Rica.

In Spanish, contracorriente means to go against the tide. The word perfectly captures Edinson’s journey through Central America on roads paved for migrants who fled in the other direction. From Mexico, there were those who rushed to California for gold or to the Texas farmlands for work throughout the 19th century; from Guatemala and Honduras, countless asylum seekers searched for new beginnings in Florida after escaping the maras and dangerous mudslides; from Nicaragua, its war-torn populous sought American democracy during the Cold War.

By April 22, after days on the road, Edinson made it to Costa Rica. That night, I met him for the first time, by a bus stop in Paso Canoas, a small town on the border between Costa Rica and Panama. Smoking a cigarette as he paced back and forth, he was surrounded by a group of Venezuelan men he had met on the bus ride to Paso Canoas. They were all young dads in their twenties and thirties who traveled solo to the U.S., now on their way back home to their kids.

“When the border with the U.S. closed, everyone’s dreams stopped existing,” says Edinson, whose tall silhouette covers the street lights shining over us. “One tries to forget about that, but the feeling remains.”

Luis, a 30-year-old father of three young kids, chimes in: “We’ve been talking about this the whole way here.… I think we are the beginning of a new wave. If they closed the door on us, we have to find a new horizon.”

That night, Edinson and his friends will rest in a nearby hostel mostly occupied by migrants and pay smugglers $40 each to be transported by charter bus from Paso Canoas into Panama in the late hours of the night, when Panamanian immigration authorities are more likely to turn a blind eye.

Paso Canoas has always been an important transit town for northbound migrants. During peak migration periods in 2023, the Costa Rican government, along with aid groups on the ground, implemented a relatively sound protection system that allowed for safe passage, opening a temporary migrant care center, adopting busing programs to transport migrants from its southern border to its northern one, and working closely with the United Nations to coordinate humanitarian assistance. During those years, the streets were bustling, there was a robust presence of aid workers, and local business owners kept their fresh-fruit stands open all day. Then, shortly after Trump took office, an eerie quiet took over the town. By the second week of February, aid workers noticed asylum seekers were coming through from America, instead of the south.

Today, locals estimate that more than 100 southbound migrants pass through Paso Canoas each day. The majority are Venezuelans who left Mexico after waiting in limbo following the 2024 election. There are also a significant number of migrants who either self-deported or were turned away by immigration authorities at U.S. ports of entry.

Every afternoon, Sister Claudia Cuadra, a nun from Chile, posts up by the bus station and waits for migrant buses to arrive. She escorts as many people as she can back to a small church turned dining hall offering free meals and basic services. Paso Canoas is now mostly run by nuns. The Trump administration’s foreign-aid freeze suspended crucial regional programs that offered shelter, food, hydration, hygiene, and legal aid to migrants, forcing some aid groups to exit the region altogether. As Refugees International recently reported, in just four months, the Trump administration dismantled Costa Rica’s protection infrastructure. This spurred a number of faith-based organizations to fill the void.

One rainy afternoon, I see the nuns in action, opening their doors to a group of about 20 migrants lined up outside the church. Some nuns pass out lunch boxes, while others play with the fidgety children and offer single mothers an extra hand. While Sister Adriana Calzada Vazquez Vela hands out food, she tells me migrants arriving here from the north are often hungry, exhausted, and resigned. “There’s a sadness,” she says. “There’s disappointment because there was a dream that became lost or broken.”

Humanitarian experts say reverse migrating is a traumatic experience, perhaps even more so than going north. Caitlyn Yates, an anthropologist at the University of British Columbia and a volunteer with Refugees International, explains that grappling with the end of hope is the most difficult part. At this point in their journey, still operating on adrenaline and survival instinct, they’ve barely processed what they’ve seen along the way. “They carry the grief and trauma of having crossed through the Darién,” says Ivan Aguilar, a humanitarian coordinator for Oxfam. “Almost all of them have seen someone die or disappear … and now they have to return.”

When I ask these experts if there is anything comparable, a similar pattern of reverse migration that has taken place in another part of the globe, they struggle to come up with an answer. Aguilar points out that after living in the U.S. for 30 or 40 years, some migrants choose to retire in their home countries. But this is different, he stresses: “The reverse migration we are seeing is due to the impossibility of reaching a final destination.”

A New Beginning

Sitting in the church’s dining hall, just miles away from the foot of the jungle, migrants weigh the same question Edinson had been pondering: how to avoid the Darién Gap.

Barajas Marquez, a 39-year-old Venezuelan playing with his son inside the church, doesn’t have the cash to pay for the boat. He’s trying to save enough money to give his family options. He says he knows of those desperate enough to consider going back through the jungle by foot. Edinson spent weeks working at the tire shop in Tapachula so he could afford the sea route, which is a little less than the $330 Edinson paid back in October 2024 to be smuggled by foot through the Darién jungle by the Gulf Clan, a Colombian paramilitary group. “It’s dangerous,” Edinson admits. “It’s unclear what can happen to us during so many hours.… What if the sea is choppy?” Luckily, he knows how to swim.

I meet Edinson at 2 a.m. by the same bus stop he had arrived at earlier that day. I knew this was the time that his group planned to make moves, when the town was asleep. Edinson and three other men walk briskly toward the border crossing with Panama, just a couple of feet away. A larger group of about 25 migrants quietly emerges from the surrounding streets and joins Edinson’s pack. They all move silently through a back alley that allows them to circumvent the Panamanian immigration authorities.

In the daytime, this intersection, which sits on the Pan-American Highway, is one of the busiest land crossings in Central America, as it’s a major hub for commercial traffic. Truck drivers sometimes wait in line for more than five hours just to get processed by immigration authorities. But at night, Panamanian immigration officials have mostly grown accustomed to looking the other way as migrants quietly tiptoe around the system.

A couple of minutes later, already on the Panamanian side, the group congregates by a charter bus stationed by the sidewalk, engine turned on, luggage-compartment hood wide open, ready to go. The silence turns into chaos as migrants frantically put their bags inside the bus and reach out with their cash — $25, the cost of being smuggled across Panama. I ask Edinson if he knows anything about the bus driver — who he is, who he works for, why he’s there. He doesn’t. The bus pulls away, taking the migrants to David, a city in western Panama. From there, Edinson will take several buses until he reaches the country’s eastern coast. That’s where the boats await.

Every day, hundreds of migrants like Edinson take off from the Panamanian province of Colón as they embark on their final stretch home. This may feel like a win for a Trump administration that prides itself on pressuring people into self-deporting and turning around. From up close, though, the act of leaving looks, for many, more like an act of freedom. That’s particularly evident in Colón, where there’s an emotional shift, when even those who feel defeated and terrified to return to the homelands from which they fled, begin to see more opportunities back in the south than up north. Perhaps it’s that their journey is almost over, that they are hours away from hugging their loved ones, or that they’ve had enough time to self-reflect. The region of Colón has a deep history of liberation.

This port played an important role during the transatlantic slave trade, when European colonizers forcefully brought millions of enslaved Africans to Panama. The enslaved people later revolted and eventually established settlements along the coast. Centuries later, the province of Colón is now inhabited by a majority Afro-Panamanian population.

Surrounded by rainforests, old colonial towns are filled with churches, squares, and ancient structures covered in a chipped, colorful, bright paint. Here, time moves slowly. After 24 hours on the road, cruising full speed toward the east coast, Edinson finally makes it to Palenque, a tiny beach town in Colón.

The morning of April 24, I meet Edinson by Palenque’s wooden dock. He’s still with the other young Venezuelan dads he’d met up with in Tapachula, but he’s now part of another, newly formed group of migrants waiting to board the two-engine boat. There’s Genesis, a 31-year-old woman who’d spent months in the Mexican border town of Matamoros, right by McAllen, Texas. She doesn’t know how to swim and is petrified to get on the boat, especially after hearing that one of them capsized in February. There’s Alessandro, also in his early thirties who, 10 days prior, self-deported from Ohio. His arms covered in tattoos, Alessandro is scared DHS would label him as a gang member and send him to El Salvador.

As we talk near the dock, I ask Edinson the same question I asked migrants in 2021 when we trekked north through the Darién jungle — was the American dream worth it? “I wouldn’t go back to the United States,” he says with certainty.

Edinson stuffs his backpack into a plastic bag. He puts on a life vest handed to him by one of the local Afro-Panamanian men organizing the boat rides. These men — coyotes of some sort, part of a well-oiled informal migrant-transportation machine — are collecting $280 per person. It will take about 12 hours to reach La Miel, Panama. From there, Edinson will get onto another boat to Colombia and continue his journey to Venezuela by bus. He hopes to be in Caja Seca in less than 48 hours. “Are you nervous? Anxious?” I ask him. “No, just anxious to get home,” he says.

Edinson knows Venezuela’s conditions haven’t gotten any better with Maduro still in power. He cannot wait to hug his boys, but what worries him most is not being able to buy his 12-year-old everything he needs for his basketball games. He’s not sure how long he’ll last in Venezuela. As soon as he gets home, Edinson will plot his next journey.

The migrants form two lines along the dock. Men on the right, women and their children on the left. The women enter the boat one by one and sit in the back, followed by the men, a couple of whom move closer to the engines to join their wives and squeeze their kids. Edinson and his friends sit by the tip of the boat, packed in with 30 people who are all part of a new chapter of history, the beginning of a new “Great Reverse Migration.” When they get home, they will tell their children, their grandchildren, and generations to come that America didn’t live up to its ideals, that the dream could be chased elsewhere. They will get out a map and look for new horizons. In turn, James Truslow Adams’ Epic of America could come to an end.

Right before the lancheros take off from the dock, a local Afro-Panamanian woman approaches the boat. She kneels down and prays out loud for them. The migrants begin cheering from the boat. The woman gets on her feet and yells “Hoy es un dia que se va a desatar algo” — “Today is a day when something will unleash.”

As the boat takes off, going against the tide, Edinson sighs as if a weight has been lifted.

A few weeks later, he’s back in Caja Seca with his family, making $50 a week as a delivery person, trying to save enough money to move to Chile. “I have life, health, and, more than anything, peace of mind,” Edinson says. “No one can take that away from me.”

When he began vomiting and having seizures in the early hours of Feb. 18, Krome staff waited nearly four hours before calling for emergency medical care.
Delays in receiving medical care at Krome were common, according to interviews and a Human Rights Watch report.
One man spent a week asking for medical care for a cough, the HRW report said.
A transgender detainee who became friends with Gomes fell and lost her teeth without receiving care, Smock said.","As overcrowding at Florida’s largest immigrant detention center ballooned this year, the emergency calls flooded in.

“I got a gentleman here, new arrival detainee, he’s complaining of chest pains.”

“We have a detainee having a seizure.”

“We got a new arrival detainee here that’s complaining of lightheadedness.”

Krome Processing Center’s average daily population has climbed from less than 600 at the start of the Trump administration to 900 in July according to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement – and that’s likely a significant undercount. In April, Krome’s population reached three times its capacity with more 1,800 detainees, according to data gathering organization Transitional Records Action Clearinghouse, which obtained additional public records from ICE to provide a fuller picture beyond the average population data ICE regularly publishes.

As Krome burst at the seams with new detainees, emergency calls have risen faster than the detainee population.

From January to July, 911 calls made from the detention center doubled compared to the same time period the year before, according to records released from the Miami-Dade Sheriff’s Office. More than 170 calls were made this year until July 15, compared to 86 in the same time period the year before. This year, about half of the calls have been related to a sick or injured person, compared to just 25% of the calls last year. Other common reasons for the calls were an arrest or investigation.

That tracks with a similar trend at ICE’s Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, where 911 calls are also on track to double from last year, according to data obtained and analyzed by The Tributary last month.

But at Krome, Florida’s largest detention center, the problems are particularly acute: Interviews with lawyers and detainees’ relatives, 911 call logs and recordings, and ICE’s own records show that overcrowding and medical neglect have run rampant at Krome since Trump took office. The detention center has also been the deadliest this year, with at least three deaths.

As the Trump administration has ramped up its deportation machine and Gov. Ron DeSantis has wielded the full force of the state’s law enforcement to help, no ICE detention center has exceeded its capacity more than Miami’s Krome, according to a report by TRAC.

“It is absolutely horrendous,” said Chelsea Nowel, a Tampa-based immigration lawyer with multiple clients who have been detained at Krome. “It’s not something that I’ve ever experienced before in practicing detained immigration for almost 10 years.”

Ramped up enforcement

Since President Donald Trump took office, immigration enforcement has intensified, targeting immigrants at their workplace, courthouses, and immigration check-ins. With Gov. Ron DeSantis as an eager partner, Florida’s immigrant communities have borne the brunt of ramped up ICE activity.

With most Florida law enforcement agencies required to collaborate with ICE, a routine traffic stop now can lead to detention without so much as a citation — let alone a criminal arrest. Changes to mandatory detention have also meant that immigrants without a criminal record and with ties to their community who may have been released on bond under past administrations are now spending months in ICE detention. More than half of the people detained at Krome have no criminal record, according to the latest ICE statistics on the detained population.

“What we’re seeing is how politicians across the political spectrum have sold us that immigration is a public safety issue, but it’s not,” said Florida-based senior organizer for the Detention Watch Network Nery Lopez. “In reality, we’re seeing that people are being incarcerated, being detained and deported and having no due process.”

As the largest detention center in the state, Krome has been the site of many of these detentions and the population quickly surged.

Within a month of Trump’s inauguration, 44-year-old Ukrainian immigrant Maksym Chernyak died in custody after being transferred to the hospital after having a seizure. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner determined the cause of death as a stroke. In August, his family filed a wrongful death complaint under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Overcrowding only increased at Krome in the following months. In April, Democratic lawmakers in Florida called the conditions at Krome “alarming” and demanded more oversight. In June, detainees used their bodies to spell out SOS to protest the conditions and prolonged detention.

Even ICE has noted overcrowding at Krome. In the latest ICE inspection conducted from April 29 to May 1, the agency documented 14 instances when the facility failed to comply with national detention standards, compared to 6 during the last inspection in September 2024. Most of the issues were related to the holding rooms or medical care.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Ron Smock, who often visited his friend Vangelis Ricardo Dos Anjos Gomes, a Brazilian immigrant who was detained at Krome from October 2024 to April 2025, watched as more and more people crowded the facilities during his visits. In the spring, he saw detainees eating and sleeping in a room meant for lawyer visits.

The overcrowding climbed steadily until June, which saw the largest 911 call volume since January 2024 with 53 calls. That same month, 75-year-old Isidro Perez died in ICE custody after reporting chest pains and being transferred to the hospital, according to ICE. The medical examiner has not yet released an autopsy or report on his death.

A 36-year-old Cuban immigrant, whose wife spoke to The Tributary on condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation, got to Krome in June after being detained at an ICE check-in in Tampa. By then, according to the immigrant’s wife, the intake process was so overwhelmed that detainees were forced to sleep on the floor for days and weeks at a time.

“He was there for a whole week in horrible conditions, where you couldn’t shower and had the same clothes on all week, with a toilet in the same room where you were,” the immigrant’s wife said in an interview. “The capacity was supposedly for 25 people, but there were up to 60 people there.”

Mich González, a lawyer for Sanctuary of the South who represents clients in Krome, said the overcrowding has created inhumane conditions.

“People were held in processing for over a week and in processing, you don’t get regular access to meals, bathroom, potable water. You have to ask to go to the bathroom,” González said.

“There’s no beds. You have to sleep on the floor. People were so cold, they were sticking cardboard in the vents and trying to hold them in place with plastic forks.”

At least four 911 calls regarding medical emergencies mentioned that the person was a new arrival who had not yet been booked into Krome, stuck instead in a limbo in which the facility’s medical staff were not yet authorized to attend to them.

“I have a detainee over here that’s complaining of chest pains,” one caller said on May 24. “Nurse staff told me to call 911 because they can’t see him because he’s not all the way booked in yet.”

In its latest inspection report, ICE documented that at least two out of six holding rooms at Krome exceeded the 25-person capacity and three exceeded the 12-hour wait time in the holding room. It also documented a failure of all the holding rooms to document detainees held there, meal times, and security concerns. Krome staff also failed to provide proper mental and medical health screenings upon arrival, the report found.

When Rep. Carlos Gimenez visited, the 36-year-old Cuban immigrant said ICE staffers took steps to get the facility more in regular order: All the men were moved out of the intake center, he later told his wife.

Gimenez told media after his visit that he did not witness any overcrowding or detainees sleeping on the floor and that the medical care was adequate.

“It’s not the Ritz, but I can tell you that there’s nothing going on in there that would be cause for alarm,” Gimenez told the media after his visit.

The office of Rep. Gimenez did not respond to a request for further comment.

Issues with medical care

Once inside Krome, overcrowding persisted and detainees reported having to request a medical appointment but waiting days to receive care, according to lawyers, relatives, a wrongful death complaint and a report by Human Rights Watch.

Smock said that Gomes, the Brazilian friend he’d regularly visited at Krome, relayed that there were 120 people in his pod, which was only supposed to hold 60 people. He spent two months in solitary confinement, which he preferred to the overcrowding and abuse he endured with the general population.

“When solitary is a better option, that shows how horrible things are,” Smock said.

The 911 calls reflect a general deterioration of the conditions at Krome and the issues with medical care, which is provided by ICE Health Service Corps. They document head injuries, chest pains, stroke symptoms, and multiple seizures.

The wife of Maksym Chernyak, the Ukrainian man who died in February, alleges that he sought medical treatment multiple times but was denied care, according to a wrongful death complaint shared with the Tributary.

Chernyak reported feeling sick and was seen by doctors on Feb. 9. Despite complaining of the same symptoms, he waited 6 days for another medical visit. His blood pressure rose by this second visit, but nothing was done, the complaint alleges. When he began vomiting and having seizures in the early hours of Feb. 18, Krome staff waited nearly four hours before calling for emergency medical care.

Smock also reported that Gomes experienced long wait times for critical medical care. It took a week to see a doctor after he fell in the courtyard and scraped his leg, which became infected with flesh-eating bacteria, Smock said.

“They kept refusing him to get treated. They finally sent him to the hospital and the hospital filed notice about how bad his condition was. He was only hours away from having his legs amputated,” Smock said.

Injuries inside Krome were common for Gomes because he was repeatedly targeted and attacked by other detainees and guards for being gay, according to Smock.

Gomes was indicted in March on two charges of forcibly assaulting a federal officer, a case that Smock believes is retaliation for filing a complaint with DHS after guards forcibly restrained and beat Gomes.

Delays in receiving medical care at Krome were common, according to interviews and a Human Rights Watch report.

One man spent a week asking for medical care for a cough, the HRW report said. He only received treatment when he showed his bloody tissue. Another waited three weeks for treatment for flu-like symptoms. A nurse wrote off his issues as marijuana withdrawal symptoms.

Another complained of abdominal pain, according to the report. An officer said that did not warrant a medical emergency. The in-house doctor said it was probably just gas. When he was finally taken to the hospital, the doctor said he had arrived just in time before his intestines ruptured from a strangulated abdominal wall hernia.

A transgender detainee who became friends with Gomes fell and lost her teeth without receiving care, Smock said. A Guatemalan woman told Smock that her husband had been attacked and fell and started having seizures, even though he was only in his 30s. The 911 calls report multiple seizures of inmates in their 30s.

All these issues could be avoided, or at least mitigated, if the government used its discretion to release people with serious health issues, family responsibilities and no criminal record as was customary in the past, according to Nowel, the Tampa immigration attorney. But instead detention only seems to be increasing.

“It’s so much worse than we’ve ever seen before and all for nothing,” Nowel said. “There is no reason for any of this to be happening.”

PHILIPSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA – Early on Sunday morning, members of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) gathered in the parking lot in East Liberty to go to Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, an old coal mining town in Central Pennsylvania. The coal mines have closed, and the town’s largest employer is ICE’s Moshannon Valley Processing Center, operated by the private prison contractor GEO Group.

The Moshannon Valley Processing Center is the largest ICE facility in the Northeastern United States and is considered one of the most inhumane.

On average, 147 immigrants per month have been locked in solitary confinement, nearly twice the national average for an ICE facility. The conditions are so brutal inside the prison that one detainee, Chaofeng Ge, killed himself in 2025. The suicide has helped bring attention to the facility’s problems.

Members of the group are excited, but some are nervous to protest in a small town like Philipsburg, deep in Trump country.

“A lot of people are scared and don’t know what to do, but we can point them in the right direction,” says June Wearden as the bus attempts to leave the parking lot in Pittsburgh. But then the bus gets stuck, and the driver is unable to navigate the turns to leave the parking lot.

Members of the PSL hop out of the bus to help it navigate around. At one point, the bus driver exclaims, “I don’t think I can get it out of this parking lot.”

Eventually, the PSL members help the bus driver to navigate, driving the charter bus over a median and, after 20 minutes of trying, escaping the parking lot to get on the road to the Moshannon Valley.

“I was nervous that we wouldn’t even get out of the parking lot,” says Wearden.

After a three-hour drive through the Appalachian mountains, the bus arrives at a lakeside park in Moshannon Valley. There are hundreds of protestors, who traveled from all over the state, some even waving Mexican flags as some truckers drive by honking their horns in solidarity. In contrast, Trump supporters drive by yelling at the protestors.

“I wanted to show that I was proud to be Mexican,” says Angelica Medina, carrying a Mexican flag and dressed in a large traditional Chiapaneco dress. “I wanted to show that I’m not afraid to be Mexican in a place like this.”

The rally is held at the Cold Stream Dam and Memorial Park, a picturesque lakeside setting in the mountains. Local residents fish from the lakeshore, looking on with amusement at the rally.

Philipsburg’s Republican mayor, John Streno, even showed up with a cigar in hand to take in the spectacle.

“I don’t agree with the protestors,” says Streno between puffs on his cigar. “But I support their right to protest.”

Not everyone is as nice or friendly as Streno.

“Fuck you, fuck you,” yells one person as they drive by. As protestors attempt to cross the highway into the park, one driver attempts to barrel through the crowd, but is stopped as protestors fail to yield.

“This is a Trump town though and I’m putting my neck out to say it, because I could be firebombed tonight,” says Philipsburg town councilman Luther Gette, who helped to organize the protest. “I already had a rock thrown through my window, but I’m taking that risk because I think it is definitely time for people to speak up.”

Luther Gette is 87 years old and the only Democrat of the seven members of the town council. He says that he’s never seen a protest this big before in Philipsburg.

“I never imagined that I would see a protest this big in Philipsburg,” says Gette.

Before the protest, there had been little discussion of the ICE facility located in their community. But now with activists from all over the state descending on Philipsburg, there has been much debate over the facility, with the local newspaper doing stories on allegations of abuse at the prison. Clearfield County Commissioner John Sobel has even had to take to the press to defend his decision to keep the facility open.

“Opinions are divided, and the main sticking point is the fact that there are jobs,” says Gette. “Old coal mining towns basically have no income,” says Gette. “A prison is a good source of jobs at any point. And I wouldn’t want to say that the people who work in these prisons are necessarily criminals, but there are better ways to make a living.”

But with debate raging over the ICE facility in Philipsburg, Gette says that some former guards have come forward to denounce conditions in the facility.

“We’ve had a quick education on this in the last couple of weeks. I knew for a long time that that prison was out there, that detention facility, but I wasn’t aware of the alleged abuses,” says Gette.

Many townspeople object to out-of-town people coming to Philipsburg to protest the facility. However, activists say that their communities are intricately linked to Philipsburg, as immigrants from their communities are being sent there.

Jamie Martinez is a community defense organizer with the Pittsburgh-based immigrants’ rights group Casa San Jose. He says that many immigrants detained in Pittsburgh, over three hours away, get sent to Moshannon Valley. A few weeks ago, Martinez visited a detainee in the facility and, even as an experienced immigrant rights organizer, found himself horrified. He says that he visited a friend who was detained for nine days without any prison official speaking to him.

“He would bang on the door for hours to be able to speak on the phone for somebody,” says Martinez. “And time and time again, like nobody explained anything in a language he could understand. And there was no clear process where he would be met without answers. He spent weeks like that.”

Equally troubling, the man was only given one change of underwear.

“When I arrive at this visitation area and see him come out, he’s wearing a red jumpsuit,” says Martinez. “And he begins to tell me that that’s the only jumpsuit that he had, that he couldn’t wash his clothes, wash his underwear, in his cell in solitary confinement, where he had been for nine days, and he pulled his collar forward like this, and he showed me the yellow sweat stains.”

ICE often pressures people to sign self-deportation papers by treating them poorly while in detention. Martinez says that immigrants in detention are aware of the protests that give them hope. Each night, the immigrants not in solitary confinement gather in their pods to praise and try to encourage one another to keep their spirits up.

“The inmates in there, they give me hope,” says Martinez. “They tell me that every night, they gather their chairs in a large circle in one of the pods, and they pray together for hours, and they build community among each other. And that’s the way in which we’re able to realize, even through the darkest of times, we can do something good. We can find that hope, that light.”

Chris Rabb, a Black state representative in Philadelphia, who is running for US Congress, says the movement against the Moshannon Valley ICE detention center inspired him to travel nearly four hours to speak at the protest. He says that it’s crucial to bridge the urban-rural divide in connecting movements in Pennsylvania.

“If you’re so arrogant to think that all the best ideas and all the best people come from places that you live in and look like, you’ve already lost,” says Rabb. “It takes us out of our physical comfort zone, also our cultural comfort zones. I don’t feel comfortable coming to these parts of Pennsylvania as a Black man alone, but this is what we need to do to build the movement.”

Interestingly, Rabb tells the crowd that some Democrats in his own party don’t feel comfortable with backing protests like these.

“There’s a lot of Democrats who wish I wasn’t here. I make it difficult for them to remain silent,” Rabb tells the crowd. “But I’m not going to be silent, particularly when I look across this amazing group of humanity and you inspire me, I know that as a public servant, there’s a responsibility for me to inspire you, but in this moment, you inspire me to do the work that all elected officials should do.”

The energy of the protests is helping mobilize some Democrats to speak out. When she found out about the rally in Philipsburg, US Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pittsburgh decided to coordinate a surprise visit to the facility on Monday to keep attention focused on the facility.

However, Lee was denied the right to enter the facility despite being the ranking Democrat on the US House Oversight subcommittee on federal law enforcement, including ICE. Lee says that not allowing her to enter the facility is a violation of the Constitution since she has direct oversight over it.

“Last year, Congress passed a law that explicitly prohibits DHS from preventing members of Congress from entering any facilities operated by them. The law also clarifies that members of Congress are not required to provide prior notice before entering any such facilities for oversight purposes,” said Lee in an interview with Payday Report. “Denying us entry is another example of [the] Trump administration’s executive overreach.”

Congresswoman Lee says that the protest movement against Moshannon is helping to put pressure on ICE.

“Of course, [these protests] have an effect, because they’ve reached the attention of members of Congress, they’ve garnered the attention of the press who are now shining a light on this facility and others like it,” said Lee.

As abuses of immigrants get more attention, polling shows that Americans have solidly turned against Trump’s immigration policies. According to a Gallup poll, disapproval of Trump’s immigration approach outweighs approval by a record 27 points.

Lee says that her Congressional office has been contacted by local townspeople who worked in the ICE detention facility, who are upset about conditions.

“We have also heard reports of a number of people leaving that facility, of quitting. There is information that trickles out from the facility itself,” says Lee. She says that right now, the key is to keep attention focused on the Moshannon Valley ICE detention center.

Activists plan to continue protesting the facility and have erected billboards around Philipsburg to draw attention to the abuses within the facility. These billboards also provide information on ways local people can get involved in organizing efforts against the facility.

“So I hope, and especially in light of our inability to get in, that there is still pressure that’s coming in from the press,” says Lee. “We expect that pressure to come from folks in the town, from folks who are impacted or who are doing advocacy.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/23430/download/Payday%20Report%20082725%20teaser.jpg?cb=566b4c3f32c365c68b7ff306dc26bbe2&w=1024,N,,2025-08-27 16:56:49.605212

Following widespread pressure, including from the supreme court, the Trump administration returned him to the US in June.
But over the weekend, the Trump administration announced new plans to deport him to Uganda.
She also reportedly said she would not order Ábrego released from immigration custody, leaving that decision for an immigration judge.
In court documents in April, the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego’s deportation had been due to an “administrative error”.","A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Kilmar Ábrego García, who was already wrongfully deported once, cannot be deported again until at least early October, according to multiple reports.

CNN reported that the US district judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over the case, scheduled an evidentiary hearing for 6 October, and said that she intends to have Trump administration officials testify about the government’s efforts to re-deport Ábrego.

At the same hearing, Ábrego’s lawyers informed the court that he plans to seek asylum in the United States, according to the Associated Press.

Ábrego’s case has drawn national attention since he was wrongfully deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador in March.

Following widespread pressure, including from the supreme court, the Trump administration returned him to the US in June. Upon his return, however, he immediately faced criminal charges related to human smuggling, allegations that his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”.

Ábrego, who is 30 years old and a Salvadorian native, was released from criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday while awaiting trial.

But over the weekend, the Trump administration announced new plans to deport him to Uganda.

Then on Monday, Ábrego was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) during a scheduled immigration check-in in Baltimore, which was one of the conditions of his release.

He is currently being held in a detention center in Virginia.

Ábrego’s legal team swiftly filed a lawsuit on Monday, challenging both his current detention and his potential deportation to Uganda. In court filings, they argued that the government is retaliating against Ábrego for challenging his deportation to El Salvador.

“The only reason he was taken into detention was to punish him,” said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney representing Ábrego, on Monday. “To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.”

Later on Monday, Xinis issued a ruling temporarily barring the government from deporting Ábrego until at least Friday. On Wednesday, she extended her order until Ábrego’s current deportation challenge in court is resolved, according to ABC News.

It added that Xinis said she would issue a ruling within 30 days of the 6 October hearing, and also ordered that Ábrego must remain in custody within a 200-mile (320km) radius of the court in Maryland.

She also reportedly said she would not order Ábrego released from immigration custody, leaving that decision for an immigration judge.

Ábrego entered the US without authorization around 2011 as a teenager. According to court documents, he was fleeing gang violence.

In 2019, a federal court granted him protection from deportation to El Salvador. Despite that ruling, in March, he was mistakenly deported there by the Trump administration.

In court documents in April, the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego’s deportation had been due to an “administrative error”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac5761cc070ae1b4e708933e5619c1c70cc4d082/14_0_2915_2333/master/2915.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe59649ccdd2d5cf86c88e317d0d454f",N,,2025-08-27 15:56:46.369917

Hot Topics: DEI, Higher Education, Online Censorship, and China

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Since day one, the Trump administration has prioritized investigating DEI programs in both the public and private sectors, and congressional oversight has followed suit. Shortly after President Trump took office, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, initiated an investigation into federal funding awarded by the National Science Foundation for DEI-related initiatives. More recently, on June 25, 2025, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing entitled “Sacrificing Excellence for Ideology: The Real Cost of DEI.” Members have further mirrored this policy agenda in their legislative efforts, introducing bills to eliminate DEI practices in the federal government and other entities, such as institutions of higher education.

Higher education. Congress and the Trump administration remain focused on colleges and universities, particularly with regard to DEI initiatives, tuition pricing, hiring practices, and antisemitism on campus. On April 8, 2025, the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to various universities requesting information on alleged collusion on tuition pricing. The Committee has since followed up with multiple institutions by issuing subpoenas for related documents and communications. Leadership of the House Committee on Education and Workforce also sent letters on March 27, 2025, to five universities demanding answers regarding their efforts to address antisemitism. As students return to campus this fall, this oversight activity may intensify.

Online censorship. The House Judiciary Committee is continuing its years-long investigation regarding censorship of conservative voices online. As part of the Committee’s investigation into the impact of foreign laws on free speech in the United States, on February 26, 2025, the Committee sent subpoenas to eight tech companies seeking communications with foreign governments regarding compliance with foreign censorship laws, regulations, and judicial orders. On July 25, 2025, the Committee issued its latest censorship report, titled “The Foreign Censorship Threat: How the European Union’s Digital Services Act Compels Global Censorship and Infringes on American Free Speech.”

China. China remains an area of bipartisan interest with members on both sides of the aisle focused on issues such as export controls, tariffs, bulk data transfers, and semiconductor and chip manufacturing. For example, on July 25, 2025, Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party Chairman John Moolenaar (R-MI), House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security Chairman Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), and Rep. Keith Self (R-TX) sent a letter to several major U.S. technology companies probing whether the subsea cable systems that each company maintains contain components produced, maintained, or repaired by entities affiliated with China. Earlier this month, senators on both sides of the aisle sent letters raising concerns about U.S. chip manufacturers selling chips in China and links to the Chinese government.

On the Rise: Parallel Executive Branch and State Attorneys General Investigations

Fundraising platforms. On April 24, 2025, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum “to crack down on illegal ‘straw donor’ and foreign contributions in American elections, following reports and congressional investigations regarding potentially unlawful activities through ActBlue and other online fundraising platforms” and directing the Attorney General to investigate and take action as appropriate. On June 22, 2025, multiple House committees—including the Judiciary Committee, Oversight Committee, and Committee on House Administration—sent a series of letters and subpoenas that also target ActBlue for its fundraising activities.

President Biden’s cognitive capabilities. On June 4, 2025, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum “directing an investigation into who ran the United States while President Biden was in office.” The memorandum asserts that President Biden’s “repeated use of an autopen raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of his actions” and seeks to determine who, in fact, signed presidential documents during Biden’s tenure. That same day, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) issued letters to former Biden administration officials seeking to compel their testimony regarding “President Biden’s cognitive state and who was calling the shots.” Both actions followed a May 22, 2025, announcement by Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Chair Ron Johnson (R-WI) stating that he sent letters to 28 former Biden cabinet members on the same topic.

Climate action. On August 1, 2025, a federal court in the Eastern District of Texas ruled that a group of Republican state attorneys general may proceed with a lawsuit that accuses three of the world’s largest investment companies of violating both state and federal antitrust laws based in part on their participation in climate initiatives. This lawsuit builds on inquiries initiated in 2022 by Republican state attorneys general, as well as a 2023-2024 House Judiciary investigation into the same three investment companies (as well as several other investment industry actors) regarding “the sufficiency of existing antitrust laws to address collusive agreements to promote and adopt progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals.” The Committee released its report on December 13, 2024.

Shadow of the Future: Democratic Members Target Entities that Cut Deals with the Trump Administration

Big Law. On April 24, 2025, minority members on the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to nearly a dozen major law firms following reports that the firms had made deals with the Trump administration in response to or in anticipation of being targeted by Executive Orders challenging the legal practices and hiring decisions at various large U.S. law firms. The Democratic congressmembers sought information on the “enforceability of these agreements, how each agreement was formed, what promises were made, and how the agreements will be implemented.”

Paramount-Skydance. On May 19, 2025, several Democratic members of the House and Senate sent letters to the chair of Paramount Global (“Paramount”) about the company’s apparent attempt to settle the lawsuit filed by President Trump against CBS, a Paramount subsidiary. The members expressed concern that Paramount was contemplating the settlement only because of the company’s announced plan to merge with Skydance Media—a merger that required the review and approval of the Trump administration’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC). On July 2, 2025, Paramount announced that it would pay $16 million to settle the CBS lawsuit with President Trump, and on August 7, 2025, the merger was completed. In response, Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) sent a letter to the FCC Chair on August 18, 2025, and ranking members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Judiciary Committee initiated an investigation into the Paramount-Skydance merger on August 21, 2025.

Pulitzer attorneys asked to shelve the dispute at least until Trump leaves office, pointing to a potential conflict should a state court seek to exercise authority over the nation’s chief executive. The case is in Florida because Trump and one of the board members live here.

Trump filed the defamation lawsuit against the Pulitzer board, the group that decides who wins Pulitzer prizes, after it bestowed a joint award in 2018 to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their reporting on alleged Russian interference in Trump’s first election.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller reported in 2019 that his investigation uncovered insufficient evidence of collusion between the Russians and Trump’s campaign, “despite multiple efforts from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.” Mueller left unresolved whether Trump committed obstruction of justice.

The Pulitzer board argued that halting the case would avoid constitutional conflicts that could arise from Trump serving as plaintiff in a case that could involve official acts as President. Trump argued the case should carry on. Both courts sided with Trump.

Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats were plunged into political crisis, especially splintered on immigration and border security, after their thorough defeat last year in an election in which President Donald Trump made hard-line immigration action a centerpiece of his campaign.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It’s putting a spotlight on Trump’s agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats are ramping up visits to detention centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration’s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado’s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It’s a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president’s deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump’s administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans hold firm even as public opinion shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump’s success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We’ve never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it’s one of the most secure southern borders we’ve had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they’re out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump’s approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There’s still a search for consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America’s security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration’s handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we’ll see if now’s the time.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/4c4d3cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5166x2906+0+273/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F44%2F79%2F0f2485217376ef07aa0bbc698ff0%2F2f3d4a8ef2b749b3adddc2c099a23b68,N,,2025-08-27 18:58:00.530735

Judge Lynn Adelman of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin denied Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah C. Dugan’s motion to dismiss a federal indictment. The indictment charges Dugan under 18 U.S.C. § 1071 with concealing a person from arrest and under 18 U.S.C. § 1505 with obstructing removal proceedings conducted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Federal prosecutors allege that in April 2025, Dugan confronted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents outside her courtroom, told them they needed a judicial warrant to arrest a noncitizen defendant, and directed them to leave the area. According to the indictment, she later allowed the individual and his attorney to exit through a non-public jury door, advising that he could appear remotely at his next court date.

In her motion to dismiss, Dugan argued that the alleged conduct constituted official judicial acts shielded by absolute immunity, that the prosecution violated the Tenth Amendment by intruding on state court authority, and that the statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional conflicts. Judge Adelman rejected these arguments, ruling that while judges enjoy immunity from civil suits for damages, the Supreme Court has never recognized absolute judicial immunity from criminal liability. He emphasized that judicial acts may serve as the means of accomplishing an unlawful end, and that immunity does not bar prosecutions alleging corrupt intent.

The court further held that the Tenth Amendment and federalism claims required factual development inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss, and found no ambiguity in the federal charging statutes that would justify narrowing them under the constitutional avoidance doctrine.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It’s putting a spotlight on Trump’s agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats are ramping up visits to detention centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration’s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado’s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia announced Wednesday that he is seeking asylum in the US, according to media reports.

The move comes in the wake of Abrego Garcia, 30, being detained Monday by immigration officials in the state of Maryland, after being released from a jail in Tennessee on Friday, where he is scheduled for a January 2027 trial in an alleged human smuggling case.

The Trump administration said it intends to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, claiming he is part of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang, an allegation that he denies.

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to his home country of El Salvador in March during a nationwide immigration crackdown conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, which targeted alleged MS-13 and Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members.

Under a 2019 court order in a separate case, Abrego Garcia was prohibited from being deported to El Salvador due to threats of violence against him by gang members. The order, however, allowed deportation to a different country, which places him in his current situation to be deported to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers are fighting those deportation efforts, arguing he faces persecution and torture in Uganda, which has documented human rights violations.

Abrego Garcia filed a Notice of Fear of Removal to Uganda to the court in which he stated his concerns.

""I, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia … hereby state that I fear persecution in UGANDA on account of my race, nationality, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group,"" he said. ""I also fear torture by or at the acquiescence of a public official in that country ... (and) that country will (re-deport me) to EL SALVADOR, where I also fear persecution on account of the above-mentioned protected grounds and torture by or at the acquiescence of a public official, and where I have been tortured in the past.""

US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the US cannot deport Abrego Garcia before she decides the underlying case. She also ruled that he must remain within a 200-mile (320-kilometer) radius of the Maryland court while he is in ICE custody.

Xinis scheduled an Oct. 6 hearing for the lawsuit that Abrego Garcia's attorneys filed Monday to challenge his deportation.

She is overseeing Abrego Garcia's case to ensure he can exercise his constitutionally protected rights during a process that his lawyers said should include immigration court proceedings and appeals. Xinis will not rule on whether Abrego Garcia receives asylum or is deported.

Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign said the government will comply with the order, even though he disagrees with the court's decision not to remove Abrego Garcia while the lawsuit is pending.

The SUVs were in small business parking lots and dotted along rural highways. By day’s end, the immigration enforcement raids had begun. More than 70 people were arrested and taken into Border Patrol custody.

In Kern County, immigration enforcement is typically handled by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Even then, arrests are usually targeted at specific individuals. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), on the other hand, rarely operates outside its 100-mile zone near the U.S.–Mexico border. Kern County is almost 300 miles away from that area. But on January 7th, Border Patrol agents cast a far wider net. They didn’t go after individual people. Instead, they stopped people of color, especially those who agents believed were farmworkers. Their tactics were aggressive and unprecedented.

For many, the raid — dubbed “Operation Return to Sender” — felt like more than a one-time sweep. It marked the start of a troubling new chapter in immigration enforcement.

“This Was Racial Profiling at Its Most Basic Level”

For Bree Bernwanger, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, the morning of January 7th started just like any other: then the calls began. Reports flooded in from Kern County that immigration agents were spotted in strange places throughout the county.

“They were slashing tires, smashing car windows,” Bernwanger recalls. “They pulled over cars, they grabbed people in parking lots, and there really didn’t seem to have any reason to do it except that people were brown. This was racial profiling at its most basic level.”

At first, everyone assumed these agents were ICE officers. But late one night, as Bernwanger checked the government’s detainee locator, she saw something unexpected. The people that had been arrested during the raid were in CBP custody. Border Patrol, which typically operates near the U.S.-Mexico border, had driven 300 miles into the Central Valley for a massive raid.

Agents targeted predominantly Latine neighborhoods and worksites, detaining people indiscriminately. People abducted were taken to a makeshift processing site in Bakersfield, then bused to an “icebox” in El Centro — freezing, windowless rooms with no beds, limited food, and no access to lawyers. Border Patrol coerced many into signing “voluntary departure” forms, misleading them about the consequences, which could include a 10-year ban on reentry.

Roughly 40 people were summarily expelled to Mexico without a hearing. Others, including U.S. citizens and longtime green card holders, were released but left shaken. Families and communities now live with the aftermath — fear, separation, and the knowledge that, as Bernwanger put it: “Everyone subjected to it is now picking up the pieces.”

“These folks’ rights are being violated. This should be concerning for all of us.”

Maricela Sanchez, an investigator with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, has lived her whole life advocating for our liberties and investigating civil rights abuses in the Central Valley. But on the morning of Operation Return to Sender, her social media feed showed something she’d never seen before: Border Patrol vehicles cruising down Highway 99 in Bakersfield.

“I haven’t seen that happen ever,” she recalls.

Through the Kern County Rapid Response Network — a coalition with a hotline and volunteers trained to document enforcement actions — and other partners, Sanchez helped interview dozens of people caught in the raids. Border Patrol foricibly reached into someone’s pocket to grab their ID from them. Another woman was driving home from work when she was pulled over by unmarked agents who never identified themselves. The next day, she was across the border in Mexico, separated from everything she had built in Bakersfield.

The stories Sanchez heard stayed with her: “Whenever I think about that week, I just think about how scary it was, how terrorizing it was. Just how much it affected our community.”

For Sanchez, these stories weren’t just case notes. They were the lives of her neighbors and friends. “So many children just stopped showing up to school. A lot of people didn’t feel comfortable coming to work. Folks completely stopped going to the store. How could that not impact you as a community member? Everyone should be concerned about this.”

“They thought no one would push back. But we did — and we’re not going anywhere.”

In Bakersfield, Rosa Lopez had been preparing for something like this for years. As a senior policy advocate with the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, she’d helped build the Kern County Rapid Response Network during the first Trump administration.

When the first calls came in on January 7, Lopez didn’t hesitate. She and her team dispatched volunteers across the county to record what they saw: license plates, uniforms, the way stops were conducted. Reports came in of canines, weapons drawn, and officers breaking windows — a level of aggression she’d never seen before.

This raid wasn’t routine. Border Patrol had set up a tent office, busing people straight to the border without legal access. Later, Lopez learned the raid had never been approved by the Department of Homeland Security. It was a rogue operation carried out by agents who thought they could act with impunity.

But the community was ready. Years of organizing meant people knew their rights, had red “Know Your Rights” cards in their pockets, and were willing to speak out. Lopez watched neighbors and community members step forward not just to report what they’d seen, but to stand beside those targeted, offering food, rides, and moral support.

“This is a moment that is going to test all of us,” Lopez said. “You can be afraid and hide, or you can be afraid and still stand up. We chose to stand up.”

The Stakes Beyond Kern County

The ACLU, United Farm Workers, and Bakersfield residents took Border Patrol to court for its unlawful and discriminatory actions during Operation Return to Sender. Agents operated far outside their legal jurisdiction, targeted people based on race, and denied them basic due process — all in violation of the Constitution. In April, in a major win for civil rights, a federal district court in California blocked the U.S. Border Patrol from using stop-and-arrest practices, which has led to zero warrantless arrest since the decision.

The ACLU and our partners will keep fighting in court and pushing for reforms that protect immigrant communities from racial profiling and abuse. We’ll also continue to work alongside residents, organizers, and labor groups to ensure no one has to live in fear of unlawful raids. We know this fight is about more than one county in California — it’s about defending the rights and dignity of people across the country.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/08/kern-county-social.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 14:57:01.427491

Allison Bustillo, now 20, said she is being forced to leave, alone.

Bustillo decided on Tuesday in court to withdraw her asylum case and self-deport back to Honduras.

Bustillo graduated as an academic scholar from Crest High School two years ago.

“I am going to ask for mercy,” Bustillo said.

Channel 9’s sister station, Telemundo Charlotte, spoke with Bustillo exclusively last weekend from the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia where she’s been held since late February.

ICE agents arrested Bustillo in her east Charlotte apartment where she lived with her mother and three brothers, one of whom has autism.

Channel 9 couldn’t find a criminal record for Bustillo.

She told Telemundo she is a nursing student on scholarship at Gardner-Webb University.

“I’m not a criminal,” Bustillo said. “I literally came here when I was 8 years old to look for a better life, and this is how they are treating me.”

Bustillo’s mother, Kelly Chinchilla, said her daughter was desperate after being imprisoned for more than six months.

“We have fought all this time so that she could be released and return home, but as a mother, I also understand her, because she is at a point where she is desperate,” Chinchilla said.

Bustillo’s attorney, Martin Rosenbluth, was able to get her a voluntary departure despite not qualifying for it.

“Technically, under the law, she wasn’t eligible,” said Rosenbluth.

That means she will leave the country without a deportation order.

Her mother said that’s not justice and her daughter going to Honduras would be terrifying.

“The only memory my daughter has of Honduras is when someone put a gun to our heads,” the mother said.

Telemundo said Bustillo will now leave the country on a commercial flight.

Bustillo said ICE agents arrested her after officers came to her house looking for someone who wasn’t living there anymore.

The head of ICE has said agents will arrest anyone they find in the country who is undocumented even if they don’t have a criminal record.

The Homeland Security secretary said 1.6 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. in her first 200 days on the job.

In a speech at London Oxford Airport on Tuesday, Mr Farage said his party would be prepared to deport 600,000 migrants over five years if it won power at the next election.

But Calum Miller, MP for Bicester and Woodstock, said the proposals were ""empty slogans"" which were ""not a substitute for serious policy"".

In a letter to Farage, Miller added that Oxfordshire was a ""community interested in solving problems, not fuelling conflict"".

""You came here to talk about 'mass deportations' but made no effort to understand the people or challenges of this community,"" he wrote to the Reform UK leader.

""If you return, I would be glad to show you Oxfordshire's real story: businesses thriving thanks to home and overseas talent, health and care services desperate for staff and residents supporting refugees with compassion.""

""He spent his career grappling with difficult truths and forging alliances in our national interest,"" the Liberal Democrat wrote.

""Instead of sowing division, we should build on that legacy.""

The BBC has contacted Reform UK and Nigel Farage for a response to Calum Miller's letter.

During Tuesday's speech, Farage said his party would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, under plans announced earlier.

The party says it would make £2bn available to offer payments or aid to countries like Afghanistan to take back migrants, with sanctions potentially imposed on uncooperative countries.

It doesn't mean that we can't have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month.","Washington — Democrats were plunged into political crisis, especially splintered on immigration and border security, after their thorough defeat last year in an election in which President Donald Trump made hard-line immigration action a centerpiece of his campaign.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It's putting a spotlight on Trump's agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats are ramping up visits to detention centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration's actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado's House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It's a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president's deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump's administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans hold firm even as public opinion shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump's success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We've never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it's one of the most secure southern borders we've had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they're out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump's approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There's still a search for consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America's security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn't mean that we can't have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration's handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we'll see if now's the time.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/25/PDTN/85816129007-ap-25237406801430.jpg?crop=4677,2632,x0,y311&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-27 14:57:05.296749

More than 180 current and former Fema employees signed the letter sent to the Fema Review Council and Congress on Monday critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs, and warning that Fema’s capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished.
“Stand Up for Science is proud to have hosted their Katrina Declaration and we stand by the Fema 36,” the person added.

Among those facing potential retaliation are staff who were directly responsible for relief efforts in Kerr county, Texas, which is still reeling from the deadly floods it faced last month, according to Stand Up for Science, the advocacy group that published the Monday letter.

“This situation is developing, but this decision underscores the many issues these public servants described in their declaration and their bravery in standing up for Americans in need,” said a Stand Up for Science spokesperson.

More than 180 current and former Fema employees signed the letter sent to the Fema Review Council and Congress on Monday critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs, and warning that Fema’s capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished.

Thirty-six signed their names while 141 signed anonymously for fear of retribution. Some reports say that up to 30 signatories have been placed on leave.

Though Stand Up for Science could not confirm that number, “it seems likely they’ve retaliated against all public signers”, a spokesperson said.

“Stand Up for Science is proud to have hosted their Katrina Declaration and we stand by the Fema 36,” the person added.

The Associated Press confirmed that at least two of the signatories received notices on Tuesday evening informing them they would be placed on leave indefinitely, with pay, and that they must still check in every morning confirming their availability. The status of other signatories was unclear.

The notice said the decision “is not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive”.

Fema did not respond immediately to questions about how many staff members received the notice and whether it was related to the letter.

The Washington Post first reported that some Fema employees were being put on leave.

Called the “Katrina Declaration” by signers, the letter references the much-criticized Fema response to Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf coast 20 years ago this week.

Jeremy Edwards, former spokesperson for Fema and the White House under Joe Biden’s presidency, who signed the letter, said the agency had been “completely unprepared for Katrina because of where they were positioned within the federal government at the time”.

He said the Trump administration was failing to comply with the 2006 Post Katrina Emergency Response Act (PKEMRA) passed to prevent future botched disaster responses.

“As an example, PKEMRA required Fema to be led by someone with disaster management experience. This administration failed that test,” he said. “It requires that the secretary of homeland security not reduce the capacity or ability of the agency. They failed that test. And it requires them to provide training and preparedness measures for state and local partners, and they’ve rolled back a lot of those trainings, or put them on pause.”

The dissent letter contained six “statements of opposition” to current policies at Fema, including an expenditure approval policy by which the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, must approve contracts exceeding $100,000, which the signatories said reduces Fema’s ability to perform its mission.

It also critiqued the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to reassign some Fema employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the failure to appoint a qualified Fema administrator as stipulated by law, and cuts to mitigation programs, preparedness training and the Fema workforce.

Edwards said the Trump administration could immediately appoint a new acting Fema administrator with more disaster management experience, and end new policies requiring Noem to sign off on agency spending.

But at least one anonymous current staffer was skeptical of the letter’s ability to deliver change.

“I appreciate where their heart is but not a lot of upside for folks who work here to sign on to something like that,” the anonymous staffer said.

In an email on Monday, a Fema spokesperson said: “It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform.

“Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo, who have forgotten that their duty is to the American people not entrenched bureaucracy.”

The statement was “an insult to anyone working at Fema, the agency directly responsive to rapidly intensifying and changing circumstances”, said a Stand Up for Science spokesperson.

The letter follows reports that the Department of Homeland Security, Fema’s parent agency, has administered lie detector tests in response to leaks about how the agency is being run.

“There is a huge culture of fear and intimidation that the secretary of homeland security has imposed upon the agency, and that David Richardson [Fema’s acting administrator] is also imposing,” said Edwards.

He said he had known people who were “unceremoniously fired on the spot” after failing polygraph tests.

“They refute the results, mind you, and these aren’t legitimate exercises, but they were walked out of the building,” he said. “The fact that the people who signed on to this letter saw all that happening, knew that that very same thing could happen to them, and they still took the risk because they thought it was important to put their name on this thing, I think speaks to an immense amount of courage on behalf of these people.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01b0babd9f82754fc4d8b36f078ffd24857b777e/62_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe3dafd41c98a07594f7e264522aee2a",N,,2025-08-27 14:57:09.951239

John Shin immigrated to Utah on a visa with his father from South Korea when he was a child, according to his attorney Adam Crayk.

He went to elementary school, high school and college in the Beehive state, graduating from Utah State University, before going on to play on some of the biggest stages, including a stint with the Utah Symphony and Ballet West.

On Tuesday, Shin’s wife Danae Snow, an American citizen, told ABC4 News that she got a heartbreaking phone call from him on her birthday Wednesday, August 20.

“That morning he was texting me ‘happy birthday, I love you so much’ and then by that afternoon, I got the phone call ‘honey, I’ve been detained by ICE, I love you and the kids and they’re sending me to a detainment center,” Snow said behind tears. “I just thought, oh my gosh, I don’t know how this can happen.”

Snow described Shin as a charismatic, selfless person, who not only contributes to society in a big way, but also to her family.

“They say that there’s stepdads and then there’s dads who step up and he’s really the dad who stepped up and he’s loved my kids just as his own,” Snow said.

According to Crayk, ICE arrested Shin because of Shin’s impaired driving charge several years ago, while he was struggling with the death of his father.

“It looks like John back in 2019 was charged with a DUI, but ultimately resolved his case in 2020 with an impaired driver [charge],” Crayk said. “He has successfully completed all of his probation, completed treatment classes, everything he was ordered to do … everything was completed.”

Shin had his driver’s license reinstated and was able to drive on Utah roads again with insurance.

“The problem that you have though, is as someone who is coming to the United States and who doesn’t currently have proper documentation because when you get a DUI, DACA gets taken — immigration will not let you have DACA with a DUI,” Crayk said. “He becomes a priority, especially under the current administration — so, he was taken into ICE custody because he accepted and did an agreement in Tooele County for an impaired driver, which caused ICE to take him into custody.”

Crayk is aiming to get Shin out of the ICE detention center in Aurora, Colorado during Shin’s first court appearance next Tuesday.

The Trump administration could just send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, which already said it would accept him, the lawsuit said.","NASHVILLE (AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who has become the face of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, is in a Virginia detention center facing deportation to the east African country of Uganda.

The Maryland construction worker, 30, was detained Monday in Baltimore by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement after leaving a Tennessee jail on Friday. Administration officials have said he’s part of the dangerous MS-13 gang, an allegation Abrego Garcia denies.

The Salvadoran national’s lawyers are fighting the deportation efforts in court, arguing he has the right to express fear of persecution and torture in Uganda. Abrego Garcia has also told immigration authorities he would prefer to be sent to Costa Rica if he must be removed from the U.S.

It’s the latest twist in a long and complicated legal saga under the administration’s hardline deportation policies.

As his deportation proceedings and a related lawsuit move forward, here’s what to know:

Why does the government want to deport him?

Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. without documentation when he was 16. He settled in Maryland, worked construction, married and started a family.

A U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for deportation in 2019, but not to his native El Salvador where he faces credible threats of violence from local gangs.

The Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, in violation of the 2019 order. His American wife successfully sued to bring him back in June, and on his return he was charged with human trafficking in Tennessee — charges his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration is trying to deport him again — before his trial — saying he’s a danger to the community. Confidential plea negotiations in his criminal case have become an opportunity for mudslinging on both sides.

Lawyers: Uganda is punishment

After the Trump administration was forced to bring Abrego Garcia back in June, ICE officials vowed to deport him to a unnamed third country. Within minutes of his release from criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday, ICE said he would be deported to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia notified the U.S. government Saturday that he fears deportation to Uganda, where he believes he could be tortured. He said he also worries that Uganda will send him to El Salvador, where he said he’s been tortured before.

In a separate notice, he said he would prefer to be deported to Costa Rica.

The notices were included in the lawsuit filed Monday. It says the U.S. is punishing Abrego Garcia for successfully fighting his deportation to El Salvador, refusing to plead guilty to the smuggling charges and for seeking release from jail in Tennessee.

Meanwhile, opposition figures and others in Uganda have criticized the agreement with the U.S. to receive deported migrants, questioning the lack of parliamentary approval and saying the deal eases political pressure on the country’s authoritarian president.

Without parliamentary oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda’s national assembly.

He said Uganda is already struggling to look after refugees fleeing violence in neighboring countries. It’s unclear what Ugandan authorities are getting in return for accepting deportees.

Costa Rica and plea negotiations

The idea to deport Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica was borne of weekslong negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys in his human smuggling case.

Abrego Garcia is accused of taking money to transport people who were in the country illegally. He has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, saying it was filed to punish him for challenging his deportation. Trial is set for January.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee. There were nine passengers in the SUV and Abrego Garcia had $1,400 in cash on him. While officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling, he was allowed to drive away with only a warning.

A Homeland Security agent testified that he didn’t begin investigating until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.

Prosecutors and defense attorneys began confidential discussions about a possible plea agreement in mid-July, according to court filings. Abrego Garcia was only interested in a deal in which “he is deported to a Spanish-speaking third country in North or Central America — like Mexico — where he can live freely and safely” after serving his sentence in the U.S.

Working with the State Department, the U.S. Attorney’s Office was able to secure a pledge from Costa Rica that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed there as a legal immigrant and not detained or re-deported to El Salvador. Prosecutors believed the two sides were very close to an agreement last week.

But within minutes of Abrego Garcia leaving jail on Friday, ICE informed his attorneys that it intended to deport him to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia’s defense attorneys publicized details of the plea negotiations in a Saturday court filing. They said the threat of deportation to Uganda was more proof of the vindictive nature of the criminal case and more reason to dismiss it.

Prosecutors shot back on Monday, defending their handling of the plea discussions and accusing defense attorneys of “twisting the Government’s good-faith efforts into something sinister.”

Reasonable fear interview

In his lawsuit, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers asked the court to ensure that he can exercise his constitutional rights, including immigration court proceedings and appeals.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s lead immigration attorney, told reporters Monday that he is entitled to a reasonable fear interview, when he can express fears of persecution or torture in Uganda.

If officials determine Abrego Garcia lacks reasonable fear, he should be allowed to ask a U.S. immigration judge to review that decision, his lawyer said. And if the immigration judge upholds the determination, Abrego Garcia should be able to bring it to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

The Trump administration could just send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, which already said it would accept him, the lawsuit said. But the administration chose Uganda “to punish him.”

They may come to the emergency room, bringing in someone who’s suffering a medical crisis while being detained. They may wait in the lobby, as agents did for two weeks at an L.A.-area hospital waiting for a woman to be discharged. Or they may even chase people inside, as federal agents did at a Southern California surgical center.

The sight of these agents — often armed and with covered faces — makes many wary and may keep people from seeking care.

Existing hospital policies guide operations when law enforcement brings in a person under arrest, hospital officials say.

“This is nothing new to hospitals,” said Lois Richardson, vice president and counsel at the California Hospital Association. “We get inmates, detainees, arrestees all the time, whether it's police, sheriff, highway patrol, ICE, whatever it is.” The job for hospital workers remains to provide care, she added, and not to get involved in disputes over why a person is in custody.

Yet immigration attorneys, advocates and health workers have expressed concerns over the handling of some of these cases, both by immigration officers and by some administrators at medical facilities.

Specifically, they’re worried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.

“We have a level of privacy that we owe to patients and their families, and that has just been completely demolished with all of the involvement of ICE coming into hospitals,” said Kate Mobeen, an ICU nurse at John Muir Medical Center in Concord. “It creates just a huge sense of fear, not only in our patient population, but in our employee population and our nurses.”

Patients' rights, policies face new tests

Sometimes when ICE has shown up at medical facilities with a detained patient, the result has been conflicting messaging about the rules.

On July 29, ICE agents took a man to John Muir Medical Center in Concord because he suffered an unspecified medical emergency while being detained outside the Concord immigration court, according to Ali Saidi, an attorney and the director of Stand Together Contra Costa, a local rapid response and legal services organization.

When Saidi arrived at the hospital as part of the response network, he said hospital staff told him that he was not allowed to see the detained patient, but that the man’s family would be allowed. Then, when the man’s wife arrived, “The rules had somehow changed, and they said no family visit,” Saidi said.

In a statement shared by the Contra Costa Immigrants Rights Alliance, the detained man’s wife, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, Maria, said that when she later talked to her husband, he told her that he was so terrified that he passed out.

“My family and I went to the emergency room and we asked to see him and talk to him to make sure he was okay,” Maria said, in the statement. “The hospital staff would not let us see him and they would not give us any information about what was happening to him. They wouldn’t even answer my questions.”

John Muir officials would not comment on the incident, citing privacy laws. But in an email, Ben Drew, a spokesperson for the hospital, said general policy is that “If a law enforcement agency indicates that visitation presents a safety or security concern, [the hospital] may limit or deny visitation to protect our patients, staff, and visitors.”

Saidi said that when the wife insisted on getting information about the man’s condition, hospital security called the police.

“We understand that emotions are high whenever a family member or friend is in the emergency department or hospital,” said Drew. “The hospital only involves local police in circumstances when a patient or visitor’s behavior becomes abusive, disruptive, or threatening, and cannot be resolved through our own security team.”

Saidi denied that the family was being disruptive, saying that conversations with hospital staff and administration were respectful and no voices were raised.

“The atmosphere in that emergency bay was something like I’ve never seen before in my career,” Saidi said. “There was a chilling effect. Everyone was averting their eyes. You could tell the staff felt bad.”

Multiple emergency department nurses told Mobeen, a local California Nurses Association leader at John Muir, that ICE officers were “very aggressive with staff” and staff were afterwards “emotionally and physically upset” by what happened, she said.

“It’s horrifying to not be able to tell patients’ family members how they are, what their status is,” Mobeen said.

Part of the issue, Mobeen added, is training. Staff were not given adequate training on how to respond to any kind of immigration enforcement action that may occur at the hospital, she said.

Drew, the spokesman for John Muir, countered that the hospital has given guidance on its longstanding law enforcement policy and answered multiple questions since January about what to do if ICE agents show up at their facilities.

Limits for ICE access, sometimes murky

Last month, immigration agents occupied the lobby of Dignity Health’s Glendale Memorial Hospital, even standing behind reception desks, as photos that circulated online showed. Protestors gathered outside the hospital hosting rallies and press conferences.

They were all there because agents had previously brought in Milagro Solis-Portillo, an immigrant from El Salvador, for medical care following her detention. They spent 15 days in the hospital waiting for Solis-Portillo’s discharge before transferring her to another hospital and then taking her into custody, according to local news reports.

In a statement, officials from Dignity Memorial Hospital said they could not legally prohibit law enforcement from being in public areas.

That’s true, say legal experts: Waiting rooms and lobbies are considered public spaces in hospitals. But agents cannot move through hospitals without limits. Law enforcement officials are not allowed to search for people in exam rooms or other private spaces without a federal court warrant.

When agents bring in someone who is in their custody and needs medical care, the application of the law can be more murky.

According to Richardson at the hospital association, how far an agent can go into treatment areas with a detained patient may be decided on a case by case basis. In cases where a detained patient is struggling or resisting, that patient may need guarding, she explained.

And if law enforcement officers do go inside exam rooms, they may hear medical information while on guard. But that isn't necessarily a privacy violation, according to federal rules. The HIPPA Privacy Rule, the law that sets privacy standards for medical information, has a provision that allows for “incidental disclosures” of information as long as “reasonable safeguards” are applied.

“The hospital will, and the doctor will make reasonable attempts to protect the patient's privacy.” “What is reasonable is going to depend, again, on what's wrong with the patient, how the patient is behaving, the nature of the circumstances,” Richardson said.

HIPAA protects the disclosure of medical records, which include names, addresses and social security numbers along with health conditions. State law also requires health facilities to protect this information. According to guidance from the attorney general’s office, health facilities should consider a patient’s immigration status confidential.

At the same time, some disclosures are required if law enforcement can prove lawful custody or show an appropriate warrant. A federal court warrant signed by a judge grants law enforcement immediate access to information or to search a particular area, while an ICE administrative warrant does not require immediate compliance.

Health workers in 'precarious' situations

Health facilities generally direct frontline workers not to engage with immigration agents, but rather to immediately contact security or management.

One particular incident at a Southern California surgery center stands out, in conversation with health workers.

On July 8, federal agents targeted three landscapers who had parked outside of the Ontario Advanced Surgical Center. They chased one of the men inside on foot, according to a felony criminal complaint filed against two health care workers in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

In videos of the incident posted online, a masked agent wearing a vest labeled “POLICE ICE” on the back holds a weeping man by the shoulder inside the center while several workers in scrubs stand by. At multiple points in the video workers ask the officer for identification; one worker says, “this is a private business.”

Two workers, Danielle Davila and Jose Ortega, tell the officer to leave. Davila moves between the officer and the man, saying “Get your hands off of him. You don’t even have a warrant.”

Ortega puts an arm between Davila and the officer and says “You have no proper identification.”

The officer says to both workers “You touched a federal agent.” Then Davila responds, “I’m not touching you.”

Davila and Ortega were later charged with two felony counts of assaulting a federal officer and conspiring to prevent a federal officer from performing their duties.

Last week the felony charges were dismissed and both Davila and Ortega pleaded not guilty to a subsequent misdemeanor assault charge. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment on the charges.

Davila’s defense attorney Oliver Cleary said his client believed she was doing the right thing by asking for credentials and a warrant.

“You can’t just come in where people are getting medical care and whisk them away,” Cleary said. “She didn’t know who these people were. They didn’t tell her who they were, and as far as she knew this was a patient of the clinic.”

Carlos Juárez, Ortega’s defense attorney, said arresting and charging health workers with crimes for asking to see a warrant and identification puts them in a “precarious” and “dangerous situation.”

“They did what they needed to do and what they had a right to do,” Juárez said. “What I hope is it doesn’t have a chilling effect on other health care workers.”

Workers say additional training can help

Around the state, health workers say they’d like to see management provide additional guidance on how to respond to such scenarios if they were to play out in their workplace. Some workers are providing training themselves.

Adriana Rugeles-Ortiz, a licensed vocational nurse at Kaiser Permanente Modesto Medical Center, has been leading “Know Your Rights” sessions at her hospital and in her community as part of her union, SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. She said some of her coworkers have expressed anxiety over some of the situations they’ve seen play out in other hospitals.

“Because of my involvement with all the training that we have done to the workers and to the community, personally, I do feel prepared. I am not that confident that we have been able to reach the entire workforce within Kaiser to get them to the level of confidence to deal with it,” Rugeles-Ortiz said.

Dr. Douglas Yoshida, an emergency room physician at Stanford Health Tri-Valley in Alameda County, said additional guidance and training for workers at medical facilities could be of great value.

“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said. “I mean, personally, if someone comes in in ICE custody, within the limits of the law, I want to do everything I can to help [patients.]”

The hospital in Pleasanton that Yoshida works in is located near the county’s Santa Rita Jail; staff, he said, have been used to a law enforcement presence. But the recent incident at John Muir Medical Center, about 30 miles north, as well as the criminal charges filed against the southern California surgery center workers have set people on edge, Yoshida said.

“Normally, health care workers have no reason to fear law enforcement,” he added, “but we’re in uncharted territory.”

“The Supreme Court should see through that ruse.”","The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court for the second time to allow the government to freeze, for now, billions of dollars in foreign aid.

In an emergency request, the administration asked the justices to lift an order from a federal judge that requires the administration to spend funds Congress already budgeted for foreign aid.

The administration has moved aggressively to seize control of the executive branch and claimed broad authority to halt federal dollars appropriated by Congress for programs at odds with President Trump’s agenda.

The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has generally been receptive to the administration’s claims, handing the president a series of technically temporary victories that have nevertheless had broad practical consequences. In emergency rulings, the justices have allowed Mr. Trump to fire independent agency regulators, cut grants to teacher training programs and remove protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants.

But in an earlier iteration of the foreign aid case in March, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, along with the three liberal justices, rejected Mr. Trump’s request to freeze nearly $2 billion while the case continued in the lower courts.

Lower court judges have issued a series of conflicting rulings as to whether Mr. Trump can refuse to spend the funds.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order temporarily ending programs around the world to determine whether they were “fully aligned with the foreign policy of the president.”

The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, both nonprofit groups, challenged the freeze as an unconstitutional infringement on Congress’s power of the purse.

Judge Amir Ali of the Federal District Court in Washington said in March that the administration had unlawfully delayed the money and required the administration to allow funds to flow, including nearly $4 million for global health and more than $6 million for H.I.V. and AIDS programs.

Then, earlier this month, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with Mr. Trump, finding that the global health organizations that challenged the freeze lacked grounds to bring the lawsuit. In a 2-1 ruling, the appeals court said that only the Government Accountability Office, an independent watchdog controlled by Congress, could challenge the administration’s withholding of funds.

Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the office can sue to force the release of funds a president refuses to spend. But it has not yet taken that step.

A larger complement of judges on the D.C. Circuit then refused to allow the three-judge panel ruling to immediately take effect while the full 10-member appeals court decided whether to rehear the matter. (One judge has recused herself.)

That prompted Solicitor General D. John Sauer to race to the Supreme Court this week, telling the justices that lawmakers and the president — not a single federal judge in Washington — should resolve disputes over how or whether to disperse federal funds appropriated by Congress.

“Given the vast sums involved and the significance of the case to the separation of powers and U.S. foreign policy, the district court’s holdings, if allowed to stand, would clearly warrant this court’s attention, and those holdings would not survive review,” Mr. Sauer wrote, asking the justices for a decision by Sept. 2.

The district court’s ruling, he added, “would open the floodgates to suits by private parties who compete for appropriated funds and who seek to impose judicial oversight on executive spending decisions at odds with the process Congress prescribed.”

In response, the lead lawyer for the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition noted that the administration had waited months before asking the justices to block the lower court’s ruling.

“Now they are running to the Supreme Court, claiming at the last second that they would be harmed by compliance with the district court’s order,” Lauren Bateman, a lawyer at Public Citizen Litigation Group, said in a statement. “The Supreme Court should see through that ruse.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/27/multimedia/27dc-scotus-usaid-mfpk/27dc-scotus-usaid-mfpk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:03.936284

As lawmakers prepare to return next week from their August recess, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) wants them to get to work on immigration reform and bolstering federal safety net programs, among other issues, framing its advocacy work around protecting human dignity and supporting the most vulnerable.

“As a nonpartisan organization, the USCCB is engaged with members of Congress, their staff, and the White House and the administration to advance the common good for all and uphold the sacredness of human life and the God-given dignity of the human person,” Chieko Noguchi, the USCCB’s executive director for public affairs, told CNA.

“This means that the care for immigrants, refugees, and the poor is part of the same teaching of the Church that requires us to protect the most vulnerable among us, especially unborn children, the elderly, and the infirm,” Noguchi noted.

Addressing the conference’s ongoing public policy priorities, Noguchi referenced a letter to members of Congress earlier this year from USCCB President Archbishop Timothy Broglio that in addition to immigration reform called for legislation that supports vulnerable communities, especially children and low-income families.

But following this summer’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act spending package, Broglio faulted that measure for including “unconscionable cuts to health care and food assistance, tax cuts that increase inequality, immigration provisions that harm families and children, and cuts to programs that protect God’s creation.”

A recently emerging issue for the bishops is digital safety. In a joint letter this July with other faith-based and family organizations, the USCCB voiced support for the Kids Online Safety Act. The measure would place greater responsibility on technology companies to design platforms that protect minors from harmful content and addictive features. The bishops described the legislation as consistent with their commitment to safeguarding children and promoting environments where families can thrive.

This fall, immigration remains central to USCCB advocacy efforts. The bishops continue to press Congress to provide permanent protections for so-called “Dreamers,” referring to people who were brought to the U.S. as children.

“The continued uncertainty associated with the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program is untenable and unjust, depriving hardworking people the ability to be fully recognized members of our society,” the conference maintains.

The bishops also oppose changes to social safety net programs that would limit eligibility for mixed-status families (those with both legal and unauthorized members). They cite, for example, the Child Tax Credit, which currently only requires the benefiting child to have a Social Security number.

“This is consistent with the goals of such programs, which exist to empower families and to prevent them from falling into poverty,” the USCCB asserts.

Religious Workforce Protection Act

The bishops are also urging passage of the Religious Workforce Protection Act, which as of Aug. 22 had 10 Democrat and three Republican lawmakers cosponsoring the House bill and would authorize the continuation of lawful nonimmigrant status for certain religious workers affected by the current backlog for religious worker immigrant visas.

A similar bill in the Senate now has five Republicans and one Democrat cosponsoring. Numerous Catholic institutions such as parishes and schools depend on international clergy. In an Aug. 7 interview with EWTN, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Trump administration is committed to fixing the ongoing backlog of religious worker visas.

Despite the fact that earlier this year the USCCB ended its decades-long partnership with the federal government to resettle refugees due to funding cuts and suspended agreements that made the program unsustainable, the bishops continue to call for generous resettlement policies and humane border enforcement.

Housing is also an increasing policy focus. In an Aug. 8 letter, the bishops pressed Congress to strengthen funding for affordable housing and community development in the fiscal year 2026 appropriations process.

(Story continues below)

Meanwhile, the USCCB’s advocacy around health care policy remains linked to the Church’s pro-life stance. The bishops have been strongly supportive of congressional efforts to ensure that federal programs such as Medicaid do not fund abortion. In July, a federal judge blocked a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that was aimed at defunding Planned Parenthood for one year and ordered the federal government to resume Medicaid reimbursements to the abortion giant while litigation over the law continues.

The USCCB also supports expanding access to maternal health services, pediatric care, and palliative care. Broadly on fiscal policy, the USCCB has called for a federal budget that prioritizes the poor and reflects Catholic principles of solidarity centered on the common good.

The bishops also continue to press for robust support for international humanitarian aid. As global crises intensify, the bishops have asked Congress to provide funding for humanitarian and development assistance in the fiscal year 2026 budget. Funding for the current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. The USCCB frames these legislative priorities as connected parts of a single mission.

“The decisions you make in your important work on behalf of our nation will have a lasting impact on the well-being and common good of many people,” Broglio wrote.

“I would rescind his executive order, yes,” Spanberger told The Mercury in a lengthy policy interview earlier this month, referring to Youngkin’s Executive Order 47 issued in February.
Spanberger countered that Youngkin’s approach illustrates how immigration enforcement can pull local agencies away from their core responsibilities while pushing state agencies into federal civil enforcement.
She pointed to her former district of Prince William County, which she said spent more than $1 million housing detainees under a prior partnership with federal immigration authorities.
Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law.","Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger says one of her first acts if elected would be to undo Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s February directive requiring Virginia law enforcement to help carry out federal immigration crackdowns — a policy she argues wastes local resources and undermines community trust.

“I would rescind his executive order, yes,” Spanberger told The Mercury in a lengthy policy interview earlier this month, referring to Youngkin’s Executive Order 47 issued in February. The order gave state police and corrections officers authority to perform certain immigration duties and also urged local jails to fully cooperate with federal deportation operations.

The governor said at the time the measure was meant to keep “dangerous criminal illegal immigrants” off Virginia’s streets. Spanberger countered that Youngkin’s approach illustrates how immigration enforcement can pull local agencies away from their core responsibilities while pushing state agencies into federal civil enforcement.

“Our immigration system is absolutely broken,” she said. “The idea that we would take local police officers or local sheriff’s deputies in amid all the things that they have to do, like community policing or staffing our jails or investigating real crimes, so that they can go and tear families apart … that is a misuse of those resources.”

Spanberger’s stance sets up a sharp contrast with her opponent — Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who has embraced the order and tied it to her own story as a legal immigrant from Jamaica.

The divide between the two candidates underscores how immigration has become one of the most combustible issues in Virginia’s 2025 campaign for governor — and how Youngkin’s policies continue to shape the race even as he prepares to leave office in January.

That influence stretches beyond Youngkin’s executive order. In late February, Youngkin also launched the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, a sweeping federal-state operation staffed with more than 200 personnel from agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the FBI, state police and corrections, which has claimed hundreds to thousands of immigration and gang-related arrests in Virginia.

Keep enforcement federal, Spanberger says

Spanberger, who represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District in Congress before launching her gubernatorial bid, argued that immigration enforcement should be handled by federal officials with judicial oversight, not by local police diverted from their own duties.

She said Democrats are often wrongly portrayed as opposing law enforcement when they object to policies like Youngkin’s that conscript local agencies into immigration sweeps.

“If someone has a criminal violation at the state level or at the federal level … local resources are required to arrest that person or put them in a local jail before transferring them to federal custody. Absolutely the locality should participate in that,” she said.

But Spanberger insisted the standard should be the same for immigration cases as for any other criminal matter.

“They have to have a warrant to pick somebody up off the street, so they meet that same standard,” she said. “And they can easily go get that detention order signed by a judge or a magistrate, if they want that local support.”

Without those safeguards, Spanberger argued, local cooperation with ICE undermines community policing, creates constitutional concerns and strains already tight budgets. She pointed to her former district of Prince William County, which she said spent more than $1 million housing detainees under a prior partnership with federal immigration authorities.

Earle-Sears emphasizes rule of law

Earle-Sears, who initially agreed to a similar policy interview with The Mercury but canceled minutes before it was to take place, has publicly and repeatedly defended Youngkin’s executive order.

“I am a legal immigrant and now a naturalized citizen. Working together, the governor, attorney general, and I have made Virginia safer,” she said in February when announcing the policy. “Now, working with President Trump, we can take on the scourge of dangerous and violent illegal immigrants.”

In December, while unveiling a “No Sanctuary Cities” budget proposal, she described the bureaucratic hurdles her own family went through when immigrating to the U.S. and argued that others should follow the same path.

“My father and I had to file documents and wait to be granted permission to enter the United States. Under Governor Youngkin’s leadership, Virginia stands firm: we are not a sanctuary state,” she said.

“The rule of law is not negotiable — it is the foundation of our safety, our freedom, and the promise of opportunity that defines America,” she added.

Earle-Sears’ broader ideas on immigration remain unclear, as she has not gone beyond a handful of public statements and her campaign website offers no issue page outlining her positions.

Dispute over Youngkin’s deportation claims

The candidates also diverge sharply on Youngkin’s claim in July that all 2,500 immigrants arrested and deported by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force are “violent criminals.”

Spanberger said she has seen no evidence to support the governor’s sweeping assertion.

“If they were violent criminals, presumably, they were arrested on those charges for the violent crime that they committed, in which case, there would be clear documentation,” she said. “Frankly, as somebody who believes in upholding the law, I want people to be arrested for the crimes that they are committing.”

Civil rights groups have also raised alarms, arguing that Youngkin’s mandate is “playing politics with people’s lives.”

“For years, Virginia’s governor has been pushing the same dangerous, false narrative as the Trump administration that immigrants commit crime at higher rates than people who were born here, despite the fact that no data exists to support that conclusion,” the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia said in a statement.

Earle-Sears has not directly addressed the governor’s 2,500 figure but has frequently pointed to grim cases of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in arguing for tougher enforcement.

“We’ve seen too many tragic stories after dangerous criminals in this country illegally were put back on the streets, and this executive order will make sure we send them back to where they came from,” she said earlier this year.

The Laken Riley Act

The immigration debate has also touched on Spanberger’s record in Congress.

Earle-Sears has faulted her for initially voting against the Laken Riley Act, named for a Georgia college student killed by a Venezuelan national who entered the country unlawfully. The law, which eventually passed after Spanberger left Congress, requires federal authorities to detain immigrants accused of theft and burglary while their cases proceed.

Spanberger said she opposed the bill in its first iteration because it “was essentially putting incredible burdens on localities removing any form of due process” and would not have prevented Riley’s murder.

“As a mother of three daughters, I was deeply offended that they would utilize that young woman’s murder as a political talking point,” she said. “At the time of that vote, her father was in the press saying that he was deeply distressed by the fact that her murder was being utilized in the way that it was.”

David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said Spanberger has staked out a position that balances criticism of Trump-era immigration policies with support for reforms viewed as moderate.

“Spanberger has been fairly vocal in criticizing the Trump administration’s methods of dealing with undocumented immigration,” Richards said.

“Her voting record on bills centered around immigration has been mixed, supporting some of the more moderate bills, but voting ‘no’ on some key GOP bills like the No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act. … It falls in line with her presenting herself as a pragmatic candidate.”

By contrast, he said, Earle-Sears has been relatively quiet on immigration, surfacing the issue primarily when it intersects with her biography or when amplifying President Donald Trump’s agenda.

“She did talk about the issue back in June, saying that she, as an immigrant, did things the ‘right way.’ But overall, she has skirted the issue,” Richards said.

“She may feel that the issue is not one she can really win with in Virginia, although, as more immigration related arrests happen in the commonwealth, she may have to start talking about this.”

The bigger picture

The fight over immigration in Virginia is inseparable from national politics. Youngkin has aligned himself closely with Trump on enforcement strategies, boasting of joint operations with ICE and staging press events around courthouse raids and “gang and immigration sweeps” that have drawn criticism from Democrats and civil liberties groups.

Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law. She cited bipartisan bills like the Farm Workforce Modernization Act and the Dignity Act as examples of incremental progress, even if they fell short.

“There are many places where the governors of states can bang on the table and tell Congress, ‘Stop making this such a political issue that you campaign on every two years and just fix it,’” she said.

She added that immigration is not only a humanitarian concern but also a pressing economic issue for Virginia, from hospitals seeking visas for foreign-trained nurses to seafood producers dependent on seasonal guest workers.

Earle-Sears, meanwhile, has emphasized border security and public safety, drawing a bright line between legal immigrants like herself and those who arrive unlawfully.

“Any local elected official who instructs law enforcement to defy efforts to keep Virginians safe abandons their duty and breaks the trust of the people they swore to protect,” she said last year.

Looking ahead

With polls showing immigration remains a top concern among Republican voters — and a complicated one among independents — the issue is likely to stay at the forefront of this year’s election cycle.

Spanberger is betting Virginians will see Youngkin’s executive order as overreach that diverts local resources and harms public safety by discouraging immigrant communities from reporting crimes. Earle-Sears is counting on voters to view strict enforcement as common sense, framed by her own story of navigating the legal immigration system.

“Maybe she is waiting for a Trump endorsement,” Richards said of Earle-Sears. “But if immigration remains in the headlines, she may not be able to avoid it.”

For now, voters face a stark choice between a Democrat who vows to unwind the governor’s crackdown and press Congress for broader reforms, and a Republican who pledges to double down on enforcement in the name of law and order.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4799.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:11.866218

The Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) and the Office of the Governor told KING 5 they’ve cut off the federal government’s ability to search a state database filled with vehicle licensing information.

The move comes after the KING 5 Investigators provided proof that ICE has misused state data to arrest undocumented residents. In Washington that’s against the law. The Keep Washington Working Act prohibits this kind of collaboration between state departments and ICE. The 2019 law states the federal government may not use state data to arrest and deport undocumented residents.

“I'm very concerned because this is explicitly what the Department of Licensing said it wasn't doing. Now we see that it is,” said Angelina Godoy with UW’s Center for Human Rights.

On Monday, officials at DOL told KING 5 the reporters were wrong – that ICE was not using the state’s database for immigration enforcement.

“The Department of Licensing has determined (the state database) was not used in {this} case. As part of (our information system), we can audit all searches made within the system. We confirmed no search was made,” wrote a DOL spokesperson.

On Tuesday night, state leaders changed their position. Representatives from DOL and the Office of the Governor told KING 5 further investigation found ICE did run an undocumented resident's license plate to verify he was the registered owner. That confirmation led to the man’s arrest.

“The terms of the agreement are very clear, as are the penalties for not following them. Even one violation is enough. It’s that important,” said Nathan Olson, DOL communications director.

DOL said it immediately took action and terminated ICE’s account. Both DOL and Governor Bob Ferguson’s Office thanked KING 5 for bringing it to their attention. They plan to notify legislators and community advocates of this breach of trust.

“Any entity using DOL data about our residents in a way we have expressly stated not to is counter to our mission and needs to be dealt with immediately,” Olson said.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/79533852-cd20-45eb-ad11-8a83ae1d9e78/20250827T060427/79533852-cd20-45eb-ad11-8a83ae1d9e78_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:42.877637

Last week, a federal district court in Tennessee denied an application to enjoin certain eligibility rules by plaintiff Derrin Boyd, a men’s basketball student-athlete. Boyd attended a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) institution for several years and argued that the inclusion of NAIA time in the membership’s “five-year” rule violated the antitrust laws. Rejecting Boyd’s request, the court noted how the facts here differed from those in the Pavia case, which was decided by the same Tennessee federal court (and judge):

“The major differences are: (1) Boyd has exhausted both the four years of intercollegiate competition and the five-year period of eligibility, whereas Pavia had one year remaining on the eligibility clock; (2) Boyd challenges the ‘counting’ of his years of attendance and competition at Georgetown College, a four-year degree granting institution that is a member of the NAIA whereas Pavia challenged the ‘counting’ of his years of competition at New Mexico Military Academy, a two-year junior college from which he could not earn a four-year degree; (3) Boyd challenges the Bylaw allowing waiver of the time-limits to eligibility; Pavia did not challenge that Bylaw.” (at 11)

Also last week, a federal court in West Virginia granted several football student-athletes’ request for a preliminary injunction enjoining the application of the five-year rule to the plaintiff student-athletes who had previously attended junior college institutions.

The varying court decisions on eligibility rules add weight to calls for a legislative response. Relatedly, time flies, and it’s been over a month since President Trump’s Executive Order regarding college sports, which included a direction to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission that action be taken in connection with “Legal Protections for College Athletics from Lawsuits” within 60 days of the order. We’ll keep you posted.

Data privacy lawsuit targets SeatGeek

On August 22, a plaintiff initiated a class action lawsuit against SeatGeek, alleging that the popular ticket secondary market platform violated data privacy laws. In the complaint, the plaintiff argues that SeatGeek violated California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA)’s “trap and trace” provisions by installing trackers that provided user personal information to third parties without obtaining consent.

Abrego Garcia, who has become the face of Trump’s hardline immigration agenda, wants to seek asylum in the United States, his lawyers told a federal judge Wednesday.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Wednesday that his department is taking management of Union Station, the main transportation hub in Washington, away from Amtrak.

Duffy said ahead of an appearance with Amtrak President Roger Harris at Union Station for the launch of the NextGen Acela, the rail service’s new high-speed train, that the building a short walk from the U.S. Capitol had “fallen into disrepair” when it should be a “point of pride.”

Duffy’s words echoed Trump, who said last week that he wants $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington as part of his crackdown on the city.

As armed National Guard troops patrol the nation’s capital in an unprecedented federal takeover of Washington, D.C.’s police department, handling crime is now a relative strength for Trump, the poll found.

Americans are generally not happy about the Republican president’s handling of issues like immigration and the economy but are more positive about his tough-on-crime approach, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Indeed, the vast majority of Americans — 81% — see crime as a “major problem” in U.S. cities — a concern Trump seizes on with threats to expand National Guard deployments to cities across the country.

But the poll shows less public support for federal takeovers of local police departments, suggesting that opinions could shift, depending on how aggressively Trump pursues his threats.

The Danish Security and Intelligence Service responded to a request for comment by saying it believes that “particularly in the current situation, Greenland is a target for influence campaigns of various kinds” that could aim to create divisions in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland.

It said it “assesses that this could be done by exploiting existing or fabricated disagreements, for example in connection with well-known individual cases, or by promoting or amplifying certain viewpoints in Greenland regarding the Kingdom, the United States, or other countries with a particular interest in Greenland.”

The service, known by its Danish acronym PET, said that in recent years it has “continuously strengthened” its efforts and presence in Greenland in cooperation with authorities there, and will continue to do so.

“We are aware that foreign actors continue to show an interest in Greenland and its position in the Kingdom of Denmark,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a statement emailed Wednesday by his ministry. “It is therefore not surprising if we experience outside attempts to influence the future of the Kingdom in the time ahead.”

“Any attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the Kingdom will of course be unacceptable,” Løkke Rasmussen said. “In that light, I have asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to summon the U.S. chargé d’affaires for a meeting at the Ministry.”

Cooperation between the governments of Denmark and Greenland “is close and based on mutual trust,” he added.

This isn’t the first time Danish leaders summoned the top U.S. diplomat for an explanation about alleged spying in Greenland. They did it in May, after the Wall Street Journal reported that high-ranking officials under Trump’s intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard had directed intelligence agency heads to learn more about Greenland’s independence movement and sentiment about U.S. resource extraction there.

Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen spoke with The Associated Press the next day, saying “you cannot spy against an ally.” The embassy declined to comment on the summoning of Jennifer Hall Godfrey, acting head of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen.

Danish public broadcaster DR reported that government and security sources, which it didn’t name, believe that at least three Americans with connections to Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations in the territory.

One of those people allegedly compiled a list of U.S.-friendly Greenlanders, collected names of people opposed to Trump and got locals to point out cases that could be used to cast Denmark in a bad light in American media. Two others have tried to nurture contacts with politicians, businesspeople and locals, according to the report.

DR cited eight sources, who believe the goal is to weaken relations with Denmark from within Greenlandic society. DR said it had been unable to clarify whether the Americans were working on someone’s orders. The Associated Press could not independently confirm the report.

At 12:30 p.m. Eastern, the president is scheduled to have lunch with Vice President JD Vance at the White House.

That event, the only on his public schedule today, is closed to the press.

Some employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency who signed a public letter of dissent earlier this week were put on administrative leave Tuesday evening, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter sent to the FEMA Review Council and Congress on Monday critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs, and warning that FEMA’s capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished.

Minneapolis student detained by ICE, deemed flight risk

What we know:

Lucero was detained while driving a car with several others inside, his attorney, Evangeline Dhawan-Maloney, tells FOX 9.

She said he did not appear to be the target, but was likely detained because he is not a U.S. citizen.

An immigration court judge denied his bond on the grounds that he is a flight risk because he does not have any relatives in the country who are here legally.

The decision means he will remain in custody at the Sherburne County Jail until his next court appearance, which could be months away, she said.

The backstory:

Lucero immigrated to the United States from Ecuador in 2020 when he was 14, Dhawan-Maloney said. She noted that he had applied for asylum, which is pending, and has a work permit, both of which she said allow him to stay in the country.

He is a student at Augsburg University in Minneapolis, where he studies international business on a full scholarship.

""My friends and also family members have decided not to show up to their appointments because of being detained,"" said protestor Marbella Vasquez. ""Let it be known that we want ICE out of here—out of Lane County, out of Eugene, out of Oregon, everywhere.""

Just before 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, as protesters stood near the parking lot gates, a Department of Homeland Security vehicle began trying to exit to the street. Demonstrators initially refused to move.

A group of DHS officers then approached the crowd and told them to back up, before pushing some of them out of the way. KLCC captured that encounter on video.

Note: The video contains explicit language.

Less than an hour later, a law enforcement officer tried to exit the building in an unmarked car. Protestors demanded that person confirm whether there was anyone detained in the back seat, before letting the car proceed.

Rob Fisette, an organizer with the Lane County Immigrant Defense Network, said there's a back-and-forth between ICE and protestors, with each group adjusting their strategies week-after-week.

“When we're out here demonstrating, and we lose for the day, what that means generally, is that they take someone [into] the building and they kidnap them and they take them to Tacoma,"" said Fisette. ""And that's really visceral.""

Tacoma is home to a regional detention facility operated by ICE.

But Fisette said the the success of these protests is something that's harder to spot—the detainments that aren't happening.

Some of the current FEMA employees who used their names received emails on Tuesday night saying they had been placed on paid administrative leave ""effective immediately, and continuing until further notice,"" according to copies of the emails reviewed by CBS News.

""While on administrative leave, you will be in a non-duty status while continuing to receive pay and benefits,"" the letter read. The staffers were told not to visit FEMA facilities, access the department's telecommunication systems or carry out any of their official duties, aside from responding to inquiries from the Department of Homeland Security.

The agency also told staff that they must remain available to work during business hours.

The emails did not provide a reason for the decision. Staffers were told the move ""is not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive.""

In a statement, FEMA called the signatories ""the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency"" and accused them of having ""forgotten that their duty is to the American people not entrenched bureaucracy.""

""Our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems,"" FEMA continued. ""Under the leadership of Secretary Noem, FEMA will return to its mission of assisting Americans at their most vulnerable.""

The Washington Post was first to report on the suspensions.

The ""Katrina Declaration"" was published as the United States marks the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. The 2005 hurricane prompted major changes to the nation's disaster relief system — and Monday's letter argued many of those reforms could be reversed by the Trump administration.

The letter accuses President Trump of picking unqualified people to lead FEMA, and criticizes the administration for cutting the agency's workforce and terminating grants meant to help state and local governments harden their infrastructure to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.

The declaration said it hopes changes are made in time to ""prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.""

The Trump administration has pushed for sweeping changes to FEMA. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested either ""getting rid of FEMA"" or ""fundamentally reforming"" the agency by pushing some of its duties to state governments. So far this year, the agency has lost roughly one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and voluntary departures.

FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues responded to the letter Monday by defending the Trump administration's record of handling natural disasters and arguing FEMA was previously ""bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes.""

""The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,"" Llargues said. ""It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.""

The Census Bureau needs the next four years to get that done.” Lowenthal warned that there’s been “radio silence” from the Census Bureau since the Trump’s administration’s return regarding a test scheduled for 2026 that will, in part, evaluate mailing and messaging strategies.

Advocates who spoke during Tuesday’s briefing also expect that the Census Bureau will have more difficulties in getting the public to respond due to mistrust.","While President Donald Trump this month has suggested that he wants to have a mid-decade census that doesn’t include undocumented immigrants, census advocates are more concerned about the status of the government’s preparations for the decennial national population count in 2030.

“[Don’t] get distracted by these calls for a new census before the one that the law and the Constitution requires in 2030 because that proposal is neither feasible nor wise,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former Capitol Hill staffer and census expert, during a virtual briefing Tuesday that was hosted by the nonprofit the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “We need to keep our eyes on the nation’s prize and that’s a successful 2030 census that counts all communities equally well. The Census Bureau needs the next four years to get that done.”

Lowenthal warned that there’s been “radio silence” from the Census Bureau since the Trump’s administration’s return regarding a test scheduled for 2026 that will, in part, evaluate mailing and messaging strategies. She also said that community outreach and promotion for the test should have started this summer, but it’s unclear if the agency has done that due to a lack of public briefings and the elimination of its advisory committees.

“My census antennas are up, and I’m a bit worried about what we might see,” she said.

The experts also said how Congress resolves the Sept. 30 deadline to pass new government funding could impact 2030 Census planning. Steve Jost — a consultant for the Census Project, a network of organizations that rely on census data — cautioned that if lawmakers pass a long-term continuing resolution that funds agencies at their current levels, then that could hurt preparations.

“If it's a full-year CR, there are serious consequences to the planning for the 2030 operations,” he said. “We don't want to repeat what we had in the 2020 census when funding levels were delayed, frozen, CR-level flat lines, and that caused the Census Bureau to cancel their field tests and their dress rehearsals, which probably helped lead to some of those undercounts because the Census Bureau couldn't fully test its operations.”

The agency found that in 2020 it undercounted people who are Black, American Indian or Alaska Native living on a reservation, Hispanic or Latino or reported being another race.

Advocates who spoke during Tuesday’s briefing also expect that the Census Bureau will have more difficulties in getting the public to respond due to mistrust. Jost highlighted the Department of Government Efficiency’s access to and use of individuals’ government data as a possible source of distrust. Multiple speakers warned that ongoing attempts to ask about citizenship on the census, which Trump unsuccessfully tried to do during his first term, would lead to fewer people participating.

“Even though there was no citizenship question on the 2020 questionnaire, the debate around it raised significant doubts that we saw a significant decline in response rates among immigrant households and households with immigrant and mixed-status families,” said Arturo Vargas, who was the chair of the 2030 Census Advisory Committee before it was axed. “This contributed to a dramatic national undercount of the U.S. population. So continuing this conversation into 2030 will only solidify that wound in the Census Bureau's reputation and undermine its ability to be a credible agency to the public.”",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2025/08/26/082625_Getty_GovExec_Census/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 11:56:35.128464

Cullen and Wilkinson haven’t been the only GOP appointees to do so.","President Donald Trump’s second term has been marked by his administration’s attempts to bend or break the law and lashing out at judges who stand in the way. The administration’s remarks against judges led one of Trump’s own judicial appointees to speak out in a published opinion on Tuesday.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen noted that in recent months, executive officials and their spokespeople “have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘activists,’ ‘radical,’ ‘politically minded,’ ‘rogue,’ ‘unhinged,’ ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional,’ ‘[c]rooked,’ and worse.”

Cullen, whom Trump appointed to the federal bench in Virginia during his first term, acknowledged that there has always been “some tension” between the branches of government.

But he wrote that “this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.”

The rebuke came in a footnote to his opinion rejecting an unusual lawsuit from the administration, which it filed against federal judges in Maryland for issuing orders preventing immigration officials from immediately deporting people who file habeas corpus petitions challenging their confinement.

Cullen’s ruling comes amid the administration’s latest attempt to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom it illegally sent to El Salvador in March.

“Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,” Cullen wrote in dismissing the case, adding: “Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.”

Cullen’s ruling comes amid the administration’s latest attempt to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom it illegally sent to El Salvador in March and only returned him to the U.S. in June after resisting court orders to do so. His latest litigation is now playing out in Maryland.

Notably, Cullen cited the Abrego case in his ruling Tuesday. Specifically, he cited an opinion from April by appellate Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a Reagan appointee who has likewise called out the administration’s actions.

Cullen and Wilkinson haven’t been the only GOP appointees to do so. It’s unlikely they’ll be the last.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/25-826-ice-agent-ch-1117-b6bb08.jpg",N,,2025-08-27 13:02:57.111957

But the Trump administration, when faced with a standing immigration order it didn’t like, instead sued all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland, the court clerk and the court itself.
On June 25, the Justice Department announced that it filed a complaint against the Maryland District Court judges, arguing that they had exceeded their authority with the 48-hour freeze on deportations because it interefered with the administration’s exclusive right to enforce immigration law.
“This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision.
Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.","A federal judge Tuesday threw out what he called a “novel and potentially calamitous” attempt by the Trump administration to sue the entire federal court bench in Maryland over an order that put a two-day pause on deportations.

When a party disagrees with a court action, there is “a tried-and-true recourse,” wrote Judge Thomas Cullen of the Western District of Virginia — file an appeal. But the Trump administration, when faced with a standing immigration order it didn’t like, instead sued all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland, the court clerk and the court itself.

Given recent conflicts between the White House and the courts, “it’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely,” wrote Cullen, who was nominated by Trump in 2019. “Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”

But judges enjoy broad immunity for judicial acts, wrote Cullen in a 37-page ruling, adding that when co-equal branches of government are involved, “there is no right—express or implied — to litigate that grievance in this manner.”

“Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,” wrote Cullen, who was assigned the case because of the conflict of Maryland judges hearing it.

Abrego Garcia detained by ICE; judge orders delay of deportation to Uganda

The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Judge George L. Russell III, the chief judge of the Maryland district and the prime target of the administration’s lawsuit.

It was Russell’s order in May that sparked the lawsuit. Faced with a flood of habeas corpus petitions from immigrants facing deportation under the administration’s amped-up immigration enforcement, Russell ordered that deportations of those petitioning the court would be put on hold for at least two days, so that judges could schedule and review their cases.

On June 25, the Justice Department announced that it filed a complaint against the Maryland District Court judges, arguing that they had exceeded their authority with the 48-hour freeze on deportations because it interefered with the administration’s exclusive right to enforce immigration law.

“President Trump’s executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a written statement at the time. “The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.”

But Cullen agreed with the Maryland judges that the Trump administration chose the wrong avenue to raise its issues with Russell’s order.

“If these arguments were made in the proper forum, they might well get some traction,” Cullen said. “And under normal circumstances, it would not be surprising if the Executive raised these concerns through the channels Congress prescribed — that is, by challenging the orders as applied to a particular habeas proceeding through a direct appeal to the Fourth Circuit or, as expressly authorized by federal statute, by petitioning the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify local court rules.”

“All of this isn’t to say that the Executive is without any recourse; far from it,” Cullen wrote. “If the Executive truly believes that Defendants’ standing orders violate the law, it should avail itself of the tried-and-true recourse available to all federal litigants: It should appeal.”

Mark Graber, regents professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, believes that the case was more of a stunt than an earnest legal challenge from the Trump administration.

“Issuing an injunction against judges is a guaranteed loser,” he said. “What the Trump people were trying to accomplish may simply to have been noise and publicity … Whether they really thought they could ever win this case is doubtful — and if somebody thought that they should ever win that case, that person should be fired for incompetence.”

Graber said that allowing the case to move forward would have “fundamentally changed the way our judicial system works.”

“The implications would be startling,” he said. “This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision. That’s not the way the separation of powers works. There’s a judicial system; it has a way of correcting errors – it’s called appeals.”

Graber compared the case to being charged for a crime in Maryland and then asking a judge in another state to issue an injunction against the judge who handed down the sentence.

“This is Law 101 — it is Law 101 to the point where virtually all non-lawyers know this,” he said.

Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.

“What the Trump administration is claiming – and this is not a horrible legal argument – is that the court could only issue orders with respect to the people before the court,” Graber said.

“There’s a legitimate debate on this, and if they appealed it, who knows what the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court would have done?” he said. “The problem is they didn’t appeal it in the normal way.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-2048x1720.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:24.909841

Judge Dugan has been temporarily removed from the bench by the Wisconsin Supreme Court while the case against her moves forward.","A federal judge in Wisconsin rejected a state jurist’s claims of judicial immunity on Tuesday in a case that is testing the limits of the Trump administration’s ability to bar local officials from interfering with its deportation campaign.

The failed attempt to dismiss the case means that Judge Hannah C. Dugan of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court remains on track to stand trial on federal charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings.

Judge Lynn Adelman, who was appointed to the Federal District Court by President Bill Clinton and who is presiding over Judge Dugan’s case, said the state judge had not shown that she should be exempted from the prosecution because of her role.

“There is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered ‘part of a judge’s job,’” Judge Adelman wrote.

Judge Dugan was little-known outside Milwaukee until April, when federal immigration agents showed up outside her courtroom with plans to arrest a man from Mexico who was scheduled to appear before her on domestic abuse charges. That set off a series of events that made Judge Dugan a face of the national immigration debate. Some supporters warned that her arrest amounted to an attack on the judiciary; Justice Department officials said it showed that no one was above the law.

Judge Dugan’s lawyers said in a statement on Tuesday that they were disappointed by the ruling. They added: “We look forward to the trial which will show Judge Dugan did nothing wrong and simply treated this case like any other in front of her courtroom.”

Justice Department officials declined to comment on Tuesday. A hearing in Judge Dugan’s case is scheduled for next week.

When the federal agents arrived at the county courthouse, they told security officers about their plans to arrest the man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who is from Mexico, on an administrative warrant, according to an F.B.I. charging document. When Judge Dugan became aware of the federal agents, the charging document said, she became “visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor.”

According to the criminal complaint, the judge confronted the agents and told them to talk to the chief judge of the courthouse. She then returned to her courtroom and, according to the charging document, directed Mr. Flores-Ruiz through an alternate courtroom exit separate from the public door to the hallway where agents were waiting.

Mr. Flores-Ruiz made it outside the courthouse, the charging document said, where agents arrested him after chasing him on foot. Federal agents said that Mr. Flores-Ruiz was removed from the United States in 2013 and that there was no record of him seeking or receiving permission to return.

Days after Mr. Flores-Ruiz’s arrest, federal agents arrested Judge Dugan and top Justice Department officials weighed in on the case.

“It doesn’t matter what line of work you are in, if you break the law we will follow the facts and we will prosecute you,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

More than 150 former state and federal judges signed a letter to Ms. Bondi calling Judge Dugan’s arrest an attempt to intimidate the judiciary. And when the judge was in court pleading not guilty to the charges after being indicted by a grand jury, protesters gathered outside to urge prosecutors to drop the case.

Judge Dugan has been temporarily removed from the bench by the Wisconsin Supreme Court while the case against her moves forward.

Her arrest marked an escalation of the Trump administration’s warnings that local officials not impede federal efforts to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Since President Trump returned to office, the Justice Department has sued state and local governments that limit cooperation with immigration agents and has announced investigations of some elected Democrats over their immigration policies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/19/multimedia/00nat-wisconsin-motion-ruling-1-whtl/00nat-wisconsin-motion-ruling-1-whtl-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 09:56:19.465428

The prosecution of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan has highlighted the push by President Donald Trump' s administration to confront state and local authorities who resist his sweeping immigration crackdown.

Democrats have accused the administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to its deportation efforts.

She was arrested at the county courthouse in April and indicted on federal charges in May. She quickly filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and is therefore immune from prosecution.

However, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman on Tuesday rejected that argument and upheld the July recommendation of a magistrate judge who also ruled that the case could proceed.

Adelman said the dispute boils down to Dugan arguing that there is a general rule of immunity for judges from prosecution, with some limited exceptions, while the government argues that the cited exceptions are simply examples of types of prosecutions that have been brought.

""A review of the relevant history reveals the government has the better of the argument,"" Adelman wrote.

He said that ""the particulars of this case may be unusual,"" but ""there is no firmly established judicial immunity barring criminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts. There is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered 'part of a judge's job.'""

Attorneys for Dugan said in a statement that they were disappointed with the judge's decision, but ""we look forward to the trial which will show Judge Dugan did nothing wrong and simply treated this case like any other in front of her courtroom.""

Steve Caballero, spokesman for prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's Milwaukee office, had no comment on the ruling.

Adelman's decision could be appealed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He scheduled a hearing in the case for Sept. 3.

Dugan has pleaded not guilty to helping a man in the country illegally try to evade authorities. No trial date has been set. She faces up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine if convicted on both counts.

In a motion in May to dismiss the charges, Dugan argued that the federal government violated Wisconsin's sovereignty by disrupting a state courtroom and prosecuting a state judge.

Dugan also argued that the prosecution under federal law violated the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers because it overrides the state of Wisconsin's ability to administer its courts.

The judge rejected her arguments.

Dugan is charged with concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.

Agents arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase.

Milwaukee police last week released body camera footage of Dugan saying she didn't know Flores-Ruiz was in the country illegally. The comments were captured three days before her arrest after Dugan called police because of potentially threatening flyers she and family members had received.

The footage shows Dugan telling police that media reports had been swirling about how she supposedly ""hid"" Flores-Ruiz in her courtroom. She goes on to say she didn't know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally, and she denied giving him special treatment.

""It's all lies,"" Dugan told officers. She later said, ""I didn't do anything that they're saying.""

Dugan's case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250515-hannah-dugan-mb-1541-976426.jpg",N,,2025-08-27 04:56:59.783893

Upon his release in 1999, he worked his way up to a role as an inspector of record on hospital construction projects across San Diego – helping several others who attended Tuesday’s hearing to do the same.
The San Diego County District Attorney’s office did not oppose Dong’s 1989 plea being vacated, and on Tuesday, San Diego County Superior Court Judge Joan Weber reviewed the case and agreed.
We want to do something.” Klugman said with the conviction vacated, Dong can now petition the federal government to reopen his immigration case.","A judge on Tuesday vacated a decades-old conviction that was the basis for a San Diego man’s detention and looming deportation back to Vietnam, a country he has not returned to since he fled to the U.S. more than 40 years ago.

Chuong Dong’s friends and family – including his wife and children, who are all American citizens – filled the courtroom for the hearing, nearly two weeks after he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the annual check-in he’s been doing with the agency for more than 25 years. He’s been held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center ever since.

“When he was taken, I was honestly just heartbroken,” his daughter’s friend Alana Nguyen said. “His case deserves so much attention because he's brought so much love and everything to the community that's gone very unseen.”

Dong came to the U.S. at the age of 12 as a refugee in 1981. He was abused at home and dropped out of school, eventually stealing two speakers at age 19. He took a deal, pleading guilty to robbery, speaking little English and not knowing it could impact his immigration status decades later.

On a later, lesser conviction, Dong spent time in prison, where his family said he turned his life around. Upon his release in 1999, he worked his way up to a role as an inspector of record on hospital construction projects across San Diego – helping several others who attended Tuesday’s hearing to do the same.

“Our job is to make sure that in the event of any catastrophe, earthquakes or anything, that the hospital is still standing,” said Trung Vo, who said Dong helped him enter the same inspecting role.

“He became my mentor — now he's a brother,” Vo continued. “He puts everyone else first. Without him guiding me, supporting me, I wouldn't be where I am now.”

Under a California law passed in 2017, Dong filed a motion earlier this month to vacate his 1989 conviction, arguing he was never informed of the effect his guilty plea would have on his immigration status.

“If a criminal defendant is unaware of the true consequences of their plea, that's a due process violation,” his attorney Adam Klugman said. “That plea cannot stand. Our justice system is based on fairness. It's based on due process. It's based on knowingly accepting consequences.”

As Dong was awaiting the hearing on that motion, he went to his yearly check-in with ICE on Aug. 13 and was detained, taken to the Otay Mesa Detention Center, where he remains. His wife said one of her main concerns now is his health, because he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and has not been given his medication while in custody.

“I could see that he tried to hold his head up, because he doesn't want us to feel heartbroken,” his sister Sandy Huynh said about visiting him in detention, ""but I know deep down he's hurt because he's not with us.”

“Chung (sp) Dong is an illegal alien from Vietnam and a repeat felon who has racked up over five years in prison for various felonies to include robbery, multiple burglaries and grand theft,” ICE San Diego Field Director Patrick Divver said in a statement on Dong's detention, adding that the agency is “steadfast in its commitment to protecting the community by ensuring that dangerous criminals like Mr. Dong are removed.”

""I'm sure we all have our secrets,"" Vo said. ""All have skeletons in our closets. He's not that guy anymore. He’s a completely different man.""

""Whatever he did back then, he paid for his crime already,"" Huynh added.

The San Diego County District Attorney’s office did not oppose Dong’s 1989 plea being vacated, and on Tuesday, San Diego County Superior Court Judge Joan Weber reviewed the case and agreed.

“I did look over the transcript from the change of plea, and it appears that my retired colleague did not advise your client of the immigration consequences at all,” Weber said during the hearing.

“The defendant since this incident has been, at least by all accounts, a productive and upstanding and helpful member of society, so it would not be in the interest of justice to proceed with the case,” the deputy district attorney said in the hearing.

“He has not had any arrests or convictions since 1996,” Weber said in issuing her ruling. “The conviction we're now talking about is over 36 years old, and particularly when I see clearly that he was not properly advised at the time of the plea of the immigration consequences – this is an easy call.”

“He deserves that and he deserves more,” said Trinity Nguyen, another friend of Dong’s daughter. “He deserves to be out here with us right now. We don't know what to do. We've been grieving, but there's only so much grieving that we can do. We want to do something.”

Klugman said with the conviction vacated, Dong can now petition the federal government to reopen his immigration case.

“Justice prevailed today,” said Klugman. “Unfortunately, Mr. Dong's journey is not over. The next step now is to ask the federal government to reopen his case, do the right thing, cancel his deportation.”

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today released the following statement on the arrest of an individual who threatened U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in Dallas, Texas.

On Monday, August 25, 2025, the Federal Protective Service (FPS) reported a bomb threat against an ICE facility in Dallas. An unknown male subject, later identified as Bratton Dean Wilkinson, a 36-year-old U.S. citizen, arrived at the reporting entrance of the Dallas Field Office and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack at approximately 6:37 pm local time.

The subject showed the security officer what he claimed to be a “detonator” on his wrist. A shelter-in-place was issued for the facility. The officer called 911 and local police responded with a bomb squad.

“On Monday evening, law enforcement arrested a suspect who made bomb threats to a Dallas ICE facility. This incident comes just two weeks after a threatening letter with a white powdery substance was sent to an ICE office in New York City. Less than a week ago, a violent rioter was charged with assault in San Francisco after he threatened to stab an ICE officer and harm his family,” said a Senior DHS Official. “These incidents come after months of smears and rhetoric by activists, politicians, and the media comparing ICE law enforcement to the Nazi Gestapo, kidnappers, and the Secret Police. This shameful rhetoric has fueled a culture of hate against law enforcement resulting in a 1,000 percent increase in assaults against them. All sanctuary politicians, activists, and the media need to turn down their temperature.”

Wilkinson was taken into custody by local law enforcement and charged with making terroristic threats. At 7:19 pm local time, police issued an all-clear. The facility houses ICE’s Dallas Field Office as well as Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Every day, America’s brave ICE officers put their lives on the line to defend our homeland and keep Americans safe. Earlier this month, ICE responded to an emergency at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City involving a white powder which was found in ICE offices. Just days ago, DHS also arrested an individual in San Francisco who made repeated threats against law enforcement stating: “I’m going to fuck you up,” “I’m going to go after your family,” and “I’m going to stab you.”

Secretary Kristi Noem has been clear: Anyone who lays a hand on law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

The Missouri National Guard did not respond to a question on how many troops were requested by the administration.
Genevieve Sheriff Gary Stolzer, who oversees the detention center, did not respond to a request for comment on the possible use of the Missouri National Guard.
“To think that Kehoe thinks he needs the National Guard to come in and help, I don't know what he thinks they’re gonna do there,” said Sara Drost, Abide in Love-Ste.
Earlier this year, Kehoe declared a state of emergency and activated the state’s National Guard ahead of immigration protests in St. Louis that ended up being peaceful.","Gov. Mike Kehoe is weighing a request from the Trump administration to deploy the state’s National Guard to support federal immigration enforcement in Missouri.

If the request is approved, Guard members would help handle administrative and logistical tasks for Immigration and Customs Enforcement — not make arrests — according to Kehoe’s spokesperson Gabby Picard.

A spokesperson for the Department of Defense said assistance could include case management, transportation and clerical support for the in and out processing of detainees without legal status.

The Missouri National Guard did not respond to a question on how many troops were requested by the administration.

The request follows a July 25 order by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that brought members of military under the command of governors and authorized them to support immigration enforcement. That adjustment added 500 troops to help the immigration agency, bringing total Defense support to about 1,700 service members.

Picard said the extra support could affect 10 additional states, including Missouri. While federally funded, the Guard would remain under Kehoe’s authority.

“By providing these crucial services, DoD military personnel directly enable ICE to dedicate more trained agents to core law enforcement activities, significantly enhancing overall effectiveness,” said Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell in a statement. “The Department of Defense is committed to supporting the Department of Homeland Security in its mission to maintain the security of our borders and enforce immigration laws.”

National Guard troops could be stationed at detention centers such as the jails in Springfield and Ste. Genevieve, which house federal detainees. The Phelps County Jail recently announced it would no longer hold detainees for ICE beginning on Sept. 1.

Volunteers working to support ICE detainees at the Ste. Genevieve County Jail said they are opposed to the potential deployment, adding it would contribute to the national rhetoric that people detained by ICE are criminals.

“In our experience, we have not found that,” said Susie Johnson, Abide in Love-Ste. Genevieve’s treasurer. “These are people who have been going to their jobs, contributing to society.”

Ste. Genevieve Sheriff Gary Stolzer, who oversees the detention center, did not respond to a request for comment on the possible use of the Missouri National Guard.

“To think that Kehoe thinks he needs the National Guard to come in and help, I don't know what he thinks they’re gonna do there,” said Sara Drost, Abide in Love-Ste. Genevieve’s president. “They don't need help containing them. It seems like an absolutely ridiculous request.”

As of Friday, 20 states — all with Republican governors — were either complying with ICE’s request for troops or considering it, according to Stars and Stripes.

Earlier this year, Kehoe declared a state of emergency and activated the state’s National Guard ahead of immigration protests in St. Louis that ended up being peaceful. The Guard was ultimately not deployed.

""While other states may wait for chaos to ensue,"" the governor said at the time, ""the State of Missouri is taking a proactive approach in the event that assistance is needed to support local law enforcement in protecting our citizens and communities.""

The Guard deployment would mark the latest expansion of federal law enforcement’s presence in St. Louis.

Last week, U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Missouri, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced the FBI would be getting extra staffing to help fight violent crime in the region.

The deployment of the National Guard to help ICE across the U.S. is separate from President Donald Trump’s recent decision to send nearly 2,000 federal troops to address crime in Washington, D.C.

Cary Lopez Alvarado, who is a U.S. citizen, was detained June 8 when she told U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Border Patrol agents that they needed a warrant upon their arrival at a private property in Hawthorne, a federal tort claim filed Aug. 20 on her behalf says.

Alvarado’s boyfriend and her cousin worked at the residence, where Alvarado was waiting for them at the property’s gate after her boyfriend told her over the phone that immigration authorities were following their truck, according to the legal claim.

Once her boyfriend and cousin arrived, the claim says federal agents pulled in behind their truck and tried to open it as Alvarado told them they needed a warrant.

Then, according to the claim, she was violently restrained and held in custody for several hours.

“The agents manhandled Ms. Alvarado by grabbing and pulling Ms. Alvarado’s arms, twisting her arm on the truck, and pushing her body, including her pregnant belly, onto the truck,” attorneys with the Carrillo Law Firm wrote in the filing.

“Border Patrol or ICE agents then shackled Ms. Alvarado with a chain under her pregnant belly, hands, and legs,” the claim states.

Footage the attorneys shared with McClatchy News shows Alvarado, who is visibly pregnant, being detained against a white truck.

“I didn’t want them to hurt my stomach because I had my baby there,” Alvarado said during an Aug. 20 news conference, KCAL reported.

Alvarado is one of five U.S. citizens who filed claims on Aug. 20 against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE and Customs and Border Protection over their arrests by immigration authorities in Southern California. A sixth claim was also filed on behalf of a legal U.S. resident. The claims are all being represented by the Carillo Law Firm.

Attorney Michael Carrillo said during the news conference that his clients “were racially profiled by ICE and border patrol agents in various communities in the Southland,” KCAL reported.

Since their arrests, the charges against them have been dismissed, according to the outlet.

In response to McClatchy News’ request for comment, a DHS spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Aug. 26 that “what makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

The DHS spokesperson said “70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges.”

The spokesperson did not respond when McClatchy News asked why Alvarado was detained. In June, the agency told KTLA that she was arrested because she prevented agents from reaching “two Guatemalan illegal aliens” inside a car.

A DHS representative accused her of pushing an agent, according to KTLA.

In the claim, her attorneys argue that federal agents “had no evidence to charge Ms. Alvarado with a crime because she was not interfering with the arrests of others but was asking the agents to identify themselves and to provide a warrant.”

Alvarado is seeking $1 million in damages in connection with her arrest, which she says harmed her and her baby.

Her attorneys argue that DHS, ICE and CBP are liable for several federal violations, including false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, battery and racial profiling.

The other claimants represented by the Carillo Law Firm include U.S. citizens Angel Piña, Javier Ramirez, Andrea Velez and Juan Carlos Ramirez, as well as legal permanent resident Juan Rivas. They were arrested in June and July.

On Aug. 26, the firm announced it is representing another U.S. citizen, a 15-year-old boy with special needs who they said was wrongfully detained by ICE at Arleta High School in Los Angeles on Aug. 11. ICE agents are accused of holding the boy at gunpoint.

Man is jailed for days

ICE and Border Patrol agents did not have a warrant when they arrived at Javier Ramirez’s job at L.A. City Junk Cars in Montebello on June 12, racially profiled him, threw him to the ground and wrongly arrested him, according to his legal claim.

The claim says the agents, who were wearing masks, “immediately pointed at Mr. Ramirez and said ‘Get him, he’s Mexican.’”

Javier Ramirez told them he was a U.S. citizen who had a passport, but he was ultimately jailed for four days, from June 12 to June 16, on charges of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer.

Ramirez, a father of two, was born in San Bernandino, his family told KABC following his arrest. At the time, they expressed concern for his wellbeing, explaining he has diabetes and was taken into custody without his insulin.

The claim says his brother tried to give agents his medicine, but they “refused to take it.”

Like Alvarado, he is seeking $1 million in damages over his arrest and detainment, which left him with physical and emotional injuries.

The claims come after several lawmakers sent a letter to DHS on Aug. 8, demanding an investigation into reports of ICE detaining and deporting U.S. citizens, according to a news release from the office of Congressman Dan Goldman (NY-10).

“ICE policy makes clear that, (a)s a matter of law, ICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest and/or detain a U.S. citizen,” the letter said. “However, in recent high-profile cases, ICE has erroneously arrested U.S. citizens, at times appearing to use violent physical force.”",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/rje1an/picture311857974/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Screenshot%202025-08-26%20142830.png,N,,2025-08-26 22:57:22.811808

A U.S. District judge on Tuesday rejected Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan’s request to dismiss allegations that she helped an undocumented immigrant evade federal authorities earlier this year.

Dugan was arrested in April after allegedly helping Eduardo Flores-Ruiz avoid plainclothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who were trying to serve him a warrant.

Her attorneys argued she is entitled to judicial immunity for her official acts. They also said the federal government overstepped its authority by arresting and charging her.

The defense team also claimed the charges violate the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment and the principle of separation of powers.

FEDERAL CASE AGAINST MILWAUKEE JUDGE ACCUSED OF CONCEALING ILLEGAL MIGRANT SHOULD CONTINUE, JUDGE RECOMMENDS

Dugan’s attorneys further argued that Dugan can only be charged with conduct ""wholly unrelated"" to her judicial duties, such as taking bribes or violating constitutional rights, though she has not been accused of either in this case.

U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman ruled on the motion Tuesday.

""Ultimately, as the Supreme Court has stated, ‘the official seeking absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for the function in question,’"" Adelman wrote, adding that Dugan has not done so here. ""I cannot say as a matter of law that the defendant’s alleged conduct falls within even this more limited version of immunity.""

""There is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered ‘part of a judge’s job,’"" Adelman added.

Prosecutors allege that Dugan helped Flores-Ruiz and his attorney exit her courtroom through a back door on April 18, after learning that ICE agents were in the building to arrest him.

TRUMP ADMIN MAY NOT DEPORT MIGRANT TO CONGO DURING IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS, FEDERAL JUDGE RULES

A federal indictment alleges Dugan ""falsely"" told the agents they needed a judicial warrant and directed them to go to the chief judge’s office. Dugan then addressed the case off the record instead of holding the scheduled hearing. Flores-Ruiz faces three misdemeanor battery charges, and despite Dugan’s efforts, he was arrested.

Adelman has scheduled a hearing about Dugan’s motion for Sept. 3.

“We already are seeing very bad things happening in border communities in terms of abuse of authority,” said BNHR Executive Director Fernando Garcia. “The border summit at the end of the year will be to engage in this discussion of human rights, immigrants’ safety and this militaristic approach” to immigration enforcement.

In a Zoom call on Tuesday, Frontera Organizing Project coordinator Alan Lizarraga disclosed two cases illustrating the fear facing immigrant families on the border and how immigration enforcement is touching residents who aren’t undocumented migrants.

One case involved a resident driving home from work who was stopped by an unmarked pickup equipped with sirens. When an officer stepped down from the truck, the driver asked why he was being pulled over. The officer allegedly said, “You speak English?” turned around and left the scene.

Another documented case could be typical of the daily drama playing out at federal courthouses in border cities. A woman accompanied her husband to a routine immigration appointment only to see him taken into custody.

“I waited outside for him, and later he called me to let me know he was going to be detained,” the wife said in a statement shown by Lizarraga. “I asked if they had shown him a warrant; my husband handed the phone to one of the (agents) who said that under President Trump’s orders, he would have to continue his case in detention.”

Amid this environment, activists from the Rio Grande Valley, Laredo and West Texas are expected to join colleagues from El Paso and New Mexico to step up community organizing and know-your-rights education.

Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition Director Adriana Cadena said advocates also will be trying to dispel myths about immigrants leeching off public assistance. Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or food stamps, yet the administration shaved billions off both of those programs implying they’re being abused by non-citizens, according to Cadena.

The result will be that eligible children will have less access to nutrition and health care particularly on the border where poverty rates are high, she said.",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/08/AP25162645397286.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-26 20:56:29.435049

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, also criticized the administration’s attacks on the judiciary, highlighting in a footnote that White House officials in recent months had described judges as “rogue,” “unhinged” and “crooked,” among other epithets.

“Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,” he wrote.

The Trump administration filed a notice of appeal.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order by the chief judge of the Maryland district court that stopped the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals. The Justice Department said the automatic pause impeded the president’s authority to enforce immigration laws, and it sought a court order blocking it.

Cullen said allowing the suit to continue “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.”

“In their wisdom, the Constitution’s framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign,” Cullen wrote. “That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another’s authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary’s constitutional role.”

Unfavorable rulings for Trump

The lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed in June, was a remarkable legal maneuver, ratcheting up the Trump administration’s fight with the federal judiciary. The department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking Trump’s agenda, repeatedly accusing federal judges of improperly impeding his powers.

“The Maryland court’s order upholds a direct assault on the President’s ability to enforce the immigration laws,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Tuesday. “This will not be the final say on the matter, and the Trump Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”

Trump has railed against unfavorable judicial rulings and in one case called for the impeachment of a federal judge in Washington who ordered planeloads of deported immigrants to be turned around. In July, the Justice Department filed a misconduct complaint against that judge.

The Maryland judges, represented by prominent conservative lawyer Paul Clement, argued the administration’s lawsuit sought to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while it pursued a mass deportation agenda.

Among the judges named in the lawsuit was Paula Xinis, who found the Trump administration in March illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020, serves in the Western District of Virginia but was tapped to oversee the case because all 15 of Maryland’s federal judges were named as defendants along with the court clerk and the court itself, a highly unusual circumstance he noted in his ruling.

“In casting its wide net, the Executive ensnared an entire judicial body — a vital part of this coordinate branch of government — and its principal officers in novel and potentially calamitous litigation,” he wrote.

Cullen found the administration lacked the legal authority to bring the suit, but he said even if it could, the judges were immune. Instead of the “more confrontational” approach of a lawsuit, the administration should have appealed the chief judge’s order, he wrote, calling that the “tried-and-true recourse available to all federal litigants.”

“One branch’s alleged infringement on another’s exclusive power does not license a constitutional free-for-all,” he wrote.

What the Maryland judge’s order said

Signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III, the order at issue in this case prevents the Trump administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in Maryland district court. It blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after the filing of their habeas corpus petitions, which allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The order says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.”

In an amended order pausing deportations, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.”

Attorneys for the Trump administration accused the Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, writing in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Clement, who served as solicitor general under Republican President George W. Bush, denounced the suit during a hearing earlier this month.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” he said. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Federal Emergency Management Agency employees argue that sweeping funding cuts made by the Trump administration are affecting the agency's programs and missions as weather experts warn the next few months could see elevated hurricane activity.

Agency workers expressed their concerns in a letter to Congress on Monday ahead of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina on Aug. 29. The natural disaster which devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast resulted in Congress passing legislation that included the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act.

RELATED: Trump plans to phase out FEMA: Here's what it means for states

But FEMA contends in their letter, signed by more than 100 current and former workers, that efforts made by the Trump administration to shrink the agency and limit its resources may lead to another disaster similar to Hurricane Katrina.

FEMA’s ‘Katrina Declaration’

Why you should care:

The FEMA workers' letter, titled ""Katrina Declaration,"" accuses President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department supervises FEMA, of dissolving the agency’s response abilities and appointing unqualified leadership.

The group calls for FEMA to be protected from political interference and for its team to be guarded from politically motivated firings.

""Since January 2025, FEMA has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a FEMA Administrator. Decisions made by FEMA’s Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator (SOPDA) David Richardson, Former SOPDA Cameron Hamilton, and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem erode the capacity of FEMA and our State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) partners, hinder the swift execution of our mission, and dismiss experienced staff whose institutional knowledge and relationships are vital to ensure effective emergency management,"" the letter states.

FEMA’s letter also outlines Six Statements of Opposition from its employees which they hope to come in time to prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina but the division of FEMA itself.

In June, President Donald Trump said he wanted to ""phase out"" FEMA and shift the responsibility of emergency response to states.

What does FEMA do?

The backstory:

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, widely known as FEMA, was created in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter to help states manage disasters.

The agency’s mission was further defined by the Stafford Act of 1988, which ""provided clear direction for emergency management and established the current statutory framework for disaster response and recovery through presidential disaster declarations,"" according to FEMA's website.

In 2003, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush signed the Homeland Security Act establishing the Department of Homeland Security. FEMA falls under the umbrella of DHS.

Disaster response is already locally led and state-managed, but FEMA supports it by coordinating resources from federal agencies, providing direct assistance programs for households and moving money to states for repairing public infrastructure.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/08/1280/720/fema.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-08-26 20:56:18.905496

According to the Associated Press, some 200 people gathered, prayed and crowded around Abrego García as he reported to a scheduled visit at the ICE office, where he was detained. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him, the crowd yelled “Shame,” the AP reported.

Abrego García, a Salvadoran national, has lived in Maryland for 14 years and has been at the center of an immigration battle with the Trump administration since March when he was detained by ICE and mistakenly deported to El Salvador. According to reporting by National Public Radio, he was returned to the United States in April and was immediately detained by the U.S. government on charges of human smuggling. He was held in a Tennessee jail until he was released on Aug. 22 to await trial in Maryland, NPR said.

ABC reported that after Abrego García declined a government offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to the human smuggling charges, his attorneys said ICE informed them that he could be deported to Uganda and ordered him to report to their office in Baltimore on Aug. 25.

After he was detained on Aug. 25 in Baltimore, his attorneys filed a lawsuit to fight his deportation until a court could hear his request for protection. According to the AP, the lawsuit “triggered a blanket court order that automatically pauses deportation efforts for two days.”

He now is being held at an ICE detention facility in Virginia.

In an interview with Episcopal News Service, Schofield-Broadbent said she was invited to take part in the rally by the office of Washington Bishop Marianne Budde, noting that because of their geographic proximity, the two bishops speak often. Abrego García, his wife and their child have been living in Maryland’s Prince George’s County, which is part of the Diocese of Washington.

Before deciding to attend, the bishop thought about it, she said, to make sure her attendance wouldn’t be simply performative. She decided to take part because she wanted people to see “that there are ways of being Christian and following Jesus that don’t look like following blindly behind Christian nationalism.”

She added, “I want whoever is looking to see Christians standing up for mercy and justice and liberation.”

The Rev. Steve Holt, rector of the Church of the Guardian Angel in Remington, Maryland, also took part, she said.

Schofield-Broadbent, who wore her purple bishop’s shirt and pectoral cross, said she knew she was asked to stand near the podium because event organizers often put people “who look like they have some standing in the community front and center.”

She found herself next to Abrego García and his wife and across from Rabbi Ariana Katz, who had been asked to offer a final blessing. Katz asked Schofield-Broadbent if she spoke Spanish, which she does, so she was able to translate a portion of it into Abrego García’s native language.

Schofield-Broadbent said she also whispered her own blessing in his ear. “I know he’s a man of faith, so I thought maybe having a blessing from a clergyperson would be helpful.”

At the rally, Schofield-Broadbent joined clergy representing a variety of Christian denominations, as well as Jewish, Buddhist and Unitarian Universalist traditions, according to Religion News Service.

Taking part in the rally, she said, “felt like I was offering everything I had, and it was absolutely not enough to change the outcome” of Abrego García’s detention.

The Justice Department, which filed the suit in June, says the automatic pause violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president’s authority to enforce immigration laws.

Clement is a prominent conservative lawyer who served as solicitor general under Republican President George W. Bush. He listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges said the government was simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

What's Next USCIS said its policy manual, which guides all its work, would be updated accordingly to reflect the change.","The Trump administration is reported to be making another change to the way immigrants applying for United States citizenship are scrutinized, using a long-unused process.

A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memo first obtained by CBS News, and later confirmed by the department to Newsweek, showed that ""neighborhood checks"" would be brought back into use by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS).

""The Immigration and Nationality Act directs USCIS to conduct personal investigations and incorporating neighborhood investigations will help enhance these statutorily required investigations to ensure that we are meeting congressional intent,"" USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow, in a statement to Newsweek, in part.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump and his Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, have been making various changes to the immigration system since January, stating that these are necessary to ensure national security is maintained and illegal immigration is halted.

Immigration advocates have warned that some stricter measures put up unnecessary barriers to legal status for those who have been living within U.S. law for decades.

What To Know

The policy memo, dated August 22, 2025, outlines the return of neighborhood investigations for individuals applying for U.S. citizenship or naturalization. The step has essentially been unused since 1991.

In the memo, USCIS states that these checks are necessary to fully determine an immigrant's eligibility for citizenship, including where they have lived over the previous five years, their ""good moral character""—another recently emphasized part of the process—and adherence to the U.S. Constitution.

USCIS said it was using its authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to restart neighborhood checks for all immigrants applying for citizenship, unless a waiver is granted.

The memo said USCIS may request information from applicants, including testimonies from neighbors, employers, co-workers, and business associates who could back up their application. The agency said preemptively submitting such documentation as part of an application may help move the case along.

USCIS has also implemented other vetting policies in recent weeks, including checking for ""anti-Americanism"" when reviewing all immigration benefits and checking social media profiles.

What People Are Saying

USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow, in a statement to Newsweek: ""USCIS is working to ensure that only the most qualified applicants receive American citizenship. The Immigration and Nationality Act directs USCIS to conduct personal investigations and incorporating neighborhood investigations will help enhance these statutorily required investigations to ensure that we are meeting congressional intent.

""Americans should be comforted knowing that USCIS is taking seriously it's responsibility to ensure aliens are being properly vetted and are of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.""

The claim was filed with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In discussing the Arleta High incident, L.A. schools Supt.
The Arleta High incident renewed concerns because it happened on the campus perimeter.
School board member Kelly Gonez, who represents the Arleta High area, said the officers acted improperly.","Attorneys announced Tuesday that they have filed a $1-million damage claim against the Trump administration alleging that the recent arrest of a 15-year-old boy outside Arleta High School amounted to the “unconstitutional racial profiling” of a U.S. citizen.

The claim, filed on Monday according to paperwork provided by attorneys, cited “conduct of ICE agents and Border Patrol agents that caused the false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, [and] battery” of the boy on Aug. 11.

The Trump administration on Tuesday denied any wrongdoing, saying that the incident was one of mistaken identity.

According to school district officials, federal agents drew weapons on the boy, who is a student with a disability, and handcuffed him before his mother persuaded the agents that her son was not the individual they were looking for.

The student’s mother, Andreina Mejia, affirmed those details at a Tuesday news conference outside school district headquarters, just west of downtown L.A. While she waited in the car with her son, who attends San Fernando High School, a white truck drove up quickly — so quickly she thought it would hit her vehicle.

At least two masked men with guns approached — one on each side of the car. She said the officers pulled both of them from the car and separated them. Her son had difficulty removing his seat belt, but he did not resist as he was placed immediately in handcuffs.

“I looked at my son’s reaction, and I saw that he was scared,” Mejia said. “He didn’t know what was going on, so I just told him: ‘Don’t make any movement. Don’t move. Just follow instructions.’”

She remembers thinking: “He could be making a movement that he’s not supposed to make, and they could do something to him.”

Mejia said her son has difficulty processing language and expressing himself and receives special services. His disability put him at greater risk, she said, but he handled himself well, telling the officers that he is an American citizen, 15 years old and a student.

Mejia said she volunteered to retrieve identification for her son from their home, although this offer was not accepted. About seven minutes after the confrontation began, officers were persuaded they had detained the wrong person.

An officer then joked, to mother and son, that the boy would have an exciting experience to tell his friends about.

“There’s nothing exciting about getting guns pointed at you, especially when you’re a 15-year-old,” Mejia said.

According to the cover letter of the claim, signed by attorney Luis Carrillo, “the ICE agents and Border Patrol agents falsely claimed that [the student] was a suspect of a crime.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security denied racial profiling.

“Allegations that Border Patrol targeted Arleta High School are FALSE,” the department statement said. “Agents were conducting a targeted operation on [a] criminal illegal alien.”

“What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity,” the statement said. “America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists — truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities.”

Officials added: “This is a case study of billboard law firms trying to turn family resemblance into racial animus to collect clicks, clout, and cash.”

The department also praised the mother for being cooperative in an investigation that led to the arrest — later that same day — of the boy’s cousin, an unauthorized immigrant who, according to the department, had a 2021 misdemeanor conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.

On Tuesday, attorneys for the Mejia family said the Homeland Security account misrepresented the situation. They said the man ultimately arrested is not a member of the same family and is of a different nationality. They do not look alike, the attorneys said.

“There’s no resemblance, except for the brown color,” said Carrillo. “That’s why they were confused thinking that this — her boy — was the gang member when there was never a case.”

Attorney Michael Carrillo said that linking the family to the arrest of a gang member could potentially have put the family in danger.

A claim, such as the one filed in this case, provides a government entity the opportunity to assess and compensate alleged victims. If a claim is denied, parties have the option to pursue litigation. The claim was filed with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In discussing the Arleta High incident, L.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho talked, at a recent news conference, of what he learned from the family, from school administrators and from reviewing video.

“He was released, but the trauma in his mind has not been released,” Carvalho said. “I spoke with the mom. He cries. He is upset. He is depressed. He keeps asking if this is going to happen again.”

Federal officials have said no place is off limits — including schools — as they press to reach President Trump’s goal of 1 million deportations per year.

Immigration agents attempted to enter two Los Angeles elementary schools in April, but the principals turned them away. The Arleta High incident renewed concerns because it happened on the campus perimeter. Immigration agents also recently arrested — on Aug. 8 — an 18-year-old Reseda High senior as he was walking the family dog near their Van Nuys home.

Federal officials have defended the arrest — and ongoing detention — of the Reseda High student, Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, as appropriate because they say he is in the country illegally.

After the Arleta incident, the officials lauded the ultimate arrest of the targeted individual.

“Once again, our agents keeping streets and the American tax-payer safe from criminals and we will keep doing so until the mission is accomplished,” said U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino in a social media post.

“This illegal alien from El Salvador was arrested in Pacoima, CA.,” Bovino posted on social media about the boy’s purported cousin. “Not only was he illegally in the United States, but he also has a misdemeanor in 2021 for ‘carrying a concealed weapon on person.’ He is also suspected of being a member of the MS-13 street gang,” Bovina posted on social media.

Mejia’s attorneys called on President Trump to exempt schools and areas near them from immigration enforcement actions. They also called on the school district to release video footage of the incident. The district has declined requests from multiple parties, including The Times, citing privacy restrictions.

School board member Kelly Gonez, who represents the Arleta High area, said the officers acted improperly.

“Such actions — violently detaining a child just outside a public school — are absolutely reprehensible and should have no place in our country,” Gonez said in a social media post.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d150e08/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+329/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fcc%2Fa76734b34f009aaefe81ba2fc6db%2F1519674-me-arleta-high-student-01-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 18:56:53.456454

The targeting of delivery drivers appears to be widespread, however, and has led to a dramatic decline in the number of visible delivery drivers on the streets.
Across D.C., residents have posted videos of police swooping in to arrest delivery drivers.
ICE has zeroed in on delivery drivers, Lukens believes, because they are easy prey.
“It’s very clear ICE is targeting delivery drivers because they’re outdoors, which makes it easier to do warrantless arrests.","Angry residents of a Washington high-rise apartment building gathered as federal agents, backed by Metropolitan Police Department officers, swooped in to encircle a delivery driver last week.

The armed agents with tactical vests arrived first. They were joined by District police officers and a truck brimming with the sorts of mopeds and scooters used by delivery drivers. Soon, the driver’s moped — representing another livelihood of a person at the bottom of Silicon Valley’s pecking order — was added to the pile.

Residents pleading for the driver’s release were ignored. As the police van drove away, one resident shouted at the driver, “Fuck you!” The officer lowered his window and spat in the resident’s direction.

Scenes like this have become common in a city under siege by President Donald Trump’s administration, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, and a federalized police force. The delivery drivers are only the latest targets of Trump’s attempt to turn the city into a test run for deploying troops and federal agents to cities that oppose his administration.

The delivery drivers’ whizzing motorcycles, mopeds, and electric bicycles filled city streets just a few weeks before, but now advocates say they’ve become a top ICE target.

Hard numbers about the crackdown are hard to come by. In a statement, the police department linked the arrests of delivery drivers to an operation that dates back to last year — without acknowledging ICE’s new role. The targeting of delivery drivers appears to be widespread, however, and has led to a dramatic decline in the number of visible delivery drivers on the streets.

In stark contrast to Trump’s first term, when the major ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft both came out against the government’s Muslim ban, the big players in the food-delivery space have been quiet about the administration’s attack on their workforce.

Advocates for immigrants and low-wage workers said the companies owe it to their drivers to speak out.

“I would hope that every employer in the District is not only finding ways to protect their staff, but they are also speaking out and speaking to their elected folks about how unhappy they are,” said Michael Lukens, executive director of Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, which represents people facing deportation in the D.C. area. “Profit cannot be paramount over people.”

A “Lazy” Tactic

Lukens’s nonprofit has already seen an increase in newly arrested clients, including those who worked as delivery drivers before the federal takeover of D.C.’s police force began August 11.

Videos bear that out. Across D.C., residents have posted videos of police swooping in to arrest delivery drivers. In one scene captured by bystanders on video, a delivery driver emerging from a coffee shop was tackled to the ground and pummeled by masked ICE agents.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Metro police attempted to tie the recent videos of violent arrests involving ICE to a monthslong operation.

“In response to community complaints about unsafe scooter driving behavior, the Metropolitan Police Department began conducting scooter enforcement in 2024,” the department said. “Since Operation Ride Right started, we have impounded approximately 1,249 scooters, made 139 arrests, and issued 1,258 Notice of Infractions.”

The operation predated the Trump administration and what the statement left out was ICE’s new, heavy-handed role. The agency has specifically been partnering with the city’s police officers to check drivers’ immigration status, the Washington Post reported last week.

ICE has zeroed in on delivery drivers, Lukens believes, because they are easy prey.

“It’s very clear ICE is targeting delivery drivers because they’re outdoors, which makes it easier to do warrantless arrests. It’s a population that ICE is aware is very immigrant-heavy. And frankly, it’s easy for ICE to go after them,” Lukens said. “It is, to me, a very lazy way for ICE to operate.”

In Washington, many delivery drivers are recently arrived Venezuelan immigrants, putting them even more in harm’s way because ICE is fast-tracking deportations for people who have not been in the U.S. for long.

“Given the government’s racial profiling, and profiling of people from Venezuela and Central America as potential gang members,” Lukens said, “that is also problematic.”

The Sound of Silence

The street corners where drivers once gathered to await new orders have emptied out since the joint police–ICE crackdown began.

As authorities round up their work force, the big players in the world of Silicon Valley-developed delivery apps have largely remained silent. Three of the biggest — Uber, Grubhub, and DoorDash — did not respond to requests for comment.

That silence disappointed but did not surprise Katie Wells, the co-author of a book about the rise of Uber.

The app companies have long relied on exploiting low-wage workers, Wells said. A core premise of the apps’ business models is that their workers are independent contractors, not direct employees. Even before the crackdown, delivery drivers faced the physical risk of accidents on the road and the economic risk of account deactivations with little support from the companies.

“The violence, the stress of getting there on time, and the indignities of being deactivated without a single human to call for help — it makes the jobs very difficult,” said Wells, who is the director of research at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank that opposes excessive corporate power.

Organizing efforts have made slow progress given the fragmented nature of the workforce, with the exception of groups such as Los Deliveristas Unidos in New York City. The app companies have deployed armies of lobbyists to fight back against attempts to regulate the industry through minimum pay guarantees or pay transparency rules.

In many cases, immigrant delivery drivers rent time on the apps from people who are legally authorized to work in the U.S., according to Sergio Avedian, a rideshare driver, industry consultant, and senior contributor at the Rideshare Guy.

The people whose names are on the account sometimes fail to turn over the agreed-upon split of the earnings to the drivers, according to Avedian.

For years, the app industry has relied on undocumented workers to meet the demand for its always-on, nearly-instant delivery services, Avedian said. But it has made few efforts to ensure that they are being treated well.

“Capital doesn’t care about fairness,” Avedian said. “But as far as these immigrants, my heart goes out to them. They get screwed every possible way.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229749394-e1756148994723.jpg?fit=5000%2C2500&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-26 20:56:43.135475

(AP) — A Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade arrest by U.S. immigration agents lost an attempt Tuesday to throw out the Trump administration’s case against her.

The prosecution of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan has highlighted the push by President Donald Trump’ s administration to confront state and local authorities who resist his sweeping immigration crackdown.

Democrats have accused the administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to its deportation efforts.

She was arrested at the county courthouse in April and indicted on federal charges in May. She quickly filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and is therefore immune from prosecution.

However, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman on Tuesday rejected that argument and upheld the July recommendation of a magistrate judge who also ruled that the case could proceed.

Adelman said the dispute boils down to Dugan arguing that there is a general rule of immunity for judges from prosecution, with some limited exceptions, while the government argues that the cited exceptions are simply examples of types of prosecutions that have been brought.

“A review of the relevant history reveals the government has the better of the argument,” Adelman wrote.

He said that “the particulars of this case may be unusual,” but “there is no firmly established judicial immunity barring criminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts. There is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered ‘part of a judge’s job.’”

Attorneys for Dugan said in a statement that they were disappointed with the judge’s decision, but “we look forward to the trial which will show Judge Dugan did nothing wrong and simply treated this case like any other in front of her courtroom.”

Steve Caballero, spokesman for prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s Milwaukee, had no comment on the ruling.

Adelman’s decision could be appealed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He scheduled a hearing in the case for Sept. 3.

Dugan has pleaded not guilty to helping a man in the country illegally try to evade authorities. No trial date has been set. She faces up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine if convicted on both counts.

In a motion in May to dismiss the charges, Dugan argued that the federal government violated Wisconsin’s sovereignty by disrupting a state courtroom and prosecuting a state judge.

Dugan also argued that the prosecution under federal law violated the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers because it overrides the state of Wisconsin’s ability to administer its courts.

The judge rejected her arguments.

Dugan is charged with concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.

Agents arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase.

Milwaukee police last week released body camera footage of Dugan saying she didn’t know Flores-Ruiz was in the country illegally. The comments were captured three days before her arrest after Dugan called police because of potentially threatening flyers she and family members had received.

The footage shows Dugan telling police that media reports had been swirling about how she supposedly “hid” Flores-Ruiz in her courtroom. She goes on to say she didn’t know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally, and she denied giving him special treatment.

“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers. She later said, “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

Dugan’s case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.

The Trump administration has unleashed a relentless, coordinated assault on immigrants – tearing families apart through mass deportations, jailing people in inhumane detention centers, and sending armed ICE agents into our schools, churches, and neighborhoods.

Now, they’re seeking to justify and cover up their harmful abuses with misinformation and lies — and it’s up to us to expose the truth.

See if you can dispel fact from fiction… because it’s up to each of us to know exactly what’s really happening.

Email Address

President Trump’s policies have resolved the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Fact

Fiction

Pure fiction! The situation at the U.S.-Mexico border has become an even bigger human rights disaster. While the Trump administration is communicating as if the border has been “handled,” this is far from the truth. Right now, approximately one-third of the entire U.S. southern border is a militarized zone. With the border closed, people are being deported or held in crowded detention centers.

The right to seek asylum in the U.S. no longer exists – meaning that people seeking safety are trapped with nowhere to go, or must return to the danger they fled.

Mass deportations are benefiting the U.S. economy.

Fact

Fiction

Fiction. Mass deportations are incredibly costly, and now funds and resources are being further expended to build horrific detention centers like “Alligator Alcataraz” and use military flights for deportations. The Trump administration’s cruel mass detention and deportation machine is now being supercharged with the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — which gives a $150 billion blank check to ICE and CBP.

Amnesty is doing research on the socioeconomic consequences of Trump’s new budget that will take away Medicaid and food assistance to pay for more cruel deportations.

The U.S. is able to bring back people who have been deported or expelled.

Fact

Fiction

This is a fact, despite what the administration has led us to believe! The Trump administration illegally expelled hundreds of men to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act — sending them to CECOT, a notoriously dangerous mega-prison with inhumane conditions. Many of these men had pending asylum cases in U.S. immigration court, and some had even been granted protection. We’ve learned that these men are still technically under the custody of the U.S. — and this administration has the power to bring them back. That’s why Amnesty continues to advocate in and out of Congress to urge the U.S. to bring back everyone who has been disappeared to CECOT, and it’s why we need your continued activism.

Watch this video before answering the below question.

ICE agents have the authority to enter private spaces without a warrant.

Fact

Fiction

Fiction – although it’s happening anyway, and in many instances, illegally. The Trump administration has emboldened domestic law enforcement agencies to participate in immigration enforcement, from local police to federal agencies like the FBI and DEA. Still, none of these agencies can legally enter private spaces without a warrant signed by a judge. Even as officers drive through immigrant communities in unmarked cars and raid schools and workplaces wearing masks, people still have rights.

There are “millions” of undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

Fact

Fiction

This is a fiction that President Trump has been repeating over and over to justify his mass deportation machine. Studies show that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. citizens. The Trump administration’s inflammatory and racist rhetoric is meant to dehumanize and criminalize our immigrant neighbors, friends, family members, and coworkers. It’s so important for our human rights movement to voice our opposition, defend everyone’s rights, and build true safety and power for our communities.

Sean’s nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself.” A spokesperson for New Mexico Gov.","California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.

An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing states' enforcement before the crash.

Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency, and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash should not have been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. The crash has become increasingly political, with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the administration's immigration concerns in interviews.

But Duffy said it is a safety issue — not a political one — because truckers need to be able to tell law enforcement what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.

“We all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs — semis — can understand the road signs, that they’ve been well trained,” Duffy said.

The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.

Duffy cited similar statistics for the other states, with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. He said New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.

Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don’t comply with the rules within 30 days — $33 million for California, $10.5 million for Washington and $7 million for New Mexico.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office said on the social platform X that the Trump administration is just trying to deflect responsibility for the crash.

“This is rich,” it said. “The Trump Administration approved the federal work permit for the man who killed 3 people — and now they’re scrambling to shift blame after getting caught. Sean’s nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself.”

A spokesperson for New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the state's process for issuing commercial licenses includes a mandatory English component to ensure divers can read and understand traffic signals.

“We are aware of recent claims regarding the enforcement of these regulations and are actively seeking more information,” Michael Coleman said via email. “Initial reports suggest that these claims relate to a small number of roadside incidents over a three-month period.”

Washington’s governor declined to comment until after officials review Duffy’s letter.

Three people died when truck driver Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on a highway about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach and a minivan slammed into his trailer, according to Florida's Highway Patrol. Singh and his passenger were not injured.

He is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.

Diamond R. Litty, the elected public defender in St. Lucie County, said her office was provisionally assigned to Singh’s case during his initial appearance Saturday morning.

Litty said her office will focus on the criminal charges against Singh, but it will also work with an immigration attorney to determine how his status affects the case. After more than three decades at her position, Litty said she cannot recall a case that garnered more attention.

“Unfortunately, Mr. Singh has been caught in the crosshairs of politics,” Litty said.

The head of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association trade group, which represents small-business truck drivers, praised Duffy's announcement.

“Basic English skills are critical for safely operating a commercial motor vehicle — reading road signs, following emergency instructions, and communicating with law enforcement,” said Todd Spencer, the group’s president.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Singh, a native of India, was in the country illegally. So Duffy said he should not have been granted a commercial driver's license by Washington and California. He said New Mexico should have pulled Singh off the road for not speaking English after he was pulled over in July because he later failed a test given by DOT investigators after the Florida crash.

But the governor's office in New Mexico said a body-camera video of the police stop of Singh makes it clear that he understands English.

Released Tuesday, the video shows Singh speaking in broken English during the highway-side stop and commercial vehicle inspection by a New Mexico State Police officer. Singh responds to a series of instructions during the inspection, and asks how long the citation will be linked to his license.

“This my ticket and on my license ... how many year?” Singh says.

The officer issues Singh a reduced speeding citation for driving 10 mph (17 kph) above the speed limit in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone, noting Singh's explanation that he was already trying to slow down.

“We believe that a full review of the incidents in question will demonstrate that New Mexico is in full compliance with federal law and that New Mexico State Police are effectively enforcing safety regulations on our roadways,” Coleman said.

Currently, 19 states and the District of Columbia issue licenses regardless of immigration status. Supporters say that lets people work, visit doctors and travel safely.

Newsom's office said California followed all the rules when it issued a license for Singh in July 2024, while the federal government confirmed at that time that he was in the country legally. Newsom has also said Singh obtained a work permit during Trump's first term, which Homeland Security officials disputed. Newsom said the permit was renewed in April and federal officials have not addressed that.

Florida authorities have said Singh entered illegally from Mexico in 2018. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that Singh should have never received the license.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois says it would fight back in court if President Trump sends the National Guard into Chicago.

Trump has suggested he would send troops there to combat violent crime.

ACLU of Illinois spokesperson Ed Yohnka told IPM News Monday that if that happens, the organization would be closely watching the behavior of those troops.

“Who is it that they’re targeting? How are they doing it, and how are they behaving, Yohnka asked. “Are they using excessive force? Are they using racial profiling?”

He also said the ACLU would also sue on behalf of detained individuals to get them released.

The ACLU has been communicating with groups that serve immigrant and homeless people, who are particularly afraid after seeing videos of the National Guard’s activity in Washington DC, according to Yohnka.

Earlier Monday, President Trump hedged on the idea of sending troops to Chicago, saying he’d prefer to be invited by local officials. Both Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson say they have not requested federal troops.

Yohnka encouraged those feeling overwhelmed by federal policy changes to focus on local action such as speaking up at local meetings to joining library or school boards.

“I know it’s hard to keep up with all that’s happening at the federal level,” he added. “We’ve been encouraging folks to act as much as they can at the local level.”

ACLU fighting immigrant kid exclusion for Head Start

The ACLU of Illinois is involved in a lawsuit to keep Head Start open to all low-income children.

Head Start began 60 years ago as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty” to help children break the cycle of poverty with health screening, social services and education.

When a Republican Congress and then President Bill Clinton were reshaping welfare law in the 1990’s, the early education program was excluded from the changes. New provisions in the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act barred certain immigrants, including those without legal status and those who have applied but not received asylum from signing up for public benefits.

The Trump administration is now reinterpreting the law to apply to Head Start and other education programs.

“I’m thinking that if that’s what Newt Gingrich and the Republicans of the 1990’s meant, they would have said it, and I think he would have heard it again,” Yohnka said. “But apparently, Donald Trump and RFK Jr. are the people who’ve suddenly discovered this.”

The administration says the change would help protect the country’s resources. The rule is on hold until September 3, due to another lawsuit.",https://ipmnewsroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041625_KellyTownHall8_M.Piacente-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 17:56:48.791988

DACA Recipients Fear Losing Health Care Access, Annual Report Shows

One-third of respondents reported worsening health related to concerns about their immigration status

WASHINGTON – A report published today by the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) shows that an overwhelming majority of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients fear losing future access to health care services and many are experiencing worsening health due to concerns about their immigration status.

Concerns about access to health care likely stem from uncertainty around DACA’s future, as well as the Trump administration’s ending of the Biden-era policy allowing DACA recipients to purchase health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). A new Trump administration rule ending the Biden policy – which was a hard fought victory after years of advocacy – went into effect this week.

“All of us should be able to access affordable and reliable health care. Full stop,” said Isobel Mohyeddin, policy associate at the National Immigration Law Center. “After years of data showing DACA recipients are disproportionately uninsured, this year’s report shows that the uncertainty around DACA and narrowing options for recipients to access care have reverberating effects on both their physical and mental health. We demand the Trump administration to reverse its cruel and unnecessary ACA eligibility rule, and Congress must work to repeal health care restrictions for immigrants.”

This is the fourth annual report by NILC tracking DACA recipients’ access to health care. The report analyzes findings from a 2024 survey of 433 DACA recipients administered by Prof. Tom K. Wong of the University of California, San Diego; United We Dream; the National Immigration Law Center; and the Center for American Progress. Top line findings include:

92% of respondents say that without DACA, it will be harder to access services to keep themselves and their families healthy

1/3 of respondents experienced worsened mental or physical health related to concerns over their immigration status

43% of respondents skipped a recommended medical test or treatment because of the cost, while 45% reported skipping a recommended dental test or treatment for the same reason

28% of respondents reported taking on debt to cover the costs of a medical procedure

NILC formally opposed the Trump administration’s rule ending DACA recipients’ access to ACA coverage and urges the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reverse it. NILC also calls on Congress to repeal health care restrictions for immigrants passed in the latest federal budget bill and has long called for Congress to pass the Dream and Promise Act, which would provide the certainty and stability that DACA recipients need to truly achieve healthy lives.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old originally from El Salvador, handed himself into the ICE field office in Baltimore, Maryland, for a check-in on Monday.

The visit was a mandatory condition of his release from federal custody earlier this weekend. However, in a court filing on Saturday, his lawyers said they expected Garcia would be detained again upon attending.

Garcia is charged in an indictment, filed in federal court in Tennessee, with conspiring to transport illegal immigrants into the US.

According to a court filing by his lawyers, immigration officials made an offer to Garcia to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to the charges.

Otherwise, they would seek to deport him to Uganda.

Speaking at a news conference outside the ICE office on Monday morning, Garcia said via a translator: ""This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us.

""God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.""

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Garcia's lawyers, also said: ""There was no need to take him into ICE detention... the only reason they took him into detention was to punish him.""

A judge later ruled Garcia could not be deported after he filed a challenge asking to be allowed due process to fight any removal attempt.

Judge Paula Xinis ruled the 30-year-old must remain detained in the US until she can hold an evidentiary hearing - set for Wednesday.

She added there appeared to be ""several grounds"" for her to have jurisdiction to exercise relief, including that Uganda has not agreed to offer Garcia protections, such as being able to walk freely, being given refugee status, and not being re-deported to El Salvador.

After initially being detained in Maryland - where he lived with his American wife and children - by ICE in March, Garcia was sent to El Salvador, where he was then imprisoned in the country's maximum security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).

This was despite an immigration judge's 2019 order granting him protection from deportation after finding he was likely to be persecuted by local gangs if he was returned to his native country.

The Trump administration admitted deporting Garcia was an ""administrative error"", but said at the time they could not bring him back as they do not have jurisdiction over El Salvador.

After eventually returning him to the US in June, the Trump administration detained Garcia on criminal charges that were filed in May.

The criminal indictment alleges Garcia worked with at least five co-conspirators to bring immigrants to the US illegally and transport them from the border to other destinations in the country.

Minutes after his release on Friday, officials notified Garcia they intended to deport him to Uganda.

Gavin Newsom's office over immigration.

Harjinder Singh made the illegal turn last Tuesday from northbound lanes of Florida's Turnpike about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A minivan was unable to avoid the truck's trailer, which was blocking the northbound lanes.

Two passengers in the minivan died at the scene and the driver died at a hospital. Singh and a passenger in his truck were not injured.

Much of Singh's immigration history was not immediately clear Monday, including his country of citizenship and whether and when he obtained legal status. Florida authorities said he entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018.

Homeland Security said Singh obtained a commercial driver's license in California, which is one of 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, that issue licenses regardless of immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Supporters of such policies say driver's licenses provide a lifeline for people to work, pick up children from school, visit doctors and travel safely.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for Homeland Security, said issuing a commercial license to someone in the country illegally is ""asinine.""

Newsom's press office, which has been in a heated online war of words over congressional redistricting, responded on the X platform that Singh obtained a work permit while Donald Trump was president. McLaughlin disputed that, saying the government denied him a permit during Trump's first term in September 2020 and granted him one in June 2021, under President Joe Biden.

Singh is charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations. The federal government has asked that he be transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody after his criminal case is complete.

The truck was attempted a U-turn in an area marked for ""official use only,"" the highway patrol said. Video of the crash was obtained by Breaking911.

Would you also consider sending the National Guard into red states and red cities that are also seeing high crime?""","LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- As President Donald Trump threatens to deploy National Guard troops to cities like Chicago and Baltimore, Eyewitness News is learning more about the U.S. Border Patrol's possible plans to expand operations in Los Angeles.

Border Patrol El Centro Sector's Chief Gregory Bovino spoke with KMEX-TV about the current operations in Southern California, saying there are more than 40 law enforcement teams - like Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement - spread across L.A.

He said there could be more agents on the way.

""I would see more Border Patrol agents coming here into Los Angeles pretty quickly, like within the next week,"" said Bovino, who stressed the agency's main objective has always been ""safer communities"" and ""a safer America.""

""As we look at immigration laws, and immigration law violators here in L.A., one of the things that we note is as we target individuals in areas ... that targeting is something that we rely on to get into those areas to be where we're at in L.A.,"" said Bovino. ""Whether it's Compton or Brentwood or Hollywood or downtown Los Angeles or at a big box store. Those targets are definite, and we know oftentimes who we're going after, why we're going after them, and what their criminal history is. There may be other individuals associated or nearby, and if we run into contacts with an illegal alien, they're going to be arrested because that is the law.""

Human rights groups and immigration advocates continue to raise concerns over tactics used by federal agents during its operations.

During Monday's interview, Bovino discussed agents not wearing uniforms during operations and the use of face masks.

""We have a multitude of law enforcement missions to carry out,"" he said. ""Our functions here in Los Angeles and nationwide, whether it's on the border or here in Los Angeles, you see that exact same thing.""

""It would be awfully difficult for me to waltz in a parking lot of a big box store, or some location that we're interested in, to conduct surveillance and trying to find someone who's illegal or a criminal or a target that we're looking for if we're in full uniform,"" he added. ""So like any police agency, or any type of a law enforcement function nationwide, it's the same thing with us. We will deploy individuals the way we need to to affect the mission.""

Trump defends crime crackdown: 'I'm not a dictator'

Meantime, Trump, at his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, touted his record on crime amid his federal takeover of Washington and threats to do the same in other major cities.

""The line is that I'm a dictator, but I stop crime. So a lot of people say, 'You know, if that's the case, I'd rather have a dictator,'"" he said. ""But I'm not a dictator. I just know how to stop crime.""

Trump said the same on Monday, as he discussed how he would prefer local officials to request his help as he discussed the possibility of ordering the National Guard to Chicago.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, in a press conference on Monday responding to Trump's threat, said that the president and the White House are trying to terrorize Democratic-run cities and states through the threat of unwarranted crackdowns.

""This is not about fighting crime. This is about Donald Trump searching for any justification to deploy the military in a blue city, in a blue state, to try and intimidate his political rivals,"" Pritzker said, flanked by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and a wide array of Chicago and Illinois elected officials and residents.

Trump on whether he'd send the National Guard to red states: 'Sure'

ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott pressed Trump on whether he would send troops to Republican-led states.

""Mr. President, on the National Guard, you've talked a lot about Democratic-run cities and states. Would you also consider sending the National Guard into red states and red cities that are also seeing high crime?"" Scott asked.

""Sure,"" Trump responded. ""But there aren't that many of them.""

“To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote.
“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Cullen wrote.

Judicial Immunity Cullen found the administration lacked standing to bring the suit, saying that Supreme Court case law prevented him from issuing an injunction against a judge.","A federal judge has dismissed the Justice Department’s lawsuit against the US district judges of Maryland over a standing order that blocked the immediate deportation of some detained persons.

US District Judge Thomas Cullen, who President Donald Trump appointed during his first term, said Tuesday past rulings lead to the conclusion that he has no choice but to dismiss the case.

“To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote.

He also said the lawsuit is “not ordinary” and that the executive branch must find other paths to raise its concerns with the standing order. He said the courts and the executive branch are each part of the sovereign US government.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches—and the public officials who serve in them—share the same core sovereign interest: To support and defend the Constitution.”

A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t immediately return a request for comment. The department filed a notice of appeal.

Deportation Fights

The Trump administration filed the suit in June against the court over a standing order that blocked for two business days the deportations of detained persons who filed habeas petitions.

The order was issued amid the administration’s crackdown on immigration enforcement, and a Maryland US district judge’s handling of a lawsuit from a wrongly deported Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

The administration initially said it couldn’t return Garcia after he was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite an earlier immigration court ruling against his removal. But he was brought back to the United States to face federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee, which he’s pleaded not guilty to. Abrego Garcia was again taken into custody by immigration officials on Monday, and is seeking to block any deportation.

Cullen said he can “appreciate” the administration’s concern that the Maryland court “encroached on its duty to police core matters of immigration.”

But he said a dispute between the judiciary should be “resolved within the constitutional structure and with due respect for the Judiciary’s co-equal standing with the executive branch,” and that he has to first ensure he has the constitutional authority to preside over the lawsuit. “In so doing, the court’s allegiance is to the Constitution,” Cullen wrote.

Judicial Immunity

Cullen found the administration lacked standing to bring the suit, saying that Supreme Court case law prevented him from issuing an injunction against a judge.

He also said the district court has sovereign immunity from the case, and that the individual judges and court officials named in the litigation have judicial immunity because it was tied to an act done in their “judicial function.”

Cullen further found there was no cause of action that allowed him to hear the lawsuit between the two branches, “and this court will not be the first to create one.”

He said the administration could’ve challenged the standing order at the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, or by petitioning the Fourth Circuit’s Judicial Council.

“The Executive acknowledges these routes are available, but it claims it chose an interbranch lawsuit because those routes are inconvenient,” Cullen wrote. “This purported inconvenience does not warrant the judicial branch’s infringement on the legislative branch’s prerogative of deciding the scope of cases federal courts may review.”

‘Not Normal Times’

The unprecedented litigation came as the administration has assailed judges who’ve ruled against its policies, with Trump even calling for impeachment and some House Republican allies filing articles of impeachment against some jurists. Chief Justice John Roberts and other top federal judges have pushed back against the use of impeachment as a response to unfavorable court rulings.

Cullen referenced the harsh rhetoric in his opinion, saying the “concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.”

He said that typically, the administration could’ve raised its challenged under other options laid out by Congress.

“But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times—at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,” Cullen wrote, referring to the courts. “It’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/0e9cbce/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F3a%2Fd4feebac4c4bb995f95b5fb23ec3%2Fjustice-sarah-silbiger.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 18:57:02.476889

In response to the letter, FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues said the Department of Homeland Security is ""committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people.""
""The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,"" Llargues said.
In June, Mr. Trump said he's looking to ""wean"" states off of FEMA.","A group of current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency officials warned Congress on Monday that the Trump administration's sweeping changes to the disaster relief agency could reverse decades of reforms made after Hurricane Katrina.

The open letter was released as the U.S. this week marks 20 years since Katrina's 2005 landfall — sparking one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, with more than 1,800 deaths and over $200 billion in damage in today's dollars.

The letter argues the Trump administration — which has sought to dramatically shrink FEMA and floated scrapping the agency altogether — had made decisions that ""hinder the swift execution of our mission."" It states that a change in course is necessary to ""prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.""

Released by the advocacy group Stand Up for Science, the ""Katrina Declaration"" says it has 181 signatories. Only 35 people signed their names to the letter, with the rest opting for anonymity due to ""the culture of fear and suppression cultivated by this administration.""

It's addressed to several congressional committees and the FEMA Review Council, which was formed by President Trump earlier this year.

The declaration alleges that Mr. Trump's picks to lead FEMA ""lack proper qualifications,"" and decries the Trump administration for cutting FEMA's staff.

""Since January 2025, FEMA has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a FEMA Administrator,"" the open letter reads.

It also castigates FEMA for terminating grants meant to help state and local governments prepare their infrastructures to withstand natural disasters and extreme weather. Two-thirds of the counties that have received those grants voted for Mr. Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris, a CBS News investigation found earlier this year. A federal judge blocked cuts to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, program earlier this month.

In response to the letter, FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues said the Department of Homeland Security is ""committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people."" He said the agency has been ""bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes,"" and defended the Trump administration's handling of natural disasters so far this year.

""The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,"" Llargues said. ""It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.""

FEMA has faced months of upheaval since Mr. Trump's return to office.

Days after his inauguration, the president floated either ""getting rid of FEMA"" or ""fundamentally reforming and overhauling"" the agency, casting it as overly bureaucratic and arguing that state and local governments should take on a larger role in managing natural disasters. In June, Mr. Trump said he's looking to ""wean"" states off of FEMA.

The White House has proposed cutting FEMA's budget for non-disaster grants by $646 million in the next fiscal year. The Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a $36.2 billion budget for FEMA, up from $33.1 billion in the fiscal year 2025 budget.

So far this year, FEMA has lost about one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and buyouts, and the administration has overhauled the contract renewal system for more than two-thirds of FEMA's workforce, CBS News has previously reported.

The agency has had two acting leaders since Mr. Trump returned to office. Christopher Hamilton led the agency until May, when he was fired after saying he didn't support eliminating FEMA. His successor, David Richardson, introduced himself to staff by warning them during an all-hands meeting, ""don't get in my way,"" and suggesting he will ""run right over"" people he believes are subverting the president's agenda, CBS News has reported.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/11/c9f64bd5-15c9-416c-b66e-cccbd3a196f5/thumbnail/1200x630/7cba5a44f418f5243a70ec3879777015/gettyimages-2215283635.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 14:56:27.075725

Social Security data is highly sought after by criminals and foreign governments, who can use the information for identity theft or to gather intelligence.","That crackdown appears to have now ensnared a different member of the Federal Reserve Board, Lisa Cook. On Monday evening, President Trump fired Ms. Cook because of allegations that she falsified records to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage, a step that could give him greater control over the central bank.

After Mr. Trump announced that Ms. Cook was fired, Mr. Pulte celebrated on social media.

“Thank you President Trump for your commitment to stopping mortgage fraud and following the law,” Mr. Pulte wrote on X. “If you commit mortgage fraud in America, we will come after you, no matter who you are.”

Mr. Pulte, who has more than three million followers on social media, has used his position at the housing finance agency to attack and investigate Mr. Trump’s political enemies. He has accused Mr. Powell of mismanaging the renovation of the Fed’s headquarters and initiated mortgage fraud investigations into Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who prosecuted Mr. Trump and his companies, and Senator Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the effort to impeach Mr. Trump during his first term.

Then he seized on Ms. Cook.

Last week, Mr. Pulte posted images of her signatures that appeared to show that she improperly designated both a condominium in Atlanta and a home in Ann Arbor, Mich., as her primary residence when taking out loans. In doing so, Mr. Pulte said, Ms. Cook appeared to have “falsified bank documents and property records” that could have allowed her to obtain lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms.

“When someone commits mortgage fraud, they undermine the faith and integrity of our System,” Mr. Pulte wrote on X, adding that he was referring the case to the Department of Justice.

Ms. Cook said she would not step down from the central bank’s board, saying that “no cause exists under the law” for Mr. Trump to fire her. A lawyer representing Ms. Cook said he was readying a lawsuit to challenge the firing. She has not been charged with a crime.

Before Mr. Trump fired her, Ms. Cook had issued a brief statement saying she had “no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.” Ms. Cook added that she took “questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve, and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”

The claims against Ms. Cook come as Mr. Trump has railed against the central bank for being slow to cut interest rates and has looked to staff the central bank with loyalists. He has already picked Stephen Miran, a top economic adviser, to fill a seat that recently opened up after another governor, Adriana Kugler, left her post months before her term was up.

Mortgage occupancy fraud can be used to help buyers get lower interest rates or down payments when purchasing a home. According to Cotality, a real estate data provider, mortgage fraud increased slightly in the second quarter of 2025, but just 0.86 percent of all mortgage applications contained fraud.

A 2023 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that on average, between 2 and 3 percent of borrowers misrepresent their occupancy status when applying for a mortgage, though it was significantly higher during the run-up to the financial crisis. Most cases of occupancy fraud are uncovered when a borrower defaults on a mortgage, and it tends to be more common with investor-owned homes.

The role of director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency is usually a low-profile one, but that has not been the case for Mr. Pulte, who has transformed the agency into a weapon for Mr. Trump.

Mr. Pulte, 37, came to run the housing agency with little housing policy experience. A grandson of William Pulte, who was the founder of PulteGroup, one of the largest American home builders, he did not play an active role at the company, though he did serve as a board member from 2016 to 2020.

Before being tapped by Mr. Trump to run housing agency, Mr. Pulte was best known for running his own investment firm and helping to clean up blighted homes in Detroit — not far from where PulteGroup got its start.

His main job as the agency’s director is overseeing the government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are the twin engines that drive the nation’s housing market. Fannie and Freddie have been under government control since the federal government had to bail them out during the 2008 financial crisis to prevent an even greater collapse of the housing market.

Even though the companies are controlled by the government, they operate quasi-independently. But one of the first things Mr. Pulte did was to name himself as chairman of the boards of both companies and oust a number of board members.

In a post on Sunday, Mr. Pulte said reducing fraud was critical to improving the mortgage firms.

“Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are getting stronger each and every day,” Mr. Pulte wrote. “And once we eliminate mortgage fraud, will be even stronger!”

On Monday, he reposted copies of Mr. Trump’s firing letter and hailed the president for becoming the first to ever remove a Federal Reserve governor. He also issued an ominous warning about Ms. Cook’s potential legal fate.

“Mortgage fraud can carry up to 30 years in prison,” Mr. Pulte said.

Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting from New York.

The emerging legal clash threatened to compromise the independence and integrity of the nation’s central bank, a powerful institution at the heart of the economy whose responsibilities are to keep prices stable and the labor market strong. The Fed is supposed to be insulated from the pressures of politics, but Mr. Trump has unleashed an unprecedented string of attacks on its members, all in the hopes of getting them to lower interest rates.

“She can’t have an infraction, especially that infraction,” Mr. Trump said at a meeting of his cabinet, referring to the allegations against Ms. Cook.

“We need people that are 100 percent above board, and it doesn’t seem like she was,” he added, highlighting the fact that he might have a “majority very shortly” at the Fed.

Mr. Trump announced his decision to fire Ms. Cook in a note posted late Monday to social media. The president justified his actions by pointing to a provision in the Fed’s founding statute that allows him to dismiss a board member if he can identify sufficient cause, which is generally understood to mean negligence or malfeasance.

But Ms. Cook’s lawyer, Abbe David Lowell, later said in a statement that the president’s “attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis.” While Mr. Lowell did not elaborate, his comment appeared to echo the myriad issues raised by legal experts, who contend that Mr. Trump has not met the burden under law to warrant a firing — and did not provide Ms. Cook sufficient opportunity to respond.

“We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,” Mr. Lowell said.

Mr. Trump’s attempts to remove Ms. Cook quickly infuriated congressional Democrats, who assailed the president for an abuse of power. The Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday specifically rebuked the White House for engaging in a “racist, misogynistic, and unlawful attack on the integrity and independence” of the central bank.

But the president and his aides appeared unfazed by the criticisms on a day when markets reacted little to the news.

Mr. Trump at one point suggested that he was already considering a replacement for Ms. Cook, even before a legal challenge over her firing was resolved. The president appeared to be referring to Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, whom Mr. Trump previously announced as a replacement for Adriana Kugler, who resigned from the Fed months before the end of her term. Mr. Miran has not been confirmed by the Senate for the role.

Still, much remained uncertain in the immediate aftermath of Mr. Trump’s move to fire Ms. Cook, who has not yet filed her lawsuit. The Justice Department, for its part, declined to comment Tuesday on if or when it would file any charges against the Fed governor, even though the president maintained this week that the accusations of mortgage fraud were sufficient enough “to remove” Ms. Cook from her position.

The Fed, for its part, took no identifiable stance on Tuesday either on the legality of the president’s actions or the allegations levied against Ms. Cook. In its first public comments since the president’s late-night missive, a Fed spokesperson said the central bank would “abide by any court decision.”

“Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “The Federal Reserve will continue to carry out its duties as established by law.”

The allegations against Ms. Cook originated with Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has joined with Mr. Trump in repeatedly savaging the Fed and its members for keeping interest rates steady.

Last week, Mr. Pulte said he had obtained documents showing that Ms. Cook represented two different homes as her primary residence, claiming that she falsified those records to obtain more favorable terms on her mortgages. He called on her to resign, prompting Mr. Trump to say that he would fire her if she did not.

The allegations were only the latest instance in which Mr. Trump and Mr. Pulte have sought to weaponize the instruments of government against the president’s perceived political enemies. They have also attacked Mr. Powell, claiming he is responsible for a cost overrun in the ongoing renovations at the central bank, and Mr. Pulte at one point urged the president privately to fire the Fed chairman.

With Ms. Cook, Mr. Pulte soon referred the allegations to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation, as he dangled the possibility of a prison sentence and called on her to resign.

Ms. Cook resisted those calls, saying in an initial statement that she had “no intention of being bullied” as she pledged to gather “accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.” But Mr. Trump then issued an ultimatum, promising to fire her if she did not depart on her own.

The president acted on that late Monday, writing in a letter posted to social media that Ms. Cook’s actions had compromised her ability to serve as a financial regulator.

“The Federal Reserve has tremendous responsibility for setting interest rates and regulating reserve and member banks,” Mr. Trump said. “The American people must be able to have full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve. In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.”

Appearing early Tuesday on CNBC, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, attacked Ms. Cook as a “crook,” despite at one point acknowledging that the administration possessed only allegations of wrongdoing.

“The crook always says I’m not going anywhere, and why would anybody defend that?” Mr. Lutnick said. “The real question should be, did she commit mortgage fraud, yes or no, and if you did commit mortgage fraud, please get out of the federal government, get out of the seat of the governor of the Federal Reserve and go away.”

What did Mr. Trump say about the name?

At an event in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said the name War Department “just sounded better,” adding, “I think we’re going to have to go back to that.” He said it was a reminder of the country’s record of victories in conflicts under the old name, citing World Wars I and II. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Mr. Trump that the change was “coming soon.”

In June, Mr. Trump claimed that the title of war secretary had been changed to defense secretary to be more politically correct. The next month, in a post on Truth Social praising Mr. Hegseth, the president called him the “Secretary of War.” The president and Mr. Hegseth have been eager to promote a more aggressive image of the military and cut back on rules that restrict its operations.

What’s the history of the name?

George Washington established the War Department in August 1789, just months after the Constitution was ratified and he became the first president. The department oversaw the new nation’s military forces. Its first secretary was Henry Knox, who had served as a commander during the Revolutionary War and had, since 1785, been the war secretary under the Articles of Confederation, an early agreement among the colonial states.

The name was retained for more than 150 years, during which time the United States fought wars against Britain, Spain, Mexico and the Philippines, as well as the Civil War. It also fought wars against Native Americans.

The United States entered World War I in 1917 and, after the attack on the U.S. base at Pearl Harbor in 1941, joined World War II on the side of the Allied powers.

Why was the name changed to the Defense Department?

According to the Truman Library Institute, President Harry S. Truman changed the name as part of the National Security Act he signed in 1947, a time when the United States was the world’s only nuclear power and the Cold War was just starting.

The law merged the Navy and War departments and a newly independent Air Force into a single organization called the National Military Establishment, under a civilian secretary of defense who also oversaw the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Two years later, Congress amended the National Security Act, and the National Military Establishment was renamed the Defense Department. Since then it has overseen wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Richard H. Kohn, a professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who specializes in military history, said the name change in 1949 reflected the department’s expanded duties, which included war fighting, foreign policy, intelligence and, above all, national security.

In a nascent nuclear age, the new name also reflected an emphasis on avoiding war, Professor Kohn said.

“The decision was definitely not about political correctness,” he said. “It was to communicate to America’s adversaries and the rest of the world that America was not about making war but defending the United States, and saying that if that requires war, there are four major armed services.”

Does Mr. Trump have the power to change the department’s name?

The president cannot easily alter the Defense Department’s name or Mr. Hegseth’s title, according to Jamal Greene, a professor at Columbia Law School.

“The president can call the department whatever he wants in informal communication, but the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Defense were so named through acts of Congress, and I am unaware of any legal authority for the president to change those names by executive fiat,” Professor Greene said.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order in January directing the federal government to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, saying that the name had a “beautiful ring.” As president, Mr. Trump has the power to order changes to geographical names as they are used in the United States.

Experts said the change in the gulf’s name put Democrats in an awkward position, since to contest it could be viewed as unpatriotic. A similar dynamic could be at play if the White House tried to revert to the name War Department.

The Defense Department referred questions about the issue to the White House.

Judge Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump, went out of his way to describe the complaint as extremely unusual, offering his own role in the case as a prime example of its unorthodox nature. Because the suit was filed against the state’s entire federal bench, all of the district judges there were forced to recuse themselves and Judge Cullen had to be brought in from his home courthouse in Roanoke, Va., to preside over the case.

Moreover, he used the ruling to take Mr. Trump and some of his top aides to task for having repeatedly attacked other judges who have dared to rule against the White House in a flurry of cases challenging aspects of its political agenda.

“Over the past several months, principal officers of the executive (and their spokespersons) have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘activists,’ ‘radical,’ ‘politically minded,’ ‘rogue,’ ‘unhinged,’ ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional, [c]rooked,’ and worse,” Judge Cullen wrote.

“Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,” he concluded.

Judge Cullen’s plaintive criticism of the Trump administration’s assaults on the judiciary was in many ways reminiscent of a ruling issued in April by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit — for which he once served as a clerk — in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the immigrant from Maryland who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador.

The ruling was written by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, an icon of the conservative legal movement, who expressed deep concerns about the executive and judicial branches “grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.”

“We yet cling to the hope,” Judge Wilkinson wrote, “that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the executive branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.”

The case in front of Judge Cullen began in June when the Trump administration filed suit challenging a standing order put in place the month before. The order said that immigrants who sought to contest their removal from the country in the Maryland federal courts by filing what is known as a habeas petition would automatically be granted a two-day reprieve from being expelled.

The order was intended to give judges time to sort through the complicated legal issues in a flurry of fast-paced cases being filed in Maryland contesting the White House’s aggressive deportation policies. The most prominent of those was a lawsuit brought in March by Mr. Abrego Garcia.

Judge Cullen pointed out in his ruling that the White House took “umbrage” with the standing order because Trump officials believed it hindered their ability “to police immigration matters and enforce the nation’s immigration laws.”

He admitted that such arguments might have gotten “traction” if the administration had made them “in the proper forum.” Trump officials, he said, could have appealed any individual cases where the standing order had actually slowed down an immigrant’s removal or could have contested the underlying validity of the blanket rule in front of the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify such measures.

But instead, Judge Cullen maintained, the administration “chose a different, and more confrontational, path.”

“The executive decided to sue,” he wrote, “and in a big way.”

In dismissing the lawsuit, Judge Cullen agreed with almost all of the arguments put forward at a hearing two weeks ago by a lawyer for the judges, Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases in front of the Supreme Court.

The judge found that the defendants, as federal jurists, were immune from being sued and that the administration’s suit essentially violated the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution by having the executive branch attempt legal action against the judicial branch.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Judge Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches — and the public officials who serve in them — share the same core sovereign interest: to support and defend the Constitution.”

It is not the most likely of crime-busting outfits to take to the streets of Washington. The agency specializes in tasks involving global diplomacy, such as providing protection for the secretary of state and senior aides, conducting background security checks of State Department employees and potential hires, and helping secure U.S. embassies and consulates.

But its officers are now doing beat-cop work in Washington. They are deployed in the city alongside police officers and other federal agents in what President Trump says is a crackdown on crime. Many residents call it theatrical nonsense aimed at scoring political points with voters who know little about Washington.

At least one diplomatic security officer played a leading role in the nighttime arrest on Aug. 19 of Mark Bigelow, 28, a part-time delivery driver for Amazon who was arrested on a charge of having an open container of alcohol, which was in a van.

A diplomatic security officer, Adam Kapettanis, worked with counterparts from other agencies to try putting a handcuffed Mr. Bigelow into a law enforcement vehicle, but Mr. Bigelow resisted, according to an F.B.I. agent’s affidavit in court documents. Mr. Bigelow kicked Mr. Kapettanis in the leg, the text said, citing that as an element in charging Mr. Bigelow with resisting and assaulting federal officers, which carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison.

Elizabeth Mullin, a federal public defender representing Mr. Bigelow, told the court that Mr. Bigelow “was caught up in this federal occupation of D.C.” — a reference to Mr. Trump’s new policy — and that “this was a case created by federal law enforcement.”

When asked on Monday whether the Diplomatic Security Service was playing a role in Mr. Trump’s actions on Washington, the State Department said in a statement to The New York Times that the security service was “actively partnering with the Metropolitan Police Department and other law enforcement to provide interagency support in the ongoing mission to deter and reduce crime in the District of Columbia.”

It added that “consistent with standard practice, D.S.S. routinely assesses its priorities and job functions based on the administration’s strategic interests, while maintaining our mission to lead worldwide security and law enforcement efforts, and to protect State Department people, property and information in 170+ countries and 30+ U.S. cities.”

At least one federal judge in Washington has expressed anger at the overreach by federal agents in the arrests they have been making in Washington.

The State Department’s security service has also been working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in American cities to try to detain noncitizens and deport them. In February, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, deputized up to 600 diplomatic security agents to help with “arresting and deporting illegal immigrants.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has tried to help deport noncitizens who are in the country legally, most notably people who have expressed pro-Palestinian points of view. Federal judges have rebuked him for trying to strip away green cards and visas of people for expressing political opinions, and have ordered those detainees to be released.

The Diplomatic Security Service has more than 2,500 employees worldwide, according to the State Department website. A history page has details on precursor outfits from the American Revolution to the early 20th century. The modern service was established after World War II, as the United States embraced its superpower status, and eventually expanded its duties to include counterespionage, counterterrorism and protecting top foreign officials visiting the United States. Its officers can carry firearms.

A government document from 2009 quoted a Justice Department official saying diplomatic security officers can make arrests based on visa and passport fraud charges.

The service’s operations sometimes come under criticism from other State Department employees. For instance, some Asian American diplomats have accused officers in the unit of unfairly suspecting diplomats with that ethnic background of being potential espionage threats. The service has denied that ethnicity plays a role in its determinations.

No Democrat has won a U.S. House seat in Utah since 2018.

The ruling, which can be appealed, creates an opportunity for a new map that could help Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans will be fighting to hold onto their slim House majority.

It also makes Utah the latest battleground in a national fight over redistricting, as President Trump urges Republican officials to redo congressional maps in his party’s favor. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott is expected soon to sign into law a redrawn map that would deliver up to five House seats to Republicans, prompting Democrats in California to counter with their own new maps designed to offset those potential losses.

The decision in Utah came after the state’s Supreme Court said in July that the legislature had likely violated the state’s Constitution when it repealed a voter-approved measure known as Proposition Four, which required independent oversight of the redistricting process and forbade partisan gerrymandering.

In the judgment, issued on Monday, District Court Judge Dianna M. Gibson said Utah legislators were wrong to redraw the state’s boundaries without adhering to Proposition Four, and that the resulting map violated voters’ constitutional rights to participate in government.

The state’s current congressional map “is the fruit of that unlawful repeal, an extension of the very constitutional violation that tainted the process from the start,” Judge Gibson wrote.

Utah’s Republican legislature had argued that Proposition Four improperly impeded the government’s functioning and inserted voters into the redistricting process, which it said was solely the legislature’s responsibility.

Judge Gibson disagreed, saying voters needed a way to participate in redistricting efforts.

“How district lines are drawn can either safeguard representation and ensure accountability by elected representatives or erode public trust, silence voices and weaken the rule of law,” the judge wrote, calling it “among the most critical responsibilities of our government.”

Utah’s current congressional map, which was adopted in 2021 after lawmakers overruled the suggestions of an advisory board, was in place for the 2022 and 2024 election cycles. Judge Gibson wrote that state officials should urgently redraw the map for the 2026 cycle in a way that meets the requirements of Proposition Four.

Her order gives the legislature 30 days to submit a redrawn map to the court. Republican officials can appeal the ruling, which could delay the timeline and keep the current map in place.

Robert Axson, chairman of the Utah Republican Party, in a statement criticized the ruling as an overreach.

“Once again, certain members of Utah’s judiciary abandon the principles of our Constitutional Republic. Using earlier flawed rulings to justify their opinions over the principles of our founding is a special kind of hubris,” the statement said.

Members of Utah’s Democratic Party applauded the decision. State Sen. Nate Blouin, who represents Utah’s 13th State Senate District, which encompasses parts of Salt Lake City, said that Democratic lawmakers were expecting challenges from Republicans.

“Utah voters got a big win tonight,” he said. “Needless to say, the supermajority will fight back hard and seek to delay us.”

On Monday, Mr. Smith’s legal team sent a letter to the Office of Special Counsel, which has no affiliation with Mr. Smith’s former position. The Office of Special Counsel conducts ethics investigations of government employees, primarily into whether people have violated the Hatch Act, which bars federal workers from using their jobs to work on behalf of a political campaign.

Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, persuaded the agency to investigate whether Mr. Smith, in seeking to quickly bring Mr. Trump to trial, violated the law. Mr. Smith’s conduct, he claimed, appeared “to have no rationale except for an attempt to affect the 2024 election results.”

Mr. Smith and his lawyers, Lanny A. Breuer and Peter Koski, fired back in a three-page letter to the acting special counsel, Jamieson Greer.

“The predicate for this investigation is imaginary and unfounded,” the lawyers wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The New York Times. “Mr. Smith followed well-established legal principles in conducting the investigations into President Trump, and the courts presiding over the resulting prosecutions have already rejected the spurious allegations that the manner in which Mr. Smith prosecuted these cases was somehow improper.”

The letter also noted that while Mr. Greer’s office had publicly confirmed it had opened an investigation, neither Mr. Smith nor his lawyers had received any inquiries from the Office of Special Counsel. A representative for the Office of Special Counsel declined to comment.

Mr. Smith’s lawyers wrote that they “welcome the opportunity to engage with your office and are confident that as you become familiar with the facts and the record, you will conclude that there is no basis to find a violation of the Hatch Act and that these allegations are wholly without merit.”

Mr. Smith, they said, is “a prosecutor who has devoted his career to following the facts and the law, without fear or favor and without regard for the political consequences, not because of them.”

Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as the chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said the argument for a Hatch Act investigation made little sense.

“I just don’t see how this comes anywhere close to a Hatch Act violation,” he said. “If Smith had made public statements shortly before the election about the filings, we would have an issue that would need to be addressed. Or if he’d written Congress, it would need to be addressed. I see no evidence that Jack Smith did anything of the kind. He simply filed pleadings with the court, and the pleadings were accepted by the courts.”

The Trump administration has taken a host of measures meant to punish his perceived enemies, firing many of the people who worked for Mr. Smith, including paralegals and office support staff, and even attacking the law firm representing Mr. Smith by issuing an executive memorandum seeking to strip it of any government business. He has also forced out F.B.I. agents and executives and demoted or reassigned a wide swath of senior Justice Department officials whom Mr. Trump and his top aides do not trust.

In firing scores of law enforcement officials based solely on Mr. Trump’s expansive claim of executive power, the administration has flouted longstanding civil service laws meant to ensure the public receives professional services from government agencies. Many of those fired individuals have sued, but the cases are moving slowly through the courts.

Mr. Smith’s lawyers argued that an ethics investigation by the Office of Special Counsel into how Justice Department prosecutors handled their court cases would radically misuse a longstanding ethics law and interfere with how the federal government investigates corruption.

“This investigation is premised on a partisan complaint that suggests the ordinary operation of the criminal justice system should be disrupted by the whims of a political contest,” the lawyers wrote. “But the notion that justice should yield to politics is antithetical to the rule of law.”

They also urged the Office of Special Counsel not to reach a conclusion without engaging with Mr. Smith’s lawyers.

“In light of the unprecedented nature of this investigation, if you intend to go forward with this in any way, we insist that you engage with us so that any finding by the Office of Special Counsel is fully informed by the record,” they wrote. A fair review of the facts and law, they said “will compel the inescapable conclusion that the prosecutions brought by Mr. Smith were handled in an entirely lawful and appropriate manner.”

“Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology,” he posted on Truth Social, opening a new and potentially contentious chapter in the world’s continuing trade fight.

The post does not call out the European Union specifically, but Mr. Trump and other key administration officials have made it clear for months that they are unhappy with how the 27-nation bloc treats big American technology companies including X and Meta.

Republicans including Vice President JD Vance have criticized an E.U. law, the Digital Services Act, that requires social media companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illegal content and disinformation. Mr. Vance and other officials argue that the law places as an unfair burden on American platforms and undercuts free speech.

This month, Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state, instructed American diplomats to lobby against the rules. And on Monday, Reuters reported that the administration was contemplating sanctions against E.U. officials who were responsible for enacting the key digital regulation.

The social media rules are not the only European technology policy that has provoked the Trump administration. American officials and technology companies have also been critical of the Digital Markets Act, which is meant to prevent large technology platforms from abusing the power that their size gives them. And some European nations have digital services taxes.

The question is whether the European Union will be able to remain unbending when it comes to technology regulation.

Mr. Trump’s outburst comes at a sensitive moment in America’s relationship with the European Union. The two trading partners just last week published the text of a trade deal that they had been working to complete.

The agreement would apply 15 percent across-the-board tariffs on most E.U. exports to the United States, which will be costly for producers across the continent. But it did not seriously weaken digital regulation, which Europeans had greeted as a major victory.

But the deal is not final. The text itself is not legally binding, and even once the agreement is put in place, officials have indicated that it is only a first step. Both sides could bring forward additional asks.

Europeans have suggested that they plan to continue pushing for exemptions for products like wine and spirits. And it is becoming increasingly clear that Americans will continue pushing for a loosening of technology rules.

“All it takes is a single tweet from Trump to suggest that the joint statement isn’t worth the paper it’s written on,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a research consultancy. “Both countries and the E.U.-level are at risk.”

Around the world, tech firms have faced scrutiny for not doing enough to stop the spread of disinformation, engaging in anticompetitive business practices and not paying their fair share of taxes in the countries where they operate.

Mr. Trump’s threat shows his close ties to the U.S. tech industry and willingness to defend its interests abroad. Over the past several years, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, the European Union and others have proposed or adopted laws, regulations and tax policies focused on the tech sector.

The trade measures the president is warning of could be painful for the European Union. Restrictions on computer chip exports, for instance, would harm efforts in Europe and elsewhere to build massive data centers for developing the technology.

Asked about Mr. Trump’s post at a news conference on Tuesday, Paula Pinho, an E.U. spokeswoman, declined to comment in detail on hypothetical measures. But Thomas Regnier, an E.U. spokesman, pointed out that the bloc’s digital regulations did not specifically target American companies, but applied to firms from all over the world.

The stakes are high for Europe. Officials here have long made it clear that they see their regulations as a matter of national sovereignty. Given that, bending to Mr. Trump would amount to allowing the United States to write Europe’s rules.

But E.U. officials have already made major concessions to appease Mr. Trump, accepting higher tariffs on key exports ranging from cars to medicine while promising to make major investment in American technology and energy. The trade deal has been widely greeted as a capitulation on Europe’s part.

The bloc did not have had much of a choice, however.

Although its member states are moving rapidly to increase their own defense outlays and to diversify their customer base away from the United States, the bloc is for now both militarily and economically closely intertwined with America.

Given that, Europe’s leaders have been left trying to appease Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump himself on Monday underscored the tone of recent deliberations, claiming to reporters that “they call me the president of Europe.”

The account by the whistle-blower, Charles Borges, underscores concerns that have led to lawsuits seeking to block young software engineers at the agency built by Elon Musk from having access to confidential government data. In his complaint, Mr. Borges said DOGE members copied the data to an internal agency server that only DOGE could access, forgoing the type of “independent security monitoring” normally required under agency policy for such sensitive data and creating “enormous vulnerabilities.”

Mr. Borges did not indicate that the database had been breached or used inappropriately.

But his disclosure stated that as of late June, “no verified audit or oversight mechanisms” existed to monitor what DOGE was using the data for or whether it was being shared outside the agency. That kind of oversight would typically be provided by the agency’s career information security professionals, Mr. Borges said in his account.

And his complaint cites an official agency security assessment that described the project as “high risk” and that warned of “catastrophic impact” to Social Security beneficiaries and programs if the database were to be compromised.

“Should bad actors gain access to this cloud environment, Americans may be susceptible to widespread identity theft, may lose vital health care and food benefits, and the government may be responsible for reissuing every American a new Social Security number at great cost,” Mr. Borges’s complaint said. He alleged that DOGE did not involve him in discussions about the project, despite his role as chief data officer, leaving him to piece together evidence of what had happened after the fact.

Included in his account, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, are more than two dozen pages of internal emails, memos and other records to document his claims. Mr. Borges’s complaint said that DOGE’s actions “potentially violated multiple federal statutes” designed to protect government data.

Lawyers at the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower protection group, filed Mr. Borges’s account on Tuesday with the Office of Special Counsel as well as with congressional lawmakers. Mr. Borges, 49, joined the Social Security Administration in January after working for more than three years at other government agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and serving 22 years in the Navy, according to his complaint. His lawyers declined to make him available for an interview with The Times.

A spokesman for the Social Security Administration, Nick Perrine, said that the agency took whistle-blower complaints seriously.

“S.S.A. stores all personal data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information,” he said. “The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a longstanding environment used by S.S.A. and walled off from the internet. High-level career S.S.A. officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by S.S.A.’s information security team.”

Mr. Perrine added that the agency was “not aware of any compromise to this environment” and remained “dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data.”

A White House spokeswoman referred questions to the Social Security Administration.

The complaint includes documents showing that DOGE leaders sought to upload the data despite warnings that they could be exposing Americans’ personal information. The documents do not reveal why DOGE pushed for the project, although Mr. Borges said he was later told that the reason was to improve the way the agency exchanged data with other parts of government.

“I have determined the business need is higher than the security risk associated with this implementation and I accept all risks,” wrote Aram Moghaddassi, who worked at two of Mr. Musk’s companies, X and Neuralink, before becoming Social Security’s chief information officer, in a July 15 memo.

Mr. Moghaddassi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

DOGE’s access to Social Security data became one of the earliest flash points in Mr. Musk’s contentious spell in Washington. The billionaire and his allies pushed for DOGE to have unfettered access to the agency’s data, which is strictly protected under federal law, ousting career officials who stood in their way. Mr. Musk advanced false claims of widespread fraud at Social Security to justify the urgency of DOGE’s work.

Privacy advocates and Democrats warned that the confidentiality of Americans’ personal information might be at risk. Social Security data is highly sought after by criminals and foreign governments, who can use the information for identity theft or to gather intelligence. A federal judge temporarily blocked DOGE’s access to sensitive Social Security data in March, but the Supreme Court overruled that decision on June 6.

The agency has also shared data with immigration authorities, as President Trump seeks to carry out his mass deportation agenda.

Although Mr. Musk and many of his allies left Washington after the billionaire fell out with Mr. Trump in May, members of DOGE have continued to occupy key roles in the federal bureaucracy, including Mr. Moghaddassi.

At issue in Mr. Borges’s complaint is the so-called Numident file, a critical database that contains the personal information of everyone who has ever held a Social Security number, living or dead. The agency has issued more than 548 million numbers.

In his complaint, Mr. Borges provided documents showing that DOGE member John Solly, a software engineer working at Social Security, called a career agency employee on June 10 to open discussions about copying Numident data to a “virtual private cloud” server operated by Social Security. Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old DOGE software engineer, was also involved in the project and would be given access to the server, other records show. The request came shortly after the Supreme Court allowed members of DOGE to have access to the agency’s data.

Mr. Solly and Mr. Coristine did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

At least one senior official soon began raising concerns, according to documents disclosed in Mr. Borges’s complaint.

On June 16, Joe Cunningham, the agency’s acting chief information security officer, emailed Mr. Moghaddassi and another top official, attaching a copy of an official risk assessment.

“After a thorough review, we have determined that this request poses a high risk,” Mr. Cunningham wrote, adding that “our current policy requires sign-off from the chief information officer (C.I.O.) to accept these risks.”

The risk assessment stated that DOGE wanted “uninhibited” control over the server to “expedite” its work but had not provided documentation of how it would maintain security, and it warned that “sensitive data could be made public,” according to a copy included in Mr. Borges’s complaint.

In another email to colleagues on June 23, Mr. Cunningham wrote: “We need to address how we can effectively monitor the data and the security controls that will be implemented.”

Two days later, he asked Michael Russo, a senior DOGE-aligned official at Social Security, to sign off on the project, noting that the personal data being uploaded had not been “sanitized,” or anonymized, as he suggested would typically be the case.

“Approved,” Mr. Russo replied less than half an hour later.

Another Social Security employee wrote that a colleague would be “transferring a copy of the Numident data over shortly.”

Mr. Russo declined to comment. Mr. Cunningham did not immediately respond.

Mr. Borges’s complaint stated that he was kept in the dark about copying the Numident data and that his superiors did not address his concerns when he raised them this month.

And he said that after he started asking questions about the project, the agency’s Office of the General Counsel told employees “not to respond to his inquiries.”

“Mr. Borges spent weeks pressing for fixes inside” the agency, Andrea Meza, a lawyer with the Government Accountability Project, said in a statement. “When nothing changed, he used the protected channels federal whistle-blower law provides.”

Mr. Borges’s complaint also includes documents that he said backed up two additional allegations.

He said that in March DOGE officials bypassed normal security procedures and were given “improper and excessive access” to other databases that contained sensitive information about Social Security applicants, including the ability to edit data.

Mr. Borges also said that DOGE officials briefly “appeared to have circumvented” the March 20 temporary court order that locked them out of Social Security data, regaining access to the data over the following weekend before being cut off again on March 24.

Other opponents of the law argued that the city should be supportive of federal immigration officials and the White House’s deportation initiative.","Immigration officers must have a warrant to enter a permitted event on most public property in Spokane if organizers request protection and go through the proper steps to receive it, the city council voted Monday.

The law, which went through months of delays to satisfy the concerns of enough council members to pass, did not come soon enough this summer to save Tacos and Tequila, an annual event celebrating Spokane’s Latino community that would have typically taken place last weekend on a closed city street downtown but was canceled for fear of targeted raids by immigration officials.

“We just don’t feel like it’s safe right now to hold a Latino festival because we are being targeted right now,” said Fernanda Mazcot, executive director of Nuestras Raices Community Center, when the event was canceled in July.

But bill sponsor Councilman Paul Dillon and supporters hope the new law will provide some level of reassurance for future event planners and their attendees.

“Words cannot fully describe the way your blood freezes or the way your entire nervous system becomes an active live wire when you think you may have to be the person who stands against injustice and holds federal agents accountable,” said Nicole Ruiz, an organizer for Nuestras Raíces Community Center – a nonprofit serving the Latino community in Eastern Washington that hosts events like Tacos and Tequila.

“However, there is also something powerful when you know you are backed by the law,” Ruiz added. “Despite the fear, you stand a little straighter.”

The “Safe and Welcome in Spokane” law, originally proposed to impact public events in city parks, now potentially includes any event on public property outside of parks, following the independent city park board’s refusal to take responsibility for enforcement or administration. To qualify, organizers must coordinate with the city permitting office, clearly define the borders of the event with signage or barriers and give attendees “express permission” to enter, such as with a ticket or verbal permission.

The original version of the law was proposed in May as one of the last major legislative actions by former Councilwoman Lili Navarrete, who resigned in late June citing health concerns, but the proposal faltered amid concerns from the park board.

Dillon took up the effort in June shortly after mass protests over immigration arrests, modifying the law so that it no longer included city parks. The ordinance again faced headwinds after Council President Betsy Wilkerson worried it would prevent typical law enforcement from entering if a crime occurred at a protected event.

Though Dillon has insisted the law only impacts immigration officers, the law approved Monday also explicitly allows local, county and state law enforcement to enforce laws relevant to their jurisdictions.

The ordinance was approved Monday 5-2, with Councilmen Jonathan Bingle and Michael Cathcart voting in opposition. Since May, Cathcart has argued the ordinance was more performance than protection, believing that federal law enforcement would not be discouraged from entering an event in violation of the municipal law, and they may actively surveil the perimeter of events that sought such protections.

Police Chief Kevin Hall, asked Monday what officers would do in response to a 911 call about immigration officers violating the city’s law, was clear: observe, attempt to keep the peace, and otherwise do nothing.

“SPD cannot and will not interfere with a federal law enforcement officer,” Hall said.

Instead, the law would potentially give residents the ability to sue the federal government and other parties for violations, similar to a 2018 city law that prohibited warrantless immigration searches at the downtown Greyhound station.

In 2021, Greyhound agreed to a $2.2 million settlement with Washington state for frequently allowing warrantless immigration services just before the first court hearing for a lawsuit brought by then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson. This lawsuit was based on violations of anti-discrimination and other state-level laws, not the 2018 city law, however.

Cathcart disputed that cities had the power to grant residents a right to sue the federal government over alleged violations, which would leave the ordinance toothless.

Other opponents of the law argued that the city should be supportive of federal immigration officials and the White House’s deportation initiative.

“The law is clear that invaders need to be repelled,” said Larry Andrews, owner of HVAC company Andrews Mechanical and a frequent critic of the council. “And the problem with our city right now is we’re in a deficit … and by doing what you’re doing, you’re going to make it even worse, because the (federal) administration is following the laws, and they’re going to pull all of your funding for sure.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/v02UBJ2X3hJm2YVhOX6Tx016ukw=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/08/25/684a61d96d77f.hires.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 16:56:34.893830

Nigel Farage's plans to tackle illegal immigration are big and would prompt a host of legal and practical challenges.","In politics the summer holidays offer a major opportunity for opposition parties.

A quieter news agenda means the chance to break through with policies.

Multiple government sources have told me that they think Reform UK has beaten both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in the August battle of attracting attention.

That may have been helped by Tuesday's finale in Nigel Farage's summer crime campaign: the unveiling of the party's long-awaited illegal immigration strategy.

A couple of attendees at the news conference, at an aircraft hangar in Oxfordshire, told me what was most notable was not just the boldness of the policy but quite how much money the party had spent on the event.

""It was like a TV variety show,"" said one.

That suggests the party is continuing to attract donors - helped by opinion polls consistently suggesting that a Farage premiership is possible.

Since April, Reform has had a lead over Labour according to these surveys.

Research suggests illegal immigration is also among the top issues for voters, although there is evidence that many have a limited understanding of the balance of illegal and legal migration in the UK.

So has Nigel Farage changed the debate on immigration?

Arguably the rise in small boat crossings since 2018 has been a major factor in crystallizing voters' concerns. It is a very visible, striking, and relatively new form of illegal migration.

These arrivals make up just over a third of those claiming asylum in the UK - many others arrive on a visa and then put in a claim.

Yet the record numbers of crossings have become emblematic of wider anxiety that the asylum system is not working. And prime ministers have struggled to fix it.

Rishi Sunak tried and failed to ""stop the boats"". Keir Starmer also made a major commitment on immigration - to ""smash the gangs"".

No party seems to be arguing that people making perilous journeys across the English Channel is a good thing. And therefore the UK political debate is focussed on who can solve this issue and how.

The solutions on offer from political parties have steadily become more radical in recent months with the Conservatives now examining whether to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Labour government is promising to introduce new legislation by the end of the year to tighten the way some of that convention is used in asylum cases to prevent legal delays.

Yet Reform is undoubtedly proposing the most radical solution - including leaving the convention altogether.

Nigel Farage's plans to tackle illegal immigration are big and would prompt a host of legal and practical challenges.

In his long political career he has regularly been accused of not being interested in policy detail, and at Tuesday's news conference Farage repeatedly deferred to his colleague Zia Yusaf when questioned about Reform's policy.

The policy document handed out to attendees was just four pages long, even if a party source insisted this was just a summary of Reform's - still secret - 100 page plan.

Questions will continues to be asked about how Reform intend to deport unaccompanied children, as well as the dangers of returning people to unsafe countries like Afghanistan where they could potentially face torture or death.

Farage's response was: ""The alternative of course is to do nothing… We cannot be responsible for all the sins that take place around the world.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2935/live/620c7ce0-829c-11f0-a21f-a946aea0c353.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 13:57:13.329496

The reason for the detainment of Utah violinist John Shin by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been revealed.

Last week, Shin’s wife Danae Snow established a GoFundMe page to raise funds for the expensive legal process required to bring him home. At the time, no details on the reason for Shin’s detention had been released.

The family has since hired the Utah law firm Stowell Crayk to help release Shin from an immigration detention facility in Aurora, UT. Snow provided an update to the fundraiser page, saying:

‘In working with the attorneys, I have learned that ICE made the decision to detain John because of an impaired driving ticket he received in 2019 while he was grieving the passing of his father from brain cancer.

‘While our attorneys feel confident that we can get him out of ICE custody on bond, I wanted to let you know as soon as I found out the reason for his being detained.

‘Of course, if this changes your mind about donating, please reach out to me for a refund.’

According to a report by Fox13 News, the attorney Adam Crayk clarified Shin’s immigration status. Crayk said that Shin originally came to the US under his father’s student visa before eventually marrying a US citizen. A family friend confirmed that Shin came to Utah from South Korea when he was ten years old.

Crayk told Fox13 that for reasons beyond their control, the family ’weren’t able to file for the green card in a timely fashion.’

Snow said that Shin was struggling with the death of his father at the time he received the impaired driving ticket, after which he completed the necessary probation.

‘He was stepping into the role of trying to take care of his family and his father’s absence and was really not knowing how to move forward and really just struggling with life without him,’ Snow said.

Shin’s citizenship paperwork has yet to be submitted, but the family and attorney are hoping to obtain Shin a green card after his bond hearing on Tuesday next week.

Snow had initially aimed to raise $28,000. As of 26 August, over $64,000 has been raised towards the fundraiser’s new goal of $70,000.

Friends and supporters of Shin have been playing their instruments at the Utah State Capitol government office and will aim to continue doing so until Shin returns home.",https://dnan0fzjxntrj.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/8/8/40288_93825967_1755708009973657_r_360847.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 13:57:28.562309

Judicial orders spark federal lawsuit

The backstory:

In a highly unusual move, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit in June against the entire federal court in Maryland. The suit was in response to a standing order issued by Chief Judge George L. Russell III, which was designed to prevent the immediate deportation of immigrants who had filed petitions challenging their detentions.

This action was seen as an escalation of the administration's ongoing conflict with the judiciary over immigration enforcement.

The court's response to the lawsuit

What we know:

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who was a Trump appointee who normally sits in Virginia, was specially assigned to preside over the case. In his ruling, he dismissed the lawsuit, finding that it was an improper challenge that went against established legal precedent and the principle of separation of powers.

He stated that the administration should have used a more traditional legal process, such as appealing a decision in a specific case, rather than suing all 15 judges. Judge Cullen's decision notes that the court's standing order was a reasonable and common judicial act intended to preserve its jurisdiction and ensure that immigrants have access to legal counsel.

The lawsuit was filed in response to a ""rising tide of last-minute immigration petitions"" that made it difficult for the court to review cases, according to attorneys for the judges. The dispute highlights the conflict between the executive and the judiciary, with members of the Trump administration criticizing judges who oppose policies set forward by the administration.

The Justice Department argued that the automatic pause in deportations violated a Supreme Court ruling. In his decision, Judge Cullen also criticized the administration's public attacks on the judiciary, calling the effort to ""smear and impugn"" judges both ""unprecedented and unfortunate.""

Paul Clement is a prominent conservative lawyer and former solicitor general who represented the Maryland judges. Clement stated during the hearing that ""there really is no precursor for this suit"" and that the lawsuit was intended to ""limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.""

Local perspective:

Newsweek reached out to Kelli Heath via her Facebook page for comment.
""We never knew that it was an issue, because he took care of it at that time,"" Kelli told 9News.
""During his interaction with CBP, Heath attempted to flee after being served a Notice to Appear (NTA) for immigration court,"" they said.
Kelli Heath, in an August 11 Facebook post: ""This has been devastating for us emotionally and financially.","A man who immigrated from England to the United States more than three decades ago was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Colorado for marijuana possession charges.

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesperson told Newsweek on Tuesday: ""A green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation's laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if our laws are broken and abused. Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) presenting at a U.S. port of entry with criminal convictions may be found inadmissible, placed in removal proceedings, and subject to mandatory detention.""

Why It Matters

Dale Heath's future as a U.S. citizen remains in limbo due to marijuana possession charges of less than 2 ounces from approximately 25 years ago. After successfully renewing his temporary proof of residency annually since 2022, he was reportedly informed by federal authorities in May that renewal was no longer an option ""because there are changes under the new administration.""

President Donald Trump has continually vowed to remove violent offenders from American soil; however, some cases involving nonviolent immigrants lacking criminal records have resulted in broader questions of whether such individuals should be detained and/or deported.

Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley's Deportation Data Project, which compiles federal data, found that roughly 37 percent of ICE arrests in July 2025 were of people with no U.S. criminal convictions or pending charges, doubling to about 92,000 during the first six months of the Trump administration compared with the final half‑year of the Joe Biden administration.

That 37 percent figure is up from 13 percent during Biden's last full month in office in December.

What To Know

On August 4, Dale Heath left his home in Castle Rock, Colorado, to tend to his immigration paperwork at Denver International Airport.

After he was informed by officials that they were unable to properly renew his residency, he was detained and placed inside the Aurora Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility, where he called his wife, Kelli, later that day, according to local news station 9News.

""It was a very like, 'Hey, I'll be right back. I'm going to run and renew my paperwork,'"" his wife, Kelli Heath, told the outlet. ""He honestly didn't even give us a hug or kiss goodbye because it was such a routine activity to go take care of...It was like he was going to the grocery store.""

Newsweek reached out to Kelli Heath via her Facebook page for comment.

Dale Heath came to the U.S. from England in 1991, at age 8 and with a permanent visa, Kelli told CBS News Colorado. He's lived in Colorado for about a decade and, along with his wife, runs Castle Rock Carpet Care, which the couple temporarily closed following his detention. He also volunteered as a coach with Rapids Youth Soccer and served in his children's school community.

His detention stems from two arrests in the year 2001 for marijuana possession of less than 2 ounces, both occurring in Texas, including once before he was 18 years old. Court records show he pleaded no contest in both cases and served probation and short confinement.

""We never knew that it was an issue, because he took care of it at that time,"" Kelli told 9News. ""But come 20 years later, we find out that it was still an issue.""

CBP told Newsweek that Heath, a United Kingdom passport holder and U.S. lawful permanent resident, had previously been found inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act due to a controlled substance violation.

""During his interaction with CBP, Heath attempted to flee after being served a Notice to Appear (NTA) for immigration court,"" they said. ""CBP officers swiftly apprehended Heath, who was subsequently transferred to ICE custody. CBP remains committed to enforcing immigration laws in strict accordance with federal statutes and policies. Heath's case is now under the jurisdiction of the immigration court system, where he remains in custody pending further proceedings.""

Dale was initially questioned in May 2022 at Houston's Hobby Airport by Customs and Border Protection officers after returning from a trip. Initially placed in removal proceedings, he was told to renew his paperwork every year to extend his parole and remain in the country.

Now, the husband and father of two children has remained in detention for about three weeks.

""It is literally like visiting somebody in prison,"" Kelli told CBS Colorado. ""It's through a glass window. You pick up the phone and can talk to them through the phone. So it's not like I can hug him or kiss him.""

""Emotionally, he's a wreck,"" she said. ""Physically, he's a wreck. He lost 12 pounds in the first four days he was there. He's in an area where there's...I'll say real criminals in there—domestic violence, or somebody who is affiliated with a murder. It's just crazy things like that.""

Kelli set up a crowdfunding campaign on the website Free Funder. The campaign, created on August 11, has already surpassed the $10,000 funding goal ($10,751 as of Tuesday morning) and received donations from 109 individuals, including one for $1,500.

""This heartbreaking situation has left his wife and children without his support, both emotionally and financially,"" the campaign page reads. ""In the midst of this sudden separation, they are now navigating overwhelming legal expenses, household bills, and daily living costs, all while holding onto hope for his safe return home.

""The family has always been the first to help others in need, and now, they need our help more than ever.""

What People Are Saying

In a statement to 9NEWS, ICE said it ""continues to issue temporary status documentation such as I-551 stamps on a case-by-case basis,"" but would not comment specifically on Dale's case.

Kelli Heath, in an August 11 Facebook post: ""This has been devastating for us emotionally and financially. Our family business is temporarily closed, and many have asked how they can help. Right now, financial support would make the biggest difference. Even $10 helps.

""We're also setting up a meal train to help with dinners. Thank you to everyone who has checked in on us—your love and kindness mean the world. If I miss responding, please know I see and appreciate you.""

In a scathing 39-page ruling, the judge, Thomas T. Cullen, called the suit “novel and potentially calamitous,” saying that the administration had simpler — and clearly more legal — ways to contest the standing order aside from bringing a suit against all 15 federal judges who sit in Maryland.
Judge Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump, went out of his way to describe the complaint as extremely unusual, offering his own role in the case as a prime example of its unorthodox nature.
Because the suit was filed against the state’s entire federal bench, all of the district judges there were forced to recuse themselves and Judge Cullen had to be brought in from his home courthouse in Roanoke, Va., to preside over the case.

Because the suit was filed against the state’s entire federal bench, all of the district judges there were forced to recuse themselves and Judge Cullen had to be brought in from his home courthouse in Roanoke, Va., to preside over the case.

Moreover, he used the ruling to take Mr. Trump and some of his top aides to task for having repeatedly attacked other judges who have dared to rule against the White House in a flurry of cases challenging aspects of its political agenda.

“Over the past several months, principal officers of the executive (and their spokespersons) have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘activists,’ ‘radical,’ ‘politically minded,’ ‘rogue,’ ‘unhinged,’ ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional, [c]rooked,’ and worse,” Judge Cullen wrote.

“Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,” he concluded.

Judge Cullen’s plaintive criticism of the Trump administration’s assaults on the judiciary was in many ways reminiscent of a ruling issued in April by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit — for which he once served as a clerk — in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the immigrant from Maryland who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador.

The ruling was written by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, an icon of the conservative legal movement, who expressed deep concerns about the executive and judicial branches “grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.”

“We yet cling to the hope,” Judge Wilkinson wrote, “that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the executive branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.”

The case in front of Judge Cullen began in June when the Trump administration filed suit challenging a standing order put in place the month before. The order said that immigrants who sought to contest their removal from the country in the Maryland federal courts by filing what is known as a habeas petition would automatically be granted a two-day reprieve from being expelled.

The order was intended to give judges time to sort through the complicated legal issues in a flurry of fast-paced cases being filed in Maryland contesting the White House’s aggressive deportation policies. The most prominent of those was a lawsuit brought in March by Mr. Abrego Garcia.

Judge Cullen pointed out in his ruling that the White House took “umbrage” with the standing order because Trump officials believed it hindered their ability “to police immigration matters and enforce the nation’s immigration laws.”

He admitted that such arguments might have gotten “traction” if the administration had made them “in the proper forum.” Trump officials, he said, could have appealed any individual cases where the standing order had actually slowed down an immigrant’s removal or could have contested the underlying validity of the blanket rule in front of the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify such measures.

But instead, Judge Cullen maintained, the administration “chose a different, and more confrontational, path.”

“The executive decided to sue,” he wrote, “and in a big way.”

In dismissing the lawsuit, Judge Cullen agreed with almost of all the arguments put forward at a hearing two weeks ago by a lawyer for the judges, Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases in front of the Supreme Court.

The judge found that the defendants, as federal jurists, were immune from being sued and that the administration’s suit essentially violated the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution by having the executive branch attempt legal action against the judicial branch.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Judge Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches — and the public officials who serve in them — share the same core sovereign interest: to support and defend the Constitution.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26dc-judges-ptgf/26dc-judges-ptgf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:57:27.021383

""I was standing over there, right by the courthouse, and happened to look over, when suddenly a gray [Ford] Expedition stopped in the middle of the street,"" Mills said. ""And at least two, maybe three armed officers in tactical gear got out and ran into the middle of the median.”

Mills said a Buncombe County bailiff was present who did not know what was happening.

After a hearing in the courthouse, Amaya-Sanchez requested a bailiff to escort him to his car. It was then that suspected ICE agents, one with a U.S. Marshal vest, arrested him.

""They clearly were coming after one person. It was a bit of a fright, with tactical gear and long guns, run towards somebody and literally just grab them,"" Mills said.

""We were aware of federal officers' presence in the courthouse, but nothing as it relates to detaining anyone.

Miller is asking for the same ICE notification it gets for ICE detainers in jail and warrants applicable to any potential courthouse arrest, Redmond said.

""It was shocking in that this is America,"" said Mills. ""Men with tactical vests in the middle of the road taking away a human being.""

Timothy Henderson served as Jediael Amaya-Sanchez's public defender in a jury trial, where he was found not guilty of any charges. He was also working to help his client the day he was arrested outside the courthouse.

""This victim's wife said that within 10 minutes of being acquitted by a jury of his peers, that Mr. Amaya-Sanchez attempted to run her down in the parking garage. That didn't sound like something the man I'd just spent a week with would ever do,"" he said.

Henderson said the hearing was why Amaya-Sanchez was at the courthouse. Henderson was working to get him a bilingual attorney who could help with the civil filing.

Henderson believed the allegations were false.

He added that he is concerned about the potential ICE situation and is in touch with his client's family.

""ICE is attempting to short change that process, which should alarm us all.""","As the Trump administration seeks to implement its hardline immigration policies, it has increased enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in immigration courts, prompting alarm from Catholic immigration advocates.

Such instances are taking place across the country: New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently filed court papers in support of a lawsuit to stop arrests of migrants reporting for their hearings at a federal immigration building in Manhattan. Protesters in San Francisco attempted to halt such detentions in that city.

Near the U.S.-Mexico border, Fr. Michael Gallagher, an attorney and Jesuit priest and a member of Jesuit Refugee Service/USA's Caminar Contigo program in El Paso, has been visiting immigration court hearings to help ensure those going into their hearings understand their rights, as well as the possible outcomes of their cases.

Among the consequences ""of these arrests as people come out of court,"" Gallagher said, was a woman who had had been told by a judge to leave her children at home for her appointment followed that instruction, and later, as she ""comes to court and gets arrested as she comes out, and her kids are left at home and don't know where mama is.""

""So that is one of the kind of brutal consequences,"" he said.

Gallagher told OSV News targeting immigration courts for enforcement actions means the government is in some cases, ""arresting people who are complying with the law.""

""It's against fundamental justice,"" Gallagher said.

The Trump administration's changes to Temporary Protected Status — a program for shielding eligible migrants from particular nations from deportation due to dangerous conditions in their homelands — means that there are individuals who first entered the U.S. with legal status who have now been left without it, he said.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment from OSV News.

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, ""Immigration enforcement that targets people attending court hearings is particularly troubling, because we're talking about going after people doing everything they can to regularize their immigration status by following the legal process.""

""As Americans, we value fairness and respect for constitutional rights, including due process,"" he said.

Kevin Appleby, senior fellow for policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York and the former director of migration policy for the USCCB, told OSV News, ""Targeting immigration courts can violate due process for immigrants, a basic principle of our justice system. Everyone should be able to have their day in court.""

""In the area of immigration, due process ensures that those who have a legal basis to remain are not wrongly deported or sent back to their persecutors,"" he said. ""ICE is attempting to short change that process, which should alarm us all.""

Gallagher said, ""what I'm observing is kind of a real shift towards cruelty, which is very depressing for our country, to become a cruel place."" But he said at the same time, ""the people I meet down at the courtroom — the Catholics and the Protestants and the Jews — are very much in favor of looking at these people as people, first of all, as human beings with inherent dignity.""

In one example of his work helping to educate people about their rights in court, Gallagher said he met a family with a ""little girl who was 2 or 3 years old in a white dress, who was waiting to go to court and doing pirouettes downstairs while I'm explaining to her parents that they might get arrested, the whole family.""

Despite the circumstances, he said, he was struck by how ""she's still a 3-year-old kid and a human being, lovely with a white dress, and a happy child.""

Corbett added that as deportations ""now begin to hit local communities, we're starting to see a groundswell of statements and actions from bishops across the country speaking out in defense of human rights and advocating for essential immigration reforms.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-08/20250825T1015-JRS-PRIEST-IMMIGRATION-COURT-1803093%20%2813%29.jpg?h=82f92a78&itok=T3Ga9Zwz,N,,2025-08-26 12:57:49.893854

Over the past three months, the Trump administration has employed a series of legal tactics in the state to achieve a desired outcome.

Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre and Andrew Mahaleris, an Abbott spokesperson, declined to respond to questions from ProPublica and The Texas Tribune.
Taken together, Trump’s legal strategies in Texas this summer show a win-at-all-costs mindset that is trampling on legal norms, said University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson.","On July 7, the Justice Department sent a harshly written letter threatening to sue the staunchly Republican state of Texas, notwithstanding its efforts to help elect Donald Trump and the fact that the president had singled out its leaders as key allies in his immigration crackdown.

The letter decried the congressional map previously passed by the state’s Republican-led Legislature as “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.” It demanded that Gov. Greg Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton respond the same day with a plan to comply. Otherwise, the Justice Department said, it reserved “the right to seek legal action against the state.”

Despite its adversarial tone, the letter was hardly unwelcome. In fact, it was just the opposite.

It set in motion a chain of events that gave Abbott and Paxton the political cover needed to provide Trump with exactly what he wanted: a mid-decade redrawing of district lines designed to ease that path for his party to maintain control of Congress after the 2026 midterm elections.

Republican lawmakers prioritized passage of the new political map above nearly all other legislation during the state’s second special session, including disaster preparedness and relief for victims of the July 4 flooding that killed more than 130 Texans. The new congressional boundaries, crafted to net Republicans up to five more seats, drew an immediate legal challenge from a coalition of Black and Latino voters who, on Saturday morning, alleged that it discriminates against nonwhite voters. Abbott is expected to sign it into law this week.

“The One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate and is on its way to my desk, where it will be swiftly signed into law,” Abbott said in a statement on Saturday. “I promised we would get this done, and delivered on that promise.”

The series of events is part of a larger trend this summer of the Trump administration using legal action or the threat of the courts to seemingly coerce Republican governors and other politically aligned defendants to do precisely what he wants them to do. The strategy has allowed his administration to sidestep state legislatures and Congress, according to legal experts and critics. In some cases, it has allowed red states to achieve a politically valuable goal they’d wanted all along.

In Texas, Trump has been met with state leaders who have been willing, if not eager, collaborators in carrying out his agenda.

Over the past three months, the Trump administration has employed a series of legal tactics in the state to achieve a desired outcome.

It filed a federal lawsuit and, in one day, killed a decades-old law allowing Texas students who were not U.S. citizens or permanent residents to receive in-state tuition at public colleges and universities if they met specific criteria. The move came just two days after bills to repeal the law failed to pass the state Legislature.

The Trump administration also maneuvered within the court system, reaching an agreement to settle a lawsuit against the federal government that effectively gutted a ban on churches participating in political campaigns. Trump has long opposed the ban, which he vowed to end, but the president lacked congressional support for such a move.

On redistricting, Trump used his heft within the party to force the state Legislature to redraw the typically once-a-decade political map it had approved just four years earlier, leading to a standoff with the governors of Democratic states. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed measures that will ask voters in his state to approve five new districts that would favor Democrats in direct response to Texas’ redistricting.

Trump is not the first president to use a “sue and settle” strategy.

Republicans complained bitterly about the Obama administration encouraging liberal groups and Democratic state attorneys general to file suits against the Environmental Protection Agency, which then led to the rapid adoption of consent agreements for more stringent enforcement of environmental policies than Congress was likely to pass, said Marquette University law professor Paul Nolette.

But Trump’s strategy, Nollette said, is even more aggressive.

Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre and Andrew Mahaleris, an Abbott spokesperson, declined to respond to questions from ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. The White House acknowledged an email seeking comment, but did not provide one.

Taken together, Trump’s legal strategies in Texas this summer show a win-at-all-costs mindset that is trampling on legal norms, said University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson. He is among several legal scholars and lawyers representing civil rights and religious liberty groups who told ProPublica and the Tribune they fear the administration’s strategy to bypass the checks provided by the legislative and judicial branches of government will cause lasting harm.

“One ought to be extremely disturbed by this thoroughly authoritarian administration,” said Levinson, who has taught constitutional law for 45 years. He added that through such initiatives, Trump is “trying to enforce the ‘Führerprinzip’ of absolute loyalty to himself, rather than to abstract constitutional norms.”

“What is truly incredible is the extent to which the GOP has fallen in line,” Levinson said.

“New level”

The first clear sign that the administration was working with the state’s Republican leadership to bypass lawmakers was its successful June 4 effort to nullify the Texas Dream Act.

The 2001 law granted in-state tuition at public colleges and universities to students who lived in the state for three years and graduated from a Texas high school, even if they were not permanent residents or U.S. citizens.

Efforts to repeal or sharply curtail the benefit for immigrant children have gone nowhere in the Republican-led Legislature, including this year. It would never have passed, or remained in place for so long, without the support of Texas Republicans, said former state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, a lead sponsor of the 2001 law. The San Antonio Democrat recalled in an interview that the law, which former Gov. Rick Perry signed, had the support of most major groups representing Texas businesses because many believed that encouraging immigrant youth to pursue higher education expands their lifelong earnings, bolsters the workforce and benefits state coffers.

On June 4, two days after the Legislature adjourned, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sued Texas in federal court in Wichita Falls. There, only one district judge sits — Reed O’Connor, a Trump appointee. Within hours, Paxton, who is charged with defending the state’s laws, joined the federal government in filing a joint motion that asked the court to declare the law unconstitutional. O’Connor, who did not respond to a request for comment about the case, quickly agreed.

Paxton’s communications office did not respond to written questions from ProPublica and the Tribune. It’s unclear if Abbott, who succeeded Perry, supported the move by Bondi and Paxton to bypass the legislative process and kill the law.

Abbott has not said a lot about the issue since his initial run for governor in 2014, and Mahaleris, his spokesperson, did not respond to questions about it. Back then, pressed by Democratic opponent Wendy Davis, who predicted that GOP lawmakers would try to repeal in-state tuition for immigrant youth and said she’d veto any such legislation, Abbott suggested he supported making some changes and left the door open to signing a repeal bill.

“Greg Abbott believes that the objective of the program is noble. But he believes the law as structured is flawed and it must be reformed,” an Abbott spokesperson said at the time.

Had the Republican-led Legislature truly been interested in repealing the law, it would have done so, said Van de Putte, who pointed to this year’s passage of a program that allows families to use taxpayer dollars to fund their children’s private school education. “I mean, they got vouchers,” Van de Putte said. “This wasn’t a policy imperative.”

Van de Putte, now a lobbyist, said that when she heard of Paxton and Bondi’s maneuver, her “heart ripped.”

On June 5, a day after the Justice Department and Paxton worked together to overturn the law, Deputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli exulted over the collaboration, saying that because they “were able to have that line of communication and talk in advance, a statute that’s been a problem for the state for 24 years, we got rid of it in six hours.” In audio obtained by NBC News, Kambli told GOP state attorneys general at a private gathering that the president’s legal team was “learning how to be offensive-minded” and “brought in a lot of people from state-AG world” conversant in the tactics.

The Justice Department didn’t respond to a request for comment about Kambli’s remarks. According to NBC, a department spokesperson did not dispute that Kambli made the statements and said it was “pretty standard” for department lawyers to notify state attorneys general of federal lawsuits ahead of time.

The same day Kambli spoke to the gathering with GOP state attorneys general, Bondi and Paxton issued a joint news release celebrating the victory. Bondi praised Paxton “for swiftly working with us to halt a program that was treating Americans like second-class citizens in their own country.” For his part, Paxton said he was “proud to stand with Attorney General Bondi and the Trump Administration to stop an unconstitutional and un-American law that gave in-state tuition to illegal aliens.” In ensuing weeks, the Justice Department sought to repeat its Texas victory by filing suits challenging immigrant-tuition benefits in Kentucky, Minnesota and Oklahoma. Oklahoma joined Texas in agreeing to end its benefits, while Democratic statewide officials in Minnesota and Kentucky are pushing back.

The effort was “coordinated and planned collusion to circumvent the people and Texas’ legislative process,” said Kristin Etter of the Texas Immigration Law Council, an immigrant rights advocacy group.

Marquette’s Nolette, an expert on state attorneys general, said Paxton, a three-term Republican attorney general, and Trump’s Justice Department have moved to a “new level” of using the courts to achieve favored policy outcomes. He said the collaboration between Paxton and the Justice Department is an expansion of the “sue and settle” approach that the Obama administration employed. In many of those cases, there was at least a provision of the federal Clean Air Act allowing suits against the EPA administrator for lax policing, Nolette said.

“With Paxton, however, he is working with U.S. DOJ to challenge Texas’s own laws. There are no statutes that allow, or even anticipate, this behavior,” he said.

Court tactics

Fresh off its success in dismantling the Texas Dream Act, the Trump administration moved swiftly to overturn a 71-year-old federal law banning nonprofits, including religious institutions, from endorsing political candidates.

The ban, known as the Johnson Amendment, did not specifically target religious groups, but, in the past three decades or so, evangelical churches that tend to align with the GOP have railed against it, saying it impermissibly muzzles their rights to free speech and exercise of religion.

In August 2024, the National Religious Broadcasters, the conservative group Intercessors for America, and two Texas churches — Sand Springs Church of Athens and First Baptist Church of Waskom, near the Louisiana line — sued in Tyler to overturn the Johnson Amendment’s strictures against secular nonprofits as well as churches.

On July 7, their case gained significant momentum when the Justice Department joined conservative lawyers for evangelical churches in filing a motion similar to the one used to end the Texas Dream Act. In both cases, the administration’s intervention set the stage for a consent judgment, an agreement reached between the plaintiffs and the defendants as part of a settlement submitted to the judge hearing the case.

In this instance, the Justice Department said the ban unconstitutionally prohibited nonprofit organizations from engaging in political speech and that religious leaders should be able to endorse political candidates from the pulpit. The proposed settlement of the suit, however, only applied to houses of worship.

Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the consent judgment proposed to U.S. District Judge J. Campbell “Cam” Barker in Tyler amounts to “improper collusion between … the Trump administration and some religious extremists to achieve a policy objective.” Her group supports keeping the Johnson Amendment.

Barker, a Trump appointee, is allowing interested people and groups to file amicus briefs in the case. So far, he has not adopted or rejected the agreement between the administration and the evangelical groups.

Trump, who has said he learned about the Johnson Amendment when he collected evangelical ministers’ blessings as he first ran for the White House in 2015, sought to end it through an executive order. His Capitol Hill allies also tried in 2017 to repeal the tax code’s constraint on churches’ political activity but failed to attract the 60 Senate votes needed to overcome a filibuster.

Holly Hollman, general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, which supports preservation of the Johnson Amendment, said that, if approved by Campbell, the consent order would amount to an end-run around Congress — and one defying most Americans’ wishes.

“The majority of Americans in poll after poll support the rule and don’t want nonprofits, including houses of worship, turned into just another partisan mechanism that divides communities,” Hollman said.

One of the leading Christian conservative lawyers trying to overturn the Johnson Amendment, Michael P. Farris, who represents the National Religious Broadcasters, pushed back on allegations of collusion.

“The answer to your question is pretty simple. This case was filed on August 28, 2024,” or before Trump reclaimed the presidency, he said. “We will not reply further,” said Farris, who played a key role in drafting Paxton’s bid to have the Supreme Court overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to The New York Times.

“We are answering no media questions until the judge rules,” he wrote in an email to ProPublica and the Tribune.

Trump’s work with state officials to reach his desired outcomes is unprecedented and dangerous, said Jim Harrington, retired founder of the Texas Civil Rights Project, a legal group that advocates for voting rights and racial and economic justice. Filing “collusive lawsuits,” such as the ones over in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants and revocation of tax-exempt status for churches that dabble in politics, and carefully selecting courts where the judges are likely to be sympathetic, lets Trump evade constraints created by the framers of the U.S. Constitution, Harrington said.

The administration’s tactics are a quick way to get around recalcitrant lawmakers but risk undermining the judiciary’s role as an independent branch of government, he said.

“Even conservative judges should raise their eyebrows about the undermining of the integrity of the judicial system that’s going on,” said Harrington, who has taught for 27 years as an adjunct law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “This is a really serious attack on our system.”

Race-Based Debates

Legal challenges to Texas’ new map have previously taken years to resolve, raising uncertainty over whether Saturday’s lawsuit will be decided before next year’s midterm election.

A decision will hinge, in part, on how the courts view an assertion by the Trump administration that the congressional map passed by the Legislature four years ago, and defended by GOP lawyers in court as race-neutral, suddenly must be changed because it paid too much attention to race.

Michael Li, senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit public policy institute that works on election- and democracy-related issues, said that the administration’s reasoning is flawed and that both the 2021 map and the new one discriminate against nonwhite voters.

The 2021 map drew intense criticism for its dispersal of nonwhite groups into districts where they’d have less influence. Dramatic gains among Texas’ Hispanic, Black and Asian American communities accounted for 95% of the state’s population growth. But lawmakers drew a map where 23 of the 38 congressional districts had white majorities, even though in the 2020 census, white and Hispanic Texans constituted roughly equal shares of the total population.

To reduce the threat to suburban GOP U.S. House members, diverse neighborhoods in Dallas and Collin counties were removed from districts that were becoming more favorable for Democrats and attached to sprawling rural districts dominated by white Republican voters.

“I’ve stated it, and I’ll state it again — we drew these maps race blind,” said the state Senate’s point person on redistricting at the time, Houston Republican Joan Huffman, who did not respond to a request for comment. “We have not looked at any racial data as we drew these maps, and to this day I have not looked at any racial data.”

During a four-week federal court trial in El Paso that ended last month, Texas officials denied practicing racial discrimination. The three judges hearing the case have delayed issuing a decision, citing the special session in Austin.

In their July 7 letter to Abbott, however, Justice Department lawyers Harmeet Dhillon and Michael Gates warned Texas to change its U.S. House map, which they said was overly biased in favor of creating districts that members of racial minorities could win.

Texas’ 2021 map for U.S. House districts has four suspect “coalition districts,” they wrote, citing three districts near Houston and one in Dallas-Fort Worth where Black and Hispanic voters combine to form a majority. In recent years, all four have been represented by Black or Hispanic Democrats.

Neither Abbott spokesperson Mahaleris, nor Baldassarre, the Justice Department spokesperson, responded to questions.

The Brennan Center’s Li disputed Dhillon and Gates’ characterization of recent rulings by federal judges. Courts haven’t forbidden states from drawing minority-coalition districts but merely stated that the Voting Rights Act doesn’t require states to proactively create them, he said.

“Given that Texas has consistently said it didn’t consider race at all in 2021, there’s certainly not a case for dismantling any of these districts.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/Donald-Trump-Greg-Abbott-1326336246.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:57:31.592691

‘The whole scheme stinks’ Without parliamentary oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda’s Parliament.
The agreement, some Ugandans said, makes sense only as a matter of “economic expediency” for the Ugandan government.
For Museveni, the deal with the US to accept deportees is desirable “for political and perhaps economic reasons”, said Marlon Agaba, the head of a leading anticorruption group in Uganda.
The deal eases pressure on Museveni and may come with trade opportunities, said Agaba, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda.","Ugandans have criticised an agreement with United States President Donald Trump’s administration to receive deportees from the US, questioning the lack of approval from the East African country’s parliament and suggesting the deal is a means to ease political pressure on President Yoweri Museveni.

After facing sanctions from Washington that have targeted many government officials, including the parliamentary speaker, “Museveni will be happy” to transact with the US, said Ibrahim Ssemujju, a lawmaker who is a prominent opposition figure. “He will be asking, ‘When are you bringing them?'”

Ugandan officials have released few details about the agreement although they have stated that they prefer to take deportees of African origin and do not want people with criminal records.

However, the country is being pushed as a deportation location for high-profile detainee Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man and an El Salvador native charged with human smuggling.

Abrego Garcia has become the face of Trump’s hardline anti-immigration policies. He has an American wife and children, has lived in the US state of Maryland for years and has been under protected legal status since 2019 when a judge ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador because he could be harmed in his home country.

He was detained on Monday by immigration officials in Baltimore. The US Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Abrego Garcia “is being processed for removal to Uganda”.

He already has been deported as one of more than 200 people the Trump administration sent this year to El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison as part of Trump’s crackdown on refugees, immigrants and asylum seekers in the US. His case remains a major flashpoint for the Trump administration in its anti-immigration crackdown. Department of Justice lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran citizen had been wrongly deported due to an “administrative error”.

Abrego Garcia was severely beaten and subjected to psychological torture in the El Salvador prison, his lawyers say.

‘The whole scheme stinks’

Without parliamentary oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda’s Parliament.

He said the agreement with the US left him “a little perplexed” because Uganda is struggling to look after refugees fleeing conflicts in neighbouring countries, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.

The agreement, some Ugandans said, makes sense only as a matter of “economic expediency” for the Ugandan government. But it remains unclear precisely what Ugandan authorities are getting in return for accepting deportees. Analysts speculated that Uganda is seeking better trade deals and wants to be in Trump’s good books.

Okello Oryem, the deputy minister in charge of international relations, told The Associated Press news agency that such a deal was “complete rubbish”. He made the comments a day before his permanent secretary confirmed an agreement was in place to accept individuals who are “reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin”.

Negotiators for Uganda are believed to have been reporting directly to Museveni, who has been in power in the country for four decades and who, human rights groups said, oversees a government that conducts unlawful killings, arrests of opposition members and attacks on journalists.

For much of his time in power, Museveni was widely seen as a strong US ally, especially for his support of counterterrorism operations in Somalia when he deployed troops there to fight the al-Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab.

But his stock in Washington has seen steep falls in recent years. Former President Joe Biden’s administration piled pressure on his government over corruption, LGBTQ rights concerns and other rights abuses, and a growing list of Ugandan officials faced sanctions.

Uganda’s LGBTQ community is facing intensified persecution after the enactment of a harsh anti-gay law two years ago, according to a report released in May by Human Rights Watch, which said Ugandan authorities have “perpetrated widespread discrimination and violence” and “spread misinformation and hatred against LGBT people” since the 2023 law was enacted.

In addition to Speaker Anita Among, a key ally of Museveni’s, Ugandan officials sanctioned by the US include the current prisons chief, a former police chief, a former deputy army commander and former government ministers.

For Museveni, the deal with the US to accept deportees is desirable “for political and perhaps economic reasons”, said Marlon Agaba, the head of a leading anticorruption group in Uganda.

The deal eases pressure on Museveni and may come with trade opportunities, said Agaba, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Coalition Uganda.

While the suit was filed in federal district court in Maryland, Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court in Roanoke, Virginia, was assigned to preside over the case.","Washington — A federal judge on Tuesday threw out the Trump administration's challenge to a standing order issued by a U.S. district court in Maryland that bars federal immigration officials from immediately removing migrants who are challenging the legality of their detentions.

The decision from U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen came in a novel and unprecedented lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against all 15 judges on the Maryland court in June. The Justice Department had argued that the standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell in May was unlawful and outside the authority of the court.

The judges, represented by Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, sought to dismiss the lawsuit. They argued that the suit presented a dispute between two co-equal branches of government that could not be decided by the courts.

In a 37-page decision, Cullen agreed with the judges in finding that the Trump administration's challenge should be dismissed because, in part, the U.S. does not have the legal right to sue and the judges are absolute immune from the suit.

""Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,"" he wrote. ""The Executive's lawsuit will be dismissed, and its motion for preliminary injunction denied as moot. Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.""

Cullen said that if the Trump administration ""truly believes"" that the standing orders violate the law, it should pursue the paths laid out by Congress.

""Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss,"" he wrote. ""To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.""

While the suit was filed in federal district court in Maryland, Cullen, who was appointed by President Trump to serve on the U.S. district court in Roanoke, Virginia, was assigned to preside over the case.

Cullen's ruling was not a surprise. In a hearing earlier this month in Maryland, the judge previewed his decision, telling Justice Department attorneys that the ""far less destructive"" move by the Justice Department would be to appeal the standing order in one of the cases where it had been issued, rather than sue another branch of the government to ""accomplish its institutional interests.""

He echoed that position in his decision, writing that ""under normal circumstances,"" it would not be a surprise if the government raised its concerns about the legality of the standing order through the mechanisms laid out by Congress.

""But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times — at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,"" Cullen wrote. ""It's no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue — and in a big way.""

In a footnote in his decision, Cullen criticized the Trump administration's repeated attacks on members of the federal judiciary who have ruled against the president's agenda.

""Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,"" Cullen wrote.

The standing order issued by Russell earlier this year prevents federal immigration officials from removing or altering the legal status of any migrant detainee who filed a habeas corpus petition for two business days.

The court adopted the order to address the rise in migrants in Maryland who were at risk of imminent deportation from the U.S. and sought review of their detentions. Signed by Russell, the chief judge, the order states that it aims to ""preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction"" of the Maryland district court over pending matters, ensure immigrant petitioners can participate in court proceedings and have access to legal counsel, and guarantee the government has a ""fulsome opportunity"" to present its defense.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/26/758f29a3-6d56-4d06-a74c-9c8b6cb9f834/thumbnail/1200x630/8eecd716cdbacf7071ff35308d89c674/gettyimages-2231378443.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:32.000942

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen of Roanoke, Va., had been specially tapped to oversee the case, after DOJ named all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland as defendants in the civil lawsuit.

The Trump administration says the Maryland court exceeded its authority and violated the law when it imposed a temporary, 48-hour freeze on deportations for any migrant who filed a petition challenging their detention.

""Like other government officials, judges sometimes violate the law,"" the Department of Justice wrote. ""This case involves an extraordinary form of judicial interference in Executive prerogatives.""

But Cullen dismissed that argument, arguing the Department of Justice would normally have appealed specific decisions in specific cases, or petitioned the judicial council to change the local rules in Maryland if it didn't like them.

""But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times—at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government. It's no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely,"" by choosing to sue, Cullen wrote in his opinion.

He said he was dismissing the case because it's a dispute between the judiciary and the executive that can't be litigated in this way in a district court, by suing all the judges.

""To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,"" he wrote.

Supreme Court advocate Paul Clement defends

In normal cases, the Justice Department defends judges when they are sued. But because it was DOJ doing the suing, the judges enlisted prominent Supreme Court advocate Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush years.

""The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,"" Clement said at a recent court hearing. ""There really is no precursor for this suit.""

The judges also received backing in the form of friend of the court briefs from the Maryland State Bar Association, dozens of law firms and 11 retired federal judges. Other former jurists affiliated with the nonprofit Keep Our Republic's Article III Project also spoke out for the judicial defendants.

""It was a sensible step. It's something courts do all the time,"" said Philip Pro, a retired federal judge from Nevada who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who normally sits in Virginia but was assigned the case because the Maryland judges could not participate, wrote in the ruling that filing suit against the judges was not the correct avenue with which to challenge the order.

At issue was a standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell on May 21 and updated a week later that described how federal judges in Maryland should handle cases involving immigrants facing an imminent risk of deportation. The order imposes a temporary stay of deportation for two business days while a case is considered.

The Justice Department sued, saying Russell had no authority to issue such a blanket order that effectively acts as a broad injunction against government actions without any assessment of whether the individual immigrants have valid cases.

But Cullen, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, concluded that the administration would have to find another way to challenge the order instead of taking the unusual and confrontational approach of suing the judges directly.

“Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,"" he wrote.

""Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,” he added.

Russell’s order was issued amid a flurry of Trump administration actions seeking to expedite deportations, sometimes without people being given the opportunity to challenge the decision.

One of the most high-profile cases in the country, involving a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported back to his native country, arose in Maryland.

Cullen wrote in Tuesday's ruling that, among other things, the administration lacked legal standing to sue and the judges are immune from such a lawsuit.

He did not address the substantive question of whether Russell had authority to issue the standing order.

The ruling is in line with comments Cullen made when he heard a hearing in the case in Baltimore on Aug. 13.

Deportation officers within a unit called Enforcement and Removal Operations are the ones who are responsible for immigration enforcement. They find and remove people from the United States who aren’t American citizens and, for a variety of reasons, no longer can stay in the country.

Some might have gone through immigration court and a judge ordered them removed. Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they’ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.

Overall, its activities — and how it carries them out — have polarized many Americans in recent months.

After years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.

Last week, the Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency’s top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.

It’s surging hiring

ICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year’s end.

The agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications — many from former officers.

New recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Ga. That’s a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers — not just ICE agents — from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.

Caleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he’s been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they’re assigned.

It’s preparing for conflict

As Trump’s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.

Vitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency’s data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.

Lyons said that after recent operations in Los Angeles turned violent, ICE is making gas masks and helmets standard issue for new agents. “Right now we’re seeing and we’re having to adapt to all different scenarios that we were never trained for in the past,” he said.

Lyons says the agency is also starting to send out security teams to accompany agents making arrests: “We’re not gonna allow people to throw rocks anymore, because we’re going to have our own agents and officers there to protect the ones that are actually out there making that arrest.”

It’s beefing up specialized units for high-risk situations

About eight deportation officers with military-style camouflage uniforms, helmets and an assortment of weapons stand outside a house yelling, “Police! We have a warrant!” before entering and clearing the house.

They are members of a Special Response Team taking part in a demonstration at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. These officers are like a SWAT team — deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations. They also accompany detainees the agency deems dangerous when they are deported.

“Everybody is trained to serve a warrant,” Vitello said. “These guys are trained to serve high-risk warrants.”

There are roughly 450 deportation officers with the special training to serve on these teams, and Lyons says they have been deployed to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., and Washington.

He said he’d like to have more such units but wouldn’t put an exact number on how many. Vitello said they’re also in the process of getting more specially armored vehicles.

It’s teaching whom agents can arrest, and when

New recruits to ICE receive training on immigration law and the 4th Amendment, which protects against unlawful searches. Longtime officers get regular refreshers on these topics.

In limited situations, ICE agents are allowed to enter someone’s home. Generally, when they’re seeking someone they’re trying to remove from the country, they have an administrative warrant as opposed to a criminal warrant. That administrative warrant doesn’t allow them to enter the house without first getting permission.

Vitello says the new recruits are taught about the different warrants and how the rules differ. And they’re taught that those who allowed ICE to enter their house can change their mind.

“If somebody says, ‘Get out,’ and you don’t have your target, you have to leave,” he said.

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.

The 4th Amendment doesn’t extend to someone’s vehicle, so Vitello said deportation officers do have the authority to arrest someone in a car or truck. Vitello said in the rare case where a target was in a motor home, officers would talk to the agency’s lawyers first to figure out what protections apply.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c239083/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+351/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcf%2F57%2Fcf4b59fa434f94a8cb10f38e8127%2F9657ceed9b5041019388433ea578a4f2.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 12:58:07.999264

US District Judge Thomas Cullen, who President Donald Trump appointed during his first term, said Tuesday past rulings lead to the conclusion that he has no choice but to dismiss the case.

“To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote.

He also said the lawsuit is “not ordinary” and that the executive branch must find other paths to raise its concerns with the standing order. He said the courts and the executive branch are each part of the sovereign US government.

“Regrettably, this lawsuit effectively pits two of those branches against one another,” Cullen wrote. “But it is important to remember that, at bottom, all branches—and the public officials who serve in them—share the same core sovereign interest: To support and defend the Constitution.”

A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t immediately return a request for comment.

Deportation Fights

The Trump administration filed the suit in June against the court over a standing order that blocked for two business days the deportations of detained persons who filed habeas petitions.

The order was issued amid the administration’s crackdown on immigration enforcement, and a Maryland US district judge’s handling of a lawsuit from a wrongly deported Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

The administration initially said it couldn’t return Garcia after he was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, despite an earlier immigration court ruling against his removal. But he was brought back to the United States to face federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee, which he’s pleaded not guilty to. Abrego Garcia was again taken into custody by immigration officials on Monday, and is seeking to block any deportation.

Cullen said he can “appreciate” the administration’s concern that the Maryland court “encroached on its duty to police core matters of immigration.”

But he said a dispute between the judiciary should be “resolved within the constitutional structure and with due respect for the Judiciary’s co-equal standing with the executive branch,” and that he has to first ensure he has the constitutional authority to preside over the lawsuit. “In so doing, the court’s allegiance is to the Constitution,” Cullen wrote.

Judicial Immunity

Cullen found the administration lacked standing to bring the suit, saying that Supreme Court case law prevented him from issuing an injunction against a judge.

He also said the district court has sovereign immunity from the case, and that the individual judges and court officials named in the litigation have judicial immunity because it was tied to an act done in their “judicial function.”

Cullen further found there was no cause of action that allowed him to hear the lawsuit between the two branches, “and this court will not be the first to create one.”

He said the administration could’ve challenged the standing order at the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, or by petitioning the Fourth Circuit’s Judicial Council.

“The Executive acknowledges these routes are available, but it claims it chose an interbranch lawsuit because those routes are inconvenient,” Cullen wrote. “This purported inconvenience does not warrant the judicial branch’s infringement on the legislative branch’s prerogative of deciding the scope of cases federal courts may review.”

‘Not Normal Times’

The unprecedented litigation came as the administration has assailed judges who’ve ruled against its policies, with Trump even calling for impeachment and some House Republican allies filing articles of impeachment against some jurists. Chief Justice John Roberts and other top federal judges have pushed back against the use of impeachment as a response to unfavorable court rulings.

Cullen referenced the harsh rhetoric in his opinion, saying the “concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.”

He said that typically, the administration could’ve raised its challenged under other options laid out by Congress.

“But as events over the past several months have revealed, these are not normal times—at least regarding the interplay between the Executive and this coordinate branch of government,” Cullen wrote, referring to the courts. “It’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely. Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/0e9cbce/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F3a%2Fd4feebac4c4bb995f95b5fb23ec3%2Fjustice-sarah-silbiger.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:58:32.763291

Ibarra, Kristen Hwang, Kristen Hwang Health",,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/08/immigration-hospitals-workers-fear/,"Specifically, they’re worried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.
One particular incident at a Southern California surgery center stands out, in conversation with health workers.
“What I hope is it doesn’t have a chilling effect on other health care workers.” Workers say additional training can help Around the state, health workers say they’d like to see management provide additional guidance on how to respond to such scenarios if they were to play out in their workplace.
“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said.
“Normally, health care workers have no reason to fear law enforcement,” he added, “but we’re in uncharted territory.”","Federal immigration agents are more routinely showing up at California medical facilities as the Trump administration ramps up deportations.

They may come to the emergency room, bringing in someone who’s suffering a medical crisis while being detained. They may wait in the lobby, as agents did for two weeks at an L.A.-area hospital waiting for a woman to be discharged. Or they may even chase people inside, as federal agents did at a Southern California surgical center.

The sight of these agents — often armed and with covered faces — makes many wary and may keep people from seeking care.

Existing hospital policies guide operations when law enforcement brings in a person under arrest, hospital officials say.

“This is nothing new to hospitals,” said Lois Richardson, vice president and counsel at the California Hospital Association. “We get inmates, detainees, arrestees all the time, whether it’s police, sheriff, highway patrol, ICE, whatever it is.” The job for hospital workers remains to provide care, she added, and not to get involved in disputes over why a person is in custody.

Yet immigration attorneys, advocates and health workers have expressed concerns over the handling of some of these cases, both by immigration officers and by some administrators at medical facilities.

Specifically, they’re worried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.

“We have a level of privacy that we owe to patients and their families, and that has just been completely demolished with all of the involvement of ICE coming into hospitals,” said Kate Mobeen, an ICU nurse at John Muir Medical Center in Concord. “It creates just a huge sense of fear, not only in our patient population, but in our employee population and our nurses.”

Patients’ rights, policies face new tests

Sometimes when ICE has shown up at medical facilities with a detained patient, the result has been conflicting messaging about the rules.

On July 29, ICE agents took a man to John Muir Medical Center in Concord because he suffered an unspecified medical emergency while being detained outside the Concord immigration court, according to Ali Saidi, an attorney and the director of Stand Together Contra Costa, a local rapid response and legal services organization.

When Saidi arrived at the hospital as part of the response network, he said hospital staff told him that he was not allowed to see the detained patient, but that the man’s family would be allowed. Then, when the man’s wife arrived, “The rules had somehow changed, and they said no family visit,” Saidi said.

In a statement shared by the Contra Costa Immigrants Rights Alliance, the detained man’s wife, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, Maria, said that when she later talked to her husband, he told her that he was so terrified that he passed out.

“My family and I went to the emergency room and we asked to see him and talk to him to make sure he was okay,” Maria said, in the statement. “The hospital staff would not let us see him and they would not give us any information about what was happening to him. They wouldn’t even answer my questions.”

John Muir officials would not comment on the incident, citing privacy laws. But in an email, Ben Drew, a spokesperson for the hospital, said general policy is that “If a law enforcement agency indicates that visitation presents a safety or security concern, [the hospital] may limit or deny visitation to protect our patients, staff, and visitors.”

Saidi said that when the wife insisted on getting information about the man’s condition, hospital security called the police.

“We understand that emotions are high whenever a family member or friend is in the emergency department or hospital,” said Drew. “The hospital only involves local police in circumstances when a patient or visitor’s behavior becomes abusive, disruptive, or threatening, and cannot be resolved through our own security team.”

Saidi denied that the family was being disruptive, saying that conversations with hospital staff and administration were respectful and no voices were raised.

“The atmosphere in that emergency bay was something like I’ve never seen before in my career,” Saidi said. “There was a chilling effect. Everyone was averting their eyes. You could tell the staff felt bad.”

Multiple emergency department nurses told Mobeen, a local California Nurses Association leader at John Muir, that ICE officers were “very aggressive with staff” and staff were afterwards “emotionally and physically upset” by what happened, she said.

“It’s horrifying to not be able to tell patients’ family members how they are, what their status is,” Mobeen said.

Part of the issue, Mobeen added, is training. Staff were not given adequate training on how to respond to any kind of immigration enforcement action that may occur at the hospital, she said.

Drew, the spokesman for John Muir, countered that the hospital has given guidance on its longstanding law enforcement policy and answered multiple questions since January about what to do if ICE agents show up at their facilities.

Limits for ICE access, sometimes murky

Last month, immigration agents occupied the lobby of Dignity Health’s Glendale Memorial Hospital, even standing behind reception desks, as photos that circulated online showed. Protestors gathered outside the hospital hosting rallies and press conferences.

They were all there because agents had previously brought in Milagro Solis-Portillo, an immigrant from El Salvador, for medical care following her detention. They spent 15 days in the hospital waiting for Solis-Portillo’s discharge before transferring her to another hospital and then taking her into custody, according to local news reports.

In a statement, officials from Dignity Memorial Hospital said they could not legally prohibit law enforcement from being in public areas.

That’s true, say legal experts: Waiting rooms and lobbies are considered public spaces in hospitals. But agents cannot move through hospitals without limits. Law enforcement officials are not allowed to search for people in exam rooms or other private spaces without a federal court warrant.

When agents bring in someone who is in their custody and needs medical care, the application of the law can be more murky.

According to Richardson at the hospital association, how far an agent can go into treatment areas with a detained patient may be decided on a case by case basis. In cases where a detained patient is struggling or resisting, that patient may need guarding, she explained.

And if law enforcement officers do go inside exam rooms, they may hear medical information while on guard. But that isn’t necessarily a privacy violation, according to federal rules. The HIPPA Privacy Rule, the law that sets privacy standards for medical information, has a provision that allows for “incidental disclosures” of information as long as “reasonable safeguards” are applied.

“The hospital will, and the doctor will make reasonable attempts to protect the patient’s privacy.” “What is reasonable is going to depend, again, on what’s wrong with the patient, how the patient is behaving, the nature of the circumstances,” Richardson said.

HIPAA protects the disclosure of medical records, which include names, addresses and social security numbers along with health conditions. State law also requires health facilities to protect this information. According to guidance from the attorney general’s office, health facilities should consider a patient’s immigration status confidential.

At the same time, some disclosures are required if law enforcement can prove lawful custody or show an appropriate warrant. A federal court warrant signed by a judge grants law enforcement immediate access to information or to search a particular area, while an ICE administrative warrant does not require immediate compliance.

Health workers in ‘precarious’ situations

Health facilities generally direct frontline workers not to engage with immigration agents, but rather to immediately contact security or management.

One particular incident at a Southern California surgery center stands out, in conversation with health workers.

On July 8, federal agents targeted three landscapers who had parked outside of the Ontario Advanced Surgical Center. They chased one of the men inside on foot, according to a felony criminal complaint filed against two health care workers in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

In videos of the incident posted online, a masked agent wearing a vest labeled “POLICE ICE” on the back holds a weeping man by the shoulder inside the center while several workers in scrubs stand by. At multiple points in the video workers ask the officer for identification; one worker says, “this is a private business.”

Two workers, Danielle Davila and Jose Ortega, tell the officer to leave. Davila moves between the officer and the man, saying “Get your hands off of him. You don’t even have a warrant.”

Ortega puts an arm between Davila and the officer and says “You have no proper identification.”

The officer says to both workers “You touched a federal agent.” Then Davila responds, “I’m not touching you.”

Davila and Ortega were later charged with two felony counts of assaulting a federal officer and conspiring to prevent a federal officer from performing their duties.

Last week the felony charges were dismissed and both Davila and Ortega pleaded not guilty to a subsequent misdemeanor assault charge. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment on the charges.

Davila’s defense attorney Oliver Cleary said his client believed she was doing the right thing by asking for credentials and a warrant.

“You can’t just come in where people are getting medical care and whisk them away,” Cleary said. “She didn’t know who these people were. They didn’t tell her who they were, and as far as she knew this was a patient of the clinic.”

Carlos Juárez, Ortega’s defense attorney, said arresting and charging health workers with crimes for asking to see a warrant and identification puts them in a “precarious” and “dangerous situation.”

“They did what they needed to do and what they had a right to do,” Juárez said. “What I hope is it doesn’t have a chilling effect on other health care workers.”

Workers say additional training can help

Around the state, health workers say they’d like to see management provide additional guidance on how to respond to such scenarios if they were to play out in their workplace. Some workers are providing training themselves.

Adriana Rugeles-Ortiz, a licensed vocational nurse at Kaiser Permanente Modesto Medical Center, has been leading “Know Your Rights” sessions at her hospital and in her community as part of her union, SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. She said some of her coworkers have expressed anxiety over some of the situations they’ve seen play out in other hospitals.

“Because of my involvement with all the training that we have done to the workers and to the community, personally, I do feel prepared. I am not that confident that we have been able to reach the entire workforce within Kaiser to get them to the level of confidence to deal with it,” Rugeles-Ortiz said.

Dr. Douglas Yoshida, an emergency room physician at Stanford Health Tri-Valley in Alameda County, said additional guidance and training for workers at medical facilities could be of great value.

“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said. “I mean, personally, if someone comes in in ICE custody, within the limits of the law, I want to do everything I can to help [patients.]”

The hospital in Pleasanton that Yoshida works in is located near the county’s Santa Rita Jail; staff, he said, have been used to a law enforcement presence. But the recent incident at John Muir Medical Center, about 30 miles north, as well as the criminal charges filed against the southern California surgery center workers have set people on edge, Yoshida said.

“Normally, health care workers have no reason to fear law enforcement,” he added, “but we’re in uncharted territory.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/071725-Dignity-Health-Glendale-Memorial-Hospital-ICE-CM-01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1334&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:53.704446

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen granted a request by the judges to toss the case, saying to do otherwise “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.”

“In their wisdom, the Constitution’s framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign,” Cullen wrote. “That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another’s authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary’s constitutional role.”

The White House had no immediate comment.

Cullen was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020. He serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the case because all 15 of Maryland’s federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s harsh response to judges who slow or stop its policies.

Cullen expressed skepticism of the lawsuit during a hearing in August. He questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue all the judges as a means of challenging the order.

Signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III, the order prevents the Trump administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in Maryland district court. It blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The order says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.”

The Justice Department, which filed the suit in June, says the automatic pause violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president’s authority to enforce immigration laws. The department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking Trump’s agenda, repeatedly accusing federal judges of improperly impeding his powers.

The lawsuit was an extraordinary legal maneuver, ratcheting up the administration’s fight with the federal judiciary.

Attorneys for the Maryland judges argued the lawsuit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” attorney Paul Clement said during the hearing. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement is a prominent conservative lawyer who served as solicitor general under Republican President George W. Bush. He listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges said the government was simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

In an amended order pausing deportations, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

Attorneys for the Trump administration accused the Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, writing in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the Trump administration in March illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oFIHW1TJliPkJhnOVNf4vg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/0f1009d0a04b564e61e7dc8c020bca9c,N,,2025-08-26 11:58:39.731788

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit to fight those removal efforts until a court has heard his claim for protection, stating that the U.S. could place him in a country where “his safety cannot be assured.”

The new lawsuit triggered a blanket court order that automatically pauses deportation efforts for two days. The order applies to immigrants in Maryland who are challenging their detention.

Crowd yells ‘shame!’

Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national, spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

“This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Roughly 200 people gathered and prayed before the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore. Some held signs with messages such as “Stop Detaining Our Neighbors” and “Free Kilmar.”

With Abrego Garcia and his wife standing before them, the crowd spoke in unison: “The people united will never be defeated.”

The crowd waited outside after Abrego Garcia entered the federal building. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him after his detainment, the crowd yelled “Shame!”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office that Abrego Garcia “will no longer terrorize our country.”

But Abrego Garcia’s lead immigration attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said lawyers will fight the administration’s removal attempts.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

What’s next?

Sandoval-Moshenberg told reporters Monday afternoon that Abrego Garcia’s lawyers don’t know when he will have a reasonable fear interview, where he should be able to express his fear of persecution or torture in the country where the U.S. wants to send him. Officials have said it’s Uganda.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have raised concerns about human-rights abuses in Uganda as well as his limited English-speaking skills in a country where the national language is English. But there are also unanswered questions about whether he could be imprisoned or sent on to El Salvador. A judge blocked the U.S. from sending Abrego Garcia back in 2019 because he faces credible threats from gangs there.

Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

“We don’t know whether Uganda will even let him walk around freely in Kampala or whether he’ll be inside of a Ugandan jail cell, much less whether they are going to let him stay,” the attorney said.

If immigration officials determine that Abrego Garcia lacks a reasonable fear of being sent to Uganda, he should be able to ask a U.S. immigration judge to review that decision, Sandoval-Moshenberg said. And if the immigration judge upholds the determination, Abrego Garcia should be able to bring it to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

Sandoval-Moshenberg said that’s the process when someone is slated for deportation to their native country. And he said it should be for third-country deportations as well.

“We don’t even know if the government agrees with that,” he said. “This is all so very new and unprecedented. … We will see what the government’s position on that is.”

Sandoval-Moshenberg also said Abrego Garcia informed ICE over the weekend that Costa Rica was an acceptable country of removal because he had “received assurances from Costa Rica that they would give him refugee status, that he would be at liberty in that country, and that he will not be re-deported onto El Salvador.”

The notice to ICE was separate from the criminal case in which Abrego Garcia declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

“Costa Rica is not justice,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “It is an acceptably less-bad option.”

Reunion with family

Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee and returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

‘Hold Abrego Garcia accountable’

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

“Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,” Gilmartin said.

The U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, calling it an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/2025-08-25T135314Z_1484710839_RC2CEGAK45I7_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MIGRATION-ABREGO-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:57:57.122542

Today's top stories

Immigration authorities yesterday morning took Kilmar Abrego Garcia into federal custody, where he is waiting to find out how long he will remain in the U.S. The Maryland man was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and later returned to the U.S. The U.S. government now says it will deport Abrego Garcia again — this time to Uganda. In yesterday's court hearing, federal Judge Paula Xinis said it is ""absolutely forbidden"" to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. without giving him the chance to challenge the deportation in court.

🎧 Abrego Garcia's detention has been one of the first high-profile immigration cases of the Trump administration's crackdown, NPR's Jasmine Garsd tells Up First. At the core of his case are questions about due process for undocumented immigrants. Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. from El Salvador illegally in 2011 to escape gang death threats. He has not been convicted of any crimes since coming to the U.S., but the Trump administration accuses him of being a member of the MS-13 gang. He has denied this claim. In 2019, an immigration court ruled that he couldn't be deported back to El Salvador.

President Trump took steps to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook yesterday. This action marks the latest escalation in his efforts to exert control over the central bank, which he has been pressuring to lower interest rates for months. The Federal Reserve is meant to operate independently from political influence by the White House, so Trump's decision may face legal challenges. Bill Pulte, who oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, accused Cook of making false statements on a mortgage application in 2021, before she joined the Fed.

🎧 Pulte says that Cook applied for home loans on two properties just weeks apart, in two different states, stating that each home would be her primary residence. NPR's Scott Horsley says that this would lead to more favorable loan terms. Trump expressed that he does not have confidence in Cook's integrity, and that was cause to remove her. Cook says the president doesn't have the authority to fire her, and she will continue to carry out her duties as Fed governor. If Trump succeeds in ousting Cook, it would create a vacancy that he could fill with someone more aligned with his interests.

The president is vowing to punish Washington, D.C., and other locations across the country for abolishing cash bail. Washington hasn't had cash bail since 1992. The driving force behind the decision was that cash bail disproportionately affects poor Black people who are stuck in jail until trial. Trump's announcement comes as he looks to expand his weekslong military intervention in the nation's capital. He also expressed his hope to expand the National Guard's role in policing.

🎧 Trump says that the bail system has let murderers easily walk free. This is extremely rare, as just 4% of all people released before trial last year in the nation's capital were accused of violent crimes, says Alex Koma of NPR network station WAMU. Many people in Washington doubt that what Trump wants to do is legal, and only Congress can overturn D.C. laws. Local leaders are on edge due to the president's ongoing meddling in the city's affairs. Trump has expressed that he wants to train a special National Guard unit dedicated to public safety in D.C. He has command of the guard in the capital, because it is not a state.

Living better

Living Better is a special series about what it takes to stay healthy in America.

Wearing sunscreen is essential health advice, but many standard sprays and creams miss an important benefit. Over the last decade, more research has focused on hyperpigmentation and melasma. Though ultraviolet radiation doesn't solely cause these conditions, evidence shows that radiation from visible light, which penetrates the skin more deeply than UV rays, can contribute to them. Tinted sunscreens, which contain pigments to match a range of skin tones, block visible light radiation. According to research published in the journal Photodermatology, Photoimmunology & Photomedicine, tinted sunscreens provide better protection against damage from visible light compared to non-tinted products. Here's what to look for on the label.

☀️ The number one ingredient in visible light protection is the chemical compound iron oxide. It provides tinted sunscreen with its color, and is commonly used to lend a skin-toned hue to concealer and foundation.

☀️ A concentration of around 3% iron oxide in sunscreen likely provides the best protection, says Dr. Jenna Lester, associate professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco. She notes that sunscreens that are white or off-white in color likely don't contain sufficient levels of the compound.

☀️ Tinted titanium dioxide does a good job of scattering visible light. Additionally, antioxidants such as vitamin C may help protect against visible light.

☀️ If you cannot find a tinted sunscreen in a shade you like, consider using a foundation with iron oxide, and apply non-tinted sunscreen under it.

Earlier this month, two 15-year-olds in Washington, D.C., were arrested for beating up a man in what is said to have been an attempted carjacking. He was not just any man, but a member of a high-profile Trump initiative. Infuriated, the president lashed out at the city's Democratic leaders.

But because D.C. has an unusual relationship with the federal government, he could do more than complain. And he did: He took over the city's police department (at least temporarily), redeployed federal agents and brought in National Guard troops. Former Fox News personality and current U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro, whose office prosecutes adults charged with serious crimes, complained that more kids — or ""young punks"" as she put it — need to be prosecuted for more crimes at younger ages, even as young as 14.

I've seen this movie before — in fact, I've made this movie before. I was part of a team that reported and produced a documentary on juvenile justice for the PBS series FRONTLINE that first aired in January 2001. That was a time when more and more states were moving juvenile offenders into adult systems. The thing is, then and now, that this happened at a time when crime rates, including among youth, were actually falling … but stats aren't driving this train. There is something about kids who do serious crime that just hits differently.

I can tell you from personal experience that when you see these kids in a lockup, no matter how tatted up or hard they try to look, they look like kids — kids who should be worrying about acne, prom and their SATs, not guns, jacking cars and stickups. The question then, as now, is what should happen when they have gotten into that life? What are we actually trying to accomplish? To get them on the right track or just get them out of sight? Then, as now, it seems we still haven't decided.

The 30-year-old El Salvador native is facing the possibility of being deported to Uganda after he was detained by immigration officials in Baltimore on Monday.

The Department of Homeland Security shared a video of him shuffling through the ICE Field Office in the moments after he was detained.

“He doesn’t belong here. He won’t be staying here. America is a safer nation without this MS-13 Gangbanger in it. Good riddance,” DHS wrote alongside the footage.

The clip quickly exploded online after Abrego Garcia, who was released from a Tennessee jail last week as he awaits trial on human smuggling charges, uttered “it’s a corrupt government” as an ICE agent led him away.

“Kilmar is nothing but a petulant child,” one person reacted on X.

Others were quick to point out the “absolute irony” of him slamming the Trump administration.

“So corrupt he still wants to stay here,” one X user wrote.

“He has the gall to mutter ‘corrupt govt.’ Criminals don’t get to call anyone else corrupt,” another raged.

Abrego Garcia’s arrest comes after the Trump administration mistakenly shipped him off to his native El Salvador back in June.

He was subsequently brought back to face criminal charges of transporting migrants living in the US illegally, tied to a 2022 traffic stop during which the construction worker was pulled over on a Tennessee highway with eight passengers in the car, but no luggage.

Abrego Garcia, who has insisted he’s not a gangbanger, has pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on bond last Friday.

His lawyers have claimed US officials offered to send him to Costa Rica in exchange for a guilty plea – or risk being deported to Uganda.

“They’re holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick,” his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “They’re weaponizing the immigration system in a way that’s completely unconstitutional.”

The feds detained him again at the ICE office in Baltimore after reporting for a scheduled interview on Monday.

He has since been sent to a detention facility in Virginia.

“Today, ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and are processing him for deportation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.

“President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer.”

His lawyers quickly filed a lawsuit seeking an order for him not to be deported anywhere unless he has had the chance to contest being sent there.

During a court hearing on Monday afternoon, US District Judge Paula Xinis said she planned to hold additional court proceedings on the administration’s plan to deport him to Uganda.

The judge barred the government from removing him until such a hearing could be held.

If deported, Sandoval-Moshenberg has argued they need assurances that Abrego Garcia won’t be sent back to El Salvador amid fears of persecution.

“We don’t know if Uganda will even let him walk around freely in Kampala or whether he’ll be inside of a Ugandan jail cell,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

The lawyer said Abrego Garcia had notified the US government he would be willing to accept deportation to Costa Rica since the country had said it would provide him with refugee status.

He didn’t say whether he’d agree to plead guilty to the criminal charges he’s facing.

Unveiling Reform UK’s “Operation Restoring Justice” at a combative Oxford press conference, Farage claimed his party would detain and deport “absolutely anyone” arriving by small boat and ensure they are “never, ever allowed to stay”, insisting this would stop crossings “within days” and “save tens and possibly hundreds of billions of pounds”.

Pressed by reporters, Farage confirmed that women and children would also be detained under the plans, conceding that “how we deal with children is a more complicated and difficult issue” but insisting all arrivals would be subject to removal.

Farage dodged questions repeatedly about how the scheme would work in practice. He was unable to name a single RAF base to be converted into secure detention facilities, despite insisting they would be central to his plans.

He offered no detail on how Reform would secure deportation agreements with countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan, many of which have no return treaties with the UK and are considered unsafe by British courts. Farage could not explain how Reform’s scheme would be funded, beyond claiming costs would be a fraction of independent estimates.

Reform’s leadership said it would repeal the Human Rights Act, leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR), and disapply the 1951 refugee convention and UN convention against torture, with senior party figure Zia Yusuf declaring that “no lawyer and no judge” would be able to prevent deportation flights from leaving.

George Peretz KC, the chair of the Society of Labour Lawyers, said: “The Reform party’s policy is simply not rooted in reality. They want to institute a mass deportation programme with no real, or workable, idea of where people would be deported to.

“Reform’s policy would require a returns policy to be negotiated with regimes such as the Taliban and Iran, and may, by their own admission, involve paying those regimes to do so. Which is impractical and extremely concerning, as well as unlawful (as our own courts ruled in the Rwanda case).”

Kolbassia Haoussou, the director of survivor leadership at Freedom from Torture, called the plans “a gift to repressive regimes” and said Britain would be abandoning one of humanity’s “clearest moral lines”. He said: “This is not who we are as a country.

“Men, women and children are coming to the UK looking for safety. They are fleeing the unimaginable horrors of torture in places like Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran. These laws were created in the aftermath of the second world war to protect us all. If Britain were to abandon this legacy it would hand repressive regimes around the world a gift and undermine the promise to defend our shared right to live a life free from torture.”

The human rights lawyer Adam Wagner KC said Reform’s promises were not only “legally extreme” but fundamentally misleading.

“A lot of the rights contained in the European convention come from British common law: the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, and the right not to be tortured,” he said.

Politicians swiftly challenged the scale and practicality of the plans.

Downing Street accused Farage of not being “serious” about his plans to deport asylum seekers, saying that leaving the CfhrECHR would undermine peace in Northern Ireland.

The prime minister’s spokesperson criticised the Reform leader on Tuesday, saying that any plan that required leaving the ECHR was bound to fail.

“The ECHR underpins key international agreements on trade, security and migration – and the Good Friday agreement,” Downing Street said. “Anyone who is proposing to renegotiate the Good Friday agreement is not serious.”

No 10 refused, however, to criticise other elements of Farage’s speech, including his references to irregular migration as an “invasion” and a “scourge”, as well as his prediction that Britain is “not far away from major civil disorder”.

Asked about those comments, the spokesperson said: “We have to recognise the strength of feeling about this and the pressure that it puts on public services. That’s why we are taking the serious, practical action to address this issue, and not just returning back to the old gimmicks, the old slogans that failed to deal with this and left us with the crisis that we currently face.”

Pushed on whether it would be a good idea to sign a returns deal with Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, as Farage has suggested, Downing Street said: “We’re not going to take anything off the table in terms of striking returns agreements with countries around the world.”

Daisy Cooper, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “Farage’s plan crumbles under the most basic scrutiny. The idea that Reform is going to magic up places to detain hundreds of thousands of people and deport them to countries who haven’t agreed to take them is taking the public for fools. Of course, Nigel Farage wants to follow his idol Vladimir Putin in ripping up the human rights convention. Winston Churchill would be turning in his grave.”

Farage claims the programme would deport up to 600,000 asylum seekers in a single parliament, yet the costings remain opaque.

A report by the Centre for Migration Control, which produced costings alongside the MP Rupert Lowe but is not led by him, estimated a near-identical mass deportation scheme would cost £47.5bn more than five years. Farage insists his plan would provide the same scale of removals for £10bn, but offered no operational blueprint or independent evidence to support the claim.

Farage argued that “over three-quarters” of small-boat arrivals were “young undocumented males” from “cultures entirely different from ours” who were “unlikely to assimilate” and “pose a risk to women and girls”, language likely to draw criticism from equality groups and anti-racism campaigners.

He also spoke of a “genuine threat to public order” if his proposals were not adopted, framing his plan as the only bulwark against rising anger and “civil disorder”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8750ba16c4f388e45d26569c51d06fe59af756a2/280_0_4310_3448/master/4310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a2d0b58dca08832fd0a7df3b55adf002",N,,2025-08-26 10:57:21.669202

Friends of John Shin, a Utah violinist who was detained by ICE one week ago, are planning on playing their instruments in the rotunda until he’s home.

“It was a shock to hear that it was John,” said Shin’s friend Nicole Marriott Fullner, who was playing the oboe Monday at the Capitol. ""He is probably the last person that I would have expected that to happen to.”

“I want all of the state representatives and the council members and anybody who happens to be walking by to know about what's happening in their own state,” said Shin’s friend Gabriel Gordon, who was playing the violin.

While the pleasant sounds echoed through the Capitol, Shin's wife, Danae Snow, was going through a nightmare of her own.

“I can't sleep. I can't eat. It's been really hard to know that he's going to be struggling in the facility in Aurora and hoping that there is a life for him to come back to,” she said through tears.

Shin’s attorney, Adam Crayk, was able to clarify Shin’s immigration status.

“He came in under his father's student visa originally, has married a United States citizen, and for some reasons that were kind of beyond the control of theirs, weren't able to file for the green card in a timely fashion,” he said.

Crayk was able to reveal the reason why Shin was detained.

“There is an impaired driver conviction from 2020, which, for all of our purposes, he successfully completed probation. He did everything he was asked to do. He has the certificates to prove it,” he said. ""But that does make, currently, anybody that has that type of a conviction, they become a priority for immigration.”

Snow said at that time, Shin was struggling with the death of his father.

“He was stepping into the role of trying to take care of his family and his father's absence and was really not knowing how to move forward and really just struggling with life without him,” Snow said.

Crayk said no citizenship paperwork has been submitted yet, but they are hoping to get Shin a green card after his bond hearing next week.

“Do I wish that they would have filed a long time ago? Yes. Did circumstances allow for that? No. Do they now? Yes. Does that change the facts of the case? Nope,” Crayk said.

Snow has since been able to talk to Shin and said he’s coping the best he can.

“He still hasn't got a pillow, and he just wishes he could be home, and so do we,” Snow said.

“I wanted the world to see what an incredible husband and father and person he is, and he's not perfect,” Snow added. ""I wish he wouldn't have made this mistake. I know that we've been doing everything that we can to make it right, and I hope that as I've been able to forgive him, I hope that our community can too.""

In the meantime, violins will continue to play in the Capitol as his loved ones await his return home.

""John, if you're listening to this, I'm sorry. I should have warmed up before,” Gordon joked while playing the violin. ""We're all here for you, and hopefully we'll see you when you get back, very, very soon.""

Shin’s bond hearing is set for next Tuesday.

While there is currently a GoFundMe for Shin’s family to help cover legal fees, Crayk wants those who donated to know something.

“There's a lot of people that did donations on GoFundMe, and I want to make sure that if those people feel uncomfortable, if they feel like, 'Hey, if I had known that there was this impaired driver conviction back in 2020, I probably would not have donated,' I'm happy through Danae to work at making sure those people get a full refund,” he said.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0692cce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/928x487+0+18/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fause1%2Fslices%2F3ce%2Fef205c0e5ea14d77944cbd6904335118%2F3ce0a41f616e4e34b6f3a9a178da2c5c%2Fposter_fca407555e9e41d99ebf034fbc9f99d1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-26 12:58:20.445420

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has ditched the Conservative administration’s flagship plan to send migrants who arrived by unauthorized means to Rwanda.","LONDON (AP) — Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain’s hard-right Reform UK party, said Tuesday that if he wins the next election he will leave the European Convention on Human Rights and immediately detain and deport anyone who arrives in the country illegally, including children.

Farage laid out his plans to tackle illegal immigration following a significant rise in the number of migrants who arrive by boats across the English Channel, and weeks of protests over the government’s use of hotels to house asylum-seekers.

“If you come to the U.K. illegally, you will be detained and deported and never, ever allowed to stay, period,” Farage told a press conference.

“The mood in the country around this issue is a mix between total despair and rising anger,” he added, claiming there is now “a genuine threat to public order” if no action is taken.

He said the issue of “how we deal with children is much more complicated,” but added: “Women and children, everybody on arrival will be detained.”

Despite holding just four of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, Farage ‘s party has gained momentum by seizing on public frustration over successive governments’ inability to bring down the number of migrants coming by boat. National polls have suggested that support for Reform equals or surpasses that of the ruling Labour Party and the Conservatives.

Farage, who has long sought to link problems such as public healthcare and housing to migrant arrivals, reiterated his stance that the U.K. is being “invaded” by migrants. He said he would introduce policies to mass deport hundreds of thousands of people over the first five years of being in government.

Reform will leave the ECHR and repeal or “disapply” all other rights treaties to bar all asylum claims and ensure migrants who arrive without authorization are deported, he added. It will scale up the capacity of detention facilities and secure deals with countries including Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran, to return migrants.

Asked about the prospect of asylum-seekers being tortured or killed if they were sent back to countries they fled from, Farage said: “The alternative is to do nothing ... We cannot be responsible for all the sins that take place around the world.”

Almost 29,000 people have crossed the English Channel by boat so far in 2025, up about 50% from the same period last year. On Monday, 659 migrants arrived in the U.K. by boat.

A much larger number of people — over 111,000 — applied for asylum in the U.K. in the year up to June, official figures show.

Reform’s deportation plans echo similar tough migration policies by Germany, which deported dozens of Afghan men to their homeland last month.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has ditched the Conservative administration’s flagship plan to send migrants who arrived by unauthorized means to Rwanda. Instead, he has pinned hopes on a deal agreed with France last month to send some migrants who cross the English Channel on dinghies and inflatable boats back to France.

U.K. officials have suggested the “one in, one out” plan is a major breakthrough, despite the initial program involving a limited number of people.

The government is also looking to speed up the processing of asylum claims. Officials have housed tens of thousands of migrants awaiting their asylum outcome in hotels at public expense — a controversial policy that has long simmered but tipped into protests in recent weeks after a hotel resident allegedly tried to kiss a 14-year-old girl and was charged with sexual assault. The man has denied the accusation.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/9b562f5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7259x4083+0+378/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fa7%2Fc3%2F9bc1241f6e707fdc18a482a956e8%2F42183606cd66463c83f25cb6e63fdd18,N,,2025-08-26 10:57:26.135026

During the four years William Murcia Henao owned Sabores De Mi Tierra — literally, “flavors of my land” — his West Side Colombian restaurant was celebrated.

Opened in 2021, the Niagara Street eatery quickly earned local media attention, praise from a local blogger and a nomination for a state Business Council award from Assemblymember Jonathan Rivera. The restaurant won particular acclaim for its traditional Colombian dishes, which Rivera and others said was missing from Buffalo.

But then, in May, Murcia Henao was deported to Colombia, part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants. Several months later, his wife and two children, including one born in the United States, opted to follow him via a self-deportation process.

Murcia Henao, his wife and their eldest daughter had arrived in the United States as asylum seekers and were permitted to live and work in the Buffalo area as their case wound its way through the courts. A panel of federal judges rejected their asylum bid earlier this year.

“They were the true meaning of hard-working people, living the American dream, coming here, opening a business, you know, paying their taxes on time, no criminal record whatsoever,” said Katherine Gomez, a legal representative for the family.

Gomez and Rivera’s staff both attempted to intervene with immigration officials, but to avail.

“We did beg ICE, and we did provide a bunch of documentation stating that these people pay taxes on time. They didn’t care, and it was devastating,” Gomez said.

Murcia Henao’s wife, Adriana Botina Rodriguez, while free, was stuck in the family’s Orchard Park home, under surveillance by a black SUV — a hallmark of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She and her children had to sneak to New York City and back under cover to obtain the needed travel documents so they could leave the country without being detained, Gomez said.

The family has since reunited in Colombia. Gomez, meanwhile, purchased the business from Murcia Henao. She’s reopened the restaurant and is working to renovate it. She’s also working to bring a branch of her legal services nonprofit, La Victoria Foundation, to the Hispanic Heritage center currently under construction several blocks away on Niagara Street.

Gomez and Rivera both said the story of the Sabores restaurant highlights the new reality of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration: Law-abiding migrants are now targeted by authorities, leaving their families, businesses and communities at risk, too.

“All this is, is loss,” Rivera said. “It’s children being taken away from their parents. It’s haphazard and chaotic. It’s truly destroying communities.

Had Gomez not purchased the restaurant, he said, “we would have just had an empty storefront on Niagara Street. And who benefits from that?”

A failed asylum bid

Murcia Henao and his family arrived in the United States in 2014, fleeing threats from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as FARC. In court filings, the family said the paramilitary group began targeting Murcia Henao’s brother in 2013 “for working for a hydroelectric dam project that the FARC opposed.” When the soldiers couldn’t locate his brother, Murcia Henao and his wife became their target.

“[Murcia Henao] testified that a man came into a clothing store where he worked, pointed at him, said ‘I found what I was looking for,’ and after buying clothing, said that he knew Murcia Henao’s brother, and that Murcia Henao had two daughters,” federal judges wrote in a filing in his deportation case.

Murcia Henao further alleged that FARC members left a condolence card at his home with a note that read, “We have one of these for each of your family.”

The family also faced extortion from local gangs, Gomez said, who wanted a percentage of the money he earned as a business owner. Eventually, she said, the family couldn’t keep up with the payments.

“So he closed his business, moved to another city, and still they were looking for him, looking for his family,” she said.

The family landed in New York City and lived and worked there before ultimately relocating to Orchard Park. Rivera said Murcia Henao has a brother who lives in the area. There, eldest daughter Salome played flag football and junior varsity basketball. Murcia Henao opened Sabores De Mi Tierra in 2021.

That same year, court records show, an immigration judge in Buffalo denied his application for asylum. Under past administrations, however, such a ruling didn’t mean immediate detention, and Murcia Henao was allowed to pursue appeals of his case as a free man. His restaurant flourished as he did.

Murcia Henao, however, lost before the Board of Immigration Appeals. In early 2023, he appealed his case to a panel of federal judges. His case languished for nearly two years. After a flurry of paperwork filed in 2023, records show, the case sat idle until Trump administration lawyers took over in February.

In March, judges in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Murcia Henao. Citing a 2016 peace accord between the Colombian government and the FARC soldiers, they argued conditions in the country were now safer than they were and that Murcia Henao had failed to demonstrate that he and his family would be persecuted if forced to return. The panel argued that “occasional flare ups of FARC violence” were not enough evidence to prove the family would be at imminent risk.

He was detained by ICE agents in mid April.

After several months in ICE custody, first in Batavia and then at a facility in Louisiana, Murcia Henao was deported to Colombia. Gomez described the detention conditions as “bad” and said his wife and children wanted to avoid detention if possible.

That meant they had to travel surreptitiously to New York City. Gomez said she arranged for the family to leave home at 2 a.m., drive to the city, acquire the needed paperwork, and arrive back home in Orchard Park undetected by the agents parked near their home. They departed for Colombia shortly thereafter, unable to sort out their affairs before they left.

“They left with nothing. They didn’t take all of their clothes or their furniture or their anything,” Rivera said. “They have to start from scratch, despite having a profitable business here.”

Future of the restaurant

After the family arrived in Colombia, Gomez said, Murcia Henao attempted to sell the restaurant. But knowing he had been deported, prospective buyers tried to take advantage of him, making only low-ball offers, Gomez said.

Running out of options, Murcia Henao agreed to sell for $30,000. He was to be paid $10,000 up front and $20,000 after the new owners took over the space. According to Gomez, they stiffed on the second payment.

Murcia Henao, she said, called her from Colombia, not knowing what to do.

“Then I told them, ‘Well, how much is it?’ And he was, you know, he was very shy,” she said. “[I said] ‘Well, let me make calls, make a loan, and I’ll buy it.’”

She did so for $55,000.

Gomez has big plans for the restaurant, which reopened July 18.

First came new flooring. Next up are repairs to the ventilation system. Gomez wants to update the menu, too, and open for breakfast. By the fall, she said, she plans to offer traditional Colombian coffee, croissants and eggs.

She’s also in talks, she said, to open a branch of her legal services nonprofit, La Victoria Foundation, down the block. Assisting Murcia Henao, she said, made her realize that many Latinos here don’t know their rights. Among other work, she wants to host “know your rights” trainings at the restaurant.

“I think people in Buffalo have no clue in regards to how immigration works,” she said. “I want them to know: These are your rights, and this is how you can have successful goals.”",https://www.investigativepost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6026-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:58:05.754011

If there are no exact matches, the system will fall back to your default search query (which can be configured separately).

OR Search (|)

Use the pipe symbol (|) to search for any of the listed terms:

Example: Marketing manager | Sales manager | Business manager

This will return any result that matches at least one of the terms. If only one term matches, only that result is shown. If multiple match, all are returned.

Exclude Words (-)

Use the dash (-) to exclude specific words from the search results:

Examples: Marketing manager -indeed.com

Houses in London -zoopla -terraced

This tells the search engine to omit any result that includes the excluded words (e.g., no listings from Zoopla or containing ""terraced"").

Fallback Match (LIKE %query%)

Use this method when no other matching methods succeed.

Example: %economy in 2025 snp stocks%

This functions like a SQL LIKE query — it's a broad, fuzzy match that tries to find results containing the key terms anywhere in the content. It's often used as a final fallback option.

AND Search (&)

Use the ampersand (&) to ensure all terms are included in the results:

Example: Sales & Marketing & London

Only results that contain all three keywords — “Sales”, “Marketing”, and “London” — will be returned.

Even if a page is titled “Sales & Marketing”, it will still be included, as long as all keywords are present somewhere in the content.

Use these search operators to narrow or broaden your results as needed. They can be combined and layered for even more control.",https://www.troutman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-TPLfavicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-26 09:58:26.755057

Welcome to The Logoff: A federal judge is standing in the way of the Trump administration’s plan to once again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia — this time to Uganda.

Who is Kilmar Abrego Garcia? Abrego Garcia became one of the most high-profile victims of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after he was wrongfully deported to CECOT, a megaprison in El Salvador, earlier this year. The Maryland resident and Salvadoran citizen was returned to the US in June to face questionable criminal charges in Tennessee after Trump officials resisted his return for months.

What just happened? On Monday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained Abrego Garcia after he appeared at an immigration check-in in Baltimore just days after being released from jail, and the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to deport him. Hours later, a district court judge in Maryland ordered DHS to suspend deportation proceedings pending a hearing later this week, where Abrego Garcia’s lawyers will have a chance to argue that he fears persecution if deported to Uganda.

Why Uganda? As part of its effort to ramp up deportations, the Trump administration has struck deals with a number of countries, including Uganda, to accept US deportees from unrelated third countries. In Abrego Garcia’s case specifically, his lawyers allege the threat of deportation is coercive. They say the government offered to deport him to Costa Rica if he agreed to plead guilty to the charges he is still facing in Tennessee — and to Uganda if he refused.

What about the criminal charges? Abrego Garcia is currently facing federal criminal charges of human smuggling in connection with a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. The indictment alleges connection with a broader human smuggling ring, but there’s reason to be skeptical, as a veteran federal prosecutor in Nashville resigned over the decision to bring the charges in the first place.

What’s the big picture? Abrego Garcia’s initial deportation was entirely DHS’ mistake, but it’s hard to avoid the sense that the Trump administration is attempting to punish him for it nonetheless by bringing criminal charges and threatening re-removal to an unfamiliar and potentially dangerous third country.

And with that, it’s time to log off…

By that afternoon, he was calling from the Aurora Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility to say he would not be coming home.
He and his wife run Castle Rock Carpet Care, which they temporarily closed after his detention.
But come 20 years later, we find out that it was still an issue,"" Kelli said.
At the Aurora detention facility, Kelli said her husband has lost 12 pounds in his first four days and is struggling emotionally.","CASTLE ROCK, Colo. — Dale Heath left his Castle Rock home on Aug. 4 for what his wife thought would be another routine trip to renew his immigration paperwork. By that afternoon, he was calling from the Aurora Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility to say he would not be coming home.

“It was a very like, ‘Hey, I’ll be right back. I’m going to run and renew my paperwork,’” his wife, Kelli Heath, recalled. “He honestly didn’t even give us a hug or kiss goodbye because it was such a routine activity to go take care of... It was like he was going to the grocery store.”

Dale, 42, immigrated from England in 1991 and has lived in Colorado for nearly a decade. He and his wife run Castle Rock Carpet Care, which they temporarily closed after his detention. He also volunteered as a coach with Rapids Youth Soccer and served in his children’s school community.

The family said the detention stems from two marijuana possession charges in Texas more than 20 years ago, when Dale was 18.

""We never knew that it was an issue, because he took care of it at that time. But come 20 years later, we find out that it was still an issue,"" Kelli said.

According to Department of Homeland Security records reviewed by 9NEWS, Dale was questioned by Customs and Border Protection officers at Houston’s Hobby Airport in May 2022 while returning from a trip. During that sworn statement, he confirmed two arrests for possession of less than two ounces of marijuana in 2001. Court records show he pleaded no contest in both cases and served probation and short confinement.

CBP officers confiscated his green card at that airport and placed him in removal proceedings. Since then, Dale has been required to renew temporary proof of residency each year while waiting for an immigration court date.

Kelli said that at his most recent appointment this month, officials told him that “because there are changes under the new administration… they weren’t able to renew it this time around.”

He was taken into ICE custody on the spot and has been held at the detention facility Aurora for three weeks now.

The impact has been immediate.

“It’s been different in multiple ways. We’ve had to temporarily close our business,” Kelli said.

She is now caring for their 9-year-old son Oliver and 12-year-old daughter Zooey alone.

Zooey said the hardest part is starting middle school without her dad.

""Everything's not good, I'll say that,"" Zooey said. ""There's a couple times I've gone to school and started crying.""

Kelli described her son’s reaction as devastating.

“Especially with Oliver, I’ve never seen him cry like that before, and that’s heartbreaking to a mother,"" she said.

At the Aurora detention facility, Kelli said her husband has lost 12 pounds in his first four days and is struggling emotionally.

“Mentally, he’s awful, I mean, to say the least. He’s going to have PTSD from this,"" she said.

In a statement to 9NEWS, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it “continues to issue temporary status documentation such as I-551 stamps on a case-by-case basis,” but would not comment on Dale’s case specifically.

Immigration attorneys told 9NEWS that while people in removal proceedings are always subject to detention under the law, past administrations rarely detained individuals who were not considered flight risks or threats to the public.

Kelli said her husband has had no arrests or tickets in nearly two decades, has passed repeated background checks for his jobs and volunteer coaching, and has successfully renewed his green card multiple times.

“If this was truly an issue, and they truly thought he was a criminal, then I feel like they should have done something a lot sooner than now,” Kelli said.

The family’s next chance at relief comes Sept. 3, when Dale’s case is scheduled for a hearing.

Until then, Kelli said, “We’ve done everything right, and he’s being punished for something that happened as a kid... They're just kind of picking up anybody and everybody and not taking into consideration the other aspects of their life.""",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/d8caac2f-3a7b-4255-96d3-5d61ac2a5173/20250826T033258/d8caac2f-3a7b-4255-96d3-5d61ac2a5173_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 11:58:14.688132

Brian Kemp is sending approximately 75 members of Georgia’s National Guard to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with immigration enforcement efforts, his office announced Monday. The Peach State is joining 18 other states to mobilize a collective 1,700 troops nationwide.

Guard members will not be tasked with making immigration arrests, but instead will assist with “administrative and logistic support,” according to the governor’s office. Processing and training is scheduled to begin in mid-September.

“I am proud to stand with President Trump’s team in the ongoing efforts to secure our nation’s border and keep Americans safe,” Kemp said in a statement. “With the longest continuous presence at the border of any National Guard, Georgia has led on this front for years and will continue to do so through this latest measure while still meeting all responsibilities and duties the Guard has to the state.”

State officials also stressed that partnerships between the National Guard and other governmental entities are not new. In February of 2024, Kemp authorized members of Georgia’s National Guard to assist with Texas’ border operations.

They also said that the move to have guard members assist with immigration enforcement “is different and separate from” Trump’s recent takeover of the District of Columbia.

State Rep. Eric Bell, a Jonesboro Democrat who served in the U.S. Navy, condemned the use of the Georgia National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement.

“I believe Georgia is standing at a crossroads regarding governance and the protection of individual rights,” he said in a statement. “What is before us is not from foreign shores but from within—the possibility of deploying troops on our own soil, against our own citizens. This is no act of security. I believe this an attempt to create division among Americans and Georgians and could be seen as serving private interests rather than the public.”

Jerry Gonzalez, executive director of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, also condemned the mobilization of the national guard.

“Unfortunately, this is another authoritarian move by the Trump regime,” Gonzalez said. “Our Georgia governor is going along with these fascist efforts to militarize attacks against our communities with violations of law with no due process for immigration enforcement.”

Experts said the death toll may have been inflated by the upheaval at Fema, claiming it diminished its capacity to respond quickly.
The letter, entitled The Katrina Declaration, accused the Trump administration of disregarding the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act (PKERMA), passed in 2006 with the intention of absorbing the lessons of the disaster.
“Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one,” the signatories wrote.
Those lessons and actions are being disregarded by the Trump administration.” Daniel Llargués, Fema’s acting press secretary, dismissed the criticisms voiced in the letter.","Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) risk exposing the US to another Hurricane Katrina, staff at the agency have warned Congress in a withering critique that also takes aim at its current leadership.

Writing in the run up to this week’s 20th anniversary of the devastating 2005 storm that killed 1,833 people and caused widespread destruction in New Orleans and the Gulf coast, more than 180 current and former Fema employees say the Trump administration’s policies are ignoring the mistakes that led to it.

The letter, sent to members of Congress and a council formed to examine the agency’s future, follows months of criticism of Fema from Trump and senior administration officials, who have threatened to close it, prompting more than 2,000 staff – about one-third of its permanent workforce – to depart, leaving it short of institutional expertise in key positions.

It comes after last month’s deadly flooding in Texas that left at least 135 – including 37 school children – dead. Experts said the death toll may have been inflated by the upheaval at Fema, claiming it diminished its capacity to respond quickly.

The letter, entitled The Katrina Declaration, accused the Trump administration of disregarding the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act (PKERMA), passed in 2006 with the intention of absorbing the lessons of the disaster.

“Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one,” the signatories wrote.

“The inexperience of senior leaders and the profound failure by the federal government to deliver timely, unified, and effective aid to those in need left survivors to fend for themselves.

“Two decades later, Fema is enacting processes and leadership structures that echo the conditions PKERMA was designed to prevent.”

It is also scathing about Kristi Noem, who as homeland security secretary, has overall responsibility for Fema, and about two administrators who have been placed in charge of the agency since Trump’s inauguration.

“Since January 2025, Fema has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a Fema administrator,” the signatories said.

The letter identifies the current Fema acting administrator, David Richardson, who has no previous experience in disaster management, and his predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, who was appointed by Trump only to be fired after publicly saying he opposed plans to abolish the agency.

“Decisions made [by Noem, Richardson and Hamiltion] … hinder the swift execution of our mission, and dismiss experienced staff whose institutional knowledge and relationships are vital to ensure effective emergency management,” it said.

Noem has angered seasoned officials by demanding that contracts worth more more than $100,000 be personally approved by her – a stipulation specialists say significantly slowed the response to the Texas floods.

Richardson’s suitability was questioned after he told staff that he did not know the US had a hurricane season – which lasts from the start of May till 30 November. His office later insisted he was joking.

The letter states: “Our shared commitment to our country, our oaths of office, and our mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters compel us to warn Congress and the American people of the cascading effects of decisions made by the current administration.”

Six statements of opposition in the letter include condemnation of “the ongoing failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator, as required by law”.

It also includes criticism of the administration’s “censorship of climate science”.

“This administration’s decision to ignore and disregard the facts pertaining to climate science in disasters shows a blatant disregard for the safety and security of our nation’s people and all American communities regardless of their geographic, economic or ethnic diversity,” the signatories write.

A petition at the end of the letter demands that Fema be given full cabinet level agency status and defended from interference from the Department of Homeland Security. The department recently ordered Fema agents to assist Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (Ice) agents in immigration raids, threatening to fire those who refused.

Trump, who has set up a review council headed by Noem to consider Fema’s future, has repeatedly said he favors its abolition, though he softened his rhetoric following the Texas floods, amid suggestions that it could be “rebranded” with more of its functions being devolved to the states.

Thirty-six of the signatories – including some currently working at the agency – attached their names, leaving them open to possible retribution. Another 144 withheld their identities.

One signatory, Michael Coen, a former Fema chief of staff under Joe Biden and Barack Obama, told the Guardian in a statement: “I am proud of the current and former FEMA employees for having the courage to speak up. Lessons were learned from Katrina and Congress took action. Those lessons and actions are being disregarded by the Trump administration.”

This month’s blog focuses on the Government’s White Paper which outlines proposed changes to the UK immigration system. It critiques the dangerous use of demonising and divisive rhetoric surrounding migration, especially in the wake of further far-right violence this summer.

“Restoring Control Over the Immigration System: White Paper”

In the Prime Minister’s foreword to the White Paper[1], he describes the recent rates of migration to the UK as an “explosion” causing “[incalculable] damage”. He states that the previous government operated a “one nation experiment in open borders” and failed “to bring inward migration under control”, which has created a “wound […] when it comes to trust in politics”.

In the wake of further anti-migrant protests by the far right across the UK, this is an unfortunate continuation of the worrying trend of politicians using demonising language surrounding migration. Hundreds of refugee organisations have therefore sent an open letter to leaders of the main political parties in the UK asking that they take action to end this and address the “pernicious and insidious currents of racism and hatred underlying these protests”.[2]

Background

The case for reducing net migration is said in the White Paper to be premised on “unsustainable” increases in the rates of migration and the need for “desirable” forms of migration i.e. migration which the Government believes will increase economic productivity. The Government’s proposals in the White Paper to restrict and reduce lower-skilled migration, and increase productivity in the domestic workforce, include:

ending the Adult Social Care Visa route;

increasing the threshold for skilled worker visas to graduate level (RQF 6) and the salary threshold (to £25,600), in order to significantly reduce the number of occupations that are eligible;

increasing access to visa routes for targeting and recruiting “global talent”; and

introducing a requirement for key sectors to produce a “workforce strategy”, outlining the steps employers will take to increase skills and training, in order to engage the domestic workforce.

Use of technology

A key aspect of the White Paper is regarding the use of new technology to increase public confidence in immigration control and strengthen enforcement activity.

Body-worn video cameras, mobile biometric kits and an “advanced data management system” will be introduced to enable immigration enforcement officers identify overseas nationals and access digital identities/immigration statuses.[3] Border Force will use AI and facial recognition technology in order to gather the most accurate information available on each individual seeking to enter the UK.[4] The White Paper also refers to the introduction of new “Intelligence systems” for the purpose of strengthening immigration enforcement, including:

The database for the new eVisa system (digital-only form of immigration status which has replaced Biometric Residence Permits) records data which will enable enforcement action to be taken as soon as someone overstays their visa and to ensure that benefits, services and employment are not accessible such individuals. The database will alert the Home Office where a visa has expired, digital records can be updated in real time, and information will be shared with other government departments.[5]

The Government also plans to develop a “new digital service” which will be capable of showing whether an individual is inside or outside the UK at any time and whether they have complied with the terms of their visa. This data will also be used “to support further immigration applications in more automated ways”.[6]

The increasing use of digital profiling and surveillance technologies to gather sensitive data about individuals who want to enter, leave or remain in the UK, is concerning and risks being disproportionately intrusive and infringing the rights of individuals including under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. There is no clear legal basis for the increasing use of AI and facial recognition technology for immigration control purposes or for storing sensitive biometric data on national database. The Government has not published any policies to set out how sensitive categories of data will be used or shared with third parties.

There is also a concerning lack of accountability which has already been documented by Privacy International in relation to the Home Office’s use of photographs collected from immigration databases onto a secret facial recognition library which the Metropolitan Police has access to.[7]

Settlement and Citizenship

The White Paper proposes a key change to the Immigration Rules in increasing the qualifying period for leave to remain from 5 to 10 years. It prefaces that “settlement” and “citizenship” should be earned and be available to those making “greater contributions” to the UK economy. It is suggested that reductions to the qualifying time period to settle or to naturalise as British will be possible through the introduction of a points-based system.

It is also proposed that English language requirements for skilled workers and settlement are increased from B1 to B2 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages “CEFR”); and that adult dependents be able to demonstrate a basic level of English (Level A1, CEFR) to be granted entry clearance.

The above changes are said to be justified on the basis that they are necessary for “successful integration”, “community empowerment” and “social cohesion”.[8] However, extending the time periods to settle in the UK risks prolonging the precariousness of immigration status and frustrating integration or belonging, which is at odds with social cohesion, the stated aim of the White Paper. Similarly, through introducing a Points Based System the idea of conditional belonging is emphasised, with migrants being required to demonstrate that their contributions are of value to readily secure permanent immigration status.

Asylum

The White Paper confirms the Government will introduce further substantial reforms to the asylum system and border security to reduce irregular and illegal migration. As we explained in our first blog post[9], in the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill 2025, the Government has upheld provisions to criminalise asylum seekers who enter the UK via an irregular route originally introduced in the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.

It is important to note that there are very few refugee and sponsorship schemes currently available to asylum seekers, and that some such as the Afghan Relocation Programme have recently been closed.[10] The criminalisation of migrants on the basis of their mode of arrival to the UK ignores this fact. Statistics confirm that 70% of people who arrived by way of small boats between 2018 and 2024 were from Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, Albania, Syria, and Eritrea – countries from which there are not currently safe or “legal” routes to the UK. Furthermore, 68% of people who arrived by small boat during that same period were granted refugee status[11], showing that the mode of travel is irrelevant to the merits of an asylum seeker’s underlying protection claim.[12]

The White Papers states that new policies will be introduced to ensure that asylum claims by those who enter the UK on other visas can be refused where conditions in the individual’s home country have not “materially changed” since their arrival.[13] The Government has also indicated that it will review existing refugee and sponsorship schemes such as the Ukrainian Scheme, to ensure a clear and sustainable sponsorship framework,[14] and that it will explore a system for allowing UNHCR recognised refugees to apply for employment through existing sponsored work routes.[15]

Concluding points

Following the election, the Prime Minister pledged to uphold the rule of law and the UK’s international human rights obligations. However, the digitalisation of the hostile environment, closing refugee and sponsorship schemes (such as Afghan Resettlement Programme), and proposals to restrict asylum claims as set out in the White Paper, exemplify how the rule of law and international human rights obligations are arguably absent from the Government’s plans to reform the immigration system.

The White Paper encompasses policies that are “as much symbolic as they are substantive. Choosing between them has tangible implications for those directly affected. But those choices also say something – and are intended to say something – about those politicians and parties making that choice”[16]. The White Paper can be read as the Government framing itself as fulfilling a political mandate to reduce migration to the UK and strengthen immigration enforcement. However, now, more than ever, we need a Government that is not afraid to reject divisive and reductive rhetoric and one that will uphold human rights and create protections for the most vulnerable. As the open letter from refugee organisations to party leaders rightly recognises:

“The responsibility to end the divisive politics, racist rhetoric and demonising language of the past is yours. Only then will you bring unity instead of division and cohesion rather than hate.”

Under the plan, named Operation Restoring Justice, Reform UK would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, and strike deals with countries to return those people.
Reform UK says it would make £2bn available to put towards returns deals if it won power, with aid offered as an incentive and sanctions potentially imposed on countries that do not co-operate.
Reform UK said it would aim to scale up deportation charter flights to five per day.
The proposals could face legal challenges and political opposition, with Labour branding it unworkable and the Conservatives accusing Reform UK of recycling their ideas.","Reform UK has said it would offer payments to countries like Afghanistan to enable ""mass deportations"" of migrants who arrive in the UK on small boats.

The party's leader Nigel Farage set out a five-year plan to detain and deport all migrants who arrive in the UK without permission at a news conference in Oxford.

Under the plan, named Operation Restoring Justice, Reform UK would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, and strike deals with countries to return those people.

Reform UK says it would make £2bn available to put towards returns deals if it won power, with aid offered as an incentive and sanctions potentially imposed on countries that do not co-operate.

Launching his plan, Farage described illegal migration as a ""scourge"" on the UK.

""The only way we'll stop the boats is by detaining and deporting absolutely anyone who comes via that route,"" Farage said.

""And if we do that, the boats will stop coming in days because there will be no incentive,"" he added.

Under the plan, people would be arrested on arrival, detained at disused RAF bases and, if agreements were reached, returned to their countries of origin, including Afghanistan and Eritrea, where a significant number of people on small boats come from.

The party says it would build removal centres in remote areas of the country under plans to detain up to 24,000 people within 18 months.

The party would also look to countries such as Rwanda and Albania to house migrants, and seek to use British overseas territories such as Ascension Island as a ""fallback"" if people awaiting deportation could not be sent elsewhere.

Reform UK said it would aim to scale up deportation charter flights to five per day.

Key to the plan is the passage of a new law called the Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill.

Reform UK said the bill would create a legal duty for the home secretary to remove illegal migrants, and ban anyone who had been deported from re-entering the UK for life.

To make removals easier, Reform is promising to leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), repeal the Human Rights Act and ""disapply"" international treaties like the Refugee Convention for five years.

A Reform UK government would give migrants the option to return voluntarily and offer them £2,500 for doing so and pay for the cost of their flight, the party says.

Reform said the plans would cost about £10bn over five years, but would save the government money it spends on asylum hotels and other costs over the long term.

The proposals could face legal challenges and political opposition, with Labour branding it unworkable and the Conservatives accusing Reform UK of recycling their ideas.

The arrival of migrants on small boats has contributed to an increase in asylum claims in recent years and put pressure on the UK government to stop the crossings.

Nearly 28,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel on small boats since the start of the year, and a record 111,000 asylum applications were made in the year to June.

The latest Home Office figures show of those who claimed asylum in the UK in the year to June, about 40% arrived via small boat.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f060/live/7156ea20-8263-11f0-ba76-2552413beb48.jpg,N,,2025-08-26 07:56:35.902022

Some UCLA medical school faculty are members of a broader campus organization, the Jewish Faculty Resilience Group, that has aired complaints publicly for months at UC regents meetings about antisemitism.
In a Monday statement, a spokesperson for the UCLA medical school said it opposed antisemitism.
“Antisemitism has no place at UCLA’s medical school.
Tense disagreements have erupted at the UCLA medical school between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students, faculty and staff since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza.","The UCLA and UC San Francisco medical schools have been given two weeks to submit years of internal documents to a Republican-led congressional committee about alleged antisemitism and how the schools responded, widening the federal government’s far-reaching investigations into the University of California.

The demands from House Education and Workforce Committee Chair Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) cited reports of Jewish people “experiencing hostility and fear” at each campus and that universities had not proved that they “meaningfully responded.”

Walberg’s letters said the committee would be investigating whether the schools violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.

The additional investigation comes as top UC officials and the Justice Department have begun negotiations over allegations that the UCLA campus overall has been hostile to Jewish students, staff and faculty. The federal government has suspended more than $500 million in health, medical and energy research grants from UCLA and is seeking $1 billion and major campus changes before restoring the funds.

The Trump administration cited alleged Title VI violations when pulling the money.

The House committee said Monday it wanted “all documents and communications” since Sept. 1, 2021, tied to complaints of antisemitic incidents at UCLA and UC San Fransisco. A similar letter was also sent to the University of Illinois College of Medicine.

Some UCLA medical school faculty are members of a broader campus organization, the Jewish Faculty Resilience Group, that has aired complaints publicly for months at UC regents meetings about antisemitism.

The group’s chair, medical school assistant clinical professor of psychiatry Kira Stein, is mentioned in the Monday letter to UCLA as a faculty member who has reported anti-Jewish incidents.

“Federal lawmakers, in their letter released today, echoed what many of us have experienced firsthand: Antisemitism at UCLA is common, corrosive, and continues to be met with silence and inaction from the university administration and local leaders,” Stein said in a statement Monday.

The committee has asked for communications with UCLA’s medical school dean, administrators who work on diversity or restorative justice-related programs, and several other positions as well as data on specific events and courses, including one on “structural racism and health equity.”

It also asked for emails from administrators “referring or relating to antisemitism or the terms Jewish, Israel, Israeli, Palestine, or Palestinian.” And it requests information about a January report focused on the medical school that a UCLA task force on anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim and anti-Arab racism prepared.

That 35-page report said “students, residents and faculty in the David Geffen School of Medicine who express support for Palestinian human rights, and who offer any criticism of Israel’s violation of them, face harassment from within and outside the medical school.”

The House committee has asked for “all documents and communications since October 7, 2023 in the possession of the office of the executive vice chancellor” — UCLA Provost Darnell Hunt — related to that task force. Members of the task force have accused UCLA of not taking complaints of bias incidents against Muslims, Arab Americans and Palestinian Americans as seriously as it has reports of antisemitism.

Walberg said that, in addition to Title VI enforcement, he would use the documents to “aid the committee in considering whether potential legislative changes, including legislation to specifically address antisemitic discrimination, are needed.”

The UCLA medical school is also under a Department of Health and Human Services investigation over accusations that it “discriminates on the basis of race, color, or national origin in its admissions.” UCLA denied the charges and the department has not formally announced the results of its investigation that began in late March. But when it canceled hundreds of millions in grants to UCLA last month, the Trump administration said the action was due in part to its belief that the university illegally uses race in admissions.

In a Monday statement, a spokesperson for the UCLA medical school said it opposed antisemitism.

“Antisemitism has no place at UCLA’s medical school. Protecting the civil rights of our Jewish community members remains a top priority,” the statement said. “We are committed to fair processes in all our educational programs and activities, consistent with federal and state anti-discrimination laws and continue to take specific steps to foster an environment free of antisemitism and other forms of discrimination and harassment.”

A spokesperson for UC San Francisco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The letter comes as the Trump administration has floated the idea of eliminating the agency altogether, and has generally sought to diminish its role while placing more responsibility on states.
The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
The letter was published online but was addressed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council, which the Trump administration set up to explore ways to reform the agency.
The FEMA staffers, which included 143 current and 38 former employees, had additional concerns that they outlined, including cuts to risk reduction programs, climate science and the agency’s workforce.","A group of current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees warned Monday that the Trump administration is weakening the disaster response agency’s capacity and preventing it from carrying out its mission.

In a letter, the 181 current and former staffers particularly pointed to an administration policy requiring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to conduct a “personal review and approval of all contracts, grants and mission assignments over $100,000.”

They said this “reduces FEMA’s authorities and capabilities to swiftly deliver our mission.”

“Consequences of this manual review became tragically clear during the July 2025 floods in Kerrville, Texas, when mission assignments were delayed up to 72 hours; FEMA’s Urban Search and Rescue Branch Chief resigned, citing these delays as cause,” the staffers wrote.

They also lamented there is no congressionally approved administrator helming the agency and said its current leader is not qualified for the position.

The letter comes as the Trump administration has floated the idea of eliminating the agency altogether, and has generally sought to diminish its role while placing more responsibility on states.

The staffers said such policies are making things worse.

“Cuts to these programs prioritize the appearance of cost reduction and empowerment of SLTT [State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial] partners but will result in an opposite outcome,” they wrote.

“When we cannot work directly with our SLTT partners in providing training and technical assistance, we lose critical opportunities to maintain trust, strengthen systems, improve preparedness, and serve the American communities we swore an oath to protect at the moments of their most dire need,” they added.

Acting FEMA Press Secretary Daniel Llargues defended the Trump administration’s moves.

“The Department of Homeland Security, under the leadership of Secretary Kristi Noem, is committed to ensuring FEMA delivers for the American people. For too long, FEMA was bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes that failed to get disaster dollars into survivors’ hands. The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

“It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems,” the statement continued, pointing to reforms including “Rapid, upfront funding was provided in New Mexico following recent flooding — a shift away from slow, reimbursable models that left families waiting for years in the past.”

In a letter called the “Katrina Declaration,” named after the 2005 hurricane that killed hundreds of people, the current and former FEMA staffers said the agency is losing progress made in the aftermath of the storm.

“Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one: the inexperience of senior leaders and the profound failure by the federal government to deliver timely, unified, and effective aid to those in need left survivors to fend for themselves for days,” they wrote.

The staffers noted that such failures resulted in the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA), but warned that current policies could take the nation backwards.

“Two decades later, FEMA is enacting processes and leadership structures that echo the conditions PKEMRA was designed to prevent,” they wrote.

The letter was published online but was addressed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency Review Council, which the Trump administration set up to explore ways to reform the agency. It also was sent to various congressional committees.

The FEMA staffers, which included 143 current and 38 former employees, had additional concerns that they outlined, including cuts to risk reduction programs, climate science and the agency’s workforce.

They called on Congress to make FEMA a “cabinet-level independent agency,” defend the agency from “further interference from DHS, including illegal impoundments of appropriated funding,” and protect employees from “politically motivated firings.”

The administration’s cuts to the disaster agency have come under particular scrutiny in light of the deadly floods in Texas. The administration has, in recent weeks, walked back its calls to ax the agency outright, but has doubled down on its assertions that it hopes to dole out less money through the agency and give states more responsibility.

Staffers at other agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have published similar letters.

Nigel Farage will on Tuesday outline proposals for a sweeping deportation programme, including the mass removal of asylum seekers arriving in small boats, the detention of new arrivals at military bases, and the rapid expansion of flights to Rwanda and other countries willing to take asylum seekers.

Speaking after a weekend of protests and counter-protests over the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, the Home Office minister Angela Eagle said the government had inherited a “border security system in tatters” and accused opposition parties of offering “the fag packet plans without the substance on delivery”.

Nigel Farage will on Tuesday outline proposals for a sweeping deportation programme, including the mass removal of asylum seekers arriving in small boats, the detention of new arrivals at military bases, and the rapid expansion of flights to Rwanda and other countries willing to take asylum seekers.

The Reform UK leader’s plans also include withdrawing from the European convention on human rights and replacing the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights prioritising citizens’ rights.

Writing for the Telegraph, he described international treaties governing human rights law as “malign influences” that had been “allowed to frustrate deportations”.

“The time has come to put this country first,” Farage said. “This is all a question of priorities. Is Keir Starmer on the side of the British people, national security and protecting women and girls – or is he on the side of outdated international treaties and human rights lawyers?”

Farage’s intervention comes after a Times poll by YouGov found that 71% of voters believe Keir Starmer is handling the asylum seeker hotel crisis poorly, including a majority of Labour supporters. The findings have intensified pressure on ministers to demonstrate visible progress before a winter in which the use of hotels remains one of the most politically fraught aspects of the small boats crisis.

Eagle, the border security and asylum minister, said Reform’s plans were unworkable and accused the Conservatives of leaving behind a broken system.

“This government inherited chaos in the asylum system and a border security system in tatters,” she said. “Since the election we have been rebuilding the foundations of both, saving £1bn in asylum accommodation costs, increasing removals of those with no right to be here, and bringing forward new laws to make it easier to deport sex offenders, which both Reform and the Tories voted against.

“Under the Tories we had years of fantasy solutions, which we were told would stop the boats, but which simply cost a fortune and had no impact. Reform look to be offering more of the same. These are back-of-the-fag packet plans without the substance on delivery.

“Illegal migration is a complex, global problem requiring serious and sustainable policies, including working closely with partners overseas. Only the Labour government is offering that kind of plan.”

A government source said “by the end of the year at least five more hotels are expected to be closed, with a big surge in closures in the new year”, describing the move as part of a wider effort to end hotel use entirely.

The number of hotels accommodating asylum seekers has fallen from a peak of 400 in 2023, when costs reached £9m a day, to just more than 200 now, with a reduced daily cost of £5.5m, insiders say. In the first half of this year alone, the number of asylum seekers living in hotels fell by 6,000 – a 16% reduction.

Home Office figures show overall asylum costs have dropped by 11%, delivering £1bn in savings last year and a forecast of at least another £1bn to be saved next year. Ministers argue the closures show tangible progress, even as critics continue to highlight delays in processing claims and challenges in securing alternative housing.

Rising public anger over asylum accommodation has been fuelled by high-profile criminal cases and violent incidents. The Scottish Tory leader, Russell Findlay, defended protests outside a hotel housing asylum seekers after Sadeq Nikzad, a 29-year-old Afghan migrant, was jailed for nine years in June for the rape of a 15-year-old girl in October 2023.

Findlay said: “It’s understandable in those circumstances why communities would question the entire integrity and safety of the immigration system. As long as that’s being done lawfully and respectfully that is an entirely right way to protest.”

The fallout from the Epping asylum hotel ruling has also escalated tensions. The high court recently ordered the removal of asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in Essex after local Conservative-led councils mounted a legal challenge. The decision has emboldened other councils to consider similar action.

Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservatives, is hosting a call on Tuesday with Tory councillors, planning law experts and senior party strategists to discuss how councils can coordinate further legal challenges. Attenders include Lord Charles Banner KC; the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp; James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary; Holly Whitbread, a cabinet member at Epping Forest council; and John Cope, the chair of the Conservative councillors’ association.

The Guardian understands the session will aim to “help and encourage Conservative councils to take the lead in fighting to close asylum hotels in their constituency” and “give genuine advice based on a serious plan of action”.

A two-day trial begins on Tuesday at Chelmsford crown court of a man charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl outside the Bell hotel – a case that has fuelled anger locally and sparked fresh protests across Essex.

Despite highlighting falling costs, declining hotel use and tougher enforcement, Labour remains under political pressure. The government has pointed to new deals with France, Bulgaria, Romania, India, Vietnam and Iraq aimed at disrupting trafficking and speeding removals.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87cfad8443230183d9bc83422fc0a657c8bbd298/0_0_5002_4000/master/5002.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00efbea264844cff475ca63bcc6a8ddd",N,,2025-08-26 00:56:27.366837

To participate in the clinic, people must first attend an information session. This fall, Human Rights Officer Shafina Khaki said the Human Rights Division is keeping immigrant communities informed with safety as a top priority.

Khaki said the citizenship clinic typically occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall. She said participants expressed concerns and fear about their safety due to the current political climate.

“Many residents need more details and explanations on how to navigate this political climate and the laws that are coming down in very real time,” Khaki said.

During the citizenship clinic on Sept. 13, attorneys from American Gateways, a nonprofit serving the low-income Central Texas immigrant community, will provide free assistance to the first 55 people to complete the N-400 application for naturalization, according to the clinic’s flyer. This clinic coincides with the citywide Welcoming Week, a series of events that recognize the contributions and presence of the immigrant community.

A common source of confusion is the distinction between lawful status and lawful presence, said Krystal Gómez, managing attorney at the Texas Immigration Law Council.

“There isn’t a code a person can point to and say, ‘Oh, here are all the people who are lawfully present under immigration law,’” Gómez said. “Lawful presence is not something that is defined in immigration law. It’s usually interpreted as somebody who is not accumulating unlawful presence.”

Some non-citizen students experienced confusion when paying for tuition after the Texas Dream Act was overturned on June 4. This law previously allowed them to qualify for in-state tuition if they resided in Texas for at least three years, graduated from or received the equivalent of a high school diploma in Texas and signed an affidavit agreeing to apply for legal status as soon as they were able to. Gómez said there have been different interpretations of the court order.

“What we’re seeing is essentially chaos,” Gómez said. “The court didn’t offer any kind of guidance on how schools should be implementing their court order, and as a result, we’ve had schools take various positions on what the court order means.”

Gómez said students can reach out to the council with questions to see if they have a pathway toward legal presence or if they need guidance from an immigration lawyer.

Khaki said the division partnered with the Texas Immigration Law Council to provide information sessions on recent immigration policy updates. The division also works closely with American Gateways during the citizenship clinic information sessions.

“That is a really critical spot for residents to come and to understand not only what the city of Austin is doing specifically, but who our partners are, who we’re working with, who we’re supporting here in our community,” Khaki said.

Whitney Drake, managing attorney at American Gateways, said applications for services are made via telephone.

“It doesn’t require people to travel to our office,” Drake said. “Requesting services with a nonprofit organization or having a consultation with a private attorney doesn’t put that individual at any increased risk. All of that information is confidential.”

Drake said American Gateways continues to receive requests for information and services, despite concerns from participants about moving forward with different types of applications.

“One trend that we are noticing is there is a lot of apprehension among the community that we work with to apply for benefits like immigration relief or a visa or things of that nature,” Drake said. “There’s a lot of fear right now.”

Khaki has been expanding the “Know Your Rights” program for the city to ensure people feel a “strong sense of safety and understanding.”

“It’s recognizing that there are immigrant communities that are really fearful of the various changes that are happening at the federal and the state level,” Khaki said. “As a human being who comes from this community, who understands those fears, I really recognize that we have to meet the moment and continue to evolve and understand that almost day-to-day, things are changing.”",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/07-21-25_pro-bono-immigration-help_JulianaBrandao.png,N,,2025-08-26 00:56:32.923402

In Washington, hundreds of DACA recipients, also known as ""Dreamers,"" will still be able to participate in the state’s health exchange. But they'll lose out on about $350 per month of additional federal benefits, according to the state's health benefits exchange. These benefits are federal tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies from the federal government that DACA recipients pay into with jobs they get with work authorization.

DACA first started as a program for children without legal status, so that they were protected from removal proceedings while they attended and completed high school or enrolled in the military when it was briefly allowed. They also received work authorization through the program as they got older. Many of those DACA recipients are now adults with U.S. citizen children of their own.

In 2024, the Biden administration changed the definition of ""lawfully present"" for Affordable Care Act eligibility so that DACA recipients were allowed to participate in state and federal health exchanges. But the Trump administration announced it was reversing that rule change in June.

""We could also see an increase in emergency room visits because of people foregoing preventive treatment,"" she added. ""These circumstances can strain the health care system and lead to challenges in providing timely, high-quality care and access to services.""

Washington DACA recipients who are currently in the state’s health exchange will still be able to keep their health insurance, Alongi said, and they're being notified of what will change for them.

For DACA recipients who need health insurance but can’t afford it, the state has already expanded its own health insurance program to provide Medicaid-like benefits to people without legal status who are considered low income.

That means those DACA recipients could get health insurance through the state. But there's a catch: The program has a waitlist of people wanting to apply.

Brian Kemp’s office announced Monday.

National Guard planners and ICE officials in Georgia are working to develop a support plan and implementation timeline.

Guard personnel will conduct training mid-September, ""And should be on duty shortly thereafter,” at several facilities across the state, the governor’s office said in a news release.

The duties of the Georgia National Guard personnel would include “administrative and logistic support tasks and requirements could include, but are not limited to, appointment scheduling, biometric collection, data entry, performing basic vehicle maintenance, and tracking vehicle fleet expenses/utilization.”

Supporting the tasks would allow more ICE agents to be in the field.

The soldiers and airmen “will remain under the control and direction of the Governor and Adjutant General of Georgia.”

The deployment is separate from the “D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force” mission.

“The GANG has a long history of partnering with federal, state and local agencies to ensure the safety and security of our communities, our state, and our nation,” Kemp’s office said.

The governor’s statement came amid reports that President Donald Trump was planning to deploy the National Guard to other major Democratic cities, including Baltimore, Chicago and New York. It also comes after the National Guard was deployed to Washington, D.C., with guns.

A statement from the Georgia National Guard clarified that it “currently has no units in support of the mission” in Washington, D.C.

Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey responded to the announcement Monday night: “Brian Kemp’s decision to deploy Georgia National Guard soldiers to respond to a manufactured crisis is a reckless abuse of state resources and a transparent ploy to win favor with Donald Trump and his MAGA base. Our state’s National Guard members signed up to respond to natural disasters and defend America in war, not be used by Brian Kemp as props in his political theater. They, and the Georgians they bravely stepped up to serve, deserve far better than this misuse of their sacrifice.”

In addition to receiving cease-and-desist orders from several states (Arizona, Illinois, Montana, and Ohio), and ongoing litigation against New Jersey state gaming regulators in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, KalshiEx LLC (Kalshi) is also now embroiled in litigation with regulators in Maryland and Nevada. Kalshi operates as a designated contract market, which allows adults in all 50 states to make financial trades on a broad range of topics — from sports to the weather.

Nevada

Earlier this year, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) issued a cease-and-desist order to Kalshi, notifying the company that it is unlawful to offer event-based contracts on sporting events and election unless it holds an approved license by the Nevada Gaming Commission. In response, Kalshi filed a federal lawsuit stating that it was not required to comply with state gaming laws because those laws were effectively preempted by the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and that it falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). A federal judge in the case granted Kalshi a significant win by temporarily enjoining NGCB from putting a halt to Kalshi’s sports-related futures contracts while the case was ongoing. In making this ruling, the court found, among other things, that Kalshi was likely to prevail on the merits when the case goes to trial.

Maryland

Like Nevada, Maryland’s Lottery and Gaming Control Agency issued a cease-and-desist order to Kalshi, alleging that the company was illegally offering sports gambling without a license. As the company did in Nevada, Kalshi sued Maryland’s gaming regulators in federal court and similarly argued that it was under the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC and that state law was preempted by the CEA.

However, in contrast to the Nevada proceedings, the district court in Maryland denied Kalshi’s request to stop Maryland’s gaming regulators from blocking Kalshi from offering its sports event contracts. The court’s ruling explained that it does not see a clear distinction between Kalshi’s sports event contracts and sports betting. Kalshi immediately filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

Why It Matters

The regulatory scrutiny and litigation facing Kalshi highlight a growing tension not just between courts in different judicial circuits, but between federal and state oversight of financial products. If courts side with state regulators, platforms like Kalshi may face significant operational hurdles and fragmented compliance requirements across different states. Conversely, a ruling favoring federal preemption could pave the way for broader adoption of event-based contracts nationwide. The outcomes of these cases could set important precedents for how similar platforms are regulated in the future, potentially reshaping the boundaries of federal preemption under the CEA and the jurisdiction of the CFTC, and opening new markets to businesses like Kalshi, including in states that have traditionally prohibited or strictly regulated sports wagering.

Brian Kemp announced Monday.

The request to support ICE in Georgia is not related to President Donald Trump's recent decision to deploy National Guard troops in Washington, D.C.

Kemp also emphasized that assigning the Georgia National Guard to work with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies is nothing new. The governor sent Guard troops to the Texas border with Mexico early last year, accusing the Biden administration of failing to secure the border.

""Under the bad policies of the prior administration, every state became a border state,"" he said. ""I was one of the first to mobilize both personnel and policies to crack down on illegal immigration. ... Georgia has led on this front for years and will continue to do so through this latest measure while still meeting all responsibilities and duties the Guard has to the state.""

The Georgia Guard troops will not conduct law enforcement functions or make arrests. Rather, they will be providing administrative and logistical support, including appointment scheduling, biometric collection, data entry, and performing basic vehicle maintenance in order to free up ICE personnel for law enforcement activities.

Nonetheless, Democrats criticized the deployment decision as unconstitutional and unsustainable.

“As a retired naval officer, it goes against my core values and principles to use Georgia’s National Guard for purposes beyond its lawful duties,"" said Georgia Rep. Derrick Jackson of Tyrone, one of several Democrats vying to succeed the term-limited Kemp as governor.

""I believe the brave men and women in uniform did not take an oath to use force against our citizens in the United States. Let me be crystal clear: the purpose of the Georgia National Guard is to defend against foreign threats and aid in natural disasters.""

Despite Abrego Garcia’s new detention on Monday, a blanket court order automatically pauses any effort by the Trump administration to immediately deport him and other immigrants who are challenging their detention.

Any immigrant seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court is covered by the order, which blocks their removal from the US until 16:00 (20:00 GMT) on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed. In June, the administration sued all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges to challenge the standard order.

Immigration officials in the US say they intend to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, according to a court filing Saturday, in what the man’s legal team describes as an act of “vindictiveness” by Trump’s administration.

Uganda, the east African nation where the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to deport him, recently agreed to a deal to accept certain deportees from the US.

The court filing said the idea of sending Abrego Garcia to Uganda came after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national, spoke at a rally before he turned himself in: “This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Abrego Garcia entered the offices of ICE in a downtown office building on Monday. His wife emerged without him a few minutes later with tears in her eyes.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said a lawsuit had been filed in a federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention, asking for an order that he not be deported. “I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

The face of Trump’s hardline immigration policies

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.

He then became the highest-profile case among more than 200 people sent to the notorious El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison as part of Trump’s crackdown on refugees, migrants and asylum seekers in the US. His case remains a major flashpoint for the Trump administration in its anti-immigration crackdown.

Department of Justice lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran citizen had been wrongly deported due to an “administrative error”.

Abrego Garcia was severely beaten and subjected to psychological torture in the El Salvador prison, his lawyers say.

The alleged abuse was detailed in court documents filed in Abrego Garcia’s civil lawsuit against the Trump administration in June, providing an account of his experiences following his deportation for the first time.

Abrego Garcia – who denies any wrongdoing – now stands accused of involvement in smuggling undocumented refugees and migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and other countries into the US between 2016 and earlier this year.

His trial in his human smuggling case is set to begin in January 2027.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member.

He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and asked a judge to dismiss the case on grounds of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee. He returned to his family in Maryland.

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his lawyers, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25234691293535-1755891766.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-25 20:57:13.650355

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit to fight his deportation until a court has heard his claim for protection, stating that the U.S. could place him in a country where “his safety cannot be assured.”

The lawsuit triggered a blanket court order that automatically pauses deportation efforts for two days. The order applies to immigrants in Maryland who are challenging their detention.

Within hours of Abrego Garcia’s detention, his lawyers spoke with Department of Justice attorneys and a federal judge in Maryland, who warned that Abrego Garcia cannot be removed from the U.S. “at this juncture” because he must be allowed to exercise his constitutional right to contest deportation.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said that overlapping court orders temporarily prohibit the government from removing Abrego Garcia, and that she would extend her own temporary restraining order barring his deportation.

Drew Ensign, a Justice Department attorney, told the judge that he understands Abrego Garcia’s “removal is not imminent” and that the process often takes time.

About 200 people gathered, prayed and crowded around Abrego Garcia while he walked into the offices for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore, where he was detained. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him, the crowd yelled, “Shame!”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi told Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office that Abrego Garcia “will no longer terrorize our country.”

Brief reunion with family

Abrego Garcia lived in Maryland for years with his American wife and children and worked in construction. He was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador because the Trump administration believed he was a member of the MS-13 gang, an allegation that Abrego Garcia denies.

His removal violated an immigration judge’s 2019 ruling that shielded him from deportation to his native country because he had “well-founded fear” of threats by a gang there.

Abrego Garcia’s wife sued to bring him back. Facing a U.S. Supreme Court order, the Trump administration returned him in June. He was subsequently charged in Tennessee with human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty and asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

The allegations stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Abrego Garcia was driving with nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. He was allowed to continue driving with a warning.

The Trump administration has said it wants to deport Abrego Garcia before his trial, alleging he is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member.

A federal judge in Tennessee determined that Abrego Garcia was not a flight risk or a danger. He was released from jail Friday afternoon and returned to his family in Maryland.

Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

What’s next?

Federal officials argue that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and that the immigration judge’s 2019 ruling deemed him eligible for expulsion, just not to his native El Salvador.

Attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told reporters Monday that Abrego Garcia is being held in a detention facility in Virginia. His lawyers don’t know when he’ll have a reasonable-fear interview, where he can express fears of persecution or torture in the country the U.S. wants to send him. Officials have said it’s Uganda.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have raised concerns about human rights abuses in Uganda as well as his limited ability to speak English in a country where that’s the national language. But there are also unanswered questions about whether he could be imprisoned or sent on to El Salvador. A judge blocked the U.S. from sending Abrego Garcia back in 2019 because he faces credible threats from gangs there.

Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

“We don’t know whether Uganda will even let him walk around freely in Kampala or whether he’ll be inside of a Ugandan jail cell, much less whether they are going to let him stay,” the attorney said.

If immigration officials determine that Abrego Garcia lacks a reasonable fear of being sent to Uganda, he should be able to ask a U.S. immigration judge to review that decision, Sandoval-Moshenberg said. And if the immigration judge upholds the determination, Abrego Garcia should be able to bring it to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

Sandoval-Moshenberg said that’s the process when someone is slated for deportation to their native country. And he said it should be for third-country deportations as well.

“This is all so very new and unprecedented. ... We will see what the government’s position on that is,” he said.

Abrego Garcia informed ICE over the weekend that Costa Rica was an acceptable country of removal because he had “received assurances from Costa Rica that they would give him refugee status, that he would be at liberty in that country, and that he will not be re-deported onto El Salvador,” his lawyer said.

“Costa Rica is not justice,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “It is an acceptably less-bad option.”

The notice to ICE about Costa Rica was separate from an offer made by federal prosecutors in Tennessee to send Abrego Garcia to the Central American nation in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

An employee at Stanford Hospital who did not wish to be named confirmed that ICE arrived at the emergency room just before noon on Monday.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested two people in East Palo Alto Monday morning and entered Stanford Hospital in an attempt to arrest another person, according to San Mateo and Santa Clara County Rapid Response Networks.

Family members of the two people arrested in East Palo Alto did not wish to share further details about the arrests that the San Mateo County Rapid Response Network said were targeted.

“They did not pick people up from the street, so it wasn’t random,” said an operator with the San Mateo County network, who declined to be named, citing concerns over personal safety. “They came looking for a particular address and picked up particular people. It wasn’t like a raid, where they were picking up people off the street.”

Federal agents notified the East Palo Alto Police Department when they arrived in the early hours of Monday morning, said Police Chief Jeff Liu, who was unaware why they were in the area.

“We do not work with ICE,” he wrote in a message. “They left town after the arrest. I didn’t know they arrested two people.”

While past police raids have been mistaken for ICE activity, Monday’s confirmed ICE sightings sparked fear on social media platforms like Facebook, where East Palo Alto residents shared videos purportedly of the arrests.

The Santa Clara County Rapid Response network verified that ICE entered Stanford Hospital to arrest one person, who was accompanied by an attorney, but could not confirm the person’s identity.

Stanford Hospital spokeswoman Lisa Kim said the federal agencies came to the hospital to bring in an individual who needed medical attention. She said there were no arrests made at Stanford.

The Palo Alto Police Department confirmed to this publication that ICE provided a “courtesy notification” to the department, notifying police that they would be at Stanford Hospital.

Assistant Police Chief James Reifschneider said the notification was routine for local and federal law enforcement agencies.

“They did not request our assistance nor did we provide any,” Reifschneider said in an email.

Palo Alto police did not have any information about the individual who ICE was looking for, he said. While ICE informed the city of the agency’s presence, it did not provide information on whether it ultimately detained or arrested the individual in Palo Alto, Reifschneider said.

“To the best of our knowledge, we do not believe ICE has made any arrests in Palo Alto this year,” he said.

The modern debate over amici isn’t an abstract fight about court culture; it’s playing out in the highest-stakes cases, with business groups and federal regulators often on opposite sides of the “v.” Consider the Supreme Court’s decision last Term in Diamond Alternative Energy, where Justice Jackson warned in dissent that decisions about who gets in the courthouse door risk “beget[ting] judicial overreach” and feeding “the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens.” In the same opinion, she cautioned that the Court must avoid any “appearance of favoritism toward well-heeled litigants,” a concern that lands squarely on the terrain where heavyweight amici and the United States regularly collide.

Outside the courtroom, the political branches are watching—and pointing to concrete flashpoints. In April 2024, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse pressed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to explain its “outrageous and unwarranted” lawsuit targeting the CFPB’s credit-card late-fee rule, casting the case as a test of whose interests are being advanced through litigation strategy.

The Role of Amici

None of this unfolds in a vacuum. Scholars have long documented what Kearney and Merrill termed the “rising tide” of amicus practice at the Supreme Court—so much so that “cases without amicus briefs have become nearly as rare as cases with amicus briefs were at the beginning of the century.” They also flagged the Court’s practical “open door” for amici: nearly all motions for leave are granted, and the briefs are widely available to the Justices and their chambers. (For more see Box-Steffensmeir et al., Larsen and Devins, and Feldman and Bruhl).

According to scholar Paul Collins, the reason the practice endures is that, for the Court, amicus briefs are not just advocacy—chambers use them to surface “new or alternative legal positions,” to digest “social scientific and factual information,” and to gauge the “policy implications” of potential rules. Scholars also describe a set of Court-facing channels where amici matter: modest effects on outcomes, contributions to the ideological direction of decisions, and—most consistently—inputs into the content and presence of opinions; at the agenda stage, the volume of amicus filings operates as a credible signal of policy stakes and is among the better predictors of cert grants. Judges and clerks, in interviews, report that high-quality amicus filings can help with technical or implementation questions and, at times, are reflected in citations or adopted arguments—uses that are practical for the Court even when the measurable effect on win-loss rates is limited.

On the ground, the players are familiar. As one of my prior overviews of the 2021 Term noted, amici “are meant to help convince the justices to vote one way or another,” and the docket is populated by repeat players—including the Chamber of Commerce—alongside the United States, the ACLU, and ideologically oriented organizations.

How This Article Proceeds

This article takes that conversation out of the abstract and into a targeted slice of Supreme Court work where these dynamics are most visible: merits cases from the 2022–2024 Terms in which the federal government—either the United States itself or a federal agency—is a party and interest-group amici filed. It is not a study of “amicus success” in the aggregate. Instead, this article focuses on two practitioner-facing questions: first, how frequently particular interest groups aligned with the government’s litigating position (and whether those alignments shift when “the government” is disaggregated into the United States versus federal agencies), and second, how often individual Justices aligned with those same groups in these government-party cases.

It is also worth noting that the data entirely consist of cases decided during the Biden Presidency and the amici’s positions should be taken with the understanding that they were filed based on this administration’s positions. This article does not make normative claims; it describes which groups most often align with government positions. Also, the data is based on the Supreme Court’s dockets, so groups that are listed as “et al.” in the docket are not directly mentioned or measured in this piece.

The data, consisting of 1,192 briefs filed in 82 cases (averaging 14.5 briefs per case) that follow are designed for lawyers who brief, litigate, and advise around the federal government’s position—showing which repeat players file most often in these cases, where their alignments actually sit, and which comparisons are clear enough to plan around.

Who Files and Why It Matters: Top Interest-Group Amici

This article focuses on repeat players—named interest-group amici that file frequently when the federal government is a party—and uses a simple descriptive metric: the share of their filings that aligned with the government’s litigating position (combining the United States and federal agencies for this section).

At the hearing on Monday, Xinis stressed that the government was “absolutely forbidden at this juncture” from removing Abrego Garcia from the United States.
""ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia & are processing him for deportation,"" the White House said in a social media post.
Abrego Garcia claims he was beaten, tortured Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported and taken to the Terrorism Confinement Center, also known as CECOT, in Tecoluca, El Salvador, in March.
The filing also says that Abrego Garcia experienced ""severe sleep deprivation"" and nutrition so inadequate that he lost 31 pounds.","A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia for a second time – after he was wrongfully removed to El Salvador earlier this year.

District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland ruled from the bench on Monday, Aug. 25, that the government cannot deport Abrego Garcia until she can hold a hearing on his latest lawsuit challenging his deportation.

Xinis’ order came just hours after U.S. immigration agents detained Abrego Garcia when he reported to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore for what his attorneys had been told was a mandatory check-in. Agents detained him within 60 seconds of his arrival, said his attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg.

Abrego Garcia’s detention is the latest chapter in a case that started back in March when he was stopped near his home in Maryland and deported to a Salvadoran mega-prison. The case has fueled outrage over the Trump administration’s hardline deportation policies.

Abrego Garcia has spent more than five months in detention, including time in his native El Salvador at a prison known for its harsh conditions. Last week, he was released from criminal custody in Tennessee and returned to his home in the Washington suburb of Beltsville, Maryland.

At the hearing on Monday, Xinis stressed that the government was “absolutely forbidden at this juncture” from removing Abrego Garcia from the United States.

The government's attorney, Drew Ensign, said Abrego Garcia's deportation was not imminent and that it takes time to remove someone to another country. Still, the administration is adamant that he will not be allowed to remain in the United States.

""ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia & are processing him for deportation,"" the White House said in a social media post. ""@POTUS is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, & child predator to terrorize American citizens..."" - @Sec_Noem.""

Abrego Garcia, who has repeatedly denied those claims, arrived at the ICE office Monday with his wife and brother and was quickly surrounded by a crowd of supporters chanting ""Si se puede,"" Spanish for ""Yes we can."" He and his wife embraced in the building's lobby before proceeding through a security checkpoint.

Where is Abrego Garcia being held? Where could he be deported?

Sandoval-Moshenberg said his client is being held in a detention facilitiy in Virginia. U.S. officials have offered to deport him to Costa Rica if he pleads guilty to transporting migrants living illegally in the United States, his lawyers say. When he declined to enter a guilty plea, the U.S. government warned he could be deported to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers say they have entered plea discussions with the government to avoid deportation to Uganda, which they say would be ""far more dangerous"" than Costa Rica.

""They're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. ""They're weaponizing the immigration system in a way that's completely unconstitutional.""

'An acceptably less bad option'

Before his check-in with ICE, Abrego Garcia notified the government in writing that Costa Rica would be an acceptable country for the United States to send him after he received assurances from Costa Rica that he would be given refugee status there and would not be deported back to El Salvador, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

""For him to be removed to Costa Rica is not justice,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said, ""it is an acceptably less bad option.""

Xinis suggested during the hearing that, if Abrego Garcia is deported, federal law may require that he be sent to his country of choice, especially since Costa Rica has agreed to grant him refugee status and not send him back to El Salvador.

Abrego Garcia also filed a second notice with the U.S. government saying he feared removal to Uganda because of human rights abuses in that country and the lack of assurances that Uganda would not send him back to El Salvador, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

Because of that notice, Abrego Garcia is entitled to an interview, Sandoval-Moshenberg said, and the U.S. government cannot remove him from the country until that interview is granted.

Abrego Garcia claims he was beaten, tortured

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported and taken to the Terrorism Confinement Center, also known as CECOT, in Tecoluca, El Salvador, in March. The Trump administration has admitted in court documents that the deportation was a mistake, which it blamed it on an “administrative error.”

Abrego Garcia experienced ""severe beatings"" and ""psychological torture"" in the notorious high-security prison, his lawyers said in a court filing last month. The filing also says that Abrego Garcia experienced ""severe sleep deprivation"" and nutrition so inadequate that he lost 31 pounds.

Lawsuit filed in Maryland seeking to ban deportation

Abrego Garcia has filed a federal lawsuit in Maryland seeking an order to ban deporting him anywhere unless he has had the chance to contest being sent there. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has blamed “activist liberal judges” for blocking administration efforts to remove people living in the U.S. illegally who were suspected of committing crimes.

“By ordering this monster loose on America’s streets, this judge has shown a complete disregard for the safety of the American people,” Noem said. “We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.”

Trump administration has focused on Abrego Garcia

Abrego Garcia, a sheetmetal worker living in suburban Washington, became the face of President Donald Trump's sweeping and controversial deportation tactics.

Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally around 2012 as a teen. Immigration officials issued a final order of removal in 2019, but they said he could not be released to his home country of El Salvador because of credible fears of persecution by gangs in that country.

What Colorado laws does the Trump administration take issue with?
While it makes no mention about immigration enforcement, SB20-083 was signed into law just a year later.","DENVER — Gov. Jared Polis defended state laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement as he defied calls by the Trump administration to eliminate such laws or face legal consequences.

Earlier this month, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened Gov. Polis with legal action and the pulling of federal funds if he failed to respond by Aug. 19 with initiatives he was taking to rescind those laws.

In response, Polis rejected the idea that Colorado was a “sanctuary state,” saying he was “frustrated by the administration's mislabeling… despite conclusive evidence to the contrary,” and asked Bondi to remove the state from a list curated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) describing it as such.

“If ‘so-called sanctuary jurisdiction policies’ have ‘undermined this necessary cooperation and obstructed federal immigration enforcement,’ elsewhere in the country we cannot say, but that has not happened and is not happening here,” the response from Gov. Polis reads. “Thankfully, Colorado is not a sanctuary state.”

Polis then defended the legality of Colorado law, saying the state “fully cooperates with federal authorities in identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminals – regardless of immigration status,” and cited the recent signing of SB25-276 into law, which allows for state and local officials to share information with federal government to assist in criminal investigations or proceedings.

But the governor was also defiant in his response to Bondi as the government seeks to ramp up mass deportations — a key signature policy of the second Trump administration.

“Colorado, like many states, will not allow the federal government to commandeer our public safety resources, and our right to do so is protected by the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution,” the governor wrote, adding state laws require compliance with “valid federal laws.”

Read the full response from Gov. Polis here or in the embed below.

The Tenth Amendment establishes the bounds of the federal government’s authority by balancing its vast power against state sovereignty.

That power has been challenged in court rulings over the past 30 years, which have repeatedly found that the federal government cannot compel states and local jurisdictions to carry out or enforce federal immigration policies. Other rulings have found that threatening states with federal funding cuts is likely unconstitutional, according to the National Immigration Forum.

That hasn’t stopped the Department of Justice from trying to get Colorado and other jurisdictions to eliminate its laws limiting cooperation with U.S. and Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) — with little success.

In late July, a federal judge threw out a Trump administration lawsuit against Illinois and the City of Chicago to upend so-called “sanctuary policies” that interfered with Trump’s mass deportation plans, calling the suit an “end-run around the Tenth Amendment.”

And just last Friday, a second federal judge ruled the Trump administration cannot deny federal funding to cities like Denver because of policies that limit cooperation with ICE, saying in his ruling the executive orders enacted by the Trump administration to do as such were an unconstitutional “coercive threat.”

In a statement, Polis spokeswoman Ally Sullivan decried the state’s labeling as a sanctuary state as well as “the lack of transparency from the federal administration on this and many other items,” while outlining the governor’s focus on improving public safety and apprehending dangerous criminals — whether they are in the country legally or not.

“The Governor encourages the federal administration – and Congress – to focus on actually securing the border, decreasing violent crime, increasing transparency, and passing real immigration reform,” she said.

What Colorado laws does the Trump administration take issue with?

Since taking full control of the state government in 2019, Colorado Democrats have passed several laws aimed at making life easier for undocumented immigrants.

In 2019, Polis signed HB19-1124, one of the most oft cited laws by Colorado Republicans unhappy with the state’s immigration policies. Officially known as the “Protect Colorado Residents From Federal Government Overreach Act,” the law prevents law enforcement officers from arresting or detaining someone on the basis of their immigration status or holding someone past their release from jail just so they can be immediately detained by immigration agents.

While it makes no mention about immigration enforcement, SB20-083 was signed into law just a year later. The law protects individuals from being arrested for civil infractions while they are inside a courthouse or while on their way to or from court proceedings.

In 2021, Gov. Polis then signed SB21-131 into law, which prohibits state employees from looking into a person’s immigration status and sharing that information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), unless it’s to comply with a court-issued subpoena, warrant or order.

Two years later, Polis signed HB23-1100 into law, which further restricts state cooperation with immigration enforcement officials by prohibiting any state agency or local government from entering into agreements with private entities for the detention of in individuals in immigration detention facilities.

Earlier this year, Polis signed the latest measure expanding protections for immigrants without legal status. SB25-276 prohibits local government officials and employees from sharing personal identifying information about someone’s immigration status with ICE, and limits where immigration agents can go within a public child care facility, school, hospital or library without a warrant signed by a judge.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/66c9454/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x2873+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2F4b%2F73b2622a4c9f9087de6cb265c418%2Fap-20203752374316.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 19:56:41.478776

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March and then sent back to the United States, was arrested in Baltimore on Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on X.

Abrego Garcia, 30, who was released last week from a jail in Tennessee, where he is facing human smuggling charges, and allowed to go home to Maryland pending trial, ""will be processed for removal to Uganda,"" the Department of Homeland Security said.

Lawyers for Abrego Garcia immediately filed a lawsuit contesting his deportation and District Judge Paula Xinis temporarily blocked his removal from the country while she holds further hearings on his case.

Abrego Garcia was required to check in with ICE in Baltimore on Monday as one of the conditions of his release.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia's lawyers, told a crowd of supporters outside the ICE field office that his client was immediately taken into custody when he turned up for the appointment.

""Shame, shame,"" chanted the protestors, who were holding signs reading ""Free Kilmar"" and ""Remove Trump.""

The attempt to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda adds a new twist to a saga that became a test case for Trump's sprawling crackdown on illegal immigration -- and, critics say, his trampling of the law.

Abrego Garcia had been living in the United States under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.

Then he became one of more than 200 people sent to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison in March as part of Trump's crackdown on undocumented migrants.

But Justice Department lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran had been wrongly deported due to an ""administrative error.""

He was returned to US soil only to be detained again in Tennessee on human smuggling charges.

- 'Completely unconstitutional' -

Abrego Garcia denies any wrongdoing, while the Trump administration alleges he is a violent MS-13 gang member involved in smuggling of other undocumented migrants.

On Thursday, when it became clear that Abrego Garcia would be released the following day, government officials made him a plea offer: remain in custody, plead guilty to human smuggling and be deported to Costa Rica.

He declined the offer.

""That they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

The case has become emblematic of Trump's crackdown on illegal migration.

Right-wing supporters praise the Republican president's toughness, but legal scholars and human rights advocates have blasted what they say is a haphazard rush to deport people without even a court hearing, in violation of basic US law.

""He was doing it the right way, and they arrested him and have him in there now,"" said Alex Scheel, member of About Face: Veterans Against the War. ""His detainment is totally unjustified. He was going to his regular appointments.""

Scheel says he didn't know Zahid personally, but understands his advocacy as a fellow veteran.

""We all learn lessons in the miliary. We all have different experiences, but us in ""About Face"" and ""Veterans for Peace"" understand that the wars that happen over there, the occupations that happen over in Palestine and Iraq and Afghanistan and Somalia all over the world, come back and haunt us,"" said Scheel.

Romero says the protest Sunday is part of ""a week of action"" by WACAN.

As for next steps, Melissa says Zahid was given a stay by a judge from the 9th circuit court, so the family is working on getting him released so he can work on his legal case from home.

""We are asking the judge for a custody re-determination, saying he does not have to be kept behind bars. He has always shown up for all of his hearings. He’s not a flight risk, not a threat. Bring him back to us while things work their way through,"" said Melissa.

""If we believe in the constitution, then immigration is a civil matter, not criminal, and no one should be kept behind bars like this.""

FOX 13 reached out to ICE to ask why he was detained, and we are waiting to hear back.

Attorney General James argues these policies unlawfully endanger families, undermine public safety for all New Yorkers, and threaten the integrity of the justice system.

Attorney General James emphasizes that New York has already fought and won against unlawful courthouse arrests.","NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today took action to stop U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) alarming practice of making arrests in federal immigration courthouses. In an amicus brief filed in African Communities Together v. Lyons, Attorney General James urged the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to block new federal policies that authorize widespread arrests in immigration courthouses and allow the federal government to abruptly dismiss immigrants’ cases. Attorney General James argues these policies unlawfully endanger families, undermine public safety for all New Yorkers, and threaten the integrity of the justice system.

“Courthouses are dedicated to the pursuit of justice, not targeted harassment and arrests,” said Attorney General James. “With these cruel and unlawful courthouse arrests, the federal government is weaponizing fear to push immigrants into the shadows, drive families apart, and risk everyone’s safety. I will not stand by while New Yorkers are stripped of their rights and our courts are used for intimidation.”

Attorney General James argues that arresting individuals as they appear for immigration hearings chills participation not only in immigration court, but across the entire justice system. As a result of this unlawful policy, immigrant New Yorkers are more likely to be afraid to testify in state and local courts, pursue orders of protection against their abusers, or generally participate in critical court hearings. This chilling effect makes it harder for prosecutors to hold criminals accountable and denies victims their day in court, undermining public safety for all New Yorkers.

Attorney General James explains that because these policies prevent immigrants from pursuing their immigration cases without risking arrest and deportation, they drive people into the shadows, where fear prevents families from reporting crimes, seeking health care, or accessing other vital services. This erosion of trust leaves entire communities more vulnerable to violence, exploitation, and public health risks. When parents are too afraid to bring their children to the doctor, communicable diseases spread more easily; when families avoid schools or places of worship, children’s education and community ties suffer. Attorney General James underscores the dire consequences of these fears, pointing to a tragic case in which a child died after his parents delayed seeking medical care because they feared hospital officials would report them to immigration authorities.

The brief also highlights the devastating toll these policies take on families and communities. Attorney General James argues that millions of immigrants, including 640,000 undocumented New Yorkers, are essential to the state’s workforce, tax base, and civic life. These courthouse arrests and detentions – which are occurring before the immigrants have a chance to prove their legal right to remain in the United States – rip parents from their children, destabilize households, and impose deep and lasting trauma. Arbitrary courthouse arrests and case dismissals are especially harmful to children who are left to cope with financial instability, food and housing insecurity, and the loss of a primary caregiver. Research shows that these children face extreme psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD, effects that often persist well into adulthood. As a result, states are forced to shoulder the burden, providing costly social services and support to families left in crisis.

Attorney General James emphasizes that New York has already fought and won against unlawful courthouse arrests. In 2020, Attorney General James secured a landmark ruling preventing the first Trump administration from making civil immigration arrests in and around state courthouses, and that same year, New York codified that protection through the Protect Our Courts Act. Attorney General James argues that the federal government’s new policies, however, revive many of the same harms New York’s laws were designed to end, now targeting immigrants in federal immigration courthouses.

Attorney General James is urging the court to stay enforcement of these dangerous and unlawful policies while litigation continues, to protect immigrant rights and safeguard the integrity of courts in New York and across the country.",https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/oag-social-preview.png,N,,2025-08-25 17:56:49.470703

America is a country that prizes freedom and the rule of law. Yet every day, we hear news of ICE raids on construction sites, Venezuelans shipped to foreign prisons without hearings, and sports tattoos treated as proof of criminality. As Agustina Vergara Cid warns in “Immigration Enforcement and the Betrayal of Due Process,” Americans have been turning a blind eye to this lawless, even authoritarian treatment. Delivered at the 2025 Objectivist Summer Conference, her talk is now available online.

While the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has made the headlines recently, Vergara Cid shows that the same lawlessness has spanned decades. The Obama administration, notorious for its record deportations, simply carried forward policies Congress had long codified.

Trump’s crackdowns threaten to further erode due process, which Vergara Cid identifies as the crucial legal safeguard which “stands between you and authoritarianism.” Today’s victims are peaceful immigrants; tomorrow, the target could be any American who dares to challenge the state.

Öztürk, a Turkish national and PhD student at Tufts University, was detained this spring and held in an ICE facility in Louisiana for six weeks before a federal judge ordered her release.

Öztürk was arrested under a rarely invoked statute after she co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper supporting student government resolutions critical of Israel's military conduct in Gaza. In her habeas petition, she asserted that the government had retaliated against her for exercising her protected First Amendment rights.

""Without presuming to speak for all of Jewish America—a diverse community that holds a multitude of viewpoints—amici are compelled to file this brief because the detention of Rümeysa Öztürk for her protected speech violated the most basic constitutional rights,"" the organizations say in their brief, emphasizing that freedom of expression, particularly on matters of public concern, is a cornerstone of American democracy and extends to academic settings and campus discourse.

In the appeal, the government is arguing that the Immigration and Nationality Act stripped the Vermont federal court of the right to review Öztürk's habeas petition and that she was first required to pursue her First Amendment claims in immigration court before obtaining a federal court hearing. As amici emphasize, meaningful review of First Amendment claims generally means rapid, prioritized review. ""Further, any regime under which Öztürk remains in detention for months despite a fundamental violation of her First Amendment rights sends a strong signal to all other potential noncitizen speakers that they risk detention, however ultimately unlawful, if they raise their voices in protest.""

The brief also expresses concern regarding any suggestion that actions taken against Öztürk are necessary to combat antisemitism: ""The government . . . appears to be exploiting Jewish Americans' legitimate concerns about antisemitism as pretext for undermining core pillars of American democracy, the rule of law, and the fundamental rights of free speech and academic debate on which this nation was built.""

Drawing on historical context, amici note that many Jewish Americans are especially attuned to the dangers of government actions taken in response to political expression, emphasizing that the protection of free speech has long served as a safeguard for minority communities in the United States, and that its erosion, particularly when connected to academic or political discourse, warrants close scrutiny.

The Trump administration has alleged Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, but his lawyers have said there is no evidence he is in that gang.
According to his lawyers, Abrego Garcia has not been convicted of a crime — he was only charged with smuggling unauthorized immigrants after his return from El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison, which was reportedly described by a warden there as a “cemetery of the living dead.” Abrego Garcia has protested his innocence.
Abrego Garcia reportedly declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, but DHS said in a separate post on X they would process him for deportation to Uganda.
“The government is paying other countries to take immigrants, as if these people are goods that can be bartered.","(OSV News) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident at the center of a high-profile immigration case, surrendered to U.S. immigration authorities in Baltimore on Aug. 25, and faces possible deportation to Uganda, a nation that recently agreed to accept certain deportees from the U.S., even those that have no ties to the country like Abrego Garcia.

His detention comes just days after he was released from a jail in Tennessee on Aug. 22, more than five months after his arrest and deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador that U.S. courts later found unlawful. He returned to his family in Maryland, and was expected to be detained at his check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, on Aug. 25.

J. Kevin Appleby, senior fellow for policy at the Center for Migration Studies in New York and the former director of migration policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, told OSV News, “Deporting him to Uganda far away from his family reveals the cruelty embedded in this administration’s immigration policies.”

“It sends a signal that this administration will stop at nothing to remove certain immigrants, even if they have a legal basis to remain,” Appleby said. “Part of the message to immigrants here is self deport or we will send you to a third country on another continent. He is being used to create even greater fear among immigrants, even those with legal status.”

Although the government acknowledged in court filings that there was an administrative error in deporting Abrego Garcia to a prison in El Salvador, the Trump administration said it was not seeking his return to the U.S. Abrego Garcia, who is married to a U.S. citizen and has a 5-year-old child, has not been convicted of a crime.

The Trump administration has alleged Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, but his lawyers have said there is no evidence he is in that gang.

In a post on X, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, “ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and are processing him for deportation.”

“President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,” she said.

According to his lawyers, Abrego Garcia has not been convicted of a crime — he was only charged with smuggling unauthorized immigrants after his return from El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison, which was reportedly described by a warden there as a “cemetery of the living dead.” Abrego Garcia has protested his innocence.

Abrego Garcia reportedly declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, but DHS said in a separate post on X they would process him for deportation to Uganda.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to carry out deportations of some immigrants, who lack legal authorization to live and work in the U.S., that are “known as “third-country removals.” The people subject to these orders are sent to countries not specifically identified in their removal orders or to countries with which they have no preexisting ties.

Vivana Westbrook, state and local advocacy attorney for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, also known as CLINIC, said in a statement shared with OSV News, “We are deeply disappointed in the treatment of not only Kilmar, but so many others across the country who are being separated from their families and kept in deplorable conditions in detention centers within the United States.”

“Our values as a Catholic community to uphold the dignity of every person are directly contrary to the prospect of sending immigrants to third countries where they have no family or friendly connections, where they do not know the culture, where they could be separated from their loved ones by thousands of miles, where there could be severe human rights problems or conflict zones, where they might even remain in detention, and often, where they do not speak the language,” Westbrook said. “The government is paying other countries to take immigrants, as if these people are goods that can be bartered. We do not have access to those agreements so have no assurance that these countries will respect the basic human rights of the people they receive.”

“The cruelty and vindictive treatment of migrants needs to be widely rejected,” Westbrook added. “We need to demand better from our political leaders.”

Jaime Contreras, 32BJ SEIU executive vice president and SEIU Latino Caucus chair, said in a statement, “Trump’s unrelenting and inhumane hunt to single out an individual and ignoring court decisions is not just un-constitutional but puts all Americans in danger.”

“Deporting Kilmar Garcia halfway around the world is a shameful and is a shocking picture for the entire world to see that damages our standing in the world even further,” Contreras said. “The bottom line is that Garcia deserves to be free.”

OSV News reached out to the Baltimore Archdiocese for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church instructs that the “more prosperous nations are obliged, to the extent they are able, to welcome the foreigner in search of the security and the means of livelihood which he cannot find in his country of origin.” The Catholic Church’s teaching also makes clear human laws regulating migration are also subject to divine justice, but it has not yet issued official teaching exploring the morality of deportation beyond the magisterium of St. John Paul II.

The late pontiff’s 1993 encyclical “Veritatis Splendor” (“Splendor of Truth”) and 1995 encyclical “Evangelium Vitae” (“The Gospel of Life”) both quote the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes,” the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, naming “deportation” — without defining it — among various specific acts “offensive to human dignity” that “are a disgrace, and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer injustice, and they are a negation of the honor due to the Creator.”

Being attorney general of a blue state during a Trump administration has proved to be a high-stakes launching pad.","Attorneys general from around New England struck a defiant posture at a town hall gathering on a recent Friday evening.

Together they pledged that nothing is off the table when it comes to holding immigration officials accountable, lauded the courts for standing firm so far, and pointed at an ever-growing pile of litigation targeting the Trump administration’s actions on everything from energy policy to anti-discrimination law.

“All of us probably have a target on our back,” Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said, speaking from the IBEW Local 103 union hall in Dorchester. “But we say bring it on.”

The town hall included the region’s Democratic AGs — Campbell, William Tong of Connecticut, Peter Neronha of Rhode Island, Charity Clark of Vermont and Aaron Frey of Maine. Billed as “United in Justice,” the gathering was distinctly aimed at Trump administration policies that the group has declared will damage the region and its residents.

Attorneys general, advocacy organizations, and individuals have leveled dozens of lawsuits at the Trump administration. They say that executive actions targeting immigration, the global economy, public health and scientific research funding, higher education, and marginalized groups are “unlawful” and “damaging.”

“After last November’s election and the anxiety that goes with it, we all felt our fight was gonna get a little tougher, a little steeper, and our work a lot harder,” said introductory speaker Lou Antonellis, business manager of the Dorchester union and executive vice president of the building and construction trades with the Greater Boston Labor Council. “And those words ring truer and truer every day for Americans because of this administration. Unless, of course, you’re rich.”

A union member at the town hall noted the administration’s antagonism toward renewable energy options, when unions are training their members on offshore wind work. Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in Boston federal court this month to block Trump’s pause on all federal wind-energy approvals.

Being attorney general of a blue state during a Trump administration has proved to be a high-stakes launching pad. Gov. Maura Healey made a national name for herself as attorney general by, like her successor Campbell, taking an aggressive stance toward the first Trump presidency. Her office sued the administration nearly 100 times, while Campbell has filed more than a dozen suits against the administration in the first 100 days of the new Trump term.

Immigration’s ‘tricky spot’

State law enforcement officials are in a tricky spot when it comes to defending against some federal policies, the attorneys general noted, especially around immigration. Multiple attendees asked what the state can do to push back on what one described as an “autocratic police state.”

There is significant federal authority to enforce and create immigration policies, placing the attorneys general in “uncharted territory” in figuring out how to wield state power against federal actors.

The offices are putting out guidance for individuals and organizations, fighting against policy changes that would claw back immigration protections like Temporary Protected Status, connecting people with lawyers, and reminding law enforcement that it does not need to enable Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Campbell spoke complimentarily of the decision by Worcester’s police chief to request that charges be dropped against the distraught 16-year-old daughter of a woman arrested in an ICE incident that has drawn intense backlash.

But “nothing is off the table” when it comes to pushing back on ICE oversteps, she said.

“If the US attorney can threaten us about us getting in the way of these policies and immigration enforcement, well guess what? We can bring it back,” Campbell said, adding slyly, “in a collaborative and loving way.”

Neronha, of Rhode Island, said withholding cooperation to federal agents looking to “commandeer” state law enforcement could be a serious impediment to ICE efforts.

He also laid out how he sees the administration’s playbook in general: bypass congressional power of the purse, strip allocated taxpayer dollars from essential programs or make sweeping declarations on constitutional matters, and challenge the legitimacy of district courts when they issue nationwide injunctions blocking the president’s actions.

“What we’re dealing with here, in my view, is a creeping authoritarianism,” he said. “And it’s not really creeping, is it?” To constituents who are looking for hope, he asked that they remember “every day there are lawyers who get up in the morning, like my colleagues here and all across the country in Democratic states, and fight for you. We are your lawyers. We are fighting for you, and we are winning.”

The latest legal volley from a collective of Democratic attorneys general – including the five New England AGs participating in the town hall – challenges a federal threat to withhold billions of dollars in transportation and disaster-relief funds unless states agree to cooperate with certain immigration enforcement actions.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in an emailed statement to Axios that no funding has been withheld.

New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella, who was elected president of The National Association of Attorneys General in December and has not joined attorney general coalitions suing the Trump administration during this second term, is the only Republican attorney general in New England and was the only regional AG not present. A spokesperson said Formella had a full schedule for New Hampshire law enforcement memorial day, but the spokesman was not aware of Friday night’s town hall.

As attorney general of the most conservative New England state – though it narrowly voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election – Formella’s office does not always split along partisan lines. He joined other Republican attorneys general in suits against former President Joe Biden, such as a volley against a vaccination-testing mandate, but also brought a civil rights lawsuit in 2024 against members of the neo-Nazi group Nationalist Social Club-131 who allegedly harassed a Concord cafe hosting drag story hours.

The day before the town hall, Campbell and Tong joined Democratic attorneys general from New Jersey, Washington, and California after US Supreme Court arguments on Trump’s executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship for the children of parents who enter the US illegally or on a temporary visa.

Tong noted on Friday that so far the “courts are holding,” but some of the voices in the current administration are still talking about potentially “de-naturalizing” American citizens like his parents, Tong said.

The case currently before the nation’s high court is ostensibly about whether lower court judges can issue injunctions halting presidential executive orders nationwide – rather than only applying to a specific set of plaintiffs who bring suits inside specific jurisdictions – but justices toyed with whether they should consider the underlying merits of the birthright citizenship suit as well.

“I think what’s most important is not just the limited argument today,” Campbell said. “It’s that everyone should care about this birthright citizenship issue. It is not just about the access to citizenship and the privileges afforded by citizenship. If they can dismantle the 14th Amendment in our Constitution, they can also dismantle the other rights and privileges afforded our residents.”

The president took to his social media platform, Truth Social, after the arguments before the Supreme Court.

“The Radical Left SleazeBags, which has no cards remaining in its illegal bag of tricks, is, in a very coordinated manner, PLAYING THE REF with regard to the United States Supreme Court,” he posted. “They lost the Election in a landslide, and with it, have totally lost their confidence and reason. They are stone cold CRAZY! I hope the Supreme Court doesn’t fall for the games they play. The people are with us in bigger numbers than ever before. They want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”

Trump continued lashing out throughout Friday after the US Supreme Court maintained a block on his deportations under wartime law.

The US government is ultimately “an honor system,” Tong said, constructed of people bound together by belief and commitment to democratic principles. No higher power is going to force Trump to comply with the rule of law, but the country is too diverse and decentralized to be “swallowed whole” by any one administration, he added

“Be as noisy and chaotic and boisterous as we can be,” he said, “in every state and every jurisdiction, and make it hard for them every step of the way.”

But human rights laws and other conventions can’t be cherry-picked.
Universal human rights became Labour’s defining mantra in the 1990s, when Tony Blair substituted the party’s red flag of workers’ control with the red rose of the brotherhood of man.
With the nation deemed an oppressive “construct”, mass immigration guaranteed by universal human rights was seen as the means to better humanity.
That’s what the human rights culture has done.","With estimates of up to 1.2 million illegal migrants in Britain, last year 38 per cent more small boats landed on UK shores than during the previous year. More than 32,000 asylum seekers are currently accommodated in hotels, a higher number than when the government came to power.

The crisis has been exacerbated by a High Court ruling that will force the Home Office to relocate up to 138 asylum seekers from the Bell Hotel in Epping because it didn’t have planning permission to become a transit camp.

Now, other local authorities are lining up to bring similar cases to court to shut their own areas’ asylum hotels, which are acting as dangerous flashpoints for local anger. It is, therefore, hardly surprising that, according to a YouGov poll for The Times, 71 per cent of voters believe the prime minister is handling the asylum hotel issue badly, including 56 per cent of Labour voters.

Britain is the destination of choice for illegal migrants because it’s where they know they can disappear and almost never be sent back or deprived of numerous benefits. And that’s because the British courts are punctilious about observing the provisions of human rights law and other relevant international conventions.

More and more voices are now saying Britain must extricate itself from these conventions, at least in part. The government itself has inched in this direction. It has set up a review of Article 8 of the European human rights convention, which lays down the right to respect for private and family life that has frustrated many attempts to remove illegal migrants.

But human rights laws and other conventions can’t be cherry-picked. Nigel Farage understands this, which is why he is announcing his proposal for the “mass deportation” of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, if his party gets into power, by scrapping human rights laws altogether and derogating from other international treaties.

Whatever the possibly unworkable details of his plans, the small boats crisis can’t be ended without scrapping these international laws and conventions. Yet Sir Keir Starmer won’t do this because the principles underlying them are an article of faith for the party and the left in general. Universal human rights became Labour’s defining mantra in the 1990s, when Tony Blair substituted the party’s red flag of workers’ control with the red rose of the brotherhood of man.

This was far more than a slick rebranding exercise. It reflected a profound shift in progressive circles — and the Tories meekly fell into line — towards universalism and multiculturalism; the notion that it was racist for a western nation to privilege its own culture over any other. The nation was viewed with contempt as the source of division, bigotry and war. The very idea of policing its borders was considered racist. With the nation deemed an oppressive “construct”, mass immigration guaranteed by universal human rights was seen as the means to better humanity.

So, the prospect of sending migrants back to oppressive regimes was regarded as an utter anathema.

It is, indeed, a moral obligation to help refugees from persecution, within manageable limits. But there’s certainly no obligation to admit people in unmanageable numbers or those who may pose a danger to Britain, either because they themselves subscribe to extremist ideologies or because they won’t assimilate to core principles such as respect for women or people from other faiths.

Allowing them in, as Farage said, is to privilege the rights of people from abroad over the rights of British people. That’s the inevitable consequence of universalism, which destroys the bargain of citizenship between individuals and their nation.

That’s what the human rights culture has done. That’s why the government is no longer able to police the nation’s borders — without which it no longer runs a meaningful nation, which it despises anyway. So with citizenship trashed, politicians and the police are now held in contempt and the streets have become flashpoints because the rule of law, the hard currency of citizenship, no longer has any purchase. This is why Labour has lost the red wall.

Having trashed the very idea of the nation to which the working class is so passionately attached, the government can only come up with one feeble proposal after another to prevent itself from facing up to the destruction the progressive classes have wrought and which now threatens its own survival.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F19b6f0c5-c7dc-4c41-b861-36ad5cbd5afe.jpg?crop=1455%2C818%2C73%2C51&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-25 15:56:51.105937

Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was erroneously deported to his home country in March and held in the notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, becoming the face of President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation regime. After the Trump administration spent months claiming falsely that Abrego Garcia could not be recovered from El Salvador’s custody, he was returned to the U.S. in June and jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.

Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. His attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda on Saturday. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X Monday morning that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia, and DHS said in a statement that he was “being processed for removal to Uganda.”

DHS did not reply to The Intercept’s request for additional information prior to publication.

“Numerous agencies of the U.S. government have been tasked with trying to get rid of Mr. Abrego and to cover up the administration’s mistake in sending him to El Salvador,” said Yael Schacher, the director for the Americas and Europe at Refugees International. “In its punitive approach to deportation, the administration undercuts the whole premise of civil immigration law; in its transactional dealings with third countries, it undermines human rights and the protection of refugees worldwide.”

The United States is pursuing deals with around a third of the world’s nations to expel immigrants to places where they do not hold citizenship. Once exiled, these third-country nationals are sometimes detained, imprisoned, or in danger of being sent back to their countries of origin — which they may have fled to escape violence, torture, or political persecution.

The nations that the Trump administration is collaborating with to accept these expelled immigrants are some of the worst human rights offenders on the planet.

The Trump administration has expelled more than 8,100 people in this manner since January 20, and the U.S. has made arrangements to send people to at least 14 nations, so far, across the globe. Of them, 13 have previously been cited by the State Department for significant human rights abuses.

The State Department recently sanitized its annual human rights reports, whitewashing the records of some of the world’s most notorious nations. Even this year’s stripped-down report paints Uganda as a pariah state. “Significant human rights issues included credible reports of: arbitrary or unlawful killings; disappearances; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; [and] arbitrary arrest or detention,” among many other abuses, according to the new report issued this month.

Uganda is a relatively new addition to the Trump administration’s global gulag for expelled immigrants: The country reached an agreement with the U.S. to accept some deportees last week. In total, the Trump administration has solicited 64 nations to participate. Fifty-eight of them — roughly 91 percent — were rebuked for human rights violations in the State Department’s past human rights reports.

The Trump administration has sought, or struck deals with, or deported third-country nationals to Angola, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Ivory Coast, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Libya, Kosovo, Malawi, Mauritania, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Palau, Panama, Peru, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, The Gambia, Togo, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe; these 58 were previously taken to task by the State Department for significant human rights abuses. Tuvalu and Santa Lucia were also cited in the report for having repressive laws on paper but were not found to enforce them in practice. Only four of the 64 total nations solicited by the Trump administration— Antigua and Barbuda, Cabo Verde, Costa Rica, and Saint Kitts and Nevis — received a clean bill of human rights health from the State Department in the past.

To justify Abrego Garcia’s second attempted expulsion, the Department of Homeland Security claims he is a member of MS-13, a gang that’s known for its prominence in El Salvador but originated in Los Angeles. His family denies the government’s allegations.

“President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,” Noem said.

The White House did not reply to a request for comment.

And Trump has won even in cases in which there are serious arguments that his administration defied a lower court, said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.

Early in Joe Biden’s presidency, defending the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, Alito stressed that its orders did not make precedent.
He mentioned no specific case or judge, but the message could easily be read as a yellow flag for lower courts.","In Donald Trump’s long-running feud with federal judges, the president has found some support in an unlikely place: the nation’s highest court.

A growing sense of frustration with some lower courts — articulated in terms that at times sound similar to Trump’s own rhetoric — has crept into a series of opinions this summer from the Supreme Court’s conservative justices as they juggle a flood of emergency cases dealing with Trump’s second term.

“Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” Justice Neil Gorsuch admonished in an opinion last week tied to the court’s decision to allow Trump to cancel nearly $800 million in research grants.

The rebuke, which was joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, flipped the narrative that it is Trump who has pushed legal boundaries with his flurry of executive orders and support for impeaching judges who rule against him. A wave of legal conservatives took to social media to tout Gorsuch’s warning.

“This is now the third time in a matter of weeks this court has had to intercede in a case ‘squarely controlled’ by one of its precedents,” wrote Gorsuch, who was Trump’s first nominee to the high court. (Kavanaugh was Trump’s second.) “When this court issues a decision, it constitutes a precedent that commands respect in lower courts.”

Other conservatives have been just as harsh this year. Justice Samuel Alito in March accused a federal judge in another case involving a Trump policy as committing an “act of judicial hubris” and “self-aggrandizement of its jurisdiction.”

The Supreme Court has been consistently siding with Trump on the emergency docket for months, including in high-profile cases dealing with immigration, spending and the leadership of independent agencies. And Trump has won even in cases in which there are serious arguments that his administration defied a lower court, said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.

“Gorsuch’s opinion in the NIH funding case is perhaps the most direct articulation yet of why — because the justices seem more concerned with lower courts correctly reading the tea leaves in their (often unexplained) rulings than with the executive branch behaving properly before the rest of the federal judiciary,” Vladeck said.

In a biting dissent in the research grant decision on Thursday, liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson described the result as “Calvinball jurisprudence,” in reference to the popular “Calvin and Hobbes” comic.

“Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules,” Jackson wrote. “We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins.”

Trump’s attacks on federal courts have subsided somewhat since the spring, when he repeatedly took to social media to rail against lower court judges and also privately complained about some members of the Supreme Court whom he appointed during his first term. But many of the president’s allies continue to work the refs and misstate the judiciary’s role — reflexively chalking losses in court up to politics.

“We will not fall to rogue judges,” Trump’s former personal lawyer Alina Habba told Fox News last week after a federal judge ruled that she was not legally serving as the acting US attorney for New Jersey. “We will not fall to people trying to be political when they should just be doing their job — respecting the president.”

Rewarding lawlessness?

Critics say it is Trump who is to blame for the tension between the executive and judicial branches, not only because of his rhetoric but also because of how the Justice Department has handled a number of high-profile cases.

In a scathing dissent in an emergency case earlier this summer, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the court of “rewarding lawlessness” by siding with Trump in one of those cases.

“This is not the first time the court closes its eyes to noncompliance, nor, I fear, will it be the last,” Sotomayor wrote, dissenting from the court’s decision to allow the administration’s deportations of certain migrants to countries other than their homeland. “Yet each time this court rewards noncompliance with discretionary relief, it further erodes respect for courts and for the rule of law.”

Sotomayor and Jackson, both liberals, are the only two on the Supreme Court who have served on district courts, where judges often take the initial stab at applying precedent to new litigation. Most of the other justices were formerly appeals court judges, where they review those first attempts by the district courts.

Gorsuch’s sharp lines — not to mention Trump’s winning streak at the high court — suggests that at least some of the justices believe that some lower courts are overreacting to the administration’s moves.

“Justice Gorsuch is making the obvious point that lower courts are required to follow the Supreme Court’s emergency orders as much as any other decree,” said James Burnham, an attorney and former Gorsuch clerk who served as general counsel for Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. “The defiance of the Supreme Court’s emergency orders by some lower courts is unprecedented, extraordinary, and the Supreme Court must deal with it decisively.”

Carrie Severino, president of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, cheered Gorsuch’s opinion on social media, writing that “yet again” it had “become necessary to remind district judges not to flout orders of the Supreme Court.”

But just how judges are supposed to approach the Supreme Court’s emergency orders — particularly when they are opaque or include little explanation — has been open to debate.

Early in Joe Biden’s presidency, defending the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, Alito stressed that its orders did not make precedent. Unlike the court’s regular merits docket, emergency orders are almost always decided without the benefit of oral argument or extensive briefing. They do not resolve the underlying legal questions of a case — only what happens while the litigation continues.

“It’s one thing when there’s a majority opinion with clear language that resolves a legal question in a way everyone will understand, whether or not we agree with it,” Vladeck said. “It’s something else entirely when the justices provide literally zero analysis in support of a ruling, expect the lower courts to nevertheless understand which argument(s) they relied upon, and then subsequently chastise the lower courts for not reading their minds — and that something is hubris. If the court wants lower courts to treat its analyses as precedent, it should, you know, provide them.”

In recent weeks, a majority of justices have sought to reinforce the notion that short-term orders should control the outcome of similar cases.

In its fractured decision Thursday, a 5-4 majority said that US District Judge William Young erred by requiring the administration to revive nearly $800 million in National Institutes of Health research grants Trump canceled because they dealt with gender or diversity.

The high court’s unsigned opinion, which allows the NIH to keep those grants frozen, pointed to an earlier unsigned emergency order from April that permitted officials to block millions of dollars in grants to states intended to address teacher shortages.

Young, who was named to the court by President Ronald Reagan, said he had “never seen government racial discrimination like this.”

In its most notable decision this year, the Supreme Court stripped the power of lower court judges to issue so-called nationwide injunctions that have been used to shutdown policies adopted by presidents of both parties. That potentially landmark ruling came in a challenge to Trump’s executive order intending to end birthright citizenship.

Lower courts are continuing to work through whether there are other avenues judges can use to temporarily halt policies they believe are unconstitutional.

Kavanaugh: Judges are not ‘policymakers’

In a decision last month allowing Trump to remove three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission who were appointed by Biden, the court similarly pointed to an earlier unsigned emergency order that dealt with firings at labor agencies. At issue in both cases was whether the president may fire board members at independent agencies despite a federal law intended to shield them from removal for political reasons.

The CPSC firings, the court said in a brief, unsigned opinion on July 23, were “squarely controlled” by the earlier decision. Although the court’s “interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits,” a majority of the justices reasoned, “they inform how a court should” decide short-term questions “in like cases.”

The emergency docket has been a topic of debate as some of the justices have traveled the country for speaking engagements during the court’s summer break.

Speaking in California in July, Justice Elena Kagan — a member of the court’s liberal wing — suggested the high court could do more to “explain things better” so that lower court judges and the public understand clearly what the Supreme Court is deciding.

Days later, speaking to a group of judges and attorneys in Kansas City, Kavanaugh defended the court’s sometimes terse emergency orders.

Kavanaugh kicked off his speech by extolling the virtues of an independent judiciary. And he stressed that judges have a part to play in maintaining that independence.

By contrast, Democrats have lambasted the mid-decennial redistricting as a power grab orchestrated from afar by Trump.","EXCLUSIVE: Former Rep. Mayra Flores, the millennial Republican who upset a border-district Democrat amid the Biden border crisis, said Texas redistricting is anything but disenfranchisement of minority voters as its critics claim.

""Four of the five new districts are actually Hispanic-majority districts. And, remember, in the previous map, the Democrats’ biggest complaint was that Hispanics were not represented well,"" Flores, who is rumored to be considering returning to Congress in 2026, told Fox News Digital.

Flores said that beyond the crowing about mid-decade redistricting, the left’s complaints about the new district lines are driven purely by political concerns.

""They're upset because these Hispanics – they’re conservative Hispanics – have voted for President Trump. This map actually is more of a representation of what Texas is today,"" said Flores, who was born in Tamaulipas, what is now one of the most violent Mexican states in terms of cartel violence. It directly abuts her home district.

In 2024, 12 of 14 Texas border counties flipped red and went for President Donald Trump, in part because of such concerns – including one that hadn’t gone Republican since 1912.

In 2022, Flores won a special election for the then-34th District, but then lost the seat to Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in the next race.

""Conservative Hispanics contribute to the political landscape by supporting Republican candidates, policies; particularly on issues such as economic development, family values, religious freedom and, of course, border security,"" she said.

She said liberal interests sued over the current maps, and that there is surprise over how many Hispanics in Texas actually support border security and conservative policies.

Flores said Hispanics and Latinos are not a homogeneous voting bloc for the left, pointing also to Florida, where Latinos and other minorities came out in large numbers for Trump – and where two Cuban-American lawmakers, Reps. Maria Salazar and Carlos Gimenez of Miami-Dade are both Republicans.

Politicians therefore need to seize the redistricting opportunity to make sure every congressional district is representative proportionally to their state’s political and ethnic makeup, she said.

Critics point to New England – where no state currently has a Republican member of Congress, despite conservative pockets in places like Massachusetts, Maine, and Connecticut – as a prime example.

By contrast, Democrats have lambasted the mid-decennial redistricting as a power grab orchestrated from afar by Trump.

Democrats and liberal voices, however, disagreed with Flores’ assertions.

""The Don demanded. The Texas Legislature complied. Voters got hurt,"" blared a Monday editorial from the San Antonio Express-News.

The paper accused Republicans of directly ""diluting"" Latino and Black representation in the new map by ""packing them into districts where they have more of a majority than needed to win representation of those seats"" or ""dispersing them into multiple districts where they lack the numbers to have a say in who their representatives are.""

Along with other Democrats, the paper also referenced the new map’s merging of Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Gregorio Casar into the same district confines near Austin.

Casar is a millennial ""Squad"" member and Doggett is, conversely, the longest-serving member of the state’s delegation. Doggett indicated last week he won’t run again if facing Casar.

Casar told NPR the new map attempts to ""silence the voices of my constituents and get folks like me out of Congress,"" by adjusting Austin-area lines – and claimed it violates the Voting Rights Act.

Additionally, Bexar County, which includes San Antonio, went about 55-45 for former Vice President Kamala Harris, but Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, is also among its political ranks. The county would see an increase in proportional representation for Republicans, according to reports.

In California, which is about half Democratic and left-leaning independent, only nine of 52 congressional districts are held by Republicans. In Maryland, lawmakers finally redrew what a judge called a ""broken-winged pterodactyl"" of a Democratic district that included several noncontiguous pieces of Baltimore suburbs.

Flores said Texas, Florida, California and New York are worth revisiting on a congressional-districting basis if only for the trends of major ingress to the first two from the latter two states.

""We want to make sure that again every congressional district is a representation of the overall state and for critics to say that this [Texas] map silences the voices of minorities when four of the five of them you map are actually Hispanic majority,"" Flores said.

""Look, Hispanics are switching toward the Republican Party and will continue to support the Republican Party because the Democrat Party has gone so far left, and you would think that after 2024, they would have learned their lesson and they would come more to the middle,"" Flores said.

While South Dakota has seen small-scale deportations, no mass events have been reported at this time.","As immigration crackdowns continue under the Trump administration, agriculture leaders have expressed some anxiety about undocumented workers in the industry.

While South Dakota’s congressional delegation acknowledged the need for labor reform, there’s no quick or simple solution.

Last month, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said mass deportations of undocumented immigrants are going to be done everywhere, and agriculture is no exception.

She said the plan was to have a 100% American workforce. That announcement has many in agriculture worried about labor gaps and how to fill them. Historically, undocumented workers have filled some of those gaps for producers and farmers.

Officials estimate that today, about 40-45% of the agriculture workforce is made up by undocumented immigrants.

The issue came up at a South Dakota Farm Bureau Federation forum at Dakotafest in Mitchell.

US Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the answer has to come in two parts. The first…“Secure the border! Which the president has effectively done.”

He said with that first part achieved, policy makers can look ahead to the second: fixing the labor system in agriculture.

He said the issue is finding a way to get the workforce here legally. Thune said the answer is going to come somewhere in the middle of the political aisle.

“I would say that in terms of legislating on that it’s been tried in the past; it’s very complicated. The Democrats holy grail on immigration is citizenship: they want everybody to get citizenship. And, of course, the Republicans it’s build a wall. And there are a lot of things that we could do that we could probably agree on,"" Thune said. ""I hope we can get that back on track. I think President Trump is probably the right person to do that because he’s been so effective at securing the Southern border. And so if he wanted to lead a legislative effort on immigration, I think there’d be a lot of people who would like to work with him and partner with him on that.”

However,US Sen. Mike Rounds said there’s a big “if” ahead to any sort of resolution.

“Look, it’s not going to happen unless President Trump agrees to work with us. You can’t do it without having the Administration work with you on it,"" Rounds said. ""But I do think also the fact that the president had employed folks in his businesses that were H2Bs, he understands it. He gets it.”

Rounds said he’s heard worker’s unions complain that immigrants are taking away American jobs, but he said that argument weakens when factoring in South Dakota’s low unemployment rate.

“And when you’re under 2%, it’s really tough to find people who are going to come out and work in the livestock industry, that are going to work in the dairies. But in other countries, culturally they still see that, and they see it as a way to get to America and eventually they see it as an opportunity for perhaps their children to have a better way of life a long time into the future,"" Rounds said. ""They take the dollars, they bring them back to their home countries, they improve things there. So H2Bs and H2As I think are critical, but we need to modify them so that they work better for the ag communities in places like South Dakota.”

South Dakota’s lone representative in the House of Representatives, Dusty Johnson agreed with his Senate counterparts. He said with the Southern border secured, “That does give us an opportunity to start to have the conversation with the White House about what comes next. I was at the White House three weeks ago, the president said it himself,"" Johnson said. ""He said, ‘We want to continue to have this be a country where some of the hardest working, some of the most talented people in the globe, want to come be a part of the American dream. Now, the details get really messy. But I think there is renewed interest in looking at how we can make these work visa programs serve our country’s interest.”

A bill in the US House of Representatives called the Farm Workforce Modernization act would reform the H-2A visa program for agricultural producers. The bipartisan bill has been introduced many times since 2019 and is currently awaiting action.

South Dakota Searchlight reports Rep. Johnsonvoted against a version of the bill in 2023, citing it was a “special deal for California” that hurt meat, cheese and biofuel processing.

Sen. John Thune told reporters after the event that while it might be an uphill battle, he thinks the president might have an appetite for revamping some visa programs.

""And I think lifting the caps on some of the visas: H2As, H2Bs, the ones that we use here in South Dakota, would be a great step in the right direction. But I think the longer-term issue is going to be trying to figure out how to codify and get some of these changes into law,"" Thune said. ""And I think the president also has a lot of latitude there to work with, and I think if he can find some willing partners in the Democrats, I think you know, some sort of legislation policy, a piece of legislation that we could pass is not outside the realm of possibility.”

Thune said ultimately, that may be the best long-term solution for such a complex issue.

Tags: Immigration","WASHINGTON (OSV News) — As the Trump administration seeks to implement its hardline immigration policies, it has increased enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in immigration courts, prompting alarm from Catholic immigration advocates.

Such instances are taking place across the country: New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently filed court papers in support of a lawsuit to stop arrests of migrants reporting for their hearings at a federal immigration building in Manhattan. Protesters in San Francisco attempted to halt such detentions in that city.

Visiting immigration court hearings

Near the U.S.-Mexico border, Father Michael Gallagher, an attorney and Jesuit priest and a member of Jesuit Refugee Service/USA’s Caminar Contigo program in El Paso, has been visiting immigration court hearings to help ensure those going into their hearings understand their rights, as well as the possible outcomes of their cases.

Among the consequences “of these arrests as people come out of court,” Father Gallagher said, was a woman who had had been told by a judge to leave her children at home for her appointment followed that instruction, and later, as she “comes to court and gets arrested as she comes out, and her kids are left at home and don’t know where mama is.”

“So that is one of the kind of brutal consequences,” he said.

Father Gallagher told OSV News targeting immigration courts for enforcement actions means the government is in some cases, “arresting people who are complying with the law.”

“It’s against fundamental justice,” Father Gallagher said.

The Trump administration’s changes to Temporary Protected Status — a program for shielding eligible migrants from particular nations from deportation due to dangerous conditions in their homelands — means that there are individuals who first entered the U.S. with legal status who have now been left without it, he said.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment from OSV News.

Hope Border Institute calls immigration enforcement targeting people attending court hearings ‘particularly troubling’

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, “Immigration enforcement that targets people attending court hearings is particularly troubling, because we’re talking about going after people doing everything they can to regularize their immigration status by following the legal process.”

“As Americans, we value fairness and respect for constitutional rights, including due process,” he said. “This is why from Los Angeles to San Diego to El Paso, we’ve seen church leaders, women religious, priests and ordinary Catholics showing up at court to witness to the human dignity of those who are our neighbors, our parishioners and decent hardworking people.”

J. Kevin Appleby, senior fellow for policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York and the former director of migration policy for the USCCB, told OSV News, “Targeting immigration courts can violate due process for immigrants, a basic principle of our justice system. Everyone should be able to have their day in court.”

“In the area of immigration, due process ensures that those who have a legal basis to remain are not wrongly deported or sent back to their persecutors,” he said. “ICE is attempting to short change that process, which should alarm us all.”

‘A real shift towards cruelty’

Father Gallagher said, “what I’m observing is kind of a real shift towards cruelty, which is very depressing for our country, to become a cruel place.” But he said at the same time, “the people I meet down at the courtroom — the Catholics and the Protestants and the Jews — are very much in favor of looking at these people as people, first of all, as human beings with inherent dignity.”

In one example of his work helping to educate people about their rights in court, Father Gallagher said he met a family with a “little girl who was 2 or 3 years old in a white dress, who was waiting to go to court and doing pirouettes downstairs while I’m explaining to her parents that they might get arrested, the whole family.”

Despite the circumstances, he said, he was struck by how “she’s still a 3-year-old kid and a human being, lovely with a white dress, and a happy child.”

Corbett added that as deportations “now begin to hit local communities, we’re starting to see a groundswell of statements and actions from bishops across the country speaking out in defense of human rights and advocating for essential immigration reforms.”

Abrego Garcia's attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit to fight those removal efforts until a court has heard his claim for protection, stating that the U.S. could place him in a country where ""his safety cannot be assured.""

The new lawsuit triggered a blanket court order that automatically pauses deportation efforts for two days. The order applies to immigrants in Maryland who are challenging their detention.

Crowd yells 'shame!'

Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national, spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

""This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,"" Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. ""God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.""

Roughly 200 people had gathered and prayed in front of the Baltimore field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some held signs with messages such as ""Stop Detaining Our Neighbors"" and ""Free Kilmar.""

With Abrego Garcia and his wife standing before them, the crowd spoke in unison: ""The people united will never be defeated.""

The crowd waited outside after Abrego Garcia entered the federal building. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him after his detainment, the crowd yelled ""Shame!""

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. But Abrego Garcia's lead immigration attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said lawyers will fight the administration's removal attempts.

""I expect there's going to be a status conference very promptly, and we're going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,"" he said.

Reunion with family

Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee and returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them ""for everything.""

'Hold Abrego Garcia accountable'

Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, which recently agreed to accept certain deportees from the U.S. He declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Filings in federal court show the Costa Rican government saying Abrego Garcia would be welcomed as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face detention.

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a ""clear danger"" and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

""Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,"" Gilmartin said.

The U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's earlier determination that he faced a ""well-founded fear"" of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, calling it an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours' notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.

""Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),"" it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/hendersondispatch.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/ab/aabe2038-3858-51f0-93a8-3db3c58ce626/68ac857e28a22.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-08-25 14:57:45.289457

The letter followed a visit earlier this month to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Aurora by U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Centennial and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood.

Crow and Neguse are among a dozen House Democrats who have sued the Department of Homeland Security over a new ICE policy requiring lawmakers to obtain prior approval to conduct facility oversight visits. But despite providing advance notice of their Aug. 11 visit, the four Colorado Democrats said that ICE personnel accompanying them were unable to provide much of the information they asked for.

“They failed to answer many of our questions and repeatedly encouraged us to instead email ICE’s Office of Congressional Relations,” they wrote in their letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons. “The inevitable delays caused by routing our questions through OCR, rather than the ICE employee leading the oversight visit, prevent meaningful oversight from taking place in a timely manner.”

The letter includes four pages of questions about the Aurora facility, which is operated by private prison company The GEO Group. The facility has a total capacity of 1,532 detainees and has long been the target of criticism from activists over allegations of inhumane conditions and dehumanizing treatment.

Among the concerns highlighted by the Aug. 22 letter are reports of an air conditioning system within the detention center “not functioning for period of time in July.” Detainees in one of the facility’s housing pods were reportedly relocated as a result. The letter also mentions “reports on several occasions of water outages in the facility, including in July and August of this year.” Other issues raised include recent prohibitions on orientation programs previously conducted by legal aid groups, as well as increased signage and “repeated visits” from ICE staff pressuring detainees to “self-deport.”

The lawmakers also want more detailed demographic information about detainees in the facility, including their countries of origin, the number of detainees entering and leaving the facility on a weekly basis, and the percentage of detainees who have not been convicted of a violent crime.

Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old Utah nursing student without a criminal record, was detained in the Aurora facility for 15 days earlier this year before being released on bond. She called her stay a “nightmare” and described having to eat soggy bread and being “treated better than others who didn’t speak English.”

Internal ICE planning documents obtained by The Washington Post indicate that up to three new immigration detention centers could be operational in Colorado by the end of the year. The lawmakers’ letter to DHS says that an ICE staffer told them that one of those potential facilities, in the town of Hudson, is “under contract with ICE.”

Trump similarly deployed National Guard members to Los Angeles last month amid a surge in demonstrations against Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts.

Trump said Friday that Chicago would likely be the next target of his efforts to crack down on crime, homelessness and illegal immigration.

“I think Chicago will be … next,” Trump told reporters at the White House.

“And then we’ll help with New York.”

The Washington Post reported Saturday that the Pentagon for weeks has been planning a military deployment to Chicago.

The planning could involve several options, the Post reported, including sending a few thousand members of the National Guard as soon as September to patrol the city’s streets.

“Donald Trump’s flagrant abuses of power must end,” Krishnamoorthi said. “Our brave servicemen and women are not pawns in his political games.”

Krishnamoorthi said he introduced legislation to block any president from deploying the military into states without a governor first requesting the intervention.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) said he was talking to Gov. JB Pritzker (D) and other local officials about preparing for “any potential unconstitutional military deployments to Chicago.”

“The Governor, the Cook County Board President, and I are in complete alignment: Chicago is not calling for a military occupation of our city,” Johnson said in a statement. “We are currently evaluating all of our legal options to protect the people of Chicago from unconstitutional federal overreach.”

BALTIMORE — This morning, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was arrested at his ICE check-in appointment. The government intends to deport him to Uganda, a country with which Abrego Garcia has no association.

Abrego Garcia is represented by lawyers at CASA, who hosted a vigil and rally in his support outside the location of the arrest.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration – by its own admission – wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a torture prison in El Salvador in the middle of the night and with no due process. According to his lawyers, he suffered severe mistreatment there including isolation, beatings and psychological torture. After repeated court orders to return him, the administration finally brought him back but then immediately prosecuted him on federal smuggling charges. On Friday, over the administration’s objections, a federal court released him to his family in Maryland while his case proceeded.

However, the government has now tried to force Abrego Garcia to accept deportation to Costa Rica as part of a plea agreement to end his criminal case. As punishment for not accepting that proposal, they then served notice to his lawyers that the administration will deport him to Uganda. Today, he was arrested during his ICE check-in.

Sarah Mehta, Deputy Director of Policy and Government Affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union, released the following statement in response:

“The Trump administration’s obsessive and petty cruelty is on full display in this latest move to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father they admitted to wrongfully deporting to a torture prison, to a country with which he has no relationship. This vindictive behavior is not just about Mr. Abrego Garcia; this is once again the administration showing that it can weaponize the law to punish people standing up for their rights and make our immigrant neighbors afraid of being rapidly exiled, including to places where they may be persecuted.”

After all, it was they who argued that leaving the EU would allow Britain finally to bring immigration under control.
But if EU leaders have their way, we may soon see Brussels, not Britain, celebrating the first complete migration pact with Rwanda.","When Emmanuel Macron was asked about the UK’s plans to send migrants to Rwanda, he could not have made his contempt more clear.

Europe must not “go and look for a third country, for example in Africa, and send our immigrants there”, the French president proclaimed in April 2024. “This is a betrayal of our values and will lead us down the path of new dependencies on third countries.”

But one year on, this is precisely what the European Union seems to be planning – as it pivots from a softer touch on migration to an approach that even the tough-talking Tory government was forced to abandon when its own Rwanda scheme was thrown out by the Supreme Court in November 2023.

Against a rising tide of Right-wing populism, officials in Brussels are drawing up new rules as nation after nation – from Denmark in the north to Italy in the south – turns to Rwanda-style asylum processing schemes.

Indeed, the interior ministers of Germany, France, Austria, Poland, Denmark and the Czech Republic convened for a special migration summit on the Zugspitze, Germany’s highest mountain, last month. At a resort on the peak of the 9,718ft-high mountain in Bavaria, they agreed that member states needed “more freedom of action” to deport asylum seekers, and that “the establishment of return centres in third countries should be legally permitted”.

‘Overwhelmed asylum capacities’

Under the proposed reforms, said to have the backing of the majority of the bloc, EU members would be allowed swiftly to reject asylum seekers and deport them to a third country they deem safe, such as Rwanda, even if the applicant has no link to that nation whatsoever. They also open the door to creating “offshore hubs” in the Middle East or North Africa, where asylum seekers would have their claims processed on the EU’s behalf by a host government.

Both ideas are similar to the UK’s failed Rwanda scheme, which would have sent asylum seekers to Rwanda for their claims to be processed and then to remain there even if the asylum claim was granted.

The proposals are a far cry from the munificent era of the 2015 refugee crisis, when Angela Merkel, then Germany’s chancellor, declared “wir schaffen das” (we can do it) as the bloc witnessed an influx of 1.3 million people.

Critics have also warned that the reforms are legally unsound, eye-wateringly expensive and could lead to gross human rights violations of asylum seekers in the countries to which they are sent.

But with first-time asylum applications hovering close to – or above – the one million mark in recent years, a surge in support for far-Right parties and the weaponisation of migrants by countries such as Russia, there is growing momentum behind a Rwanda-style model for the EU.

“If you want to grant protection to those that are in need, you need a properly working system that is able to differentiate as early as possible between those who are in need of protection and those who are not,” she says.

A stark shift in Germany

A decade ago, European attitudes to asylum seekers were markedly different: crowds of Germans gathered at Munich’s central train station to cheer and greet new arrivals.

But the mood has since soured on mass migration across the bloc, and perhaps most strikingly in Germany – where the far-Right, anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AFD) party secured an unprecedented second place in last February’s elections, making it the de facto opposition.

Under the country’s current chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who has loudly and repeatedly distanced himself from the migration policy of Merkel, German police have been turning away asylum seekers from their land borders since May.

Merz himself says Germany’s asylum capacity has been “overwhelmed”, a sentiment echoed by leaders in Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland – where vigilante groups have resorted to policing the borders themselves.

According to a report earlier this month, the Merz government has already launched talks with Rwanda on an asylum scheme, perhaps in the hope that the new EU reforms will clear any legal hurdles the deal would otherwise face. When asked by The Telegraph what progress has been made so far, a German interior ministry spokesman said they “do not comment on ongoing negotiations with other countries”.

However, sources in Merz’s centre-Right Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) party say there is great appetite to replicate the scheme that was attempted by Rishi Sunak before the collapse of his government. “We want to erase any legal obstacles that exist under EU level for such a scheme,” a CDU source in Berlin says.

They add a caveat: even if talks with Rwanda are going on behind closed doors, Merz’s coalition of his centre-Right CDU party and the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD) are split on the issue. “It’s not very likely that the SPD accepts a Rwanda plan any time soon,” the source says, raising the possibility that the plan will never get full political backing.

Even so, Alexander Dobrindt, the German interior minister, has gone as far as claiming that “models involving third countries have majority support… a vast majority of member states have made it clear that this is a path the EU must take”.

‘A rekindling of a longstanding concern’

Another key player in the EU’s migration debate is Denmark, which holds the rotating EU presidency and, unlike Germany, has been consistently sceptical towards mass migration.

Having had its own failed Rwanda plan, which was shelved amid a backlash in January 2023, the Nordic nation now appears to feel increasingly vindicated as other member states warm to outsourcing asylum.

“While immigration has certainly returned to the forefront of the Danish debate – after nearly five years of relative silence on the issue – I wouldn’t describe it as a major shift in public attitudes. Rather, it’s a rekindling of a longstanding concern,” says Mikkel Bjørn, an MP for the Right-wing Danish People’s Party.

To cite just one example, in 2016 Denmark was criticised for what was considered at the time to be callous treatment of asylum seekers: seizing their valuables upon arrival to help fund their accommodation. Now, somewhat similar ideas are being floated across the EU, alongside plans for Rwanda-style processing schemes.

However, human rights groups are deeply concerned by the new push in the bloc to try to succeed where Sunak and his ministers failed.

Amnesty International has warned that the Rwanda model and others, such as Italy’s migration pact with Albania, are deeply cynical, violate human rights laws and are an abdication of Europe’s responsibilities.

Under the deal struck by Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s government last year, Rome planned to transfer migrants to centres in Albania while their applications for asylum in Italy were being considered. But the move was challenged by Italian courts, forcing authorities to pivot and use the facilities to house those awaiting deportation from Italy instead. Most of the few dozen transferred to Albania under the scheme have also had to be returned to Italy before being repatriated.

“A lot of different initiatives are being bandied around, but all of them are doing the same thing, which is shifting the EU’s responsibility for asylum outside of the bloc,” says Olivia Sundberg Diez, a migration expert at Amnesty International.

“Whenever there have been similar schemes, you see a very similar pattern of human rights violations taking place,” she adds, referring to Australia’s notorious processing centre on the island of Nauru, where refugees were kept in inhumane conditions, denied proper medical care and in some cases driven to suicide attempts, according to a 2016 Amnesty report.

Inflated expectations

Despite such concerns, officials in Brussels appear confident the Italian model will work in the future. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Financial Times such a scheme “will be possible again”, adding that member states would “make the necessary adjustments” required to ensure asylum processing could be outsourced to countries not part of the bloc.

But even if the EU pushes ahead with such schemes, Diez says they still risk breaching international law and being abandoned just like the UK-Rwanda model, which racked up a £700m taxpayers’ bill despite never coming into force.

“From our experiences, it’s very dangerous for policymakers to be inflating the public’s expectations of what these schemes can accomplish, and we don’t believe they can be implemented in a way that’s compliant [with international law],” she adds.

But it appears increasingly unlikely the bloc will be deterred. And now, it will be up to the European Commission, the EU’s civil service, to make the lofty vision of the Zugspitze summit a reality. Should they succeed where Sunak failed, it would be a bruising twist of irony for Brexiteers.

After all, it was they who argued that leaving the EU would allow Britain finally to bring immigration under control.

The Maryland construction worker became the face of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador.

He was returned to the US in June but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the 30-year-old married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member.

He denies the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

The Salvadoran national spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

“This administration has hit us hard but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Abrego Garcia entered the offices of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a city centre office building. His wife emerged without him a few minutes later, appearing to have tears in her eyes.

Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said in a tweet that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. Abrego Garcia’s lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said a lawsuit had been filed in federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention asking for an order that he not be deported.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

Abrego Garcia was released on Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee. He returned to his family in Maryland. Video of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything”.

Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, which recently agreed to a deal to accept certain deportees from the US. He declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Filings in federal court show the Costa Rican government saying Abrego Garcia would be welcomed as a legal immigrant and would not face detention.

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

“Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,” Mr Gilmartin said.

The US mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there.

Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pre-trial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.",https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjVcXFwvMDhcXFwvMjUxMzE5NDZcXFwvZWQzNWY4MzMzYzllNDllY2E1MDI2Y2Q5Mjg2MWFmZDYtMS5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYyNyxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZVxcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6ImI0MGI0MDM1YWEzY2M0NmE4MGZjYjliNDI1ODRhYzgxMDc2YjBjNzcifQ==/man-at-centre-of-us-immigration-storm-faces-possible-deportation-to-uganda.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 11:58:39.575945

The Trump administration is asking the justices to allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to continue using aggressive, dragnet tactics in their immigration crackdown in the Los Angeles area, which civil rights groups have said amount to racial profiling.

Beyond statistics, there are some communities in which immigrants maintain a critical role in terms of child care.","Since the outset of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, Carolina Reyes, the director of the Arco Iris Bilingual Children’s Center in Maryland, had to start having conversations with parents about whom she should contact in case they disappear in an ICE raid.

“I had to say, ‘You need to have a plan. I know it’s difficult, but you need to have a plan,’” Reyes told Salon. “I know it’s difficult, but you need to have a plan. And then they were like, ‘No, I don’t want to talk about it.’ I was like, ‘I understand, but you have to because, unfortunately, you don’t know if you go to work and something happens, who’s going to take care of your child? What is going to happen? What do I have to do?”

According to Reyes, this is only one of many difficult conversations she has had since the beginning of the Republican mass deportation campaign earlier this year.

“We had a meeting with my teachers where we need to prepare if ICE comes. As a school, we are not allowing anybody to come into our school. We close the door and we lock down a little bit, if that’s the case. We are not going to release anybody, not to, particularly ICE or anything like that. We call parents too. We talk about it, and if we see ICE or any situation where we feel uncomfortable, parents will be notified,” Reyes said.

From 2011 until the beginning of Trump’s second term, child care facilities had been off limits for ICE raids. Trump ended the protection afforded to child care facilities and other sensitive locations in January, telling immigration officers to “balance a variety of interests” when conducting operations in or around such locations.

While it’s not clear whether ICE has conducted any raids on early childhood education centers yet, the rule change earlier this year and the administration’s readiness to detain children and families have left providers across the country in a state of anxiety with organizations advising that providers prepare for potential raids.

The potential for direct raids on facilities isn’t the only issue impacting parents and children since the beginning of the GOP mass deportation campaign. For many of the families Reyes has worked with, parents are afraid to go to work because they’re worried that they, or one of their family members, might be targeted by ICE. At the same time, Reyes said, ICE had targeted those seeking food assistance at places like local churches, which left families of mixed immigration status with nowhere to turn.

“Here in Maryland, ICE was going to those places too, to arrest people, so we started our own food program a little bit here, asking our own families to donate food so that families didn’t have to go to those places,” Reyes said.

And the fear in the community goes beyond just noncitizen residents.

“I did have some families who were concerned and worried, even though they had legal status in the United States, you know. But they’re immigrants, so we look like immigrants and Latinos, and some of them were concerned about that too,” Reyes said.

Reyes’ experience is only a keyhole view into the dramatic effect that Trump and the GOP’s policies are having on the child care industry and the families that rely on it in the United States.

The child care and early childhood education industry is among those most impacted by Trump’s immigration policies. According to the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at Berkeley, around 500,000 workers in the industry are immigrants, accounting for about 21% of the industry’s workforce nationwide.

The percentage of child care workers born outside the United States varies widely by state as well. In Florida, for example, 38% of early childhood educators were born outside the United States, while in a state like Vermont, the number is closer to just 3%.

Beyond statistics, there are some communities in which immigrants maintain a critical role in terms of child care. The 19th detailed in a report this year the detention of Orozco Forero, a worker who cared for children with Autism and was the only provider who would take some children in her community.

One child care provider located near Columbus, Ohio, who wished to be identified only as Ann, told Salon that since Trump’s mass deportation campaign began, they’ve been having a hard time finding new workers.

“I have two who, in the middle of the hiring process, disappeared, or they no-showed. And then I found out from other trusted sources who know them that they are involved in immigration proceedings,” Ann said. “Even today, there’s one woman who was supposed to start with us — I don’t know the correct immigration or political term — she’s got clearance to be in the US. She’s originally from Mexico. Her father’s here, but they were able to get her immigration status made legit, if I can say it that way. But she’s disappeared for two weeks, and then I found out today that she’s had to travel to Cleveland for a court proceeding. I said to the other person who knows her, I just asked her, ‘is she okay?’”

Ann said that the new problems haven’t been limited to hiring workers either. She told Salon that immigrant families have recently had problems getting financial benefits through Ohio’s Publicly Funded Child Care program for their children, who are American citizens.

“Now what’s happening is I have immigrant families who have immigrant children, and U.S.-born children, we are having a hard time getting the families care and benefits for their entire family, including the U.S.-born child, and that’s when I start losing all hope in this,” Ann said.

In the past, Ann said, she would be able to appeal the decision made by the county government to the state government with a high success rate. Now, however, she says families are increasingly being denied at the state level, too.

According to Arabella Bloom, a researcher at the center, the mass deportation campaign, which impacts parents, children and the people who staff child care centers, is hitting a system that was struggling to begin with.

“I think something important to note about childcare is that the system that we currently have right now — it’s kind of generous to call it a system,” Bloom said. “It’s very patchwork. Programs are happening in public schools, but programs are also happening in people’s homes. And so there’s not like a cohesive early childhood system. It’s a lot of programs kind of operating on their own. You know, many early childhood programs are for-profit, but they’re barely making ends meet.”

Bloom said that, even for those workers who are not immigrants, there is a “real fear about interacting with immigration,” especially among Hispanic workers and other people of color.

The pressure from Trump’s mass deportation campaign comes in addition to more direct attacks on immigrants’ access to early childhood education from his administration and the Republicans in Congress.

The Trump administration announced in July, for example, that it would be making undocumented immigrants, who are already largely ineligible for federal benefits, ineligible for Head Start and that administrators for Head Start would be checking for eligibility based on immigration status.

“This decision undermines the fundamental commitment that the country has made to children and disregards decades of evidence that Head Start is essential to our collective future,” Yasmina Vinci, executive director of the National Head Start Association, told the Associated Press at the time.

Bloom explained that some changes in the recent GOP budget also stood to have an outsized impact on the workers in the early childhood education industry, especially cuts to SNAP and Medicaid.

“We know that roughly 43% of early educators rely on public benefits to make ends meet because pay is so low, so it’s kind of just a like a perfect storm of at the same time that immigration efforts are ramping up, and that’s obviously going to be very impactful for the one in five early educators who are immigrants,” Bloom said.

The GOP attacks on public benefits and immigration policy “threaten the supply of care that’s already hard to find,” Rachel Wilensky, a senior analyst on child care and early education at the Center for Law and Social Policy, told Salon.

Wilensky cited a CLASP study from 2018, which found that immigration actions like those being carried out by the Trump administration this year, and those that were conducted in the first administration, left a lasting impact on the physical, social and emotional development of young children.

“Good nutrition, regular health care, a stable and healthy living environment, and nurturing care are necessities for children to grow and learn and ultimately do well in school, in their jobs, and throughout their lives,” Wilensky said. “When children don’t have their basic needs met—or when they experience hardship and distress—it undercuts their growth and development and can have enduring effects. Immigrants have been central throughout our nation’s history, and their experiences matter for our future. The success of the United States is tied to the health and well-being of immigrants, as well as their success in school and later careers.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/ice-arrest-2230437083.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 11:58:21.040044

The appellate ruling means Nepali immigrants immediately lose TPS while their Latin American co-plaintiffs lose legal status next month.
The administration faces multiple lawsuits from immigrants and civil rights groups to retain the protections.
The government also cited a May 19 Supreme Court decision permitting DHS to terminate TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans as rationale for ending the status for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.
Nevertheless, a three-judge panel issued the order staying Thompson’s decision after an urgent request from the Trump administration.","The Trump administration can proceed with plans to rescind temporary deportation protections for more than 60,000 Honduran, Nepali and Nicaraguan immigrants, a federal appellate court in San Francisco ruled Aug. 20.

The two-page decision by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California overturned a July 31 lower-court ruling preventing the Department of Homeland Security from terminating Temporary Protective Status for the immigrants while their lawsuit opposing the move continues to be litigated.

TPS shelters migrants fleeing war and natural disasters from deportation and allows them to work in the U.S. legally as their asylum cases move through the immigration court system.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced the designation would end Aug. 5 for Nepali immigrants and Sept. 8 for Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining the conditions in their home nations have changed and no longer meet the conditions of TPS. The appellate ruling means Nepali immigrants immediately lose TPS while their Latin American co-plaintiffs lose legal status next month.

DHS is also seeking to rescind the status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela, and to end humanitarian parole programs, as well. The administration faces multiple lawsuits from immigrants and civil rights groups to retain the protections.

National TPS Alliance II v. Noem argues Trump decided to end Nepali, Honduran and Nicaraguan TPS without a proper review of the conditions in those countries and the decision was “motivated by racial animus.”

In her order temporarily halting Noem’s action, U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco said the plaintiffs made a compelling case that race motivated the decision to remove their protections: “The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty and the American dream. That is all plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names and purify their blood. The court disagrees.”

Thompson added that Trump’s 2023 statement claiming migrants are “poisoning the blood of our country,” and his January executive order equating the presence of immigrants with an “invasion” lend credence to the claims of racism.

“Plaintiffs provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the secretary’s TPS Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua terminations were based on a preordained determination to end the TPS program, rather than an objective review of the country conditions,” the court ruled.

In oral arguments at the Ninth Circuit Aug. 19, the Justice Department dismissed Trump’s “poisoning” comment as “ancient” history and argued courts have no authority to interfere with Noem’s handling of TPS, Politico reported.

The government also cited a May 19 Supreme Court decision permitting DHS to terminate TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans as rationale for ending the status for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said the cases are not analogous because the plaintiffs in National TPS Alliance II v. Noem have been in the U.S. a decade or more, while Venezuelans affected by the Supreme Court decision won protections much more recently.

“The thing we had in the Supreme Court had nothing to do with these at all,” Arulanantham said during the hearing.

Nevertheless, a three-judge panel issued the order staying Thompson’s decision after an urgent request from the Trump administration.

“The court’s failure to provide any reasoning for its decision, including why this was an ‘emergency,’ falls far short of what due process requires and our clients deserve,” Arulanantham said in response. “The decision simply sanctions the government’s power grab, exposing tens of thousands of people to illegal detention and deportation.”

The ruling confirms the administration is “systematically de-documenting” immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for decades while starting businesses and families with American-citizen children, said Jessica Bansal, attorney at the National Day Laborer Organization.

“The court’s unexplained decision to let the TPS terminations take effect — despite a district court finding them likely unconstitutional — will cause tremendous, senseless hardship for tens of thousands of families, including over 40,000 U.S.-citizen children of TPS holders,” she said.

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network lamented the decision and expressed concern for the fate of TPS holders from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.

“More than 63,000 immigrants from those three countries stand to lose their status rapidly and be uprooted from families, jobs and communities,” CLINIC Executive Director Anna Gallagher said.

Plaintiffs in the case said they are devastated by the Ninth Circuit’s order.

“I am heartbroken by the court’s decision. I’ve lived in the U.S. for years, and my kids are U.S. citizens and have never even been to Nepal. This ruling leaves us and thousands of other TPS families in fear and uncertainty,” said plaintiff Sandhya Lama, a TPS holder from Nepal.

The Trump administration had mistakenly deported him there in March, leaving him in the high-security prison known as CECOT.

The other side: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed Abrego Garcia's detention on X.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia was taken into immigration detention in Baltimore on Monday, according to his lawyer.

Why it matters: Abrego Garcia's detention comes after the Trump administration indicated in court filings that it planned to deport him to Uganda after returning him earlier this year from a high security prison in El Salvador.

The big picture: The El Salvadoran, who was living in Maryland with his wife and children until being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement this March, now faces a criminal trial in addition to fighting his deportation case.

A federal judge has said Abrego Garcia can be deported but not to his home country, El Salvador, because of the danger he would face there.

The Trump administration had mistakenly deported him there in March, leaving him in the high-security prison known as CECOT. Abrego Garcia alleges that he was tortured there.

When the administration was ordered to bring him back, Abrego Garcia was charged with human trafficking in a Tennessee federal court. That trial will begin in January.

What they're saying: ""The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him, to punish him for exercising his constitutional rights,"" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia's attorneys, said on the steps of Baltimore's G.H. Fallon Federal Building.

He added Abrego Garcia has a ""constitutional right to fight back against being illegally deported to El Salvador, his constitutional right to speak up through his court filings on the torture and treatment that he received in El Salvador at the direct request of our government.""

The other side: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed Abrego Garcia's detention on X.

""President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,"" she wrote.

The latest: Sandoval-Moshenberg said that Abrego Garcia has filed another lawsuit in federal court in Maryland to ensure he has due process in any potential third-country removal.

""They don't have present legal authority to remove him to Uganda because he's requested a reasonable fear interview. He has the right to court proceedings,"" he said.",https://images.axios.com/3ccOFvkttSQ8oBpsQ2GPWCa_Geo=/0x0:5444x3062/1366x768/2025/08/25/1756127468471.jpeg,N,,2025-08-25 11:58:24.380069

Luke Tryl: No, I don’t think that is the case.
Luke Tryl: I think people like the idea that something is being done.
Luke Tryl: Yeah, absolutely.
Luke Tryl: So most British people are proud of a flag.","We spoke to Luke Tryl, who’s Executive Director of the think tank and research agency More in Common UK, on how concerned voters are about immigration.

Cathy Newman: These protests this weekend turn out as pretty muted. Does that mean people don’t by and large care that much about the problem of immigration and asylum hotels, or not?

Luke Tryl: No, I don’t think that is the case. What we’ve seen over the past year is both the salience of immigration and channel crossings rising up the public’s agenda. We track the public’s top issues every week and this week, for the first time, whilst cost of living was still number one, levels of immigration actually overtook the NHS just for the number two spot. And then in fourth, it was channel crossings. So a big issue for the public. And we’ve also seen opposition increase. When we asked two years ago if you would support asylum seekers being housed in temporary accommodation in your area, it was basically split, slightly more opposed than supported. That has changed. And the number who are strongly opposed has risen by 21 points in a two-year period.

So something has definitely shifted, but what I should say is that’s very different to violence and violent protests, and we know from our research that most Brits, the overwhelming majority, condemn violence, bigotry, intimidation of the sort we’ve seen in some of those protests.

“Most Brits, the overwhelming majority, condemn violence, bigotry, intimidation of the sort we’ve seen in some of those protests.”

– Luke Tryl

Cathy Newman: Right, and I’ll pick up on that in just a second, but where does all this leave Sir Keir Starmer’s announcement, overhauling the asylum system? Sort of quite complex, it might be quite time consuming. Is that going to register with people or not?

Luke Tryl: I think people like the idea that something is being done. You know, this is one of those issues where people I think sort of almost want to throw everything at the wall within what’s possible, within what’s legal and see what sticks – the returns deal with France, the work on the gangs, the announcement today on the new courts and judicial process. I think it does cast an image in people’s minds of something being done but you’ve got to remember the public patience on this issue is wearing really thin. They think they’ve been told time and time again we are going to, as Rishi Sunak said, stop the boats and they’re going to have to want to see some progress because it’s becoming a real political issue for the government.

Cathy Newman: And it will take time for the Labour government’s proposals to go in and bed in. So let’s come to Nigel Farage, then, because he’s promising mass deportations, a withdrawal from European treaties on human rights and torture. It’s a lot more dramatic, isn’t it? Does that resonate with the public?

Luke Tryl: Well, we know if you ask people who are planning on voting reform, what is the main reason that you’re voting for the party, immigration is way ahead. You know, they’re as close to being a single issue party as you get in British politics. So there’s no doubt it’s their strong point. But I do think there are a couple of risks in Reform’s approach. For instance, when we last polled on the European Court of Human Rights, we found 58% of the public wanted to stay in. That was actually up over the past year, and I think the idea of getting into long protracted debates with Europe again puts lots of people off. There’s also amongst the British public no desire for cruelty towards people who travel here. People will often say in the same breath, ‘oh, I’m a bit worried, you know, about pressure on services. Can we afford this at a time when Britain’s struggling? But equally, I can understand, it must be terrible to make that decision to leave your country and travel here.’

Cathy Newman: Well, because, you know, some of the people in the hotels where the protests are, they’ve come from Afghanistan, from Eritrea, many will have been tortured. Is there public sympathy for them still?

Luke Tryl: Yeah, absolutely. When we speak to people, they will say, the decision to have to leave your country and the circumstances which some of these people have been in is terrible. The worry comes down to – number one, pressure on services, number two, can we afford it? And I think the danger for Reform UK is they can take a hard line on stopping illegal crossings but a British public balance control and compassion.

“I think the danger for Reform UK is they can take a hard line on stopping illegal crossings but a British public balance control and compassion.”

– Luke Tryl

Cathy Newman: Let’s come to flags, because there are a lot of flags behind Frances and in her piece just now. There’s been this outbreak of flag flying in the wake of all the protests over asylum hotels. How is the St. George’s flag seen by the public?

Luke Tryl: So most British people are proud of a flag. In fact, when you ask people how do you feel when you see the St. George’s Cross flying, most Brits say that it makes them feel happy, they feel good about it. They like celebrating our national culture. Most Brits are very patriotic. But it’s a bit more subtle than that kind of American style standing up during the Pledge of Allegiance. So whilst on important days or on civic buildings, people expect to see the flag. I just wonder if the sort of flags everywhere, it looks a little bit odd. It jars a little with that kind of muddling through sense of patriotism that lots of Brits have.

He faces possible efforts by the Trump administration to deport him to Uganda.

The 30-year-old Salvadoran national was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the 30-year-old married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He denies the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution. Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to the smuggling charges.

Here's the latest:

Special envoy Keith Kellogg was speaking in Kyiv on Monday about efforts to end the three-year war between Russia and Ukraine as a lack of progress fuels doubts about whether a peace settlement could be on the horizon.

Officials are “hoping to get to a position where, in the near term, we have, with a lack of a better term, security guarantees” that address Ukraine’s fears of another invasion by Russia in the future, Kellogg said.

""That's a work in progress,"" Kellogg said of the potential security guarantees after attending Ukraine's annual National Prayer Breakfast along with politicians, business leaders and diplomats.

A week ago, President Trump said he'd set in motion arrangements for direct peace talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But Russian officials have signaled that such a summit won't happen any time soon.

The president plans to sign an executive order threatening to revoke federal funding from local and state governments that allow cashless bail, according to a White House official. The official requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the matter before a public announcement later in the morning.

Trump has been escalating his focus on public safety, particularly in Democratic cities such as Washington, where he’s deployed National Guard troops and federal agents over the objections of local officials.

The president is scheduled to sign executive orders at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. One involves ending cashless bail, according to the White House Assistant Press Secretary. Another is designed to crack down on those who burn the American flag, which is an act protected by the First Amendment.

At noon, he's scheduled to greet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. The two will then participate in a bilateral meeting and a lunch, where they're expected to discuss trade and defense issues.

President Trump will sign an executive order later Monday that’s meant to crack down on those who burn the American flag, which is protected by the First Amendment.

The order calls on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute those who break laws “in ways that involve desecrating the flag,” according to a White House official.

Under the order, Bondi would also pursue litigation with the intent to potentially change what is allowed on flag burning under the First Amendment. The administration would also be allowed in some cases to deny or revoke visas to foreigners who participate in the act.

Trump has long demanded punishment for those who burn a U.S. flag, although the Supreme Court has ruled that doing so is a form of constitutionally protected free speech.

The court order signed by Chief Judge George Russell III automatically pauses any effort by the Trump administration to immediately deport Abrego Garcia.

Any immigrant seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court is covered by the order, which blocks their removal from the U.S. until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed. In June, the administration sued all of Maryland's 15 federal judges to challenge the standard order.

Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, says a lawsuit had been filed in federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention asking for an order that he not be deported.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

This latest development makes good on a directive issued late last week by Trump's defense secretary.

A Defense Department official who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly said some units on certain missions would be armed — some with handguns and others with rifles. The spokesperson said that all units with firearms have been trained and are operating under strict rules for use of force.

An Associated Press photographer on Sunday saw members of the South Carolina National Guard outside Union Station with holstered handguns.

A statement from the joint task force that has taken over policing in the nation’s capital said units began carrying their service weapons on Sunday and that the military’s rules say force should be used “only as a last resort and solely in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.” It said the force is committed to protecting “the safety and wellbeing” of Washington’s residents.

But the court documents weren’t publicly available. They filed it in the federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, where U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has been presiding over a string of hearings for the original case.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s story begins in his native El Salvador, but it’s become increasingly unclear where it will end.

A local gang, Barrio 18, began extorting his family for “rent money.” When he was 12, the gang threatened to take Abrego Garcia away until his father paid “all of the money that they wanted.”

Abrego Garcia eventually fled to the U.S. illegally around 2011, the year he turned 16, according to documents in his immigration case. He found work in construction.

In March 2019, Abrego Garcia went to a Home Depot seeking work as a laborer when he and three other men were detained by local police, court records say. They were suspected of being in MS-13 based on tattoos and clothing, according to the records.

Abrego Garcia became a flash point in Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's earlier determination that he faced a ""well-founded fear"" of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The latest filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

On Friday, Abrego Garcia returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

Take care of yourself.” LISTEN: EL PASO MATTERS PODCAST","It was a hot July summer day in Miami when, looking to make a little extra income, Ricardo Quintana Chavez took to the beach to sell ceviche.

In just four weeks since, he’s been in four different detention centers – including the Dade County jail, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Florida known as Alligator Alcatraz, and two immigration detention facilities in El Paso.

“Hace un mes que no veo el sol. He bajado de peso 15 libras y tengo barba del siglo 19. Estoy desesperado y tambien por mi familia,” Quintana told El Paso Matters during a brief phone call from the East Montana Detention Facility on Fort Bliss. “I haven’t seen sunlight in a month. I’ve lost 15 pounds and have a 19th-century beard. I’m distressed for myself and for my family as well.”

Quintana, 57, an investigative journalist from Peru, said he sought asylum in the United States in 2021 after receiving death threats for his coverage of the Peruvian presidential elections and government corruption. While he had authorization to remain and work in the United States while his asylum case was heard, he said a definitive court date had never been set.

While in Florida, he worked in restaurants, ride-share companies and for a Peruvian natural products company. But as his salary and work hours were cut, he said he looked for ways to make extra income.

When he was detained in Miami for the civil infraction of selling items on a public beach without a permit, he paid the $180 fine – but was released to ICE agents who quickly and unexpectedly took him to Alligator Alcatraz. He was there through Aug. 8, when he was transported to the detention facility in Northeast El Paso, and transferred to the Fort Bliss center Aug. 15.

The $1.2 billion ICE detention complex – which will be the largest federal detention center for civil detainees in the country when it expands to accommodate 5,000 people – opened Aug. 1. Within two weeks, it held about 1,000 people.

The facility includes a game room, library, dining area and health care areas. The white reinforced tent facility sits on military land in the desert north of Montana Avenue near George Dieter Drive. It is staffed by ICE personnel and temporary employees who work under a private contractor.

“Es mejor aquí, si, pero mejor que que?” (“It’s better here, yes, but better than what?”) Quintana asked about the facility on the Eastside, which he characterized as cleaner, bigger and “more humane” than the one in Florida. In Alligator Alcatraz, he said, he was made to use the restroom while shackled and with an ICE agent in front of him with his back turned.

“When they took me to the county jail in Miami, that’s when my misfortune began,” he said in Spanish. “It was traumatic to be shackled at my feet and hands as if I had committed a major crime – or a crime at all. How is it that being in this country – with the government’s permission at that – is now a crime? Why was I considered to have legal status when it came to paying taxes but not now?”

Quintana came to the United States on a visitor visa for two weeks in 2019, and returned to Peru within the required time, according to his family. In August 2021, he returned to the United States on another visitor visa.

At that time, his family said, they received a letter containing death threats against him and his family stemming from his work as a journalist. Quintana said that’s when he decided to request asylum – a move his family supported for his safety. He was granted authorization to remain in the country and work here.

On July 20, he was selling ceviche on the beach when he was approached by local police. He was taken to the county jail and issued a fine, which he paid. Upon his release, he was turned over to ICE agents, who accused him of having overstayed his 2019 visa, he said, adding that he wasn’t given an opportunity to present the necessary documents needed to prove otherwise.

He was transported to Alligator Alcatraz, a converted airstrip at the abandoned Dade-Collier airport in the marshy Everglade wetlands just west of Miami. The center has a capacity of about 3,000 people and is among several ICE facilities erected to expand immigrant detention capacity under President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

In response to a lawsuit by environmental groups, a federal judge on Thursday ordered that detainees be moved out of the facility within 60 days, no longer accept new detainees and that equipment such as generators and fencing be dismantled.

“En una miseria increíble,” Quintana said Thursday, recounting that it took 12 hours to be processed into the facility – all while shackled. Eventually he was placed in a 13-by-10-foot cell with about 30 other people. The facility was overcrowded and dirty, he said, and the meals were like dog food. “It’s unbelievably miserable.”

He said he – like many others – weren’t told why they were being transferred to Texas. At the Northeast El Paso facility, he said, staff were generally nicer and more tolerant than in Florida. But detainees were still demeaned, he said.

Nights are always the worst, he said.

“Los llantos y gritos de la gente desesperada te rompe el corazón, especialmente porque sabemos que la mayoría de los que estamos aquí no deberíamos,” he said. “The cries and screams of desperate people break your heart, especially because we know that the majority of those here shouldn’t be.”

Civil rights organizations such as ACLU Texas, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Border Network for Human Rights have denounced what they call inhumane conditions at the detention facilities, also protesting that they’re being built on military bases with Department of Defense dollars.

On Thursday, the groups gathered alongside the veterans organization Common Defense in El Paso, saying in a statement that converting the base into an immigration detention center is “a betrayal of our values, a misuse of resources, and a stain on our nation.” The groups pointed out that a tent facility leaves detainees exposed to brutal heat and sandstorms.

“Military bases are meant to protect our freedoms, not cage human beings,” Common Defense’s Lead Texas Organizer and Air Force veteran Britni Cuington said in a statement. “The fact that ICE is detaining people at Fort Bliss is disgraceful and unacceptable.”

Waiting to be sent home

For Quintana, the site of a detention center is not a concern as much as being locked up not knowing where he stands or where he might be sent next.

Quintana said he wants to self-deport rather than wait to be officially removed, which can take much longer than the alternative, he said. Under voluntary departure, he’d be allowed to leave at his own expense and on his own terms. A forced removal, or deportation, carries consequences such as reentry bans.

The wait might be especially long since deportation flights to Peru are much less frequent. In July 2025, four deportation flights to Peru were recorded – compared with 54 to Guatemala, the highest for any receiving country that month, according to an ICE flight monitor known as Witness at the Border, now under the organization Human Rights First.

Since Trump’s inauguration in January through July, 1,036 deportation flights have been recorded – an increase of 15% over the same time the previous year, according to the flight monitor.

At the same time, detentions of immigrants continue on the rise: As of Aug. 10, more than 59,000 people were in ICE detention – 70% without any criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, or TRAC. The majority of detainees – over 13,000 – are in Texas.

TRAC isn’t yet reporting the number of detainees at the East Montana facility, but another ICE detention center in East El Paso had an average daily population of just over 800 in early August. The tent facility in Northeast reported just under 200 at that time.

Quintana, a longtime reporter and editor who last worked for Digital TV Peru, graduated from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Lima and the Universidad de San Martin de Porres, earning communication and journalism degrees. He said men of all ages and backgrounds are being detained at the East Montana facility.

He said his heart breaks most for the young men who braved traversing thousands of miles across dangerous countries with the goal of working and earning a little money to send home. Now they’re imprisoned, he said, and they’re too young to understand why.

Journalist’s case gets news, government attention

For Quintana, his reporting background has helped his story get news coverage in his home country, he said, prompting his case to be discussed in a foreign relations committee hearing by the Peruvian congress Aug. 18. Committee members said that the government should seek to help Peruvians detained not just in authoritarian countries, but in democratic countries where they’re essentially being disappeared.

Sadith Tavara, Quintana’s wife, said journalism has always been a way of life for him. “He’s a police investigative journalist and he’s very passionate about his profession, about ensuring that people know the truth,” Tavara told El Paso Matters.

Quintana’s family had struggled to find an attorney, particularly as he’s been moved around so much. On Friday, he talked to an attorney who is now working to get his case file from Florida to set up a hearing, Tavara said.

“We’re a little more hopeful, but we won’t be at ease until he’s home,” Tavara said.

Tavara said the family most fears that he’ll remain locked up longer than his mental health can handle – or that he’ll be deported to a country other than Peru. Their hope, she said, is that he’s allowed to self-deport soon.

“A place like that can break anyone,” she said, adding that being jailed in a foreign country where he’s unwanted has been difficult for her husband. “We want him back.”

Quintana’s sister, Monica, called his situation, like that of many others, a violation of civil rights.

“Everything that is happening is devastating for families who are undergoing the same travesty,” she said.

She said she’s been able to talk to her brother almost daily. On days she doesn’t hear from him, she fears the worst. On a recent call, she said, he broke down and there was little she could say to comfort him.

“You just don’t know, “ she said, “and not knowing is the worst.”

In his call with El Paso Matters, Quintana said he has changed his perspective about the United States.

“Estoy viviendo la pesadilla americana,” he said. “I’m living the American nightmare.”

“No pienso regresar nunca más en mi vida,” he added. “I don’t plan to ever return in my lifetime.”

Quintana said he had planned to return to Peru soon: His ailing mother is 81 and has had heart complications.

On Aug. 10, his family was being interviewed by a Peruvian news organization, Cuarto Poder, when he called his mother to check in.

“Tranquila, mami, tranquila. Ya pronto nos veremos las caras o sea lo que quiera Dios.

Cuidate,” he told her as she sobbed. “Remain calm, mami, remain calm. We will see each other face-to-face soon, God willing. Take care of yourself.”

In a statement, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem confirmed his arrest and said that ICE ""are processing him for deportation"".

He was mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador in March, and then brought back to face criminal charges.

US authorities have informed him he may be deported to Uganda, following his refusal to accept a plea deal, his lawyers say.

His legal team accuses the US of trying to ""coerce"" him to plead guilty by threatening to re-deport him ""halfway across the world"".

""The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him, to punish him for exercising his constitutional rights,"" one of his attorneys, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told reporters outside the ICE office.

He said that Mr Abrego Garcia had filed a new federal lawsuit in Maryland challenging his current detention and potential deportation ""to Uganda or any other country"" until he has a trial.

They have said their client declined an offer to plead guilty to human smuggling charges in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica. He was asked to check in on Monday at the field office in Baltimore.

During the interview, Mr Sandoval-Moshenberg said ICE officers had taken Mr Abrego Garica into custody with no explanation. An officer told the attorneys he would be taken to a detention center but would not specify which one.

His attorney argued there was no reason to detain Mr Abrego Garcia, as he was under ankle monitoring and ""basically on house arrest"".

His supporters now fear he faces a second deportation - this time to Uganda, a country where he has no known ties.

Supporters held a rally outside the premises in support of the Salvadorean national, whose drawn out immigration case has made global headlines.

Abrego Garcia on Monday filed a lawsuit challenging his current detention and any deportation to Uganda or any other country until a trial is held at an immigration court.

In a statement after his detention, Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said Abrego Garcia is being processed ""for removal to Uganda.""

At the core of Abrego Garcia's case is the question of due process under President Trump's aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The man was arrested in March and sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to the Central American country because of the ""well-founded fear"" of gang persecution there. The Trump administration conceded Abrego Garcia's removal was an ""administrative error,"" and returned him to the U.S. in June, to face criminal charges.

He was indicted on two charges, including conspiracy to transport undocumented immigrants and unlawful transportation of migrants without legal status.

The Trump administration has said it intends to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, despite the latter government indicating last week it prefers to receive people from other African countries and individuals without criminal records.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys said in a court filing that the U.S. government has offered the possibility of deporting him to Costa Rica if Abrego Garcia pled guilty to the criminal charges against him and served the imposed sentence.

Associated Press

BALTIMORE (AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia surrendered to U.S. immigration authorities in Baltimore Monday and faces possible efforts by the Trump administration to deport him immediately.

The 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

“This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Abrego Garcia entered the offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a downtown office building. His wife emerged without him a few minutes later, appearing to have tears in her eyes.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a tweet that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said a lawsuit had been filed in federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention asking for an order that he not be deported.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

Abrego Garcia became the face of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee. He returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, which recently agreed to a deal to accept certain deportees from the U.S. He declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Filings in federal court show the Costa Rican government saying Abrego Garcia would be welcomed as a legal immigrant and wouldn’t face detention.

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

“Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,” Gilmartin said.

The U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours’ notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.

“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration gutted some of the entities tasked with facility oversight, including the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman.","At least a dozen Democratic members of Congress have been denied entry to federal immigration facilities this year when they showed up to conduct oversight as President Donald Trump has ramped up his mass deportation efforts—and now they are suing the Trump administration.

The lawsuit was filed in the federal district court for the District of Columbia on July 30 by 12 Democrats from the House of Representatives, including El Paso Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, who has provided oversight of such facilities for several years.

“As part of its campaign of mass deportation, the Trump-Vance administration has stretched the U.S. immigration detention system far beyond its capacity. More people are being held by the United States in immigration detention than ever before, with many facilities housing more individuals than they were built to contain,” the lawsuit states. “Reports of mistreatment have been widespread and have included disturbing details of overcrowding, food shortages, lack of adequate medical care, and unsanitary conditions.”

Since 2019, Congress has adopted statutory provisions stating that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may not use federal funds may to prevent members “from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house” noncitizens, per the lawsuit. Those mandates for unfettered oversight were a direct response to Trump’s attempts to block members of Congress under his first administration.

However, since June, several members of Congress have been turned away when attempting to enter and examine federal immigration facilities, including privately run detention centers and ICE field offices where immigrants have been detained.

Escobar currently serves on the House Appropriations Committee and its Subcommittee on Homeland Security, which oversees DHS. In her six years serving Congress, she and her staff members have conducted numerous visits to DHS facilities, and identified issues that saved taxpayers money or improved facility conditions for detainees. Prior to this year, she had only been turned away once, in 2019, from a facility when attempting to conduct oversight.

“It is not acceptable for the Trump administration to ignore the law and limit Congressional oversight and authority; this cannot go unchallenged,” Escobar said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.

U.S. Representative Greg Casar, an Austin Democrat, is among the latest members of Congress to be turned away when requesting to conduct oversight duties. On August 15, Casar attempted to access the Don T. Hutto Detention Center in Taylor, which is operated by DHS contractor CoreCivic, to conduct oversight after receiving complaints that the air conditioning was not functioning properly and that detainees were “boiling.” The congressman, along with Austin-based attorney Andrea Jarero, who was trying to visit a client, were both denied access by CoreCivic.

When journalists, activists, Casar and his staff arrived at the detention facility, CoreCivic employees had blocked off access to the building’s parking lot with traffic cones and two white vans. A CoreCivic employee exited his vehicle, and told Casar he’d need to schedule any visits at least seven days in advance.

“This advance notice is necessary to ensure proper scheduling and to avoid any intrusion on the President’s Article II authority to oversee executive department functions,” the employee said, reading from a piece of paper.

The statutory provisions of recent DHS appropriations bills explicitly say that they may not “be construed to require a Member of Congress to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a [DHS] facility.”

However, per the lawsuit, the Trump administration has unilaterally enacted a new policy that requires seven calendar days’ notice ahead of any visit to a DHS facility.

“What are they hiding, if they will break the law and not let a member of Congress in?” Casar said. “What are they hiding if they’ll violate constitutional rights and not let a lawyer in?”

Casar said that he intends to join his fellow Democratic members of Congress as a plaintiff in the lawsuit—though he has not done so yet.

Texas has the largest immigration detention capacity in the country, putting the state on the front lines of Trump’s mass deportation agenda. As of early August, more than 13,000 immigrants were detained in Texas facilities, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC)—far more than any other state. That number will likely continue to grow: a new, $1.24 billion immigration detention camp opened last week on Fort Bliss, a military base in El Paso, and is poised to be the nation’s largest once it reaches its full capacity to hold 5,000 people. (Escobar was allowed to access that facility on August 18, and said it held 1,000 detainees at that time, though she was not able to speak to any.)

Recent events bring new urgency to immigration detention inspections: as of late June, 13 people had died in ICE detention this fiscal year—which is the same amount of deaths for the entirety of fiscal year 2024. (A report from several advocacy groups found that dozens of deaths between 2017 and 2021 in ICE detention facilities could have been prevented with adequate medical care.)

Additionally, more people are detained in ICE custody than ever before, and that number will likely continue to grow. The agency is also set to receive historic levels of funding; HR1, Congress’ recent tax cuts-and-spending bill, contains $75 billion for ICE detention and removal operations.

As spending ramps up, oversight mechanisms have been stifled. Earlier this year, the Trump administration gutted some of the entities tasked with facility oversight, including the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman.

Escobar, the El Paso Democratic House member, said oversight is supposed to be multi-layered, but now “Trump has effectively done away with government watchdogs,” she told the Texas Observer.

Since the other agencies tasked with holding DHS accountable in detention centers have had major staff cuts, the role of members of Congress in conducting oversight of immigration detention is more important than ever, she said.

“There’s absolutely no reason for [DHS Secretary] Kristi Noem to block members of Congress from our legal ability to enter a facility unannounced,” Escobar said. “Unless she believes she has something to hide.”",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1518-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 09:56:21.259689

This swing to MAGA helped Trump win, kicked Democrats into the political wilderness, launched a thousand thought pieces and showed politicians that they ignore Latinos at their own risk.

Now, Latinos once again hold the power to make or break American politics, thanks to redistricting fights shaping up in Texas and California. And once again, both Democratic and Republican leaders think they know what Latinos want.

In the Lone Star State, the GOP-dominated Legislature last week approved the redrawing of congressional districts at the behest of Trump, upending the traditional process, to help Republicans gain up to five seats in the 2026 midterms. Their California counterparts landed on the opposite side of the gerrymandering coin — their maps, which will go before voters in November, target Republican congressional members.

Texas Republicans and California Democrats are both banking on Latinos to be the swing votes that make their gambits successful. That’s understandable but dangerous. If ever a voting bloc fulfills the cliche that to assume something makes an ass out of you and me, it’s Latinos.

Despite President Reagan’s famous statement that Latinos were Republicans who didn’t know it yet, they rejected the GOP in California and beyond for a generation after the passage of Proposition 187 in 1994. When Hillary Clinton supporters whispered during the 2008 presidential race that Latinos would never vote for a Black candidate, they gladly joined the coalition that put Barack Obama in the White House. Trump increased his Latino support each time he ran — to the point that in 2024, a bigger proportion of Latinos voted for him than for any previous Republican presidential candidate — even though Democrats insisted that Latinos couldn’t possibly stomach a man that racist.

Many Latinos hate being taken for granted and don’t like the establishment telling them how to think. It’s classic rancho libertarianism, the term I created in the era of Trump to describe the political leanings of the people with whom I grew up: Mexican Americans from rural stock who simultaneously believed in community and individualism and hated the racist rhetoric of Republicans but didn’t care much for the woke words of Democrats, either.

Such political independence exasperates political leaders, yet it’s long been a thing with Latino voters across the U.S. but especially in Texas and California, where Mexican American voters make up an overwhelming majority of each state’s Latino electorate. As Republicans in the former and Democrats in the latter launch their initial redistricting volleys, they seem to be forgetting that, yet again.

The GOP is hoping voters in South Texas, one of the most Latino areas of the U.S., will carry their Trump love to the 2026 congressional races. There, two of the three congressional seats are held by Democrats Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, despite a swing from most of the region’s 41 counties supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016 to just five going for Kamala Harris eight years later.

In their new maps, Texas legislators poured more Republican voters into those South Texas districts. They also configured new districts in the Houston area and central Texas so that Latinos are now the majority, but voters favored Trump last year.

But a lawsuit filed hours after the Texas Senate moved the maps to Gov. Greg Abbott for his approval alleged that all the finagling had created “Potemkin majority-Latino districts.” The intent, according to the lawsuit, was to dilute Latino power by packing some voters into already Democratic-leaning districts while splitting up others among red-leaning districts.

The legislators especially threw San Antonio, a longtime Democratic stronghold that’s a cradle of Latino electoral power, into a political Cuisinart. Three Latino Democrats currently represent the Alamo City and its metro area: Cuellar, Joaquin Castro and Greg Casar. Under the new maps, only Castro is truly safe, while Casar is now in a district represented by Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who has announced he will retire.

“We have three Hispanic-predominated districts in South Texas that we believe we can carve out for Republican leadership,” state GOP Rep. Mitch Little bragged on CNN this month. “It’s good for our party. It’s good for our state. And we need to ensure that Donald Trump’s agenda continues to be enacted.”

The thing is, fewer and fewer Latinos are supporting Trump’s agenda. In Reuters/Ipsos polls, his Latino support dropped from 36% in February to 31% this month. Only 27% of Latinos approved of his performance in a Pew Research Center poll released this month.

If this slide continues through next year and Latinos continue to reject MAGA, Texas Republicans would have done Trump’s gross gerrymandering and sparked a nationwide legislative civil war for nothing.

In California, Latino voters are also crucial to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting push — but Democrats are hoping they’ll be GOP spoilers, despite their recent tack to the right.

Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley’s district would swing into Sacramento, picking up many more Latino voters than he now has in the majority white Eastern Sierra.

Proposed districts for Democrats Josh Harder and Adam Gray in Central California and Derek Tran in Orange County, all of whom the party is trying to buttress after they squeaked through in close elections in the fall, also include areas with more Latinos. A new congressional district in southeast L.A. County would probably be filled by a Latino Democrat.

Powerful Latinos in the state have already come out in favor of Newsom’s so-called Election Rigging Response Act, and the governor is counting on them to convince Latino voters to approve the maps in November.

But all this shuffling is happening a year after those very voters jolted state Democrats. Although the party still holds a super-majority in Sacramento, Democratic legislators serve alongside the largest number of Latino GOP colleagues ever. The biggest swings to Trump happened in areas with larger Latino populations, according to a Public Policy Institute of California report published last month.

The president’s popularity is especially souring in California due to his deportation deluge — but whether Latinos will support redistricting is another matter.

Although 51% of Latinos support Newsom’s performance, only 43% said they would vote yes on his redistricting push — the lowest percentage of any ethnic group, according to a UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll conducted for the Los Angeles Times. The poll also found that 29% of Latinos are undecided on redistricting — the highest percentage of any group.

Such skepticism is the bitter fruit of a generation of Democratic rule in Sacramento, at a time when blue-collar Latinos are finding it harder to achieve the good life. Politicians blaming it all on Trump eventually created a Chicken Little situation that pushed those Latinos into MAGAlandia — and Newsom, by constantly casting redistricting as a necessary uppercut against Trump, is in danger of making the same mistake.

California Latinos have helped to torpedo liberal shibboleths at the ballot box more often than Democrats will ever admit. A Times exit poll found 45% of them voted to recall Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 while 53% voted yes on the anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 in 2008 even as a bigger majority voted for Obama. So egghead arguments about how redistricting will save the future of democracy won’t really land with the rancho libertarians I know. They want cheaper prices, and Trump isn’t delivering them — but neither is Newsom.

Latinos, as another cliche goes, aren’t a monolith. They could very well help Republicans win those extra congressional seats in Texas and do the same for Democrats in California.

But any politician betting that Latinos will automatically do what they’re expected to ... remind me what happens when you assume something?",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c899c9d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6a%2F99%2Ff16ef9d242a99b2f74e200ae2bd3%2F1518278-me-newsom-redistricting-plan15-ajs.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 09:56:25.133473

On his way to the United States, Mr. Lee made a stopover in Tokyo and met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.","Outside the office, a lawyer for Mr. Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said that the stated intention of the meeting with ICE was for an interview. “Clearly, that was false,” he said, adding that the immigration authorities did not say why Mr. Abrego Garcia was being detained or even where he would be taken.

The crowd of supporters descended into chants of “boos” and “shame” to the news, and immigrant rights volunteers in yellow vests shielded Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family members as they left the building.

Shortly after, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers filed a legal action known as a habeas petition in Federal District Court in Maryland seeking to stop his removal to Uganda. The petition claimed that the Trump administration had re-arrested him without first giving him the opportunity to express “fears of persecution and torture in that country.”

Mr. Abrego Garcia should have a grace period of two business days from being deported again under a standing order issued in May by the chief federal judge in Maryland. The order automatically stopped the government from following through on expulsions of immigrants for 48 hours after they filed habeas petitions.

Over the weekend, his lawyers had accused the Trump administration of seeking to “coerce” a guilty plea from him on the charges of human smuggling that were brought against him in an indictment in June.

The lawyers said the administration had promised to send Mr. Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, where he could live freely as a legal resident, if he pleaded to the charges and agreed to serve whatever prison sentence he eventually received. Otherwise, the lawyers said, Trump officials said they would deport Mr. Abrego Garcia “halfway across the world” to Uganda, where, the lawyers said, “his safety and liberty would be under threat.”

“The government now seeks to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda as punishment, notwithstanding that Costa Rica is willing to take him in as a refugee,” one of the lawyers, Sean Hecker, said after the detention. “The government’s campaign of retribution continues because Mr. Abrego refuses to be coerced into pleading guilty to a case that should never have been brought.”

The arrest in Baltimore was the latest twist in a long-running saga that began this spring, when the Trump administration removed Mr. Abrego Garcia to a notorious terrorism prison in El Salvador, despite a court order that expressly barred him from being sent to the country. Then, after weeks of complaining that they were powerless to bring him back to U.S. soil, Trump officials did exactly that — not merely to correct their own mistake but to file criminal charges against him.

As he arrived for his immigration check-in, Mr. Abrego Garcia was greeted by the cheers of dozens of supporters. His wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and his brother, Cesar, were by his side. Speaking to the crowd, he thanked the people who had stood with him and delivered an emotional plea to immigrants and the immigrant rights community to keep up the fight and not lose hope.

“Brothers and sisters, my name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia,” he said. “And I always want you to remember that today, I can say with pride, that I am free and have been reunited with my family.”

Mr. Abrego Garcia, dressed in jeans, sneakers and a black, gray and white polo, appeared nervous when he first arrived. His eyes shifted from reporters to rally goers, and he took a deep breath. His voice broke as he spoke about how the memories of his family and playing with his children on a trampoline had sustained him while he was detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

But he held back his tears and finished his statement with resolve. He said those moments would continue to fuel him as he continued his legal battles and reminded the audience that his case was not about one immigrant family but the many targeted under the Trump administration’s crackdown.

“To all of the families who have also suffered separations or who live under the constant threat of being separated,” he said, “I want to tell you that even though this injustice is hurting us hard, we must not lose hope.”

He continued: “God is with us, and God will never leave us. God will bring justice to all of the injustice.”

As he climbed the steps to the federal building, with immigration agents around, the scene turned chaotic. Mr. Abrego Garcia bowed his head as he slowly walked into the building. The crowd chanted “ICE go home” and “Si se puede,” or “yes you can” in Spanish.

“Our shared commitment to our country, our oaths of office, and our mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters compel us to warn Congress and the American people of the cascading effects of decisions made by the current administration,” the FEMA employees wrote in the letter.

They added that they hoped their warnings would “come in time to prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.”

Representatives for FEMA and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hurricane Katrina’s landfall in Louisiana and Mississippi caused an estimated 1,833 deaths and $161 billion in property damage and shook the country’s confidence in the government’s ability to handle disasters. President George W. Bush faced intense criticism for the slow federal response to Katrina’s devastation in New Orleans, leading to the resignation of Mr. Bush’s FEMA administrator, Michael D. Brown, and the passage of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act.

That landmark law imposed new eligibility criteria for FEMA administrators, requiring that they have a “demonstrated ability in and knowledge of emergency management.” It also prohibited the homeland security secretary from interfering with FEMA’s “authorities, responsibilities or functions,” among other things.

But the Trump administration has ignored both requirements of the law, the FEMA employees wrote in the letter.

Mr. Trump installed first one and then another acting FEMA administrator who lack experience in emergency management. The current acting head, David Richardson, told employees in June that he did not know the United States had a hurricane season — a comment that unnerved FEMA employees who heard it. The agency later said Mr. Richardson was joking.

And Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has become directly involved in FEMA operations. She has imposed new spending rules that have delayed hundreds of FEMA contracts and that hampered FEMA’s response to the catastrophic floods that swept through Central Texas in July.

At the same time, the administration has eliminated billions of dollars in FEMA grants intended to help communities better withstand disasters. The administration is also now requiring disaster survivors to provide email addresses when applying for FEMA aid, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times — a change that could prevent people with limited internet access from receiving vital assistance.

And the very future of the agency is unclear. In June, Mr. Trump said he wanted to eliminate FEMA after the end of hurricane season and move emergency management efforts “back to the state level.” After the Central Texas floods in July, when many Americans were focused on the rescue efforts, the administration’s rhetoric softened and officials spoke instead of reforming the agency.

Still, about 2,000 employees have left FEMA since Mr. Trump took office, accounting for about one-third of the agency’s permanent work force. Those who resigned included some of the agency’s most accomplished leaders. The situation has alarmed the FEMA employees who signed the letter, which lamented the loss of “experienced staff whose institutional knowledge and relationships are vital to ensure effective emergency management.”

Of the 182 FEMA employees who signed the letter, 36 attached their names, while the rest withheld their identities for fear of retaliation. The letter was sent to the leaders of several congressional committees and to the FEMA Review Council, which Mr. Trump created to provide recommendations on overhauling the agency.

A FEMA employee who helped organize the letter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said many workers declined to sign their names because they worried about being put on administrative leave. That was the fate of 144 employees at the Environmental Protection Agency after they signed a similar letter criticizing the administration.

A second FEMA employee who helped organize the letter, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she wanted to sound the alarm before it is too late and the next hurricane has struck.

This year’s Atlantic hurricane season has been relatively quiet, with Hurricane Erin avoiding landfall in the United States last week. But forecasters say hurricane season could ramp up before it ends on Nov. 30, with storms supercharged by warmer ocean waters fueled by human-caused climate change.

The company’s share price fell more than 16 percent Monday to fresh record lows in trading in Copenhagen.

“This latest development from the hostile U.S. administration is yet another blow to Orsted and makes the stock difficult to invest in,” Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at the Wall Street research firm Bernstein, wrote in a note to clients.

The wind farm, called Revolution Wind, aimed to supply electricity to 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut by next spring.

Revolution Wind is a 50/50 joint venture between Orsted and Skyborn Renewables, a company in the investment portfolio of BlackRock’s infrastructure unit.

The order on Friday to stop work on one of the Danish company’s premier projects heaped pressure on the company, which is seeking new funds from investors.

Earlier this month, Orsted rattled investors when it announced that it would need to raise 60 billion Danish kroner, or about $9.4 billion, by issuing new shares because of its inability to sell a stake in Sunrise Wind, another project off the East Coast of the United States.

In her note, Ms. Venkateswaran said that the order to cease work on Revolution Wind was “out of the blue” given that the project, according to Orsted, is 80 percent complete.

In a letter to Orsted ordering it to halt construction, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which supervises offshore development, mentioned “protection of the environment” and concerns about “national security” but gave little further detail.

On Monday, Orsted said that it would proceed with “preparation” for the planned share issue and that the Danish government, which owns 50.1 percent of the company, continued to support the offering.

Of the Revolution Wind project, the company said it “was evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously with permitting agencies and, potentially, through legal proceedings.”

Earlier this year, Equinor, the Norwegian energy giant, and Governor Kathy Hochul of New York were able to persuade the Trump administration to reverse an order to stop another large project, Empire Wind, off Long Island. Equinor wrote down nearly $1 billion in value because of the resulting delays.

Analysts say Orsted faces difficult decisions in the United States. Abandoning these projects would waste the capital already invested and lead to cancellation fees to contractors.

Yet putting additional money into U.S. projects is now risky, given the skepticism of the Trump administration about offshore wind. “It remains to be seen if management are willing to take such risk or decide to walk away,” wrote analysts from Citigroup.

Mr. Christie, a Republican who was a federal prosecutor before he was elected governor, had been discussing Mr. Trump’s connection to recent F.B.I. searches of the Maryland home and Washington office of John R. Bolton, a national security adviser in the president’s first term.

The raid last week of Mr. Bolton’s home and office was an escalation of a yearslong inquiry into whether he collected or leaked sensitive national security information. That episode, and Mr. Trump’s threat against Mr. Christie, were the latest examples of how the president’s campaign of retribution has undercut the principle that law enforcement should keep a distance from politics.

Mr. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform late Sunday that Mr. Christie had lied about 2013 lane closures on the George Washington Bridge “in order to stay out of prison, at the same time sacrificing people who worked for him.” The president was referring to a decision by Mr. Christie’s associates to close access lanes to the bridge, which links New Jersey and Manhattan, in order to punish the Democratic mayor of a New Jersey town.

“Chris refused to take responsibility for these criminal acts,” Mr. Trump wrote. “For the sake of JUSTICE, perhaps we should start looking at that very serious situation again? NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW!”

The 2013 “Bridgegate” closures created days of traffic jams, and the scandal tarnished Mr. Christie’s reputation and helped to destroy his 2016 presidential candidacy. Mr. Christie has long denied any knowledge of the plan. He could not immediately be reached for comment.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Christie, who have known each other for decades, once had a good relationship. Mr. Christie initially served as the head of Mr. Trump’s first presidential transition team, and he helped Mr. Trump with debate preparations in the run-up to the 2020 election.

But their relationship soured after Mr. Trump refused to concede the 2020 election to Joseph R. Biden Jr. When Mr. Christie ran for president again last year, he was the most vocal Trump critic in the Republican primary field. And members of Mr. Trump’s family are said never to have warmed to Mr. Christie, who led the prosecution that resulted in the 2005 conviction of Charles Kushner, the father of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and former adviser, Jared Kushner. Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Kushner in 2020 and named him ambassador to France this year.

In 2016, two of Mr. Christie’s associates were convicted of wire fraud and other federal charges for their roles in the bridge closure, but the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the convictions four years later. Mr. Trump said at the time that the court’s decision was a “complete and total exoneration” of Mr. Christie, who was not charged in the case, “and all others involved.”

It was not immediately clear what aspect of Mr. Christie’s Sunday appearance on ABC’s “This Week” had led Mr. Trump to threaten him on social media.

Mr. Christie mentioned the president by name after he was asked by the journalist Jonathan Karl whether Vice President JD Vance, who has defended the criminal investigation into Mr. Bolton, is playing a role in it.

Mr. Christie responded by mentioning what he called the administration’s disregard for the idea of separation between the president and criminal investigations. He noted that Mr. Trump had recently described himself as the nation’s “chief law enforcement officer.”

“Donald Trump sees himself as the person who gets to decide everything, and he doesn’t care about any separation,” Mr. Christie told Mr. Karl. “In fact, he absolutely rejects the idea that there should be separation between criminal investigations and the politically elected leader of the United States. This is much different than it’s ever been run before.”

He said Mr. Trump had telegraphed this approach during his 2024 presidential campaign.

“He told you he was going to do this, that he was going to have a Justice Department that acted as his personal legal representation, and that is what they’re doing,” Mr. Christie said.

The search of Mr. Bolton’s Maryland home and Washington office came days after Mr. Trump attacked him for criticizing his approach to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. Mr. Bolton was pushed out of the first Trump administration in 2019, after he disagreed with the president on several foreign policy challenges.

In a statement, Maj. Michael A. Maxwell said that the change was directed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. On Friday, officials said Mr. Hegseth authorized Guard members to carry their weapons, though without giving specifics on how often members would be armed as they walked through the city.

Major Maxwell emphasized that service members would operate under established rules for the use of force, employing it “only as a last resort and solely in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.”

He said that more than 2,200 Guard troops were deployed in Washington as of Sunday, including about 900 D.C. members and others from Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.

Mr. Trump ordered the deployment of troops in Washington two weeks ago, saying that they would help an array of federal agents crack down on crime in the city. But their mission remains vague, and much of the overall federal law enforcement effort has focused on low-level crimes and detention of undocumented immigrants.

Major Maxwell said Guard members would assist in surveying for “community restoration” projects and aid the D.C. police in staffing at public transit stops as the school year began.

Outside Union Station, as travelers waited quietly with their luggage to be picked up, several protesters jeered the half-dozen armed Guard members patrolling the area. One demonstrator, Nadine Seiler, heckled the troops while carrying a sign reading “Free D.C. Release the Epstein Files”; her partner in an orange vest banged a cowbell.

Ms. Seiler, 60, who is from Trinidad and Tobago, called the rollout of the troops in Washington a “manufactured crisis” by Mr. Trump.

She added, “As somebody who bought into American ideals and America’s vaunted Constitution, I can’t articulate how disappointed I am in lawmakers and the American people,” who she said were idle in a time of crisis.

Abbey Schneider, 51, a former Washington resident who was in town visiting family, said near the station that Sunday was the first time she and her daughter had seen Guard members armed after spotting them while out at night last week. “I have a visceral reaction to it,” Ms. Schneider said. “I feel it is unnecessary and a little bit scary. It feels like an escalation.”

The two leaders have a lot in common. Both survived assassination attempts before taking office. Both share an interest in meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. But their priorities diverge when it comes to the seven-decade-old alliance between their two countries — especially over a potential conflict between China and Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own.

Tens of thousands of U.S. troops have long been stationed in South Korea to deter North Korea, which has nuclear arms. But the Trump administration is demanding that Seoul take greater responsibility for its own defense, as Washington expands the role of its troops based in South Korea to help contain China. South Korea fears that this “strategic flexibility,” as the United States calls it, could leave it more vulnerable to the North and increase the chances of the South getting sucked into a war over Taiwan.

Seoul and Washington should ensure that strategic flexibility “will not undermine South Korea’s security” and the allies’ combined abilities to deter North Korea, Mr. Lee’s national security adviser, Wi Sung-lac, told reporters on Friday.

The allies have found some common ground over that principle, Mr. Wi said. But officials were also wary of Mr. Trump’s unpredictability.

“If the president somehow feels that he needs to elicit some more public statements from Lee Jae Myung as a partner in countering the Chinese economic and military threat, that might put President Lee in a position that would take him beyond his current talking points​,” Sydney Seiler, a Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said during an online panel discussion this past week.

Officials in Seoul are also concerned that if China ​invades Taiwan​ and the United States uses its forces in South Korea to defend Taiwan, China and North Korea ​could open another military conflict on the Korean Peninsula.

Similar concerns were behind a 2006 joint statement ​in which the United States agreed to respect South Korea’s position that “it shall not be involved in a regional conflict in Northeast Asia against the will of the Korean people.” Only then did South Korea agree to respect “the necessity for strategic flexibility” of the U.S. forces in ​South Korea.

But that was before the United States saw China as its biggest security threat and made defending Taiwan from Chinese aggression a priority. In recent weeks, some policy analysts in Washington have suggested that the U.S. military should drastically reduce its presence in South Korea because it cannot freely use its bases there to fight a war elsewhere.

If South Korea resists Washington’s demand on strategic flexibility, “the United States can simply relocate key components of its forces in South Korea to another ​region where it will face less constraint in sending them into a Taiwan contingency,” said Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean presidential adviser for diplomacy and national security.

This month, Gen. Xavier Brunson, the top U.S. military commander in Korea, said​ it should not be considered a foregone conclusion that the United States would want South Korea to join in a conflict between Taiwan and China.

But “what’s being asked of Korea is to be stronger” against North Korea so that the U.S. military might be able to “do other things,” General Brunson told reporters at the U.S. base in Pyeongtaek.

On his way to the United States, Mr. Lee made a stopover in Tokyo and met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. In a nod to Washington, Mr. Lee and Mr. Ishiba agreed to improve bilateral ties so that their nations could cooperate better with the United States to help contain China and North Korea. They also compared notes on an overlapping set of challenges, including Mr. Trump’s high tariffs and his pressure on U.S. allies to increase their military spending.

​Seoul and Washington have yet to hash out the details of the broad-stroke trade deal they agreed to​ last month. Mr. Trump agreed to lower his tariffs on South Korea’s exports, like Samsung phones and Hyundai cars, to 15 percent in return for a $350 billion investment package from the country​. He has also said that South Korea should ​increase its annual contribution to the upkeep of​ the U.S. troops on its soil​ to $10 billion​, more than nine times the current level​.

​These demands have some South Koreans wondering if it would be better to try to defend their country without U.S. troops. In recent years, surveys have shown that a majority of citizens want South Korea to build its own nuclear weapons instead of relying on the United States for protection.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/25/multimedia/25trump-news-promo915am/25trump-news-mwfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 09:56:35.018283

Advocates condemn federal deportation push against Abrego Garcia

Immigrant rights group CASA sharply criticized the federal government Monday for its handling of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's case, calling him a ""martyr"" for resisting what they describe as illegal deportation practices.

""Kilmar is being made an example of,"" said Lydia Walther-Rodriguez, CASA's chief of organizing and leadership, in a press release. ""They're throwing the entire federal apparatus at one father of three to prove that no one should dare challenge their authority.""

The statement comes amid growing backlash over the Trump administration's efforts to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, despite ongoing legal proceedings and public support from elected officials. CASA called the government's actions ""torturous"" and demanded an immediate end to what it views as retaliatory enforcement.

Trump to sign order targeting D.C.'s cashless bail policy

Trump is expected to sign an executive order Monday aimed at ending Washington, D.C.'s longstanding cashless bail system, according to a senior White House official. The order would pressure the district to abandon the policy by threatening to withhold federal funding and project approvals.

The directive also calls for suspects arrested in D.C. to be placed in federal custody rather than local detention, further expanding federal control over the city's criminal justice process.

D.C. has operated under a cashless bail framework since 1992, allowing judges to release defendants pretrial based on risk assessments rather than financial conditions. Critics of Trump's move say eliminating the policy could disproportionately harm low-income residents and undermine judicial discretion.

The order follows a series of aggressive federal actions in the capital, including arming National Guard troops and threatening deployments to other cities. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office declined to comment on the pending order.

What did Kilmar Abrego Garcia do?

The Trump administration accuses Kilmar Abrego Garcia of being a member of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang designated as a terrorist organization. The allegation stems from a 2019 police encounter in Maryland, where officers cited his clothing, tattoos, and a confidential source as indicators of gang affiliation. Abrego Garcia denies the claim, and his attorneys argue that the evidence is speculative and uncorroborated. He has never been convicted of gang-related activity in the U.S. or El Salvador.

In 2025, Abrego Garcia was indicted on federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee after being stopped while transporting several passengers. He pleaded not guilty, and his legal team says he was driving construction workers between job sites. No trafficking charges were filed at the time of the stop.

A domestic violence allegation also surfaced in 2021, when his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, filed a protective order claiming physical abuse. She later withdrew the petition, stating the couple had resolved the matter privately through counseling. Vasquez Sura continues to support her husband publicly and denies any gang involvement.

Despite these allegations, Abrego Garcia was granted protection from deportation to El Salvador in 2019 due to threats from rival gang Barrio-18. He has complied with immigration check-ins since then and maintains that he poses no danger to the community. His legal team argues that the government's efforts to deport him—particularly to Uganda—are retaliatory and politically motivated.

Who is Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wife?

Her public efforts have drawn attention to the family's struggle and the broader implications of U.S. immigration policy.

About Abrego Garcia's possible Uganda deportation

Kilmar Abrego Garcia could be deported to Uganda, the Associated Press reported on Saturday, citing a court filing.

The Salvadoran man, who was mistakenly sent to the high-security CECOT prison in El Salvador by the Trump administration in March, was returned to the United States in June following a lengthy court battle to face the human smuggling charges tied to a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee.

He was then held in pre-trial detention in Tennessee, from which he was released on Friday.

Following his release, his attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told CBS News. He declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica, which offered to receive him, so officials have turned to Uganda, which has agreed to receive deportees although preferably ""individuals from African countries.""

Newsweek has contacted the DHS for comment via email.

The check-in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore was part of the conditions of his release from federal custody on parole on Friday.

While such meetings are usually routine and are meant for case updates, Abrego's attorneys said they expected he would be taken into ICE custody during the check-in after the Trump administration announced over the weekend its intenton to deport him to Uganda.

""There was no need to take him into ICE detention. ... The only reason they took him into detention was to punish him,"" for using his constitutional right to speak up and fight proceedings, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego's attorneys, said Monday morning.

He said lawyers asked ICE officers why Abrego was taken into custody, and the officers would not answer. The ICE officers would also not give information as to where Abrego is going, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

Abrego spoke at a news conference before heading into his ICE appointment on Monday morning, surrounded by family, supporters, faith leaders and his legal team, who were all calling for his freedom.

""My name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and I want you to remember this, remember that I am free and I was able to be reunited with my family,"" he said in Spanish before a translator repeated in English.

""This was a miracle. Thank you to God and thank you to the community,"" Abrego added. ""I want to thank each and every one of you who marched, lift your voices, never stop praying and continue to fight in my name.""

It's the latest move by the government to boot Abrego from the country after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, in violation of a 2019 court order. After much legal resistance, Abrego was returned to the U.S. in June and hit with human smuggling charges out of Tennessee, which he pleaded not guilty to.

The Trump administration has repeatedly accused Abrego of being a gang member part of the notorious MS-13, which his attorneys have denied. Abrego’s lawyers have said he illegally immigrated to the U.S. when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland to escape gang violence in El Salvador.

The Trump administration offered Abrego a plea deal last week, his lawyers said in a Saturday court filing that was part of their efforts to get the charges in Tennessee dropped over what they consider to be ""vindictive"" and ""selective"" prosecution.

If he pleads guilty to the federal charges out of Tennessee and serves time, he can be deported to Costa Rica. The Costa Rican government said he'd live as a free man there, according to the filing.

Before Monday morning's appointment, Sandoval-Moshenberg said his client would not be taking the plea deal as Abrego ""will not accept charges of which he's not guilty."" This means the agreement to be deported to Costa Rica could be off the table.

Abrego's attorneys rebuffed the Trump administration's apparent attempt to strong-arm him.

""What they’re trying to do here is punish him. They’re trying to use the deportation system, and specifically, they’re trying to use which country they’re planning on deporting him to as a means of punishing him for exercising his constitutional rights,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Saturday outside Abrego's brother's home in Maryland.

""As he was leaving the jail in Tennessee on Friday he'd been given a notice requiring him to check in at 8 a.m. this morning,"" Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. ""The notice stated that the reason was interview — clearly that was false.""

Sandoval-Moshenberg said Abrego Garcia had filed a new lawsuit challenging his confinement and deportation to any country ""unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court, as well as his full appeal rights.""

Sandoval-Moshenberg said the ICE officer did not answer when asked about the reason for Abrego Garcia's detention and would not say which detention center he would be taken to or commit to providing paperwork.

""There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshall Service and basically on house arrest,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. ""The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.""

Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January on federal human smuggling charges.

Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial detention on Friday. In a legal filing Saturday, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said Abrego Gracia was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica, which he declined.

He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.

CBS News reported Saturday that hours after he was released, his attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia, who entered the country illegally, was directed to appear at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore on Monday morning. The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement Sunday that he was glad to ""welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.""

""The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring Ábrego García back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda — to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,"" Van Hollen said. ""As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.""

An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country. But the government could legally seek Abrego Garcia's deportation to another country, such as Uganda.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" that ""I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the President of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.""

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this summer approved requests from the Department of Homeland Security to begin holding immigrants at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, Camp Atterbury in Indiana, and Fort Bliss in Texas, while also expanding migrant detention at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, according to correspondence obtained by NPR and confirmed by the Pentagon.

At Fort Bliss, ICE has already begun holding detainees in tent-like facilities, with capacity expected to reach 5,000 people — the largest civil immigration detention site in the United States. In Indiana and New Jersey, officials say the bases could soon accommodate between 1,000 and 3,000 people each. Together, the bases form the core of a new DHS strategy to process and deport immigrants from the country’s interior on an unprecedented scale.

Advocates Warn of Internment Echoes

Civil rights groups say the reliance on military bases for immigration detention is “deeply concerning” and risks normalizing the use of military infrastructure for civilian law enforcement.

“What we’re seeing with Fort Dix is an overreach that we shouldn’t normalize when it comes to the use of military facilities or military resources for immigration detention,” said Ami Kachalia of the ACLU of New Jersey. She and others compared the move to the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, when the U.S. government used military sites to confine citizens and residents based on ancestry.

Christopher Purdy, an Iraq War veteran who once served at Fort Dix, called the new policy the opposite of the humanitarian mission that military bases fulfilled during the 2021 Afghan evacuation. “Instead of taking people out of harm’s way, what they’re actually doing is putting people in danger,” Purdy told DocumentedNY. “Using the military to enforce immigration law is incredibly dangerous to this country.”

Military Readiness vs. Civilian Detention

Hegseth has insisted the deployments will not harm military training or readiness. In letters to lawmakers, he wrote that bases would remain focused on military missions, while ICE contractors and staff handle “all care and custody” of detainees, including meals, transportation, and medical services. Defense officials emphasized that no active-duty personnel would directly guard or process immigrants.

Still, the Pentagon has authorized National Guard troops to assist with detention-related “riot control” and guard duty, raising fears of militarization. Already, Guard units are helping ICE in Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, with hundreds more expected to be called up in at least seven additional states.

Lack of Transparency and Oversight

Lawmakers from New Jersey and Indiana — nearly all Democrats — say they have been left in the dark. Rep. Herb Conaway (D-N.J.) condemned the plan as “an inappropriate use of our national defense system and military resources,” while Rep. Andre Carson (D-Ind.) said his questions about detainee conditions remain unanswered.

The secrecy extends beyond Congress. The ACLU and immigrant rights groups have been denied details about detainee housing, deportation flight operations, or whether attorneys will have reliable access to clients on bases that are otherwise closed to the public. “If members of Congress can’t get inside to conduct oversight,” Purdy said, “what chance do asylum lawyers have?”

Billions in New Funding

The expansion comes on the heels of a congressional spending package that allocated $45 billion for immigration detention centers and $30 billion for ICE personnel, transportation and operations. Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar,” said the administration’s goal is to double U.S. detention capacity to 100,000 beds. “The faster we get the beds, the more people we can take off the street,” Homan said.

A Divisive Model for the Future

Supporters of the move, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), have hailed the Fort Bliss facility as proof of the administration’s commitment to mass deportations. But opponents warn it risks turning military posts into civilian prison camps.

“Military bases are not designed, staffed, or equipped for civilian detention operations,” said Jason Houser, ICE’s former chief of staff, in an interview with The Washington Post. “Detention at these facilities complicates oversight, legal access, and monitoring — raising the risk of violations and lack of transparency.”

For now, immigrant advocates say there is still time to stop the plan from fully taking hold. “These are not wartime operations,” said Sarah Mehta of the ACLU. “These are not national security operations. This is immigration detention, and we should not be using our armed forces to carry it out.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wm9O!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe74bebae-94f4-430d-a7f2-b6537a826f59_1000x667.webp",N,,2025-08-25 11:58:27.601410

What Trump is building is not a system of immigration law but a system of exclusion.","Key points:

Trump’s immigration agenda targets all immigrants, not just the undocumented.

Temporary visa holders and naturalized citizens face revoked visas and denaturalization threats.

Historians warn that the current immigration policies echo past injustices.

The Trump administration’s second-term immigration agenda has been billed as a crackdown on so-called “illegal” immigrants. The reality is much broader and much more dangerous.

In 2025, Trump’s policies have swept far beyond the undocumented. Temporary visa holders, asylum seekers, recipients of humanitarian status, lawful permanent residents, and even naturalized citizens have found themselves in the government’s crosshairs.

The result is a sweeping system of exclusion, one that undermines due process and chips away at the core promise of equal protection under the Constitution.

Since January, the administration has moved aggressively to revoke visas from students and workers over minor violations or even social media posts deemed critical of the government. It has gutted humanitarian protections such as Temporary Protected Status, shut down parole programs for multiple nationalities, and created new barriers to asylum.

It has also gone after permanent residents. Green card holders now face subjective vetting based on so-called “anti-American activity” online. The administration has backed legislation to deport lawful residents for old convictions, including DUIs.

Even citizenship itself is under threat. The Department of Justice has been directed to prioritize denaturalization cases, sometimes over paperwork errors.

In January, Trump issued an executive order attempting to restrict birthright citizenship guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment. Federal courts quickly blocked it, but the message was unmistakable.

As the administration has leaned on obscure legal theories to justify its agenda, Trump’s advisors have floated invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law passed during the John Adams administration, to override due process and accelerate deportations.

Expedited removal — a fast-track deportation procedure once limited to border cases — has been expanded to sweep up people across the interior.

Civil rights groups are fighting back. Legal challenges have slowed some of the administration’s moves, but the scale of enforcement has already changed the landscape.

On July 4, Trump signed into law the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — OBBBA — which the National Immigration Law Center describes as a historic rollback of immigrant protections. The law strips lawfully present immigrants of access to health insurance, nutrition assistance, and even the Child Tax Credit. It raises fees across the board for humanitarian applications, putting due process out of reach for many families.

Even more, OBBBA pours billions into detention and deportation. It provides $45 billion for immigrant detention, including family detention, and $75 billion for border militarization, including $47 billion for continued wall construction.

According to The New York Times, deportations surged to nearly 1,500 people a day this summer. ICE has added more than 50 new detention facilities, including private prisons and military bases. Almost all of the increase in arrests, the Times reported, has been among people with no criminal record.

The government is not distinguishing between undocumented and documented, between recent arrivals and longtime residents. It is casting suspicion on entire communities, reducing legal status to a temporary privilege the state can revoke at will.

Unfortunately, this is not as new as we would like to think it is.

After Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal and incarceration of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans. Two-thirds were U.S. citizens. None were ever charged with espionage or sabotage.

As historian Susan Kamei documents in When Can We Go Back to America?, Roosevelt acted despite intelligence reports concluding Japanese Americans posed no security threat. Instead, racist hysteria and economic opportunism drove the mass removal. California agricultural leaders saw Pearl Harbor as their chance to eliminate Japanese American farmers, openly saying they wanted their land.

The legal justification was flimsy. Officials concocted a “legal fiction” that the entire West Coast was a war zone, even though there was no evidence to support it. The Supreme Court upheld the orders in Korematsu v. United States, deferring to claims of “military necessity.” Justice Robert Jackson dissented, warning the ruling left behind “a loaded weapon” for future abuses.

That loaded weapon is now in Trump’s hands.

The echoes are chilling. Then, Japanese Americans lost homes, businesses, and freedom because of ancestry. Today, immigrants of all statuses are being treated as perpetual suspects, their rights contingent on government approval.

Then, the courts failed to stand up to executive overreach. Today, judges are again asked to decide whether expanded expedited removals and denaturalization campaigns will be allowed to stand.

Then, mass incarceration was justified as a temporary emergency. Today, mass detention is funded through 2029, with billions locked in to expand ICE, militarize the border, and normalize indefinite family detention.

The incarceration left lasting scars. Families lost everything overnight.

Survivors carried deep grief, as Representative Robert Matsui, who was born in camp, once asked: “How can a nation founded on principles of individual rights suddenly deny the due process rights of an entire group of people?”

The answer is the same in 2025 as it was in 1942: through fear, prejudice, and unchecked power.

It took more than four decades for Congress to apologize and offer redress. By then, many incarcerees had passed away. Norman Mineta, who entered camp as a boy and later became a Congressman and a Cabinet secretary, insisted America must remember so history would not repeat.

But history is repeating. The lessons of incarceration are being ignored.

What Trump is building is not a system of immigration law but a system of exclusion. It is a system that punishes families for where they were born, strips rights from lawful residents, and even threatens the constitutional bedrock of citizenship itself.

The question is whether Americans will stand by, just as most did in 1942, or whether we will resist now. The voices of survivors warn us that silence is complicity.

As George Santayana famously wrote, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Kamei adds her own corollary: “Those who don’t know our past will find a way to reinvent it”.

Trump has reinvented it. The rest of us must decide if we will let it stand.

Any immigrant seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court is covered by the order, which blocks their removal from the U.S. until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed. In June, the administration sued all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges to challenge the standard order.

--

Kilmar Abrego Garcia surrendered to U.S. immigration authorities in Baltimore Monday and faces possible efforts by the Trump administration to deport him immediately.

The 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.

“This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”

Abrego Garcia entered the offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a downtown office building. His wife emerged without him a few minutes later, appearing to have tears in her eyes.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a tweet that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said a lawsuit had been filed in federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention asking for an order that he not be deported.

“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.

Abrego Garcia became the face of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee. He returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”

Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, which recently agreed to a deal to accept certain deportees from the U.S. He declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

Filings in federal court show the Costa Rican government saying Abrego Garcia would be welcomed as a legal immigrant and wouldn’t face detention.

In a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.

“Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,” Gilmartin said.

The U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours’ notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.

“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.

In July 2025, the Trump administration announced its plans to use the military base to hold thousands of people facing deportation.
“Using the military to enforce civil law [and] immigration law is incredibly dangerous to this country,” Purdy said.
Following the Trump administration’s memo announcing plans to detain immigrants at military bases, New Jersey Congressmen Herb Conaway and Donald Norcross said the administration has given them no information about the base, despite them requesting full transparency.

In July 2025, the Trump administration announced its plans to use the military base to hold thousands of people facing deportation.

But immigrant justice advocates are concerned that the military base, with its capacity to hold between 1,000 to 3,000 immigrants in detention, would be repeating a shameful history of America’s past when the nation used the military in civil immigration affairs to incarcerate Japanese Americans during World War II. The base currently serves the Air Force, Army and Navy.

The additional lack of transparency about how the facility will operate makes advocates even more worried as New Jersey contends with detention centers already in operation, including New Jersey’s Elizabeth Detention Center with 1,300 beds and the recently opened 1,000-bed center, Delaney Hall.

“The use of the military for interior enforcement is deeply concerning,” said Ami Kachalia, a campaign strategist with the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). “What we’re seeing with Fort Dix is an overreach that we shouldn’t normalize when it comes to the use of military facilities or military resources for immigration detention.”

The use of the Department of Defense (DOD) resources, staff and facilities in civil proceedings, is fairly unprecedented in recent years, Kachalia said. ​​

“This action, in some ways, reopens a shameful chapter of U.S. history putting […] visa holders and long term residents in camps on a military base, harkens back to a dark era [of] Japanese internment, and we must make sure we’re learning from the past and not repeating it,” Kachalia added.

Christopher Purdy, director of the Chamberlain Network, an organization that “organizes veterans in defense of human rights,” said that the use of military bases to hold immigrants originated as a humanitarian effort from the Biden administration during the Afghan evacuation in 2021. Purdy, who served in Iraq in 2011 as a soldier and also formerly worked at the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, said they airlifted 100,000 people out of Kabul into military bases around the world — including Fort Dix — while they sought asylum. The Obama administration also held unaccompanied children at military bases until 2014.

Today, he says the Trump administration is doing the opposite. “Instead of taking people out of harm’s way, what they’re actually doing is putting people in danger.” Like Kachalia, Purdy believes the usage of military installations to conduct civil proceedings and detain immigrants echoes the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II.

“Using the military to enforce civil law [and] immigration law is incredibly dangerous to this country,” Purdy said. “We have a clear separation between law enforcement and the military for a reason, and to use the military in this way is going to put a lot of people at risk.”

Kachalia said that she is concerned that the use of this infrastructure will result in even more enforcement that will impact New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Delaware. She is concerned that the uncertain timeline of this operation calls into question many things such as conditions and access to sufficient food, heating and staffing.

Lack of transparency

After numerous requests by the ACLU and members of Congress, the DOD and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have yet to provide information about the base, a fact that concerns advocates worried about the militarization of immigration enforcement and detention and what that will mean.

Sarah Mehta, deputy director of the ACLU’s immigration team, said that advocates are still trying to learn about the plans for Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst and hope to get more information about who the immigrant population to be detained there will be, how long they’re going to be in detention and if they will be deported from the base.

“These are not wartime operations,” Mehta said. “These are not national security operations.”

She added that it was unclear if the military would still be able to use the base, or use the base for deportation flights. “We haven’t got a public answer about that yet,” she said, “but it could […] really shift the way that people are detained. It can speed up their deportations if they end up using the airfields.”

It is also unclear where detained immigrants will be housed in the base. Purdy said that there are modern barracks as well as World War II era barracks there, but he is unsure what kind of setting immigrants will be in.

He’s not the only one left out of the loop.

Following the Trump administration’s memo announcing plans to detain immigrants at military bases, New Jersey Congressmen Herb Conaway and Donald Norcross said the administration has given them no information about the base, despite them requesting full transparency.

They asked the DOD and ICE administrators to provide them a timeline for operations and information about facility construction and base operations, information about reimbursement and funding, detainee qualifications, and methods of coordination with local authorities by mid-August.

“We condemn in the strongest possible terms the decision by the Trump administration to use Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst as an immigrant detention center,” Congressman Conaway said in a press release. “This is an inappropriate use of our national defense system and military resources.”

Barriers in access to the facility

Among concerns of transparency, Purdy said that as members of Congress have been turned away from entering immigrant detention facilities in California and New York to exercise their oversight, questions remain about the possible additional blocks immigrants at the base will confront when trying to obtain legal counsel for their asylum or deportation hearings.

“This is just another barrier that’s going to be put up in front of their lawyers who are going to have to find ways to get onto posts, and go through another checkpoint that could be weaponized to keep lawyers out,” Purdy said. “If a member of Congress can’t access their legal rights in this environment, what would an asylum attorney be able to do?”

In addition to legal counsel, he believes there are also going to be barriers for protestors, who could be turned away from entering the base.

While protesting at the base might be difficult, there are still ways to oppose it. Mehta said that it is important for people to contact their members of Congress, the DOD, the DHS, and let them know that their communities don’t want the use of the military and their bases to be used in this way. She explained that Congress can exercise oversight and the public can still make their opposition known.

“I think it’s really important for there to be as much vocal opposition as possible, for people to make their feelings known to their local, state and federal representatives, and to try to push against this so that they won’t end up using this base,” Mehta said. “My understanding is it’s not currently in use, and there’s still hopefully a window of time to use public pressure to stop its activation.”",https://bunny-wp-pullzone-0pcifvcfq2.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4-3J5A4819-jpg.webp,N,,2025-08-25 09:56:45.597273

The partnership with ICE has become a lucrative revenue source for the small county 26,400 people.

Local officials said the partnership with ICE has kept them from raising taxes on residents. But immigrant advocates say it has separated breadwinners from their families.

BRAZIL, Ind. — The Clay County Jail is a nondescript building near the heart of this small town, just across the street from the courthouse and a block south of the main thoroughfare.

From the outside, it doesn't look much different than other jails in rural county seat communities across Indiana.

But the similarities end at the door.

Inside, on any given day, the jail is packed with people from outside the county. Some were arrested in Indianapolis and other Indiana cities. Others were hauled in from out of state. Most speak Spanish or another foreign language. And each one represents money in the bank for the county.

The Clay County Jail, about 60 miles southwest of Indianapolis, doubles as one of the major U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers in Indiana and the Midwest. Just seven months into President Donald Trump’s second term, ICE has already funneled more than 3,000 men and women through the jail, paying the county $85 for each day it holds an immigration detainee.

The jail was generating a profit by holding inmates from other agencies long before the Trump administration's aggressive push for mass deportations, which relies heavily on detaining immigrants regardless of criminal history. For more than a decade, the partnership with ICE has been a lucrative revenue source for the small county with a population of 26,400 people. Officials have used the windfall to give raises and bonuses to county workers and help pay for other projects — all without raising local taxes.

The new crush of detainees just means an even bigger gusher of federal dollars.

The county's general fund soared to $13.5 million this year, thanks in part to the jail's partnership with ICE. That's a 224% jump from 2013, when the county first began housing ICE detainees. The jail's budget this year, $4.9 million, is about a third of the general fund. The remainder covers other county expenses and agencies, including the prosecutor's office and the sheriff's department.

In the first four months of this year alone, Clay County has already billed ICE $2.7 million for housing, transporting and feeding detainees, according to invoices from the Clay County Sheriff's Department. That's more than twice the jail's entire budget in 2013.

Members of the Board of Clay County Commissioners and the president of the Clay County Council didn't respond to interview requests from IndyStar or declined to comment about the jail's role with ICE. Clay County Sheriff Brison Swearingen, who oversees the jail, also declined to comment and denied a request for a tour of the jail.

But County Commissioner Paul Sinders explained the rational for the partnership during a conversation with a reporter in 2021: Immigrants detained by ICE are going to be jailed somewhere, so why not here?

At that time, officials were considering whether to approve an expansion project that ultimately added 285 beds to the jail.

The expansion, a windowless 45,420-square-foot jail pod attached at the back of the original building, opened last year. As of early August, the jail had an average daily ICE detainee population of 256, according to TRAC, a research organization at Syracuse University that tracks government data.

""People don’t realize, I believe, that with the ICE inmates it helps keep taxes down,"" Sinders told the Indiana Lawyer. Without the added income, the commissioner said, ""if there’s a shortfall, basically taxes are going to go up, and at this time there is no need for that.""

But immigrant rights advocates have accused Clay County of misusing federal funds meant to maintain humane conditions at the jail. They say this new era of enforcement has led to the costly and unnecessary detention of immigrants who aren’t public safety threats.

Stacy Suh, program director for the Detention Watch Network, a national coalition of advocacy groups, said the crackdown ""creates a perverse financial incentive to keep people incarcerated,"" as local governments face shrinking budgets.

Increasing rates, rising numbers, higher demand

Some county jails, especially those in rural communities, have long relied on renting out beds to other counties, state agencies and the federal government to raise revenue. ICE, for example, has a large network of 200 detention facilities nationwide, including several dozen county jails that have contracts to house immigration detainees.

Clay County first signed an agreement with the U.S. Marshals Service to house federal inmates in 2006, earning a per diem rate of $45 for each person detained for more than two days. The federal government does not pay for detainees who were released within 48 hours.

The contract was modified in 2013 to allow ICE to house immigrants facing deportation at the jail. By 2015, Clay County was receiving $55 per day for each detainee.

In 2021, Illinois passed a law banning new ICE detention centers in the state and ending existing contracts with county jails. Hannah Cartwright, an attorney and co-executive director of Mariposa Legal, an Indianapolis nonprofit that represents immigrants, said this created a demand for more bedspaces in neighboring states.

At that time, the Clay County Jail was the only long-term ICE detention center in Indiana. The following year, the Clay County Commissioners voted to expand the jail.

With the new addition, the jail's ICE detainee population soared — and so did its per diem rate.

By 2024, the daily rate had grown to $85.

That year, the county had 1,052 ICE book-ins, according to a jail log from the sheriff's department. This number includes those who were released or transferred to other facilities.

This year, the ICE book-ins have already nearly tripled. From January to July, the county had 3,503 book-ins.

These numbers significantly dwarf the size of the local inmate population. From January to July, for example, 598 book-ins came from local police and county arrests, as well as some who were held for the Indiana Department of Correction and other state agencies.

The jail took in more ICE book-ins in each of the last two months alone: 673 in June and 677 in July.

ICE partnership seen as a win-win

Last year, Clay County billed ICE $4.3 million for housing, transporting and feeding detainees, according to monthly invoices from the sheriff's department. In just the first four months of this year, the bills have already topped $2.7 million.

To hear officials talk about the partnership, it's a win-win for Clay County and its residents.

County employees received a 3% raise and a 2% bonus, County Commissioner Bryan Allender said in 2021, according to the Brazil Times. Officials were able to buy a new $83,000 HVAC chiller, thanks to ICE funds, the paper reported.

The county was also able purchase new facilities for the local health department and community corrections, as well as a storage building for the sheriff's department. Officials would've had to raise taxes to pay for these projects, County Commissioner Marty Heffner said during a meeting in 2021.

""We are looking at what is best for everyone in Clay County,"" Sinders said, according to the Brazil Times, ""not just the small picture of today, but the big picture of our future generation.""

The jail's 2025 budget showed it allotted $1.5 million for jail officers and more than $650,000 for shift supervisors and drivers to transport ICE detainees. The jail also budgeted $600,000 for inmate meals and $900,000 for medical and hospital costs.

ICE money is 'not a blank check'

Immigrant rights advocates say some of the ways Clay County has used the funds are unethical and illegal.

A lawsuit filed by the National Immigrant Justice Center alleged officials treated the detention of immigrants ""like a cash cow"" while keeping ""grossly inadequate conditions"" at the jail. The lawsuit, which was filed before the jail expansion, alleged officials have spent ""hundreds of thousands of federal dollars"" on expenses unrelated to making sure ICE detainees are held in humane conditions. The lawsuit cited the pay raises and bonuses to county employees and the $83,000 cooling system for the courthouse.

At the same time, the lawsuit alleged that ICE — because it has been increasingly dependent on the county for detention needs — has let the misappropriation slide.

""ICE was fully on notice of that,"" said Mark Feldman, a senior litigation attorney for the center, ""and they just continued to look the other way.""

The lawsuit is still pending. Last year, U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt dismissed Clay County and county officials from the case. But the judge allowed some of the key allegations against ICE — including that it abdicated its responsibility to enforce rules on how Clay County uses federal funds — to move forward.

Feldman said the judge's ruling, while split, reinforces their central argument: ""The money from ICE is not a blank check.""

'It's heartbreaking, and ... we're paying for that'

Advocates and immigration lawyers describe partnerships with ICE as a revenue-generating detention machine built on the backs of some of society's most vulnerable, including many who aren't public safety threats. They point to ICE's own data showing majority of those arrested have not been convicted of crimes or are facing civil immigration violations.

""I wouldn't want to sustain our county based on the mass incarceration of non-citizens, and I certainly wouldn't want to do that based on the mass incarceration of non-citizens in deplorable conditions ... I wouldn't want my taxes to go towards that,"" Feldman said. ""That's exactly what has been happening in Clay County.""

""I would say even more so now, when you have an administration that is hell bent on detaining anyone regardless of criminal history, regardless of danger to the community and has made it fairly clear that they care even less about the conditions people are detained in,"" Feldman added.

Still, more jurisdictions have jumped at the chance to join the Trump administration's sprawling detention apparatus — and earn thousands, if not millions, to supplement local tax revenues.

Three more Indiana counties, including Marion, have reached agreements to house ICE detainees. The other two counties, Clinton located outside of Lafayette and Clark across the Ohio River from Louisville, referred inquiries about those partnerships to ICE, which has not responded with records requested by IndyStar.

Marion County's Adult Detention Center has more modest numbers. During the first seven months of this year, the jail had 945 ICE book-ins. Marion County, which charges ICE a per diem rate of $75 per detainee, has so far received $586,725.

The Miami Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison north of Indianapolis, and Camp Atterbury, a military training facility to the south, are also slated to house up to 2,000 ICE detainees altogether. Gov. Mike Braun told reporters in early August that his goal is for the Trump administration to compensate Indiana for its efforts.

Cartwright, the Indianapolis immigration attorney, said using large facilities, whether they're prisons or military bases, to detain as many people as possible is an ""abnormal"" pattern under the Trump administration.

""It harkens of prison camps from the past,"" she said.

Advocates also say detaining immigrants, often in counties hours away from where they lived, not only isolates them from their attorneys and support network, but also forces even those with meritorious immigration cases to accept deportation. They say it has separated breadwinners from their families and needlessly traumatized their children.

Martha Maust, a volunteer for Indiana AID, a nonprofit that helps ICE detainees in Clay County by connecting them with lawyers and other resources, recalled talking to a woman whose 3-year-old toddler has been asking about her since she was arrested for driving without a license earlier this year.

""It’s heartbreaking, and we’re doing that,"" Maust said. ""We're paying for that. We, the U.S. We, the country. We, the people.""","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/12/PIND/85628520007-2025-08-12-clay-county-detention-mm-006.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y25&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-25 07:56:27.428945
