,Human Rights,2025-09-05 03:18:53+00:00,Miami Herald,"In South Florida, many Venezuelans live in uncertainty as Trump ends TPS protections","Syra Ortiz Blanes, D.A. Varela",,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article311970929.html,"Cecilia’s teenage daughter fled to South Florida in April 2018 after the so-called colectivos and the National Guard assaulted her.
Wednesday’s announcement sets the expectation that, barring a judge’s intervention, about 253,000 Venezuelans will lose their TPS protections by Sept. 10.
However, the Trump administration has said it’s too dangerous for Americans to go there.
Advocates and TPS holders told the Herald they never expected a positive decision from the Trump administration, and had expected Noem to end the protections altogether.
In South Florida, he could give his 15-year-old daughter a better education and a brighter future.","In Venezuela, Cecilia was a veteran government worker who loved working in the tax department and training future generations of civil servants. But she opposed Nicolás Maduro’s government, she says, and assisted the local opposition from the shadows. When a pro-Maduro paramilitary group saw her at a protest, they began stalking her outside her home and on the streets.

Cecilia’s teenage daughter fled to South Florida in April 2018 after the so-called colectivos and the National Guard assaulted her. Cecilia followed eight months later, after finishing treatment for breast cancer and hiding out in family members’ homes.

When the Biden administration granted deportation protections and work permits to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in 2021, Cecilia had already applied for asylum. ButTemporary Protected Status was a welcome relief.

“It’s like when it rains and you have boots and a poncho. It’s another layer of protection for your immigration process,” she said.

Unless a court intervenes, those protections are now set to disappear in just a few days for Cecilia and hundreds of thousands of other Venezuelans living in the United States. President Donald Trump set the TPS protection to end on its original expiration date on Sept. 10, after rolling back a Biden-era extension through October 2026. The decision, coupled with others targeting Venezuelan immigrants, leaves scores of people to face an uncertain future, particularly in South Florida, home to the largest number of TPS recipients in the entire country.

In South Florida, Cecilia – whom the Miami Herald is identifying by her middle name because she is afraid she’ll be kidnapped or disappeared in Venezuela if deported – has continued working in public service. She’s a hotline operator that connects the recently-arrived to social services and helps immigrants do their taxes. She recently bought a home in the Homestead area and aspires to become a financial coach that helps vulnerable communities develop financial literacy. But the possibility of being sent back to a country where she fears her life is at risk has weighed heavily on her mind since President Donald Trump began his second term.

“There’s no justice system over there.There is too much risk of ending up in the dungeons,” she said.

Since 2015, over 7 million people have left Venezuela. Many landed in Florida, where 57 percent of TPS recipients are Venezuelan.

Wednesday’s announcement sets the expectation that, barring a judge’s intervention, about 253,000 Venezuelans will lose their TPS protections by Sept. 10. The decision follows an action by the Trump administration in February to strip another 352,000 Venezuelans of their protected status, granted in 2023, based on the argument that it wasn’t in American interests to keep the program in place.

“We have paid our taxes, we have maintained a completely clean record, and we have worked hard to move forward,” said Carlos Briceño, a TPS beneficiary and project manager in the roofing industry who came to Miami from Venezuela nearly a decade ago. He’s the father of eight-year-old twins, born here. “We have two American daughters who are extremely worried.”

A fierce legal battle

Congress created Temporary Protected Status in 1990 for nationals of countries in turmoil, like ongoing wars or natural disasters. To be eligible, people must already be in the United States before a certain cutoff date, be fingerprinted, have no felonies on record and pass background checks.

President Joe Biden granted Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela in 2021, citing the acute poverty, economic contraction, repressive governance, human rights abuses, collapsing infrastructure, inadequate healthcare, widespread crime, food insecurity and lack of basic services in the country. In 2023, he expanded the designation so more Venezuelans could qualify for the benefit.

But only days after Trump’s return to the White House, the Department of Homeland Security announced that “notable improvements” in areas like the economy, public health, and crime made it possible for Venezuelans to be safely returned to their home country. However, the Trump administration has said it’s too dangerous for Americans to go there. A “Do not travel” advisory from the State Department warns of wrongful detentions, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, and more.

The National Alliance, along with several TPS recipients from Venezuela, sued the Trump administration in San Francisco after it first announced it would end Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans under the 2023 designation in February. In March, federal judge Edward M. Chen of the Northern District of California issued a preliminary order upholding TPS for the group, whose protections were set to expire in April, and restored TPS for Venezuelans until October 2026. Chen wrote in his decision that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had made “sweeping negative generalizations” when ending Venezuela’s Temporary Protected Status, and described “acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype” as a “classic example of racism.”

The Trump administration submitted an emergency request asking the Supreme Court to intervene in the case. The nation’s highest court ruled in May that the administration could end TPS but did not stop ongoing litigation or weigh in on the merits of Chen’s case However, the Supreme Court decision left the vast majority of Venezuelans under the 2023 designation without any TPS protections. Last week, an appeals court affirmed Chen’s authority, upheld his March order and ruled that Homeland Security had improperly ended the protections.

Advocates and TPS holders told the Herald they never expected a positive decision from the Trump administration, and had expected Noem to end the protections altogether. Homeland Security said that it had weighed public safety, national security, migration patterns and other factors, and concluded the deportation protections for Venezuelans did not benefit the United States. A DHS spokesperson said TPS had a “clear magnet effect” for Venezuelans, though people who come after designation cut-off dates cannot benefit from TPS.

Now, the fate of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans depends on how Chen rules on the case.

“We’re waiting on that decision to come out any time now,” said Jose Palma, co-coordinator and spokesperson of the National TPS Alliance.

Over the last year, the Trump administration has also moved to revoke Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras — all countries whose difficult conditions on the ground have led to the settlement of sizable immigrant communities in South Florida.

“We’re talking about long-term contributors to our community who are being targeted. It’s deeply concerning,” said Sui Chung, executive director for Miami-based Americans for Immigrant Justice.

“An existential crisis”

To understand how the Trump administration’s posture toward Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans is playing out in South Florida, the Herald spoke with attorneys, advocates and immigrants, several of whom asked that their names be withheld for fear of persecution.

David — who asked to be identified by his first name because of the delicate situation with TPS in the United States and the possibility of repercussions in Venezuela — came to the United States in February 2021 to visit friends and family in the United States on a tourist visa. While he was here, Biden issued the first TPS designation for Venezuela. A long-time engineering professor, he said he decided to stay. In South Florida, he could give his 15-year-old daughter a better education and a brighter future.

David, who works in the tourism industry, said he understands why Trump wants to crack down on irregular immigration. But he told the Herald that there are hard-working professionals getting tangled in the wider immigration enforcement net his administration has cast for immigration enforcement. Already, the Miami resident said he’s been having difficulties renewing his license, which is vital for his job. Ahead of the expiration of his TPS next week, he fears being separated from his daughter, who has a pathway to permanent residency and is applying.

“Please give us another opportunity, evaluate who is doing things wrong and who is doing things right in this country. And those who are doing things right want to continue contributing to society and to the world,” he told the Herald. “Los buenos somos más.” The good people are the majority.

U.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington ruled Wednesday that the Republican administration's decision to withhold the funding was likely illegal. He issued a preliminary injunction ordering the release of $11.5 billion that is set to expire at the end of the month.

“To be clear, no one disputes that Defendants have significant discretion in how to spend the funds at issue, and the Court is not directing Defendants to make payments to any particular recipients,” wrote Ali, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden. “But Defendants do not have any discretion as to whether to spend the funds.”

The administration filed a notice of appeal on Thursday.

“President Trump has the executive authority to ensure that all foreign aid is accountable to taxpayers and aligns with the America First priorities people voted for,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement.

Elisha Dunn-Georgiou, president and CEO of Global Health Council, one of the groups in the case, said in a statement the decision was a victory for “the rule of law"" and reaffirmed that “only Congress controls the power of the purse.""

Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a letter on Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That is when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice means Congress cannot act on the request in the required 45-day window and the money goes unspent. It’s the first time in nearly 50 years that a president has used the tactic. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September.

Ali said Congress would have to approve the rescission proposal for the administration to withhold the money.

The law is “explicit that it is congressional action—not the President’s transmission of a special message—that triggers rescission of the earlier appropriations,” he wrote.

The money at issue includes nearly $4 billion for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, to spend on global health programs and more than $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs. Trump has portrayed the funding as wasteful spending that does not align with his foreign policy goals, and in January, he issued an executive order directing the State Department and USAID to freeze spending on foreign aid.

Nonprofit organizations that sued the government said the freeze shut down funding for urgent lifesaving programs abroad.

A divided panel of appeals court judges ruled last month that the administration could suspend the money. The judges later revised that opinion, reviving the lawsuit before Ali.

In his ruling, Ali said he understood that his decision would not be the last word in the case, adding that “definitive higher court guidance now will be instructive.”

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

“That means using a human rights approach to public policy, protecting the most vulnerable, and matching words with action.","The federal government under Prime Minister Mark Carney must change course and reverse the declining state of human rights protection in Canada, Amnesty International Canada warned on Thursday.

Reacting to the first 100 days of Canada’s 45th Parliament, the human rights watchdog called on the federal government to enact policy changes in three priority areas — Indigenous rights, refugee rights, and upholding international law — where the need to correct course is especially urgent

“Since the opening of Parliament on May 26, the Canadian government has championed legislative changes that undermine the rights of Indigenous Nations and threaten to put refugees at risk, while failing to stop the ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English-speaking section. “One hundred days later, the most vulnerable are at greater risk.

“Economic recovery is a clear priority for this government, but it cannot be pursued at the expense of human rights,” she said. “A just economy creates opportunity and protects those at the margins of society. This has not been the case in the past 100 days, but it is not too late for the government to backtrack and lead on human rights. Doing so will require urgent, decisive action.”

Pushing back against escalating threats to Indigenous rights

Canada’s response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war has sidelined Indigenous Nations’ territorial rights. Pro-development bills passed in British Columbia and Ontario this spring gave provincial leaders new powers to push through major infrastructure and mining projects without meaningful community consultation and environmental assessments. Indigenous leaders have rightly denounced the bills, which undermine Indigenous Nations’ right to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) over building projects that affect their territories. The right to FPIC is enshrined in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

The federal government exacerbated the crisis by passing the Building Canada Act. The legislation gives cabinet the power to designate projects such as ports, pipelines and dams as being in the “national interest,” allowing them to speed through or bypass environmental assessments and consultation processes. Indigenous leaders across the country have also condemned the bill and the government’s failure to adequately consult Indigenous Nations on its development.

“Ontario’s Bill 5, British Columbia’s Bill 15, and Ottawa’s Bill C-5 represent an orchestrated attack on Indigenous Nations’ rights,” said Nivyabandi. “They are interwoven, interdependent, mutually reinforcing, crafted from the same painful colonial pattern that has, for centuries, dispossessed Indigenous Peoples of their lands and denied their sovereignty.”

Amnesty International Canada calls on the federal government to repeal the Building Canada Act without delay; or substantially amend the legislation to ensure the respect of FPIC and other protections. Any replacement must: embed FPIC as a binding precondition; restore independent environmental assessments and cumulative effects analysis; mandate the publication of clear criteria and reasons for “national interest” designations; and guarantee judicial review and public participation, including Indigenous-led review mechanisms. In addition, Amnesty urges the government to, to the best of its ability, ensure that provinces do not undermine constitutional protections of Indigenous rights, UNDRIP obligations, or international human rights standards and instead actively support Indigenous jurisdiction and decision-making as the foundation of reconciliation.

“Upholding Indigenous rights is not a barrier to shared prosperity — it’s foundational to it,” said Nivyabandi. “If we are serious about confronting climate change and securing a brighter future for everyone, the path forward must be rooted in respect for Indigenous Peoples, environmental responsibility, and human rights. Canada cannot build a just and sustainable economy while sidelining the very Nations that have stewarded these lands for centuries.”

Upholding refugees’ rights

During the 2025 Canadian federal election, the Mark Carney campaign vowed to “[maintain] Canada’s global leadership in prioritizing the world’s most vulnerable, including human rights defenders and refugees.” In practice, the government has proposed sweeping legislation that would prevent some people from having their claims for refugee protection fairly assessed. If passed as is, Bill C-2 would effectively prevent a person who, for example, entered Canada three years ago as a child, from having a refugee claim heard by Canadian immigration two decades from now – even if the person’s life circumstances had changed radically and they found themselves in grave danger in their home country.

Moreover, Canada is already imperiling refugees’ rights by sending people back to the U.S. knowing they will face detention and the risk of deportation to countries where they will be persecuted. Amnesty International has repeatedly condemned the U.S. government’s vicious crackdown on refugees and their rights. Through a series of executive orders and other measures, the Trump administration has made it virtually impossible for people to seek asylum in the United States. Refugee claimants already in the U.S. find themselves hunted by ICE, arbitrarily arrested and thrown into inhumane detention facilities, or sent back to countries of origin where they face persecution, torture or even death.

On Thursday, Nivyabandi repeated Amnesty’s call for the government to stop the passage of Bill C-2 and to withdraw from the Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S. She also reiterated that Canada must stop using provincial jails and federal prisons for administrative immigration detention.

“Canada cannot continue sending people back to the U.S. to face the cruelty and racism of President Trump’s mass deportation campaign,” Nivyabandi said. “This government must end its complicity in the United States’ attacks on refugees, stop attacking refugee rights here in Canada, and strongly counter false anti-refugee narratives that have crept into the political discourse.”

Upholding international law and the Genocide Convention in Gaza

Since the new session of Parliament opened 100 days ago, Canada has issued gradually escalating condemnations of Israel’s campaign of mass destruction and starvation in Gaza. However, Canada’s words and, crucially, its actions fall short of fulfilling its human rights obligations under international law.

“Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and as a long-time ally of Israel, Canada has an imperative duty to stop it,” Nivyabandi said. “Across the country, Canadians are horrified by the devastation Israel is inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza and are desperately calling for the government to act, while Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism rise to alarming levels at home.”

In December 2024, Amnesty International released a landmark report determining that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza — marked by the indiscriminate killing of civilians, the denial of basic supplies such as clean water and electricity, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure including health care facilities and schools — met the legal definition of genocide. A growing body of international and Israeli human rights organizations and genocide scholars have since reached the same legal conclusion.

The situation in Gaza has grown more catastrophic since Amnesty International released its genocide report nine months ago. On August 22, five UN agencies announced that more than 500,000 people were trapped in a man-made famine marked by widespread starvation, destitution and preventable deaths. Evidence gathered by Amnesty International demonstrates how, since the launch of its militarized “aid” distribution system in May, Israel has continued to use starvation of civilians as a weapon of war against Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip. On multiple occasions, Israel Defense Forces soldiers have also opened fire on the crowds, killing dozens of people, and creating a booby trap for desperate and already starved Palestinians.

Using the term “genocide,” Nivyabandi noted, does not politicize the crisis; it is a statement of fact. Under international law, a determination of genocide has a strict legal definition and imposes upon states a duty to act. Notably, the Genocide Convention obligates states, including Canada, to prevent genocide — in other words, to act as soon as the risk of genocide has been identified. Failing to do so risks complicity under international law.

“Canada’s halting response to the genocide in Gaza will be scrutinized for decades to come,” Nivyabandi said. “This government must be unequivocal and do what the world failed to undertake in Rwanda 30 years ago: use all means at its disposal and stop a genocide underway.”

Reiterating Amnesty International Canada’s urgent calls to action on Gaza, Nivyabandi demanded that the government, without delay: 1) Sanction Israeli officials suspected of perpetrating the genocide in Gaza and cooperate with the International Criminal Court; 2) ban all arms transfers to Israel; 3) ban all other trade linked to Israel’s genocide, apartheid or illegal occupation against Palestinians; and 4) protect individuals and organizations sanctioned by the U.S. for their advocacy on Palestinian rights.

Asserting Canadian leadership in tumultuous times

The first 100 days of Canada’s new Parliament indicate a decline on human rights, marked by legislative choices and policy inaction that risk turning back the clock for the most vulnerable. However, it is still early enough to change course. This government’s ambition to strengthen Canada’s standing abroad — combined with Canadians’ collective calls to stand firm against Trump’s tariff threats and push toward authoritarianism — provides a sturdy foundation for positive chang“Canada must seize the moment to ensure the next 100 days look profoundly different from the last,” said Nivyabandi. “That means using a human rights approach to public policy, protecting the most vulnerable, and matching words with action.

(WSAV) — WSAV has confirmed with the spokesperson from Homeland Security that Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting a sting operation at the Hyundai plant.

Hundreds of undercover law enforcement vehicles and Humvees were reportedly seen on Kia Road Thursday morning.

Large buses were also seen entering the site. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm (ATF) confirmed Thursday night 450 people were apprehended during the sting operation.

Parts of the Hyundai Megasite were shut down, according to reports.

Workers began sharing video and pictures from inside of the operation after the raid began.

Homeland Investigations (HSI) have not released details on this operation and said the information is sealed under indictment.

WSAV was given the following statement from Mary Beth Kennedy, senior public relations specialist with the HL-GA Battery Company, a Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution company:

“HL-GA Battery Company is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities regarding activity at our construction site. To assist their work, we have paused construction. We do not have further details at this time.”

Thursday afternoon, Yvonne Brooks, president of the Georgia American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) issued this statement in response to the ICE raids at the Hyundai metaplant:

“Georgia’s labor movement is outraged by ICE’s escalating presence at workplaces across the state. This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living. Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers. And when multiple workers have died during the construction of this very plant, the only federal action that could possibly be justified is to strengthen enforcement of occupational safety and health protections and other labor rights—a far cry from ICE raids.

The Georgia AFL-CIO stands with every worker who has been targeted by these politically motivated raids. Our movement will do everything we can to support all working families. That’s what solidarity looks like, and it cannot be broken. Workers in our state will not be pitted against each other.”

The Georgia AFL-CIO is the state’s largest labor federation, representing hundreds of thousands of union members statewide.

Georgia State Patrol (GSP) is reported on the scene.

There are also reports of road closures in the area.

There is no strict definition for sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describes places that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks help from state and local authorities to identify immigrants wanted for deportation and hold them for federal officers.

“The Trump administration’s decision to partner with Louisiana to use the notorious Angola prison to detain immigrants is just the latest move in President Trump’s shameful attack on immigrants.

“Angola prison, a notorious facility built on a former plantation used to enslave people, is steeped in a legacy of racism and brutal conditions. It is appalling that this facility is now being used to detain immigrants, some of whom are seeking safety in the U.S., and others who have lived in the U.S. for years.

“This new partnership follows the dangerous model set by Florida’s Everglades Detention Center, also known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” Like “Alligator Alcatraz,” the federal use of Angola reflects a disturbing trend of states using public resources to advance President Trump’s inhumane immigration agenda. The very nicknames given to these facilities, “Alligator Alcatraz” and “Louisiana Lockup,” trivialize the suffering of people who are caught up in President Trump’s mass detention and deportation agenda.

“Louisiana is already the second largest state for immigration detention. Thousands of people are already detained in Louisiana in some of the cruelest facilities, with long records of abuse, lack of access to legal counsel, and such a heinous track record of human rights violations the state is referred to as a “black hole” of immigration detention.

“The “Louisiana Lockup” lays bare the racism behind the Trump Administration’s mass detention and deportation machine, being the latest iteration of U.S. policies that prolong and profit off Black, brown, and Indigenous communities. The history of Angola reminds us that the cruelty is the point.

“We must dismantle this racist detention and deportation machine Immigrants are our neighbors, colleagues, family members, and our friends.

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed that an illegal migrant from Pakistan, who served in the U.S. military, has an extensive history of criminal activity paired with ""lies about his military service.""

Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry originally entered the U.S. in 1998 on a B-2 visa after intentionally leaving out criminal history related to convictions in Australia for stealing goods, falsifying passports and committing financial misconduct, according to DHS. DHS told Fox News Digital that Chaudhry also claimed he was deployed to Iraq, though Department of Defense records show he was never actually deployed.

An official with the Department of Defense told Fox News Digital that illegal migrants cannot serve in the military and an individual must have some form of legal status in order to serve. Green card holders (permanent legal residents) are able to join a branch of the U.S. military.

Immigration officials at the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS) determined Chaudhry’s falsified forms and omitting of criminal history were grounds for removal in 2008, but the Pakistani native has been repeatedly appealing the decision for roughly 17 years.

DHS RAGES OVER WHAT IT CALLS A NYT 'SOB STORY' ABOUT CONVICTED JAMAICAN MURDERER DEPORTED BY TRUMP

""Sanctuary politician Bruce Harrell and the media are peddling a FALSE sob story on this serial fraudster,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital. ""President Trump and Secretary Noem’s message is clear: Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.""

""Why do sanctuary politicians and the media continue to peddle sob stories of criminal illegals and smear our brave ICE law enforcement officers?"" McLaughlin added. ""Make no mistake, these types of lies are contributing to our ICE law enforcement officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults.""

According to an Inspector General’s report obtained by Fox News Digital from 2021, Chaudhry collected $449,459.82 in taxpayer dollars from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veteran’s Benefits Administration (VBA) and currently owes the federal government $81,080 for a mortgage reduction grant from the VBA.

Sources at the Department of Homeland Security told Fox that Chaudhry entered the country on a B-2 tourist visa and then was granted a green card. After officials discovered he previously lied to immigration officials about his criminal past, the green card was revoked — making him an illegal migrant in the U.S.

Chaudhry remains detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after being arrested during a citizenship appearance in Tukwila, Washington, on Aug. 21, 2025. He has been placed into removal proceedings after an immigration judge ruled he was in violation of federal immigration law.

Protests in Seattle have since erupted as hundreds of demonstrators stood outside the ICE detention center demanding Chaudhry’s release last week.

Seattle radio host Jason Rantz told Fox News Digital that Democrats have tried to ""portray [Chaudhry] as some sort of victim.""

PILSEN — Organizers of upcoming Mexican Independence Day celebrations are bracing for federal immigration agents to target the festivities.

Gov. JB Pritzker has warned Chicagoans to prepare for an immigration crackdown planned around Mexican Independence Day — which is Sept. 16 — saying federal agents are expected to arrive this week. President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to send hundreds of immigration agents here as soon as Friday and has threatened to also send the National Guard.

Some organizers of Mexican Independence Day events said they will not cancel plans, and they will stand united to celebrate the culture, history and heritage of Mexican and Mexican American communities. Others are working with local officials to determine next steps, they said.

Among the celebrations being planned for this month is El Grito Chicago, which is set for Sept. 13-14 in Grant Park. The event will feature live entertainment and music, sports clinics, carnival rides, art workshops and a lineup of food, drinks and vendors.

“In response to recent news, we are working closely with elected officials, community leaders and key stakeholders to determine the best path forward for our annual El Grito celebration,” German Gonzalez, organizer of El Grito Chicago, said in a statement Wednesday.

Last year’s two-day El Grito attracted about 24,000 people and recorded no festival-related incidents, organizers previously said.

“While the targeting of Mexican Independence Day celebrations underscores the vital importance of our mission to uplift our community, it also requires us to carefully consider how we can best serve our community,” Gonzalez said.

In Pilsen, the 24th annual Mexican Independence Day Parade is set to start noon Saturday on West 18th Street. Organizers have been working with the city and police and will have volunteer marshals to serve as “the eyes and ears” throughout the parade to alert participants if the National Guard or immigration agents show up, said Vicky Lugo, whose United Merchants Pilsen Chamber of Commerce organizes the parade.

“People are ready to lift our voices, to celebrate our culture, our heritage and our history,” Lugo said. “We’re not causing any chaos. We’re not causing any problems. It’s a celebration of unity, of our heritage and our culture.”

Pritzker said this week that he’s been notified federal immigration agents will soon be deployed in Chicago, saying his administration believes the timing is tied to the city’s annual Mexican Independence Day festivities. That potentially puts Latino communities at particular risk of being targeted for Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

“It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful gatherings,” Pritzker said Tuesday.

In Little Village, the 54th annual 26th Street Mexican Independence Day Parade is set for noon-3 p.m. Sept. 14 under the theme “Pride and Power: Our Strength, Our Legacy.” In past years, the parade has drawn hundreds of thousands to Little Village, dubbed by some officials as the Mexican capital of the Midwest.

Organizers said that they are working with elected officials and community organizations to “determine the best next steps that will ensure our community’s safety while honoring our cherished traditions.”

“The Little Village Chamber of Commerce is fully committed to upholding our 54-year tradition of celebrating Mexican Independence Day and supporting our local business community,” Jennifer Aguilar, executive director of the Little Village Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement Wednesday. “We will provide further updates as we work through these considerations with all of the stakeholders involved.”

Earlier this year, organizers of the Little Village Mexican Independence Day Parade said they would not halt plans to celebrate Mexican and Mexican American culture despite fears of immigration raids.

Hosting the parade this year is “almost like an act of resistance” amid the federal administration’s crackdown on immigration and its anti-immigrant rhetoric, Aguilar previously said.

The event — which commemorates the Cry of Dolores, which marks Mexican Independence Day — is also a celebration of the culture and contributions of the Mexican community in Chicago, organizers said on social media.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services played a key role in the investigation.

According to court documents, the defendants operated a prolific alien smuggling operation that facilitated the unlawful entry of Cuban nationals into the United States by preparing visa applications, laundering millions of dollars in payment, and exploiting the immigration process.

“Through diligent investigation, USCIS and our partners exposed a multi-national, multi-year, multi-million-dollar criminal conspiracy operated by aliens that attempted to undermine our immigration system and flood our country with illegal aliens — none of whom had any intention of following our laws,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow. “This criminal organization operated a front for fake asylum claims, churning out frivolous applications around the country. To criminals who seek to exploit our immigration system: we will find you, shut down your schemes, and you will face justice.”

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, 27, of Hialeah, FL (unlawfully residing in the United States);

Yuniel Lima-Santos, 30, of Tampa, FL;

Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, 26, unlawfully residing in Lebanon, TN;

Yuniel Lima-Santos and Frandy Aragon-Diaz are also charged with alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Layra Libertad Treto Santos, and Gisleivy Peralta Consuerga are charged with conspiracy to commit asylum fraud.

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Erik Ventura-Castro, Miguel Alejandro Martinez Vasconcelos, Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, and Layra Libertad Treto Santos are charged with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments.

From January 2021 through June 2025, the defendants promoted bogus visa services online, claiming Cuban nationals could secure U.S. entry through false claims of European citizenship. They filed hundreds of fraudulent Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) applications with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using fake addresses and fabricated documents.

The alien smuggling operation promoted its services on social media accounts and encrypted messaging platforms, including a WhatsApp group titled, “TRÁMITE DE ESTA Y VISA DE TURISMO A USA PARA CIUDADANOS ESPAÑOLES” (Processing of ESTA and tourist Visas to the USA for Spanish citizens). One promotional video advertised the scheme by showing stacks of passports, airline tickets, and visa approvals.

What began as a small operation grew into a commercial enterprise. The defendants charged clients between $1,500 and $40,000, sometimes even chartering private planes to move groups of aliens. Records show they spent over $2.5 million on flights alone and funneled more than $7 million through payment apps such as Zelle. Based on a financial analysis conducted of 27 known accounts associated with the defendants and their co-conspirators, the alien smuggling organization took in over $18 million during the course of the conspiracy.

The operation also smuggled unaccompanied minors. In one case, a teenage girl was told to pose as the lifelong friend of an unrelated adult man when crossing the border.

The defendants operated a sham immigration business, ASESORIA Y SERVICIOS MIGRATORIOS LLC, which promised asylum filings, work permits, and residency applications. In reality, the company churned out boilerplate asylum claims without clients’ knowledge or consent and even blocked them from accessing their own USCIS online accounts.

ASESORIA marketed itself on Instagram with flashy ads for immigration services while simultaneously posting videos of aliens being smuggled into the country.

The investigation and superseding indictment were coordinated under Joint Task Force Alpha. JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security, has been elevated and expanded by the attorney general with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along southern and northern borders. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, and the Office of International Affairs, among others.

JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 410 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 355 U.S. convictions; more than 305 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

Homeland Security Investigations Tampa, U.S. Border Patrol Miami Sector, and USCIS’ Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate led U.S. investigative efforts, with substantial assistance from HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit in Washington, D.C., and CBP’s National Targeting Center International Interdiction Task Force. Authorities in the Cayman Islands provided valuable assistance.

Trial Attorney Jenna Reed of the Criminal Division’s HRSP and Assistant U.S. Attorney Courtney Derry for the Middle District of Florida are prosecuting the case.

This case is part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations, and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Project Safe Neighborhoods.

An indictment is merely an allegation. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

It has rejected state accusations that they are enforcing a sanctuary policy, which is illegal under state law.","South Miami Mayor Javier Fernández and immigration attorneys are urging cities across the state to review its policy of having its law enforcement agencies cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

Speaking at a virtual news conference Thursday, Fernández and the attorneys say state officials acknowledged in court last month that municipalities are not obligated under law to sign the so-called 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The city of South Miami had filed a lawsuit against the state to clarify whether the agreements are mandatory for municipalities under Florida law. It is mandatory for counties that run jail systems.

During court testimony last month, attorneys representing the state told the judge municipalities are not required by law to enter into the 287(g) agreement.

The agreement deputizes and trains local law enforcement as ICE agents, and gives them authority to carry out federal immigration laws.

No decision has been made in the ongoing court case, but Fernández told reporters Thursday that he and his attorney “felt validated” by the state’s acknowledgement that it's not mandatory for cities to sign.

“These admissions should provide a clear relief to cities that have not signed an agreement; cities that have been under extreme, unwarranted, and unlawful pressure,” said Alana Greer, Director at the Community Justice Project, during the press conference.

Said Tallahassee City Commissioner Jacqueline ""Jack"" Porter: “Local elected officials are being threatened for even questioning these agreements; we know now that the state itself has admitted that it is not a legal requirement.”

Porter said her city may explore options to withdraw from the agreement with ICE.

Numerous municipalities across the state have joined the partnership under pressure from Gov. Ron DeSantis as the state works closely to help the Trump administration's aggressive deportation efforts.

South Miami is the only Florida city actively to challenge the state position in court that all cities must enter into immigration enforcement agreements with ICE.

The city is not subject to state law requiring law enforcement agencies partner with ICE because they do not operate a jail. All 67 Florida counties have signed on to partner with ICE because they operate jails.

DeSantis and other top state officials have pushed cities, including Fort Myers and Key West to enter into the agreements by threatening to remove city commissioners from office and cut state funding.

Law enforcement agencies, like Tallahassee Police Department, that have active 287(g) agreements, must get approval from the State Board of Immigration Enforcement to terminate their agreements.

As the prisoners’ lawsuit lays out, all ten of the litigants were sentenced under the old law and knew they would be executed by lethal injection from the moment they were sentenced.
The power to designate the execution method used in Arkansas is, they say, a legislative power.
It asks the court to recognize that a state’s choice of an execution method is by no means merely a technical one.
And the Arkansas litigation is not the usual method of execution challenge since it does not question the constitutionality of either of the methods mentioned in Act 302.","Challenges to particular methods of execution have become a standard part of the litigation strategy in many death penalty cases, even though, in recent years, the Supreme Court has made them much more difficult to win. But for any of those challenges to occur, death row inmates have to know which method a state intends to use to put them to death.

That is why states like Arkansas and Florida have revised the laws governing execution to grant unchecked discretion to the people in charge of carrying out executions to choose the method. They make it hard for death row inmates to know, in a timely manner, the method that will be employed in their cases.

This mystery not only complicates litigation strategies, but it adds a layer of cruelty to the heavy psychological toll already associated with the death penalty process. And it runs afoul of Supreme Court rulings about the things legislative bodies can and cannot delegate to executive agencies, like the departments of corrections that are responsible for putting the condemned to death.

Whether courts will recognize that problem in the context of capital punishment remains to be seen. But a suit filed last month in Arkansas will test their willingness to do so.

This first-of-its-kind suit was filed on August 5 in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County on behalf of ten of the twenty-three inmates currently on Arkansas’s death row. It alleges that legislation enacted earlier this year, Act 302, which does not specify whether they will be executed by lethal injection or nitrogen hypoxia, is unconstitutional because it violates the state constitution’s separation of powers.

Act 302 changed the existing law, which read “A person convicted of a capital offense shall be punished by death by lethal injection or by life imprisonment without parole….” The new law deletes the reference to lethal injection as a necessary part of the punishment of death.

It now says, “A person convicted of a capital offense shall be punished by death or by life imprisonment without parole….”

Act 302 allows the Division of Corrections to “carry out the sentence of death either by intravenous lethal injection of…[a] drug or drugs…in an amount sufficient to cause death or by nitrogen gas.” That’s it.

The law offers no guidance as to the factors that the DOC must consider or the standards that should govern its choice. There is nothing to prevent it from choosing one or another method because correctional officials dislike a prisoner or want to pay back those who have been troublesome while on death row.

And there is nothing in the new law to prevent them from choosing an execution method because of the race of the inmate or of their victim, factors that we already know play a role in death sentencing and decisions to seek death warrants. If Arkansas’s new law survives judicial scrutiny, race may play a role in determining whether an inmate is put to death by lethal injection or nitrogen hypoxia.

What a nightmarish possibility.

As the prisoners’ lawsuit lays out, all ten of the litigants were sentenced under the old law and knew they would be executed by lethal injection from the moment they were sentenced. No more.

The power to designate the execution method used in Arkansas is, they say, a legislative power. They argue that the legislature cannot “delegate to the Department of Corrections and ADC Director absolute, unfettered discretion to choose between lethal injection and nitrogen hypoxia as the means for executing [them].”

And while Act 302 gives detailed instructions about lethal injection procedures, it “provides no standards to the Department of Corrections and ADC Director to constrain and guide the use of nitrogen hypoxia…”

Standardless delegations of authority by legislative bodies to executive agencies, of the kind contained in Act 302, have drawn the ire of the current majority on the United States Supreme Court. As the Court explained last June, “To distinguish between the permissible and the impermissible…[delegation of authority], this Court asks whether Congress has set out an ‘intelligible principle’ to guide what it has given the agency to do.”

“Under that test,” the Court said, “Congress must make clear both ‘the general policy’ the agency must pursue and ‘the boundaries of [its] delegated authority.’”

Justice Neil Gorsuch put it simply, “the Constitution…command[s] that Congress ‘may not transfer to another branch ‘powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.’”

The Arkansas suit is premised on exactly that understanding.

It asks the court to recognize that a state’s choice of an execution method is by no means merely a technical one. It is instead a profound political and moral one, appropriately left to the people and their elected representatives and subject to the constitutional requirement that the method not be cruel or unusual.

The lawsuit’s critique of the delegation of that choice contained in Act 302 seems to align perfectly with Gorsuch’s understanding, though there is some irony in seeing the doctrine developed by a death penalty enthusiast like him, now applied in an effort to invalidate a statute enacted to make executions easier.

The Arkansas lawsuit also says that Act 302 “impairs the judicial function by imposing and modifying prior sentences” and that a new punishment like nitrogen hypoxia for capital murder cannot be inflicted retroactively “without violating the Arkansas Constitution’s due process protections and prohibitions on bills of attainder.”

In the end, Arkansas is a somewhat unexpected place for such a consequential death penalty lawsuit to occur. It has not carried out an execution since 2017, and not seen a new death sentence since 2018.

And the Arkansas litigation is not the usual method of execution challenge since it does not question the constitutionality of either of the methods mentioned in Act 302. It just insists that people sentenced to death can’t be left in the dark, until the last minute, about which method will be chosen to kill them.

The fate of the litigation filed this month in the self-proclaimed “Natural State” may go a long way in determining whether other more active death penalty states can keep not only the condemned, but the people as well from knowing in advance how executions will be carried out in their name.",https://i0.wp.com/verdict.justia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/shutterstock_156003992.jpeg?quality=90&resize=426%2C350&strip=all&fit=1000%25&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-04 19:57:33.066027

In a petition filed late on Wednesday, the administration asked the justices to quickly intervene to rule that the president has the power to impose such import taxes on foreign nations.

A divided US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit last week ruled 7-4 that the tariffs Trump brought in through an emergency economic powers act did not fall within the president's mandate and that setting levies was ""a core Congressional power"".

The case could upend Trump's economic and foreign policy agenda and force the US to refund billions in tariffs.

Trump had justified the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives the president the power to act against ""unusual and extraordinary"" threats.

In April, Trump declared an economic emergency, arguing that a trade imbalance had undermined domestic manufacturing and was harmful to national security.

While the appellate court ruled against the president, it postponed its decision from taking effect, allowing the Trump administration time to file an appeal.

""The stakes in this case could not be higher,"" Solicitor General John Sauer said in Wednesday night's filing.

He wrote that the lower court's ""erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign policy crisis"".

Lawyers representing small businesses challenging the tariffs said they were confident they would win the case.

""These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardising their survival,"" said Jeffrey Schwab of Liberty Justice Center. ""We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients.""

If the Supreme Court justices deny the review, the ruling could take effect on 14 October.

What tariffs has Trump announced and why?

How much cash is the US raising from tariffs?

In May, the New York-based Court of International Trade declared the tariffs were unlawful. That decision was also put on hold during the appeal process.

The rulings came in response to lawsuits filed by small businesses and a coalition of US states opposing the tariffs.

In April, Trump signed executive orders imposing a baseline 10% tariff as well as ""reciprocal"" tariffs intended to correct trade imbalances on more than 90 countries.

In addition to those tariffs, the appellate court ruling also strikes down levies on Canada, Mexico and China, which Trump argues are necessary to stop the importation of drugs.

The decision does not apply to some other US duties, like those imposed on steel and aluminium, which were brought in under a different presidential authority.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ff7e/live/a309f100-891d-11f0-b663-f3bb91f7a7fe.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 21:57:39.964139

Green",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/04/us/trump-news,"So far, the Trump administration has filed about 20 emergency applications, many of which seek to remove blocks imposed by district-court judges.
Between 120 and 125 detainees remain, a lawyer for the federal government said on Thursday at a hearing in federal court in Fort Myers.
Mr. Trump has already sent National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., saying the military is needed there to fight crime.
Mr. Trump is already embroiled in a legal battle with Lisa Cook, a governor he is trying to oust over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.
Mr. Miran has been a vocal cheerleader of the president’s economic policies and is expected to press for what Mr. Trump wants at the Fed.","“It’s a difficult job that each of us has,” he said, as he opened remarks during a luncheon panel at the annual Sixth Circuit Judicial Conference in Memphis, “particularly the trial judges who operate alone.” (In the federal system, district courts are the trial courts.)

He called trial-court judges “the front lines of American justice” and thanked them for helping to “preserve and protect the Constitution and the rule of law of the United States.”

Justice Kavanaugh’s remarks came at a time of increased strain on the Supreme Court’s relationship with district court judges, who have often moved swiftly to block President Trump’s policies with sweeping preliminary orders, issued before a case has been heard in full. The Supreme Court in turn in June imposed new limits on the lower courts’ power to issue orders that affect the whole country, known as universal injunctions.

The justices have also intervened in more than a dozen individual cases in ways that at least temporarily lift blocks imposed by lower court judges that would have stopped Mr. Trump’s policies from being implemented while their legality is litigated.

Justice Kavanaugh, whose mother is a retired state-court judge, told the judges gathered in Memphis that she had often impressed on him how difficult the job of a trial-court judge could be.

“It’s kind of like having the referee on the field, and then we’re sitting up in the replay booth, dissecting every frame of the replay,” he said. “Respect for the role of the trial judge as a single person who has to make quick decisions is something that I saw firsthand,” he added.

In the case on universal injunctions, Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the new limitations on district-court judges’ powers “will help bring substantially more order and discipline” to lawsuits over executive orders.

In a case late last month, he joined Justice Neil M. Gorsuch in rebuking judges who “defy” the Supreme Court by failing to apply its emergency orders, which, Justice Gorsuch wrote, “carry precedential weight.” That criticism, issued in a case dealing with cuts to National Institutes of Health grant funding, prompted a pointed apology from the bench by Judge William G. Young of Massachusetts, the Reagan-appointed judge at whom it was directed.

The increasing number of emergency orders issued by the Supreme Court have come in response to a flurry of executive orders issued by the Trump administration, which have then been challenged in court. The administration has sought the intervention of the Supreme Court in a series of cases, asking the justices to remove temporary blocks imposed by lower-court judges.

Critics call this growing segment of the Supreme Court’s caseload the “emergency docket” or “shadow docket,” because it involves less briefing, usually no oral arguments and generally less deliberation by the justices. On Thursday, Justice Kavanaugh said that “interim docket” was a more accurate term, as not all of the matters under review were actual emergencies, nor were the court’s orders necessarily its final word on the issues.

The interim docket’s rise, Justice Kavanaugh argued, has been driven by factors outside the Supreme Court’s control. In what he called “structural separation of powers,” presidents seek to advance their agenda despite inaction by Congress. That dynamic, he said, is “totally bipartisan,” predating Mr. Trump’s presidency.

So far, the Trump administration has filed about 20 emergency applications, many of which seek to remove blocks imposed by district-court judges. That total over the last seven and a half months exceeds the number of applications filed by President Joseph R. Biden’s administration during his four-year term.

Justice Kavanaugh’s remarks came in response to questions from Judge Joan L. Larsen and Judge Andre B. Mathis, who both sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

While he was careful to present the executive branch’s current relationship with the courts as more of a continuation than a rupture, Justice Kavanaugh appeared to acknowledge that the degree of political rancor in the Trump era was unusual. He suggested that judges, especially when writing dissents, should do what they could to lower the temperature.

“We’re modeling behavior for everyone,” he said, adding that that made civility and neutrality especially important “when the tone around us, in the public sphere, in the political world, on all sides, is loud.”

The latest ruling was a victory for Florida, which pushed the boundaries of traditional immigration enforcement when it opened the facility in July. It became the first state to run an immigrant detention center — normally a federal role. Other states have since announced plans to house federal immigration detainees in state-owned facilities.

The ruling was also significant for the Department of Homeland Security, which had argued in court that it was not running the Everglades detention center.

In granting the stay, the appeals panel found that the lower court had misinterpreted a federal law requiring a review of potential environmental harms before building a major project in the ecologically fragile Everglades. It found that because the detention center had so far been entirely funded by Florida, and because the state operated the center, the National Environmental Policy Act would not apply.

Florida has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the detention center, an outlay that Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has repeatedly said will be reimbursed by the federal government. Even if that should happen, the appeals panel ruled, it would be “insufficient” grounds to consider the detention center a major federal project subject to environmental review.

“Alligator Alcatraz is, in fact, like we’ve always said, open for business,” Mr. DeSantis said in a video posted to X shortly after the appellate ruling. “The mission continues, and we’re going to continue leading the way when it comes to immigration enforcement.”

Elise Bennett, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said that environmental groups hoped to “ultimately prevail in defending the heart of Florida from this brutal and destructive facility.”

“This is a heartbreaking blow to America’s Everglades and every living creature there, but the fight isn’t even close to over,” Ms. Bennett, the center’s Florida and Caribbean director, said in a statement.

Mr. DeSantis, whose administration has taken an aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, recently announced plans to open a second detention center at an empty state prison west of Jacksonville. This week, he also floated the idea of opening a third such center, in the Florida Panhandle.

Judge Kathleen M. Williams of the Federal District Court in Miami ruled on Aug. 21 in favor of environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, which had sought to halt construction on the center and its operations because of the lack of environmental review. Since then, the number of immigrant detainees at the facility has dwindled.

Between 120 and 125 detainees remain, a lawyer for the federal government said on Thursday at a hearing in federal court in Fort Myers. The hearing was on a different case regarding the Everglades detention center.

During that hearing, Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state, told Judge Sheri Polster Chappell that Florida was not bringing any additional detainees to the Everglades detention center, but intended to keep it running, and to bring in more detainees, if Judge Williams’s ruling were reversed.

The appeals panel found that the state and federal governments would suffer “irreparable harm” if the Everglades detention center were shut down while the case played out in court.

“Florida will undoubtedly be harmed if it cannot ‘apply its own laws’ to respond to an immigration crisis and serve the public interest,” Judge Barbara Lagoa wrote in the 2-to-1 ruling. She was joined by Judge Elizabeth L. Branch. Both were appointed by President Trump.

Among the reasons the appeals panel cited for allowing the detention center to remain open was that the state said it would cost $15 million to $20 million to dismantle much of the facility — and then the same amount to rebuild if it were to succeed in its appeal.

In his dissent, Judge Adalberto Jordan, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, wrote that the appeals panel had overstepped its limited role in ruling for the state and federal governments and dismissing the lower court’s findings that the sensitive Everglades ecosystem could be harmed.

“The district court properly balanced the equities and the public interest,” Judge Jordan wrote. “The court considered the significant ongoing and likely future environmental harms to the plaintiffs from the detention facility, as well as the importance of immigration enforcement to the state and federal defendants.”

But with Republicans pushing for deep cuts and Democrats resisting, a broad spending agreement will be exceedingly difficult. And even a short-term measure is likely to be challenging, with the two parties divided over key details. Such a package would also pose a political challenge for Democrats, who weathered a backlash from their voters in March when they allowed the current stopgap spending bill to move forward.

“We don’t want a shutdown,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader. “We want bipartisan negotiations and a bipartisan bill. If Republicans want to keep the government open, they’ve got to work with us.”

Back in March, Democrats agonized for days over whether to supply the votes needed to allow the G.O.P.-written temporary spending measure to move ahead. Mr. Schumer and nine other members of his caucus ultimately voted to let it advance, arguing that a shutdown would only empower Mr. Trump to tighten his grip on federal agencies and to unilaterally decide what money to spend.

Democrats have said they would find it extremely difficult to back future funding measures without some kind of assurance that Republicans would not continue to allow the Trump administration to cancel spending after Congress approves it. In order to clear a Senate filibuster, government spending deals have historically been bipartisan products.

Instead, the Trump administration last month advanced a new effort to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion that lawmakers approved for foreign aid programs, infuriating Democrats.

“It almost seems like they want a fight,” Senator John Hickenlooper, Democrat of Colorado, said of the gambit, known as a pocket rescission.

At the same time, Republicans appear poised to change the rules of the Senate to fast-track the confirmation of Mr. Trump’s nominees, an attempt to overcome Democratic insistence on holding formal roll call votes on every executive branch nominee.

The Republican efforts have riled Democrats, who for months have seethed at the president’s escalating campaign to undercut congressional spending authority.

“I’m not going to go along with keeping the government open unless they change course,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware told NPR.

“Trump has made it clear that the budget is not worth the paper it’s written on,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut. “There can’t be any good-faith negotiation when the implementer of the budget is refusing to implement it.”

For now, Democratic leaders have said they are willing to vote for a spending package, as long as they get a say in the contents.

Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said at a news conference on Wednesday that she would support negotiating bipartisan versions of three of the least divisive spending bills the Senate and the House have already separately approved, then passing them with a stopgap bill.

Any short-term spending agreement “needs to reflect Democratic values and principles, and needs to be a real bipartisan compromise,” Ms. Murray said.

Efforts to find a compromise on spending levels could be difficult. House Republicans have largely rejected the deepest spending cuts proposed by the White House, but they are advancing funding bills setting drastically lower spending levels than their counterparts in the Senate. Their bills would slash spending across the board, including an 11 percent cut to the bill that funds the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.

“Following the president’s clear direction, we have taken a critical look at every program, and in several cases had to make hard decisions on some ‘nice-to-have’ programs,” said Representative Robert Aderholt of Alabama, who leads the spending subcommittee in charge of labor and health. “Americans must prioritize resources at the kitchen table, and we should be doing the same here in Congress.”

The question of how long a stopgap bill would last could also divide Republicans. More conservative House Republicans have long chafed at yearlong temporary bills because the bills traditionally keep spending flat and do not make cuts.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Republican majority leader, said lawmakers would “inevitably” need a stopgap measure “for some time.”

He added: “What that looks like and how long that might extend, I think, probably, is a matter of discussion.”

Some Democrats have privately said that they are negotiating against a backdrop that is more politically favorable to them than the one they encountered in March, an argument that Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota made publicly this week.

“One thing that’s different from back then: Donald Trump at the beginning of this year was 9 points up,” Ms. Klobuchar said. “He’s 9 points under.”

That has created a political environment, she said, that has allowed Mr. Schumer and Democrats to recruit strong candidates to run for the Senate in next year’s crucial midterm elections, she said.

“It is a very different situation,” she continued, “and they know it.”

It is not clear which U.S. attorney’s offices are involved in the inquiry, but Ms. Cook previously reported in disclosures that she had owned homes in Georgia, Massachusetts and Michigan, according to court records. Federal prosecutors have begun issuing subpoenas, one of the people briefed in the investigation said.

The opening of the investigation, earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes as little surprise. Mr. Martin, who leads the department’s vaguely defined weaponization task force after Senate Republicans scuttled his nomination to be the permanent U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, signaled his intention to do so as the White House stepped up its attacks on Ms. Cook.

The saga began when Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said his office had investigated Ms. Cook and found that she appeared to have falsified bank documents to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage. Mr. Pulte later referred the matter to the Justice Department for a criminal inquiry, before Mr. Trump announced he would fire Ms. Cook from the Fed.

Ms. Cook initially responded in a statement that she would not be “bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.” But she said she would take “questions about my financial history seriously” and gather the facts. She then sued the administration over its attempted firing, and in a hearing last week, her lawyers depicted her potential ouster as an illegal bid to undermine the traditional independence of the Federal Reserve.

In a statement Thursday, Abbe D. Lowell, the lawyer representing Ms. Cook, said the reports suggested the Trump administration was “scrambling to invent new justifications for its overreach,” describing the Justice Department as “perhaps the most politicized” in American history.

“The questions over how Governor Cook described her properties from time to time, which we have started to address in the pending case and will continue to do so, are not fraud, but it takes nothing for this D.O.J. to undertake a new politicized investigation, and they appear to have just done it again,” Mr. Lowell continued.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.

Mr. Martin, who has been given few staff but broad latitude to team up with U.S. attorney’s offices around the country, flouted the department’s procedural norms last month by suggesting to the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, that Ms. Cook step aside.

Ms. Cook’s case “requires further examination” Mr. Martin wrote in a letter to Mr. Powell, suggesting that the department could be pursuing an investigation.

“At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms. Cook from your board,” Mr. Martin wrote. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.”

The administration, led by Mr. Pulte, has increasingly scrutinized the mortgage applications of Mr. Trump’s political adversaries to seek retribution against his enemies. The Justice Department, under the leadership of Attorney General Pam Bondi, has acted on referrals from other government agencies by proceeding with mortgage fraud investigations of the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, and Senator Adam B. Schiff, two prominent Democrats who are known as critics of Mr. Trump.

On Thursday, Revolution Wind LLC, a joint venture between Orsted and Skyborn Renewables, asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to prevent the administration from enforcing the stop-work order. The complaint alleges that the order was arbitrary and capricious in part because it appeared to be carried out under political pressure from the White House.

The attorneys general of Connecticut and Rhode Island also said that they would file a separate lawsuit Thursday in the United States District Court for Rhode Island to overturn the stop-work order.

The 65-turbine Revolution Wind project had obtained financing as well as all necessary permits from the Biden administration. Construction began in 2023, and the developers had said it was on track to produce enough electricity for more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut by next spring.

In their complaint, the developers said that they had already spent $5 billion on the project and would incur another $1 billion in financial penalties from failing to complete it, while also losing billions of dollars in future revenue if the project was canceled.

A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, the parent agency of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said it did not comment on pending litigation.

President Trump has been a vocal critic of wind firms for years, calling them ugly and inefficient. His administration has sharply escalated its attacks on the wind industry in recent months, moving to block not just future wind projects but also projects that have already been permitted and under construction.

The White House has also enlisted a half-dozen federal agencies to find new ways to thwart offshore wind as part of a governmentwide effort to suppress the industry. That includes asking the Health and Human Services Department to probe the health effects of wind turbines and the Department of Defense to find any national security concerns.

“President Trump’s day one executive order instructed agencies to review leases and permitting practices for wind projects with consideration for our country’s growing demands for reliable energy, effects on energy costs for American families, the importance of marine life and fishing industry, and the impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman.

In April, the Interior Department ordered that work be stopped at Empire Wind, a $5 billion wind farm off the coast of New York that had received all necessary approvals from the Biden administration and was already being built. After several weeks of negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, the administration allowed Empire Wind to proceed.

White House officials suggested they had done so only after Ms. Hochul agreed to approve new gas pipelines in the state. She denied that any such deal had been made.

Equinor, the Norwegian energy giant that was building Empire Wind, never ended up suing the administration over the monthlong pause. The company had warned that it was losing nearly $50 million per week while the project was halted and that it might have to abandon it altogether if the stop-work order continued for much longer.

Orsted is taking legal action more rapidly. The Danish government owns a 50.1 percent share in the company, which saw its stock price plunge to record lows last month after the stop-work order.

Denmark and the United States have repeatedly been at odds under the Trump administration, with Denmark rejecting Mr. Trump’s insistence that the United States take over Greenland. Last month, Denmark summoned the head of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen after allegations that three Americans with ties to President Trump were running “covert influence operations” in Greenland.

In a statement, the developers behind Revolution Wind said that “the project is facing substantial harm from continuation of the stop-work order, and as a result, litigation is a necessary step.”

Gov. Ned Lamont, Democrat of Connecticut, said he was willing to work with the administration but it had not justified its decision to halt construction and that the state was acting “to preserve this vital project and protect the energy future of Connecticut and the entire New England region.”

Before it obtained federal permits, Revolution Wind went through a multiyear review process that included the Defense Department, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service and several other agencies.

Some legal experts have said that there is little basis for blocking projects that have already received permits.

Elizabeth Klein, who led the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management during the Biden administration, said the agency did have the ability to halt projects for national security reasons. But even in those cases, the agency is required to follow a process that includes a written notification describing the basis of its concerns. And the regulator would typically discuss issues with the developer rather than abruptly stop work without warning.

“Even under the most generous interpretation of what is happening here, if there were some issue that arose that suggested a threat, there would be a dialogue between the regulator and the proponent,” Ms. Klein said. “There’s no actual justification to stop the project.”

The administration is also pursuing other strategies for blocking offshore wind. On his first day in office, Mr. Trump ordered a sweeping halt to all leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms. And it has sought to revoke permits for projects that have already been approved but are facing litigation by opponents.

On Wednesday the Trump administration said in another court filing that it planned to revoke federal approvals for the New England Wind project, about 20 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. Construction has not yet begun, but if completed it would be one of the largest offshore wind projects in the country.

A group in Nantucket that is opposed to offshore wind, ACK for Whales, had filed a lawsuit to challenge New England Wind’s permits, saying that the project posed a danger to the endangered North Atlantic right whale. Scientists have said there is no evidence to link wind farms to whale deaths. In a filing, the Justice Department said that the lawsuit no longer needed to proceed since the administration was rescinding the project’s permit.

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have sued the administration over Mr. Trump’s halting of federal approvals for wind projects.

The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts federal court, argued that the move violated the Administrative Procedure Act and harmed the efforts by states to secure energy and fight climate change while jeopardizing billions of dollars in investments. The Alliance for Clean Energy New York, a coalition of environmental and clean energy industry groups, later joined the suit as a plaintiff.

Administration lawyers countered that the injuries to New York were hypothetical rather than imminent and that the pause in federal permitting was necessary “based on concerns over potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews,” according to a memo signed by Michael K. Robertson, a trial attorney in the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Justice Department.

In July, Judge William G. Young narrowed the case but allowed it to proceed. A hearing was set to be held on Thursday afternoon.

Lisa Friedman contributed reporting.

The expenses, Mr. Newsom said, included $71 million for food and shelter, $37 million in payroll, more than $4 million in logistics supplies, $3.5 million in travel and $1.5 million for demobilization.

The Pentagon initially estimated that the activation would cost $134 million and last about 60 days. As of Thursday, the deployment has lasted 89 days, with about 300 troops remaining on orders that have been extended into November. Because the troops were commandeered by the White House, the deployment costs are a federal obligation.

In a statement, Mr. Newsom condemned the Los Angeles deployment as “political theater” that has sent “millions of taxpayer dollars down the drain” and corroded the readiness of the National Guard.

Mr. Newsom’s public-records request to military officials last month called on them to tell American taxpayers “how much this folly has cost them.” His office still has not formally received a response from the Defense Department to that request. The governor also requested cost calculations from the California National Guard, which supplied his office with the data.

The nearly $120 million figure is consistent with standard pay and support costs for the Marines and the National Guard. The total cost matched data supplied to the federal government, according to a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the deployment costs with the press.

At the height of the deployment, thousands of National Guard soldiers were being housed in a sprawling and hastily erected tent city south of Los Angeles at a military facility near Long Beach. Only a few hundred troops were assigned any duties away from the base. Many of those who were given outside assignments — largely to assist federal agents arresting undocumented immigrants in workplaces — were used illegally, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.

Federal law generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, and military officials who testified in court described an ongoing struggle to ensure that troops were not used by federal agents in ways that violated their authority or endangered the public. In interviews with The New York Times, several members of the National Guard, including infantrymen and two officials in leadership roles, spoke of low morale during the deployment. They described troops who were demoralized, bored and questioning the mission. On the upside, they said, the federal activation meant better benefits and higher pay.

Most of the troops have since been released, with the remainder scattered across several federal facilities in Southern California. The Trump administration extended their activation last month, saying the troops are needed to protect federal buildings and personnel.

This week, Mr. Newsom asked the federal court to order their removal, saying that the extension amounted to an “intimidation” tactic in advance of a November special election on redistricting that could impact control of Congress in 2026.

Mr. Newsom’s announcement of the deployment costs came as other Democratic-led cities across the United States have braced for the presence of federal troops.

Mr. Trump has already sent National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., saying the military is needed there to fight crime. And he has suggested that the National Guard could be sent into Chicago, New Orleans and other cities.

The intervention, which President Trump has said is a response to a “public safety emergency,” has prompted criticism and protests from many people in the city who say the president wants to use his power over the federal enclave to roll back the city’s limited self-governance and punish it for policies he objects to.

“No American city should have the US military — particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement — policing its streets,” Brian Schwalb, D.C.’s elected attorney general, who brought the suit, said in a statement. “We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.”

In the suit, Mr. Schwalb asks the court to declare that the orders sending the National Guard troops to Washington were illegal.

The lawsuit comes two days after a federal judge in California ruled that the president’s decision to send National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles in June was illegal.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that the lawsuit was “nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents and visitors — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.”

Even as the Guard deployments have faced local pushback and legal challenges, Mr. Trump has been promising to send troops to other cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Like Washington and Los Angeles, Baltimore and Chicago are led by mayors who are Black and are Democrats.

Unlike in states, where governors have considerable authority over the deployment of the state guard, the D.C. National Guard is under the president’s direct command.

But the suit argues that the deployment of the local guard for public safety reasons, and without the mayor’s consent, violated Washington’s autonomy under the 52-year-old Home Rule Act.

The key argument in the suit is similar to the one the judge in California based his ruling on: that the deployment of National Guard troops in the city runs “roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy — that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.”

Mr. Trump had made clear that such a role was his intention, saying on Aug. 11 that he was calling out the Guard to “reestablish law, order and public safety” in the city. Since then, even as federal law enforcement officers have been involved in hundreds of arrests and immigration agents have been detaining hundreds of Washington residents deemed to be in the country illegally, the National Guard troops have been patrolling Metro stations and around city landmarks. Some have been picking up trash.

Many if not most of the National Guard soldiers have been deputized as U.S. Marshals. That gives the soldiers the power to detain people, the lawsuit asserts, establishing “a massive, seemingly indefinite law enforcement operation in the District subject to direct military command.”

The suit is the second the attorney general has filed against the administration since Mr. Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the city.

The first, filed days after the declaration, challenged the authority of the administration to take command of the D.C. police. The judge’s comments during the initial court hearing suggested the city was likely to prevail, but after several hours of negotiation, the U.S. Attorney General agreed to take a more limited role in compelling local police to cooperate on certain tasks.

Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington was an outspoken supporter of that earlier lawsuit. While the mayor has expressed a willingness to work with federal law enforcement agents in addressing violent crime, she has criticized the presence of out-of-state National Guard troops in the city, saying they are not helping.

Still, the mayor deferred questions about Thursday’s lawsuit to Mr. Schwalb’s office. “My 100 percent focus is on exiting the emergency, and that’s where all of our energies are,” Ms. Bowser said to reporters at a school-related event.

The emergency that Mr. Trump declared in early August ends next week if Congress does not vote to extend it, and any authority that the Trump administration holds to direct local police actions expires with it.

But much of the federal intervention in D.C. in recent weeks, including the presence of National Guard troops, is not subject to the emergency declaration. Barring a judicial ruling, many of the soldiers and federal law enforcement agents now on the ground could remain indefinitely.

Republicans in Congress have applauded the intervention, and many are pushing to bring an even heavier federal hand onto Washington’s affairs.

The House Oversight Committee, whose jurisdiction includes D.C., is expected next week to take up a bill that would toughen the District’s crime laws with regard to juvenile offenders. It is also weighing a slate of bills to reshape Washington’s criminal justice system by adding tougher penalties for some offenses and rolling back sentencing reforms passed by local lawmakers, according to a draft summary that was shared with congressional offices and viewed by The New York Times.

Among the bills being considered are legislation that would lengthen or establish mandatory minimum sentences for many crimes and repeal second-chance legislation meant to allow some people to have their criminal records sealed or expunged. Another measure under discussion would impose a $500 fine or a prison sentence of up to 30 days on people who camp outdoors on public property in the District, a measure that appears designed to target homeless encampments that Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited in justifying his efforts in Washington. The legislation was reported earlier by The Washington Post.

There is also a measure that would significantly increase congressional oversight of D.C.’s elected government, giving federal lawmakers the authority to veto local regulations and mayoral executive actions, as well as broadening the veto power Congress already has regarding laws passed by the D.C. Council. That piece of legislation, which expands on a similar bill proposed last year, is tentatively called “The District of Columbia Home Rule Improvement Act.”

Rather than resign from his position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Miran told lawmakers on the powerful Senate Banking Committee that he would take an unpaid leave of absence to fill a term on the Fed’s Board of Governors that is set to expire at the end of January. He cited the short tenure of the position and said the decision reflected the advice of counsel.

Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, called the arrangement “ridiculous.”

“Your independence has already been seriously compromised by your statement,” he added.

Senator Andy Kim, a Democrat from New Jersey, suggested that the decision made it very likely that Mr. Miran would continue to be beholden to the president while serving at the central bank.

“You could very well be continuing to act in a way that is in the political interests of the president, because you know he is going to be your future boss again at the White House,” Mr. Kim said. “Why do you even want this job at the Fed for four months, if you’re just hedging your bets and just continuing to hold your position at the White House?”

The law stipulates that members of the Fed’s board “shall devote their entire time to the business of the board.”

The issue dominated a hearing that gave Republicans and Democrats their best opportunity yet to dig into the Trump administration’s plans to overhaul the central bank amid a relentless pressure campaign from the president, who wants the Fed to slash interest rates.

Mr. Miran’s hearing was hastily scheduled so that he could possibly be in place before the Fed’s next meeting on Sept. 16 and Sept. 17. He was selected to fill the temporary position in August, after Adriana Kugler abruptly stepped down from her post five months before her term ended.

Mr. Miran sought to head off questions about his ability to make policy decisions free of political influence from the start of the hearing. In opening remarks, he said the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on major policy decisions, was an “independent group with a monumental task, and I intend to preserve that independence and serve the American people to the best of my ability.”

As the hearing got underway, he repeatedly pushed back on the idea that he would function as a “puppet” of Mr. Trump’s, as Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, accused him of being on Thursday.

“No one — not the American public, not investors here at home, not the worldwide financial markets — will trust him as an independent voice,” she said. “Every claim he makes and every vote he takes will be tainted with the suspicion that he isn’t an honest broker, but that he is Donald Trump’s puppet.”

Mr. Miran said he had not been asked to make any pledge to lower interest rates and said his views would be determined by the economic data and his own analysis.

While Republicans appeared ready to confirm Mr. Miran, his assurances rang hollow for many Democrats on the committee, given the extent of the attacks being waged on the Fed.

Mr. Trump is already embroiled in a legal battle with Lisa Cook, a governor he is trying to oust over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. Ms. Cook, who has not been charged or convicted of any wrongdoing, has sued to prevent her removal, teeing up what is expected to be a prolonged fight over the president’s ability to remove a Fed official “for cause.” That is typically interpreted to mean professional neglect or wrongdoing.

“Your nomination is getting rushed because the president is frustrated with the Fed for not cutting rates, and he wants loyalists on the Fed board,” said Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota.

Mr. Miran did not talk about Ms. Cook’s case directly, but he did clarify when asked that he had not made false statements on any mortgage applications.

If Ms. Cook loses her case, Mr. Trump will have yet another opening on the Fed’s board to fill, tipping the balance of support further in his favor. The president will also get to nominate a new chair once the term of the current head of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, ends in May.

If Mr. Trump has a majority of governors in his corner, he is likely to command greater sway over an institution that is supposed to operate independently from the White House.

As a governor, Mr. Miran would be able to vote on every major policy decision the Fed makes, including on interest rates and the rules that govern Wall Street. He would also be involved in deliberations related to the inner workings of the Fed and its staff.

Lawmakers repeatedly brought up a paper that Mr. Miran co-wrote in 2024. The paper sharply criticized the central bank and concluded that its institutional setup made it prone to policy errors and that it was unaccountable to the very people it was supposed to serve. The paper also included a series of profound reforms for the central bank. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Miran called for an end to the “revolving door between the executive branch and the Fed” — the exact journey that he now finds himself taking.

As part of a radical reset, he called for shorter terms for top officials and the ability for the president to remove policymakers for any reason. Mr. Miran wanted the 12 regional reserve bank presidents to have more say in interest rate decisions, but to come under the control of state governors. He also sought to subject the central bank’s budget to the congressional appropriations process rather than maintaining the Fed’s autonomy.

Before joining the administration, he also floated the idea of weakening the value of the U.S. dollar in a bid to make American exports more competitive, a proposal known as the Mar-a-Lago Accord. He also highlighted the costs of the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, a position that stands in sharp contrast to how the Fed sees it.

The Fed, which is overseen by Congress, is obligated to set monetary policy in pursuit of low and stable inflation as well as a healthy labor market. The central bank’s longstanding inflation target is 2 percent, a level it has exceeded since consumer price growth accelerated in the pandemic.

Before Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on effectively all of the country’s major trading partners, inflation was easing. But price pressures have intensified again, leaving a divided Fed in a difficult spot in terms of what to do about interest rates. The labor market, meanwhile, has started to show more obvious signs of softening.

Officials are getting ready to restart cuts that were put on pause in January in recognition that the risks posed to the labor market are outweighing the risk of a persistent inflation problem. But policymakers are likely to move slowly once they get going again, keeping them at odds with the president’s demands for borrowing costs that are three percentage points lower than the current range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent.

Mr. Miran has been a vocal cheerleader of the president’s economic policies and is expected to press for what Mr. Trump wants at the Fed. But he would also have to be careful about alienating himself from his soon-to-be colleagues. Decisions related to interest rates and the balance sheet, for example, are made by a 12-person committee of the governors and a rotation of five regional Fed presidents.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to decide by Sept. 10 whether to review the case and to schedule oral argument for the first week of November — just one month after the court’s new term begins. If the justices accept the case, it would be the first to reach the court in Mr. Trump’s second term that directly tests the legality of one of the administration’s signature initiatives rather than addressing the president’s actions on a temporary emergency basis.

Since taking office, Mr. Trump has relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 as a central part of his efforts to force companies to invest in the United States.

Without the emergency powers, the president and his advisers have warned of major damage to the nation’s economy, military power and diplomatic relations, particularly if the government were forced to pay back some of the billions of dollars it has already collected in tariffs.

The lower court’s “erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the president’s efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis,” the solicitor general told the justices in his request for highly expedited review. The petition had not yet been publicly docketed on the court’s website late Wednesday, but its filing was confirmed by both sides in the litigation.

Other presidents have invoked the emergency statute, typically to issue sanctions, but Mr. Trump is the first to try to use the emergency powers to impose broad levies of 10 to 50 percent on trading partners.

In April, five small businesses and a dozen states sued, saying Mr. Trump’s actions were unlawful.

Lawyers for the coalition expressed confidence in their legal arguments late Wednesday.

“These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,” Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, said in a statement.

A divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington last week upheld a lower court decision invalidating the tariffs and finding the president’s actions were not authorized by the emergency statute.

In its 7-to-4 ruling, the appeals court said the tariffs were a core constitutional power given to Congress and noted that the statute at issue did not include the word “tariffs” nor synonyms such as “tax” or “duty.”

“The power of the purse (including the power to tax) belongs to Congress,” the appeals court said in an unsigned opinion.

Mr. Trump used the emergency law early last month to tax imports from 90 countries. He previously invoked it to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico in response to what he said were those countries’ roles in the fentanyl trade.

The administration’s filing on Wednesday emphasized the importance of the tariffs to the president’s agenda and a need for the justices to act urgently.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers characterized the tariffs as the administration’s “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative,” which the president has “determined are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl across our borders.”

A coalition of prominent conservative and libertarian lawyers, scholars and former officials filed a brief in June opposing Mr. Trump’s tariffs and emphasizing that the powers to tax must remain with Congress.

Under the act at issue in the case, the president can take certain steps in response to a declared emergency arising from an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” The law says that includes the power to regulate imports, language the Trump administration says means tariffs.

But the appeals court said the statute’s grant of power to the president to regulate imports did not authorize the particular tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump’s executive orders.

The majority did not address whether the president’s actions should have been taken as a matter of policy or whether the law ever permits a president to unilaterally impose tariffs.

In dissent, four judges nominated by presidents of both parties said the challengers had failed to show that the tariffs are not among the tools Congress permitted when it passed the 1977 law.

The statute “embodies an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm, which unsurprisingly extends beyond authorities available under nonemergency laws,” wrote Judge Richard G. Taranto, a nominee of President Barack Obama, who was joined by three other judges.

Harvard’s case centered on its research funding, and the university contended that the administration had compromised its First Amendment and due process rights when it sought to strip it away. The judge’s decision could give Harvard new leverage in its settlement talks with the White House.

Although the ruling was a milestone for Harvard, the only university to sue over the administration’s targeted assault on its research funding, President Trump had vowed to appeal any decision that went against him. His administration has spent months seeking to pressure Harvard in ways beyond research money, and while Judge Burroughs’s ruling may not put an end to that campaign, her opinion was a bracing rebuke.

“We must fight against antisemitism, but we equally need to protect our rights, including our right to free speech, and neither goal should nor needs to be sacrificed on the altar of the other,” Judge Burroughs wrote in an 84-page ruling. “Harvard is currently, even if belatedly, taking steps it needs to take to combat antisemitism and seems willing to do even more if need be.”

She added, “Now it is the job of the courts to similarly step up, to act to safeguard academic freedom and freedom of speech as required by the Constitution, and to ensure that important research is not improperly subjected to arbitrary and procedurally infirm grant terminations, even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.”

As a part of the decision, Judge Burroughs said the Trump administration could not issue new blockades on Harvard’s federal research funding “in retaliation for the exercise of its First Amendment rights, or on any purported grounds of discrimination without compliance with the terms” of civil rights law.

The White House condemned the ruling.

“To any fair-minded observer, it is clear that Harvard University failed to protect their students from harassment and allowed discrimination to plague their campus for years,” said Liz Huston, a White House spokeswoman. “Harvard does not have a constitutional right to taxpayer dollars and remains ineligible for grants in the future.”

She added that the government would “appeal this egregious decision, and we are confident we will ultimately prevail in our efforts to hold Harvard accountable.”

Hours after the White House’s statement, Harvard’s president, Alan M. Garber, said the university would “continue to assess the implications of the opinion, monitor further legal developments and be mindful of the changing landscape in which we seek to fulfill our mission.”

But, he said, Judge Burroughs’s ruling “affirms Harvard’s First Amendment and procedural rights, and validates our arguments in defense of the university’s academic freedom, critical scientific research, and the core principles of American higher education.”

Judge Burroughs’s decision came on the second day of classes for the new academic year and after both the government and the university asked her to issue what is known as summary judgment — a ruling on the case’s claims without a trial. She largely ruled for Harvard, relying on voluminous filings, a select batch of evidence and oral arguments in her Boston courtroom on July 21 to reach a decision.

Harvard brought the case in April, after the Trump administration insisted that the nation’s oldest university had become a wellspring of bigotry. On April 11, it sent the school a letter trying to condition Harvard’s access to federal research money on its acquiescence to a range of demands.

Those terms included audits, the establishment of “merit-based” admissions and hiring policies, the shutdown of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and an examination of “programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”

Harvard refused on April 14. The administration took only hours to announce it would begin cutting off funding that Harvard, like other prominent universities, had long relied on to pay for research. The university sued a week later, accusing the government of ignoring its First Amendment protections and hastily barreling past the thicket of laws and regulations that govern how federal funding can be revoked.

“All told, the trade-off put to Harvard was clear: Allow the government to micromanage your viewpoints and your academic institution or jeopardize your ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries and innovative solutions,” lawyers for Harvard wrote in a court filing in June.

They added that the administration’s “content- and viewpoint-based attempt to coerce and control Harvard is blatantly unconstitutional.”

The Trump administration had insisted that it had the authority to cancel grants and contracts because, in its view, Harvard had not done enough to counter what it argued was rampant campus antisemitism. Federal research funds, the Justice Department asserted in one of its submissions to Judge Burroughs, were “not charitable gratuities.”

“Rather, the federal government grants funds to universities through contracts that include explicit conditions,” the Justice Department wrote, adding: “If they fail to meet these conditions, the grants are subject to cancellation.”

But the administration also hoped that Judge Burroughs would not issue much of a ruling at all. Its lawyers argued that an 1887 law meant that the suit, which the Justice Department depicted as a contractual matter, needed to be heard by a specialized court in Washington.

More recently, it urged the judge to consider the implications of an August decision by the Supreme Court in a different case. In that case, which also concerned federal grants, the court ruled that challenges to individual terminations should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. But it was a muddled ruling that left the door open for policy challenges in federal district courts.

Judge Burroughs acknowledged the Supreme Court’s decision on Wednesday and said she was “endeavoring” to follow it, but she largely asserted her own court’s jurisdiction.

“The First Amendment claims here are about speech and whether the federal government is improperly infringing on the free speech rights of an academic institution and its employees,” she wrote. “The resolution of these claims might result in money changing hands, but what is fundamentally at issue is a bedrock constitutional principle rather than the interpretation of contract terms.”

And Judge Burroughs, as she had in her courtroom in July, resisted the government’s efforts to tie research money to accusations of civil rights violations.

Judge Burroughs wrote on Wednesday that it was “difficult to conclude anything other than that defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”

But Harvard leaders have privately fretted over the potential fallout of a protracted fight with the federal government, even if they won in Judge Burroughs’s court, and chose months ago to start parallel settlement talks.

That did not keep the government from intensifying its pressure campaign against the school, including by issuing cumbersome subpoenas and opening new investigations, like one focused on Harvard’s patents.

The New York Times reported in July that the university was open to spending $500 million to resolve the matter, but that Harvard was seeking an array of provisions to protect its independence.

Although the university and the administration have continued to move toward a potential agreement, they have not reached a settlement. Mr. Trump, who has taken a special interest in the financial terms of pacts his administration has reached with universities, said last week that he wanted “nothing less than $500 million from Harvard.”

“They’ve been very bad,” Mr. Trump told the education secretary, Linda McMahon, during a televised cabinet meeting. “Don’t negotiate.”

But Harvard officials had anticipated that a favorable decision from Judge Burroughs could help the university’s approach to the negotiations in two essential ways.

Such a ruling, they have reasoned, gives them a new way to pressure a government that might not wish to fight the university all the way to the Supreme Court.

And school officials, ever mindful of the university’s internal politics, have hoped that a legal victory would help them to portray any deal with the White House as part of a surrender by the administration.

Joseph Sellers and Corey Stoughton, lawyers for other organizations that also sued the administration over the attack on Harvard, including the American Association of University Professors, said they welcomed Wednesday’s ruling as “a decisive victory for academic freedom and research in the public interest.”

But, they added, “We hope this decision makes clear to Harvard’s administration that bargaining the Harvard community’s rights in a compromise with the government is unacceptable.”

Judge Burroughs’s decision arrived at a moment of high tension for Harvard. Federal regulations had the university preparing to submit “closeout” paperwork for some terminated grants on Wednesday.

Without a ruling by Wednesday, the university had warned the judge, it feared that “the government will take the position that no restoration of funds is possible.”

According to court documents, the defendants operated a prolific alien smuggling operation (ASO) that facilitated the unlawful entry of Cuban nationals into the United States by preparing visa applications, laundering millions of dollars in payment, and exploiting the immigration process.

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “We will not rest until those who profit from the suffering of vulnerable people — including many unaccompanied children — face severe, comprehensive justice.”

“This indictment exposes a criminal organization that smuggled people into the United States on a massive scale, and then fraudulently secured immigration benefits for them,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Posing as a legitimate immigration service, the defendants used social media promotions and false legal filings to attract new clients and perpetuate their fraud. The Criminal Division and our law enforcement partners will continue to dismantle these schemes, protect vulnerable people from exploitation, and safeguard the integrity of the U.S. immigration system.”

“The defendants in this case conspired with others to deliberately violate our nation’s immigration laws while personally seeking to enrich themselves,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory W. Kehoe for the Middle District of Florida. “Because of the interagency coordination and diligence of our dedicated law enforcement agencies, their crimes have been thwarted. We will continue working with our partners to protect our national borders.”

“This superseding indictment exposes the depth of a multi-year conspiracy of alien smuggling, asylum fraud, and money laundering that preyed on vulnerable individuals and weakened public trust in the immigration system,” said Acting Director Todd M. Lyons of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “This highlights the critical role ICE has in dismantling these criminal networks, combating immigration fraud, and ensuring criminals who abuse our systems are held accountable. We are absolute in our resolve to protect the integrity of our immigration system and safeguard our national security.

“It is because of the unfettered Department of Justice support we charge criminals with every available statute to provide consequences to those that erode the moral fabric of our society,” said Chief Jeffrey J. Dinise of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Miami Sector. “The message is clear, the United States is closed to illegal immigration and terrorist organizations, and those that make an attempt, will be met with fierce consequences. We are committed to protecting our Florida communities and safeguarding our nation.”

“Through diligent investigation, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and our partners exposed a multi-national, multi-year, multi-million dollar criminal conspiracy operated by aliens that attempted to undermine our immigration system and flood our country with illegal aliens — none of whom had any intention of following our laws,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow. “This criminal organization operated a front for fake asylum claims, churning out frivolous applications around the country. To criminals who seek to exploit our immigration system: we will find you, shut down your schemes, and you will face justice.”

The superseding indictment charges:

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, 27, of Hialeah, FL (unlawfully residing in the United States);

Yuniel Lima-Santos, 30, of Tampa, FL;

Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, 26, unlawfully residing in Lebanon, TN;

Marianny Lucia Lopez-Torres, 25, residing in Cuba, (formerly Hialeah, FL);

Frandy Aragon-Diaz, 33, of Cuba, (formerly unlawfully residing in Tampa, FL);

Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, 31, of Tampa, FL;

Layra Libertad Treto Santos, 31, of Tampa, FL; and

Gisleivy Peralta Consuegra, 40, of Tampa, FL.

According to the superseding indictment:

All defendants except Gisleivy Peralta Consuegra are charged with conspiracy to commit alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos and Frandy Aragon-Diaz are also charged with alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Layra Libertad Treto Santos, and Gisleivy Peralta Consuerga are charged with conspiracy to commit asylum fraud.

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Erik Ventura-Castro, Miguel Alejandro Martinez Vasconcelos, Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, and Layra Libertad Treto Santos are charged with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments.

From January 2021 through June 2025, the defendants promoted bogus visa services online, claiming Cuban nationals could secure U.S. entry through false claims of European citizenship. They filed hundreds of fraudulent Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) applications with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using fake addresses and fabricated documents.

The ASO promoted its services on social media accounts and encrypted messaging platforms, including a WhatsApp group titled, “TRÁMITE DE ESTA Y VISA DE TURISMO A USA PARA CIUDADANOS ESPAÑOLES” (Processing of ESTA and tourist Visas to the USA for Spanish citizens). One promotional video advertised the scheme by showing stacks of passports, airline tickets, and visa approvals.

What began as a small operation grew into a commercial enterprise. The defendants charged clients between $1,500 and $40,000, sometimes even chartering private planes to move groups of aliens. Records show they spent over $2.5 million on flights alone and funneled more than $7 million through payment apps such as Zelle. Based on a financial analysis conducted of 27 known accounts associated with the defendants and their co-conspirators, the alien smuggling organization took in over $18 million during the course of the conspiracy.

The ASO also smuggled unaccompanied minors. In one case, a teenage girl was told to pose as the lifelong friend of an unrelated adult man when crossing the border.

The defendants operated a sham immigration business, ASESORIA Y SERVICIOS MIGRATORIOS LLC, which promised asylum filings, work permits, and residency applications. In reality, the company churned out boilerplate asylum claims without clients’ knowledge or consent and even blocked them from accessing their own USCIS online accounts.

ASESORIA marketed itself on Instagram with flashy ads for immigration services while simultaneously posting videos of aliens being smuggled into the country.

The investigation and superseding indictment were coordinated under Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along southern and northern borders. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 410 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 355 U.S. convictions; more than 305 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

HSI Tampa, U.S. Border Patrol Miami Sector, and USCIS’s’ Fraud Detection and National Security led U.S. investigative efforts, with substantial assistance from HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit in Washington, D.C. and CBP’s National Targeting Center International Interdiction Task Force. Authorities in the Cayman Islands provided valuable assistance.

A Michigan woman has been indicted for her role in an international alien smuggling conspiracy which brought aliens, including children, from Central America into the United States across the northern border.

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “We will not rest until those who profit from the suffering of vulnerable people — including many unaccompanied children — face severe, comprehensive justice.”

“The defendant is charged with conspiring to smuggle families, including young children, across our northern border for profit,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Smuggling organizations threaten the security of our borders and undermines public safety. The Criminal Division is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to disrupt smuggling networks wherever they operate and bring their members to justice.”

“Those who promote and profit from smuggling migrants into the country take advantage of vulnerable individuals without regard for the safety of others,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael P. Drescher for the District of Vermont. “The prosecution of Ms. Lozano should send a message that those who commit these offenses will be investigated and held responsible, not only for their own criminal acts but also for facilitating illegal border crossings by others. Thank you to our law enforcement partners at the U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) for their collaborative investigative work to keep our communities and country safe.”

“Human smuggling is a ruthless criminal enterprise that exploits vulnerable individuals for profit without regard for their life and safety,” said Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Krol of HSI New England. “HSI remains steadfast in combating alien smuggling organizations and upholding the integrity of our borders.”

“I commend the unwavering dedication and vigilance of our agents in combating the dangers posed by smuggling operations along our northern border,” said Chief Robert N. Garcia of U.S. Border Patrol Swanton Sector. “Smuggling, whether it involves people, contraband, or other illicit activities, poses a significant threat to public safety and national security. The alleged actions of Norma Linda Lozano underscore the risks associated with these criminal enterprises and the critical need for robust enforcement efforts. I would also like to extend my appreciation to all of our partners in the investigation and indictment of Lozano. Their efforts are vital to ensuring that those who engage in these dangerous and illegal activities are held accountable.”

A federal grand jury charged Norma Linda Lozano, also known as Norma Linda Quintanilla Lozano, 53, of Ypsilanti, Michigan, with one count of conspiracy to smuggle aliens and six counts of bringing aliens to the United States for profit.

According to the indictment, from February through November 2024, Lozano participated in an alien smuggling organization (ASO) that brought and attempted to bring aliens from Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and El Salvador, including children, illegally into the United States from Canada. The ASO instructed the aliens to cross the border on foot, provided GPS coordinates and a description of Lozano’s vehicle, and coordinated their pick-up once inside the United States.

Lozano allegedly drove from Michigan to Vermont to meet the aliens at prearranged locations near the border. She then transported the aliens further into the United States, delivering them to residences, businesses, or airports. The aliens or their family members allegedly paid Lozano for smuggling services.

In one smuggling event, Lozano allegedly transported three aliens from Guatemala and El Salvador in her car, with a five-year-old girl. The child rode in the front passenger seat, and Lozano falsely claimed the child was her granddaughter. In another smuggling event, she allegedly transported six adults along with an eight-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy. The girl was placed in the cargo area of the hatchback on top of luggage.

The crash of a tractor-trailer packed with at least 160 illegal aliens – many of them Guatemalan – killed more than 50 people, including unaccompanied children, and injured over 100 more.

Yesterday’s extraditions are the result of sustained coordination between the Justice Department and Guatemalan authorities following an international enforcement operation carried out on Dec. 9, 2024, the third anniversary of the tragedy. The extraditions mark yet another significant step in the Justice Department’s efforts to bring those responsible to justice.

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “We will not rest until those who profit from the suffering of vulnerable people — including many unaccompanied children — face severe, comprehensive justice.”

Human smuggling organizations profit by exploiting the vulnerable, putting lives at grave risk for financial gain. Even those smugglers who try to hide beyond the reach of the U.S. will be brought to justice for the death and suffering they have caused.”

“Human smugglers do not care if the people they transport live or die,” said U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei of the Southern District of Texas. “They do not care if unaccompanied children have food, water, or even air to breathe. They respect neither the law nor basic principles of decency. They care for only one thing — the blood money they make from the suffering of others. But these extraditions show that the United States will never tire in pursuing them. There is no border, no refuge that can shield these criminals from justice.”

Tomas Quino Canil, 37; Oswaldo Manuel Zavala Quino also known as Osvaldo ZQ, 25; and Josefa Quino Canil De Zavala, 43, were arrested in Boquerón, Guatemala on Dec. 9, 2024, pursuant to U.S. extradition requests, and were surrendered to U.S. authorities on Sept. 3, 2025. A fourth Guatemalan national, Daniel Zavala Ramos also known as “Dany ZR,” 41, was arrested on Aug. 7, 2025 in Boquerón and is pending extradition.

Two additional defendants were also arrested during the coordinated operation. Alberto Marcario Chitic also known as Alberto De Jesus, 32, was also arrested in Boquerón on Dec. 9, 2024, and extradited to the United States in May 2025. Jorge Agapito Ventura also known as Jorge Ventura, George Ventura, and El Raitero, 33, was arrested at his residence in Cleveland, Texas.

All six defendants are each charged in the Southern District of Texas with conspiracy to bring undocumented aliens to the United States, placing life in jeopardy, causing serious bodily injury, and resulting in death. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of life in prison.

According to court documents, from Oct. 2021 to Feb. 2023, the defendants conspired with other smugglers to transport undocumented aliens from Guatemala though Mexico to the United States. They allegedly recruited Guatemalan aliens, collected payment, and arranged for the aliens to travel by foot, inside microbuses, cattle trucks, and tractor-trailers. In some instances, including the smuggling of unaccompanied minors, the defendants provided scripts and instructions on what to say if apprehended. Some of the aliens recruited by the defendants died or suffered serious bodily injury as result of the Dec. 9, 2021, crash.

HSI’s Counter Proliferation Investigations Group in Washington D.C. investigated the case in partnership with HSI Guatemala and HSI Mexico. Valuable assistance was provided by HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit; HSI Houston; HSI Laredo; U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s National Targeting Center; Operation Sentinel; U.S. Border Patrol; Liberty County Constable, Precinct 6; ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Houston; U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont Division; and the Criminal Division’s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance, and Training (OPDAT). The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs (OIA) provided significant assistance in securing the arrests and extraditions of the defendants. Guatemalan prosecutors and Mexican prosecutors from the Republic of Mexico’s Federal Prosecutions Office also known as Fiscalía General de la República (FGR), with the support of law enforcement officials from both countries, were also instrumental in furthering the investigation.

Senior Trial Attorney Danielle Hickman of the Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mary Lou Castillo and Jennifer Day for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case, with substantial assistance from HRSP Latin American Specialist/Historian Joanna Crandall.

The indictment of these defendants is the result of the coordinated efforts of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Joint Task Force Alpha. JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA is currently comprised of detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along southern and northern borders. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by HRSP and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, and the Office of International Affairs, among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 410 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 355 U.S. convictions; more than 305 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

This case is part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) and Project Safe Neighborhood.

Newsweek has analyzed numbers released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, which provided recent records of immigrants to depart the U.S. through July 31, 2025.

Since President Donald Trump took office on January 20, ICE had deported 145,419 illegal immigrants from its detention centers, peaking in June with a total of 27,970.

A Small But Rising Number of Self-Deportees

The chart above details the different categories ICE gives for remoivals, including deportation on the grounds of inadmissibility and voluntary departure.

In February, the first full month of Trump's second term, confirmed voluntary departures were at 592, the data showed. By July, that number had climbed to 4,241.

The beginning of the increase roughly aligns with the repurposing of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) app. Under former President Joe Biden, CBP One was a tool for immigrants to book appointments with officials at the southwest border. The Trump administration transformed it into the CBP Home app, a tool for those without legal status to report self-deportation.

It was not immediately clear how many of those whom ICE marked as voluntary departures had used the CBP Home app to depart the country, and CBP has not published figures on the app's usage as of September 2025.

""One caveat on making judgements about use of this disposition is that it may or may not entirely reflect ICE policy, because [voluntary departure] is commonly offered by immigration judges too,"" Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies told Newsweek.

Vaughan said it was important to note that 38 percent of voluntary departure cases under Trump came from the border, compared to 20 percent under Biden.

Has Trump Increased Deportations?

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has repeatedly touted high deportation numbers, but the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE have not published consistent data on removals.

Under Biden, DHS shared monthly updates on immigration enforcement, with ICE data for July 2024 showing around 25,000 removals by ICE. That number was 23,250 this July, according to the data released under FOIA.

""More generally, there has been a significant increase in interior enforcement and in corresponding removals under Trump compared to the exact same period under Biden,"" Vaughan said.

""Most notably, under Trump, ICE has removed nearly double the number of aliens with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, which will result in safer communities across the country. Part of the reason for this has been the much greater engagement with state and local law enforcement agencies under Trump.""

This data gives some insight into how ICE has moved to deport its detainees since inauguration day, totaling more than 145,000 removals in six months. The number marks an increase in ICE deportations from within the U.S. compared to the same period last year under Biden, but then more immigrants were being turned around and sent back across the U.S.-Mexico border instead.

""I'd say that total removals are not much higher than they were last year—which could mean that there is a hard capacity limit on total removals,"" David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told Newsweek.

""Nonetheless, that the number of removals of recent border crossers have fallen because fewer people are entering, while the number of removals of people here for more than six months has increased threefold.""

What Do We Know About Deportees?

The ICE data provides a breakdown of each individual immigrant to have officially left the U.S. under its jurisdiction, meaning there are also details on their nationality and whether they committed any crimes while in the U.S.

The majority of those deported since late January were from Mexico, with monthly totals far outpacing other nationalities. In May, 12,211 Mexicans were deported or left voluntarily, with Guatemalans, Venezuelans and Hondurans following in the low-thousands.

Not all immigrants are sent back to the country they came from, often because the U.S. does not have agreements with those nations, or countries do not accept repatriation flights.

In June, 240 Chinese nationals were deported, though China itself took 235 of them. Venezuela, a country with which the U.S. has a strained relationship, also saw fewer repatriations.

The Trump administration has also touted its efforts to arrested and deport the ""worst of the worst"" – that is, illegal immigrants who have either been convicted of serious crimes, or face criminal charges.

The data released by ICE also gave an insight into the criminality of the immigrants deported between the end of January and end of July. While more than 60,000 had no criminal convictions or pending charges, the vast majority of those deported by ICE were suspected or known criminals.

Though data publishing remains inconsistent under the Trump administration, these figures suggest a marked increase in removals of known criminals compared to previous years. However, recent detention data has suggested most of those being held in ICE facilities do not have any criminal convictions or pending charges.

""After successfully ending the invasion of our country and securing our southern border, President Trump established the visionary Project Homecoming in May to create a smooth, efficient process for illegal aliens to return home,"" a senior DHS official told Newsweek.

""By using the CBP Home App, illegal aliens will receive a complimentary one-way plane ticket home, a $1,000 exit bonus, and forgiveness of any fines previously assessed for failure to depart. Tens of thousands of illegal aliens have utilized the CBP Home app, and 1.6 million illegal immigrants have left the United States population since January 20.""

The challenge for ICE now, coming up on nine months into Trump's second term, is to dramatically increase its enforcement numbers, from arrests through to deportations, as the president and his top advisor, Stephen Miller, are said to be demanding.

Under Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the agency has seen its budget supercharged, but more officers and expanded detention space will both take time to get online.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2715839/immigration-enforcement.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 22:57:46.543889

That breaks down to $71 million for food, $37 million for pay, $4 million for logistics supplies, $3.5 million for travel and $1.5 million for ""demobilization costs,"" according to Newsom's office, which released the numbers Thursday, citing the California National Guard.

The Trump administration sent in the military in June after federal immigration raids sparked protests across the region. At the height of their deployment, around 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines were on the ground in Los Angeles.

""Let us not forget what this political theater is costing us all — millions of taxpayer dollars down the drain,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""We ask other states to do the math themselves.""

On Tuesday, California asked a federal court to block a Trump administration order to continue their deployment through Nov. 5, the day after Newsom's special election will ask California voters to approve his redistricting plan.

Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled for the second time that Trump's deployment of the National Guard in L.A. was illegal. District Judge Charles R.

In the ruling, Breyer wrote that Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth are ""creating a national police force with the President as its chief.""

Trump appealed that ruling. He has also threatened to send the National Guard to San Francisco.

Human Rights and Global Wrongs

Donald Trump appears fixated on “creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer wrote, holding that Trump’s deployment of federal troops to Los Angeles to enforce the immigration laws was illegal. Trump has already sent troops to Washington, D.C., and has also set his sights on Oakland, San Francisco, Chicago, and Baltimore.

Trump will appeal the ruling. The appellate courts will determine whether he will be allowed to use the military as his personal police force, notwithstanding the clear command of the Posse Comitatus Act.

In his 52-page decision, Breyer ruled that defendants Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and the Department of Defense “willfully” violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 1878 law that prohibits the use of the military to enforce domestic laws. The act now forbids the willful use of “any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus [power of the county] or otherwise to execute the laws.” It only allows exceptions that are expressly authorized by the Constitution or act of Congress, such as the Insurrection Act, which Trump did not invoke.

Breyer concluded that, “at Defendants’ orders and contrary to Congress’s explicit instruction, federal troops executed the laws” in and around Los Angeles. “Defendants systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence.”

On June 7, without the consent of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Trump issued an edict under 10 U.S.C. section 12406 to activate National Guard units for “the enforcement of Federal law and to protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.”

In his edict, Trump also wrote that “To the extent that protests or acts of violence directly inhibit the execution of the laws, they constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

Not limiting his order to California, Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles for 60 days at the discretion of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. That number was later increased to 4,000 and the defendants also mobilized 700 Marines to deploy to Los Angeles. Three months later, 300 members of the National Guard remain stationed in L.A.

“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” Breyer noted. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”

Newsom and the State of California filed this case on June 9, and Breyer then found that Trump, Hegseth, and the Department of Defense illegally deployed federal troops to L.A. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overruled Breyer and held that the defendants had properly mobilized the troops under 10 U.S.C. section 12406, But the appellate court didn’t weigh in on the plaintiffs’ assertion that defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act.

Facts Adduced at Trial

Breyer presided over a trial from August 11 to August 13 that dealt with the merits of the plaintiffs’ Posse Comitatus claim.

It was established at trial that in early June 2025, “ICE targeted ‘several locations in downtown LA and its immediate surroundings’ that are ‘known to have significant migrant populations and labour-intensive industries’ … Public protests quickly followed.” Breyer wrote that the L.A. Police Department and the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department “responded to these protests and maintained control of the situation.”

Nevertheless, the defendants deployed military forces to L.A. and they were put under the control of Task Force 51, which received training on the permissible scope of their activities under the Posse Comitatus Act. Their training materials said that “active-duty military personnel may not provide ‘direct, active assistance to civilian law enforcement authorities by performing law enforcement functions,’ unless a Constitutional or an Act of Congress exception specifically permits it.”

Task Force 51 was given a list of “Prohibited Law Enforcement Functions,” which included “active, direct”: (1) Pursuit, (2) Arrests, (3) Apprehension, (4) Search, (5) Seizure, (6) Security patrols, (7) Traffic control, (8) Riot control, (9) Crowd Control, (10) Evidence collection, (11) Interrogation, and (12) Acting as Informants. But Task Force 51 troops were orally instructed that 4 of 12 listed functions that were highlighted in red — security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, and riot control — “were subject to a so-called constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act,” Breyer noted.

Moreover, the Defense Department instructed the Northern Command and Task Force 51 “that the President and Secretary’s June 7 memoranda created a constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act and thereby authorized Task Force 51 to engage in the four functions listed in red,” Breyer added.

Task Force 51 troops and some Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wore camouflage uniforms, which made it difficult to differentiate them at a distance. Task Force 51 troops carried weapons with live ammunition.

“The presence of Task Force 51 deterred engagement by the public, especially by those who might have attempted to hinder or protest an arrest by ICE agents,” Breyer noted.

Breyer Rejects Trump’s Invention of a “Constitutional Exception” to Posse Comitatus

The defendants argued that there is a “constitutional exception” to the Posse Comitatus Act, which gives the president inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, personnel, and functions.

“Under this ‘constitutional exception,’ as Defendants call it, the President has inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions, so any actions that can be construed as such ‘protection’ are lawful in spite of the Posse Comitatus Act,” Breyer wrote. “This assertion is not grounded in the history of the Act, Supreme Court jurisprudence on executive authority, or common sense.”

The judge cited the defendants’ knowing contradiction of their own training manuals and their refusal to coordinate with state and local officials. Breyer noted that Trump, Hegseth, and the Department of Defense “‘coach[ed]’ federal law enforcement agencies as to what language to use when submitting requests for assistance in an attempt to circumvent the Act … These actions demonstrate that Defendants knew that they were ordering troops to execute domestic law beyond their usual authority. Whether they believed that some constitutional or other exception applied does not matter; ‘ignorance of the law is no excuse.’”

During the trial, Breyer was incredulous at the defendants’ arguments. “Are you saying because the president says it, therefore it is?,” the judge asked. “In other words, we’re going to see federal officers everywhere if the president determines there’s some threat to the safety of a federal agent.”

Breyer Issues a Narrow Injunction

Breyer issued an injunction forbidding the defendants from using the National Guard troops currently deployed to Los Angeles from enforcing the law. Defendants are not required to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops from L.A. And they are not prevented from using the troops for purposes consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, such as protecting federal property.

Under Breyer’s order, Hegseth and the Department of Defense are enjoined from:

deploying, ordering, instructing, training, or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops heretofore deployed in California, to execute the laws, including but not limited to engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants, unless and until Defendants satisfy the requirements of a valid constitutional or statutory exception, as defined herein, to the Posse Comitatus Act.

This order applies only to the defendants’ use of the National Guard in California, not nationally. Breyer stayed his injunction until September 12, 2025, ostensibly to provide the defendants an opportunity to appeal his ruling.

True to form, Trump reacted to the ruling by calling Breyer “a radical left judge.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who filed the lawsuit, applauded Breyer’s decision. The ruling “affirms that President Trump is not King, and the power of the executive is not boundless,” Bonta said in a news release. He added:

For more than two months, the President has engaged in political theater, using National Guard troops and Marines as pawns to further his anti-immigrant agenda. In doing so, he trampled on one of the very basic foundations of our democracy: That our military be apolitical and the activities of troops on U.S. soil be extremely limited to ensure civil liberties and protect against military overreach.

But in light of the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision giving presidents monarchical powers, a ruling that reverses Breyer’s decision would not be surprising.

“The stakes are huge,” Eric J. Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law, told the Los Angeles Times. “If this District Court decision is reversed by either the 9th Circuit or the Supreme Court or both … the Trump administration would go hog wild.”

It was recently reported by Jack Poulson on Substack that ICE has reactivated its 2 million dollar contract with Paragon Solutions, a cyber-mercenary and spyware manufacturer.

The reactivation of the contract between the Department of Homeland Security and Paragon Solutions, a known spyware vendor, is extremely troubling.

This end run around the executive order both ignores the spirit of the rule and does not actually do anything to prevent misuse of Paragon Malware for human rights abuses

Paragon's “Graphite” malware has been implicated in widespread misuse by the Italian government. Researchers at Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto and with Meta found that it has been used in Italy to spy on journalists and civil society actors, including humanitarian workers. Without strong legal guardrails, there is a risk that the malware will be misused in a similar manner by the U.S. Government.

These reports undermine Paragon Solutions’s public marketing of itself as a more ethical provider of surveillance malware.

Reportedly, the contract is being reactivated because the US arm of Paragon Solutions was acquired by a Miami based private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, and then merged into a Virginia based cybersecurity company, REDLattice, allowing ICE to circumvent Executive Order 14093 which bans the acquisition of spyware controlled by a foreign government or person. Even though this order was always insufficient in preventing the acquisition of dangerous spyware, it was the best protection we had. This end run around the executive order both ignores the spirit of the rule and does not actually do anything to prevent misuse of Paragon Malware for human rights abuses.

Ms. McIver, 39, was charged in May with assaulting and interfering with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents after a confrontation involving the city’s mayor, Ras J. Baraka.

She has pleaded not guilty. And on Wednesday afternoon seven Republicans joined with Democrats to block a resolution that would have led her to be censured and removed from the Committee on Homeland Security.

Ms. McIver, a first-term House member from Newark, was outside the detention center on May 9 when agents, wearing masks and camouflage gear, moved in to arrest Mr. Baraka on trespassing charges, leading to a volatile scrum. Video showed her pushing toward the gates and being pushed from behind after Mr. Baraka was handcuffed.

Ms. McIver was there for a House oversight visit and, immediately after the incident, was invited into the facility and led on a tour with two of her Democratic colleagues, Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez.

Ten days later, Alina Habba, New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor, announced in a news release that she was dropping the trespassing charge against Mr. Baraka — but would pursue charges against Ms. McIver. A grand jury later handed up an indictment that accused Ms. McIver of “forcibly grabbing” one agent and “using her forearms” to strike a second agent as she sought to block the mayor’s arrest.

Representative Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, moved to censure Ms. McIver and remove her from Homeland Security — a committee he quit last week, noting that he was no longer in sync with fellow Republican committee members who were “more in alignment with the less conservative factions of our conference.”

Mr. Higgins’s resolution argues that Ms. McIver’s actions “do not reflect creditably on the House” and that the charges she faced presented a conflict of interest on a committee that oversees federal immigration enforcement.

The House clerk who read the resolution aloud on Wednesday afternoon was repeatedly interrupted by a chorus of boos, only to be told: “Read over them.”

Then, Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, moved to table the resolution, drawing supportive votes from Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans and two Republican members of the Ethics Committee, who might eventually be asked to consider ethics violations tied to the incident.

The resolution could be reconsidered at a later date.

In a statement, Mr. Higgins called out the Republicans who either supported Ms. Clark’s motion or abstained from taking a position by voting “present”: Representatives Don Bacon of Nebraska; Mike Flood of Nebraska; Dave Joyce of Ohio; Mike Turner of Ohio; David Valadao of California; Andrew Garbarino of New York; and Nathaniel Moran of Texas.

“Talk to these guys,” Mr. Higgins said. “They’re the Republicans who failed to stand with federal law enforcement.”

Ms. McIver reacted with trademark defiance on Tuesday night when it became clear that Mr. Higgins’s effort to oust her from the committee would reach the House floor.

“Instead of making life any better for the people he represents, he’s seeking to punish me for doing what he and his caucus are too cowardly to do: conduct real oversight, stand up to this administration and do our jobs,” she said in a statement. “If House Republicans think they can make me run scared, they’re wrong.”

At the center of the controversy is the Newark detention center, which is known as Delaney Hall and is run by one of the country’s largest private prison companies, GEO Group. It has a contract with ICE to hold as many as 1,000 migrants at risk of deportation in its two-floor jailhouse.

In the weeks before Mr. Baraka’s arrest, he had argued in court and in visits to Delaney Hall that it had not been fully inspected and was operating without a valid certificate of occupancy.

His concerns about the safety of the facility proved prescient when, weeks later, unrest over food portions and crowding ended only after four men escaped through a jailhouse wall. The men lowered mattresses to the ground on June 13 and then lashed bedsheets together to escape, according to court records. The last of the four men was located and rearrested five weeks later.

Ms. Habba, a former personal lawyer to Mr. Trump, has led the U.S. attorney’s office since late March, courting controversy as she pursued high-profile cases against New Jersey Democrats. After district court judges declined to extend her tenure, the Justice Department resorted to an extraordinary series of legal maneuvers to keep her in office. That drew immediate legal challenges to her authority from several defendants in pending criminal cases.

Last month, a federal judge concluded that Ms. Habba has not been the lawful leader of the office since July 1, but he delayed the effect of the ruling until after the matter is reviewed by an appeals court, leaving the federal courts in New Jersey at a virtual standstill.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/03/multimedia/03MET-McIVER-pckw/03MET-McIVER-pckw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 17:56:51.796154

In President Trump’s August 11 emergency declaration, he invoked Section 740 of the Home Rule Act, which allows the president to declare an emergency in D.C. and require the “services” of the Metropolitan Police Department for “Federal purposes,” which is the one statutory exception to local control of MPD.

Even under Section 740, Congress reserved day-to-day control of MPD to D.C.’s local elected officials, not to the federal government. And under Section 740, MPD services are to be used for “Federal purposes” under emergency conditions. By attempting to give the federal government full operational control of MPD, including its local law enforcement efforts, for the purpose of addressing crime in the city, which is at a 30-year low, President Trump has far exceeded his statutory authority under Section 740.

The Trump administration’s attempted D.C. takeover is a frightening step in President Trump’s ongoing weaponization of government against his perceived political opponents. Since returning to office, the Trump administration has used federal law enforcement to seemingly threaten and intimidate his critics, and is now encroaching on D.C. local affairs to intimidate the city’s residents. This aggressive use of law enforcement stands in stark contrast to President Trump’s conduct during the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump group, when he failed to promptly mobilize federal law enforcement as violence persisted in the Capitol for hours, resulting in the death of a Capitol Police officer and injuries to approximately 140 other law enforcement officers.

President Trump’s interference in local law enforcement matters is not limited to just D.C. In June, the Trump administration sent the California National Guard into Los Angeles to quell protests against the Trump administration’s immigration policy without the consent of the state’s governor, and the Pentagon is reportedly preparing to send the Illinois National Guard into Chicago despite the opposition of the state’s governor. Attempting to take over law enforcement in those cities disrupts the delicate balance of state and federal power established by the Constitution.

The attempted D.C. takeover highlights the city’s precarious legal status and the need for statehood. It also may be a testing ground for more extreme authoritarian action in the future. Congress must stand up against this unjustified attack on D.C. and the Constitution by passing H.J. Res. 115 to end the D.C. takeover.",https://www.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DCDeployment-1200x630.png,N,,2025-09-04 14:57:02.969239

In their court declarations, the unaccompanied children said they don’t want to go back to Guatemala or that their parents never requested their return.
Another judge in Arizona blocked the removals of 53 other Guatemalan minors in the state last week.","Guatemalan migrant children say they remain “traumatized” and “depressed” after the Trump administration attempted to quietly remove them from the United States during the holiday weekend despite having pending immigration cases, according to new court declarations.

A declaration by a 16-year-old describes how multiple Guatemalan children at a Texas shelter were awoken in the middle of the night Saturday and told they would be returned to their native country in a matter of hours.

“I am afraid to return to Guatemala,” said the teen, who fled Guatemala last year following their sister’s murder, according to a court declaration. “I was worried that I would be killed.”

“At around 2:30 a.m., I called my mother to tell her I might be deported to Guatemala. My mom started crying,” states the declaration from the teen, who is only identified by the initials A.J.D.E. in court records.

The mother, who lives in Guatemala, was not aware of any plan to have her child removed from the U.S., according to the teen’s declaration. “She does not want me to return. She does not have the resources to care for me. My father is not a part of my life. I have no other family who could receive me.”

Thirteen other declarations from teens like A.J.D.E, most of whom are 16 and 17, were filed in court Wednesday as part of the ongoing legal challenge that on Labor Day weekend temporarily blocked the removals of any unaccompanied Guatemalan child in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement who does not have a final removal order.

In the documents, the teens describe fearing gang recruitment in their home country as well as violence from relatives, criminal organizations and even the Guatemalan government.

A.J.D.E.’s declaration said he still feels “totally traumatized. ... I don’t even know how to explain it.”

A 17-year-old at another Texas shelter woke up at 2 a.m. Sunday so scared that “I felt like I lost my breath for a second.” In a declaration, the teen, identified in court records by the initials A.R.M.D., stated: “I just keep thinking about them trying to return me to Guatemala. I feel depressed.”

The U.S. government and Guatemalan officials have said their efforts to remove unaccompanied Guatemalan children in ORR custody are “repatriations” and “reunifications of children,” according to court transcripts and public statements. The removals are part of an agreement reached between the two nations following Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s visit to Guatemala in July.

But legal advocates representing the minors dispute that the attempted removals were “repatriations” and not attempted deportations, stating there’s no indication that ICE is complying with obligations “to provide access to counsel or with the mandated safeguards it must implement before children agree to voluntary departure,” according to the lawsuit.

“If these are benign repatriations, that’s not how they happen,” said Efrén C. Olivares, vice president of litigation and legal strategy at the National Immigration Law Center, the organization that filed the lawsuit blocking the minors’ removal to Guatemala. He spoke at a virtual congressional briefing on Tuesday.

Dozens of advocates and organizations providing legal immigration services to many of these minors have characterized the attempted removals as “unlawful” because they disregarded a series of legal protections Congress granted to unaccompanied migrant children who are in federal custody as they go through immigration proceedings.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 outlines some of these protections. It generally requires children be placed in the “least restrictive setting possible” throughout the duration of their immigration proceedings. It also establishes protocols for safe repatriations and family reunifications to ensure the safety of these unaccompanied minors, who are considered among the most vulnerable migrant children.

Under these protocols, a child can request a voluntary departure that must be authorized by an immigration judge to ensure the child is not being coerced to return or a parent can come forward to claim their child.

In their court declarations, the unaccompanied children said they don’t want to go back to Guatemala or that their parents never requested their return.

Other declarations submitted by the attorneys representing the minors also included statements from some of their parents in Guatemala saying they never asked for their children to be returned.

Jennifer Anzardo Valdes, director of children’s legal services at the International Rescue Committee, told NBC News that two unaccompanied Guatemalan teenage girls her organization represents in Texas went before an immigration judge last Friday and were told their names were on a list of children who wanted to return to Guatemala.

“The children told the judge that was not true and that they were scared to go home,” Anzardo Valdes said. “So the judge continued the case for them to be able to continue their immigration application.”

Still, both girls and a third unaccompanied minor that IRC represents were picked up from their foster homes in the middle of the night and put on a bus. They were kept for over 12 hours Sunday before being returned to an ORR facility without the ability to say goodbye to their original foster families, according to Anzardo Valdes.

“All of them were really sad to be pulled away from their foster home,” she said.

They were also “terrified,” Valdes said, pointing out that one of the girls is Mayan, which is the largest Indigenous group in Guatemala. The girl said she comes from “a community where kids disappeared” and thought “that was going to happen to me.”

It is estimated that the federal government intends to remove up to 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children from the U.S., according to whistleblower reports cited by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon in a letter he sent to the Office of Refugee Resettlement last week.

Court records show immigration authorities placed at least 76 minors in planes to Guatemala that were later grounded. Another judge in Arizona blocked the removals of 53 other Guatemalan minors in the state last week. Court declarations and accounts from organizations providing legal immigration services to the children show that minors in ORR custody across at least eight states are at risk of being removed under these circumstances.

“Children who are in ORR custody have fled difficult circumstances. Some have been orphans, some have been persecuted, abandoned, trafficked or sold,” said Shaina Aber, executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, during the virtual congressional briefing Tuesday.

“All of them have experienced significant trauma that remains ongoing,” Aber said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250904-guatemalan-children-ch-0955-727857.jpg",N,,2025-09-04 14:58:05.984593

(WTVO) — As Chicago prepares for a surge of immigration enforcement agents, the city of Rockford issued a statement Wednesday in solidarity with its noncitizen community, with the warning that ICE operations could extend to the Forest City.

The City posted a notice to its Facebook page in both English and Spanish, saying, “We are aware that Homeland Security recently confirmed plans to expand ICE operations in Chicago. While there is no confirmation that these operations will extend to Rockford, we recognize it is a possibility. And, we also recognize the fear and uncertainty this news may cause.”

“It’s also important to be clear – the Rockford Police Department follows the Illinois Trust Act. We do not participate in ICE raids, nor will we,” the statement continued. “To our immigrant neighbors: please know this — you are valued, you are cared for and you are an important part of who we are.”

Rockford Police Chief Carla Redd also released a statement, saying, “It is important for our community to know that the enforcement of civil immigration laws is the responsibility of federal agencies, such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as stated in the Illinois Trust Act. Our duty is to protect and serve everyone in our community, regardless of immigration status.”

The TRUST Act, signed by former Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) in 2017, prevents state law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

According to ICE, those arrested as part of the nationwide effort had criminal histories, including sexual assault, robbery, drug and weapons charges, and domestic violence, the agency said.

The Department of Homeland Security conducted operations in Rockford in mid-June, but it has not been confirmed whether the agents were from ICE.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said federal troops will be coming to Chicago as part of an immigration enforcement effort, but did not give a timeline for the operation.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker held a news conference later that day, saying the head of the Illinois State Police had received a call from Customs and Border Protection’s chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino on Saturday.

The governor said the White House began positioning armed federal agents and military vehicles at the Great Lakes Naval Base on Monday.

“Unidentifiable agents in unmarked vehicles with masks are planning to raid Latino communities and say they’re targeting violent criminals,” Pritzker said, adding that he expects to see videos of “them hauling away mothers and fathers traveling to work or picking up their kids from school.”

“We have reason to believe that [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,” he continued.

Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said undocumented immigrants should “prioritize your health, mental wellness, and safety above all else.”

Pritzker characterized undocumented immigrants in Chicago as “law-abiding individuals who pay taxes and pay taxes and contribute to the communities.”

“In other words, they’re following the law,” Pritzker said.

U.S. federal law (8 U.S. Code § 1325), makes it illegal for someone to enter the United States at any time or place between an official port of entry.

Pritzker also said he believed “Trump and his team will be looking for any excuse to put active duty military on our streets, supposedly to protect ICE,” and said “We have reason to believe that the Trump administration has already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment in Illinois.”

Chicago is home to a large population of undocumented immigrants, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with Trump‘s mass deportation agenda.

The Governor said the Chicago surge is expected to last 30 days.",https://www.mystateline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/09/Rockford-welcome-sign.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-04 14:57:54.265024

Training to become an immigration judge Traditionally, immigration judges are appointed by the Attorney General and serve within the Department of Justice’s executive office for immigration review (EOIR).
Until recently, the qualifications for immigration judges included admission to a state bar, several years of post bar legal experience and demonstrated knowledge of immigration law.
But the administration said it would waive those requirements to allow military lawyers to fill the roles.
There are also no standard operating procedures or guidelines for how military lawyers should operate as immigration judges.","There is no precedent in peacetime for using military lawyers in civilian courtrooms — the last time U.S. military officers exercised judicial authority over civilians was under martial law during World War II, a practice the Supreme Court later ruled unconstitutional. Now, the Pentagon’s plan to use its military lawyers as immigration judges is setting a precedent with no clear limits that could fundamentally reshape civil-military relations in the United States.

“Whatever happens here is going to establish some precedent for future administrations, and if we normalize using military resources to address civilian government staffing challenges, which is ultimately what this is, we are fundamentally altering the nature of American governance,” Ira Rushing, an associate at the Tully Rinckey law firm, told Federal News Network.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week approved a plan to detail up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department as temporary immigration judges — an effort aimed at easing a backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has grown in recent years.

Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell told Federal News Network the Defense Department is currently identifying Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details; these attorneys will “augment existing resources to help further combat a backlog of cases by presiding over immigration hearings.” These military lawyers will serve as immigration judges for about six months, but their assignments can be renewed.

It is unclear what authority the DoD is using to lend its attorneys to the Justice Department. Rushing said the administration appears to be relying on Title 10 authority, which allows the Defense Department to provide support to civilian agencies as long as it does not violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of active-duty military forces for domestic law enforcement.

At the same time, there are other laws, such as the Economy Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act, that allow interagency support.

But immigration judges are not just federal employees performing administrative functions — they hold judicial power that directly affects individual liberty interests.

“There’s really never been this question of military personnel themselves serving in a quasi-judicial civilian role, I know what the mindset is — we want to use these military lawyers to do these administrative law roles and that’s not law enforcement. It’s just administrative law. But it really threads this needle by arguing that adjudicating civil immigration cases doesn’t constitute law enforcement, because immigration enforcement itself involves detention, removal proceedings and determinations that directly affect personal liberty,” Rushing said.

“While the immigration proceedings are technically civil rather than criminal, the Supreme Courts recognize this quasi-criminal nature of immigration proceedings, given the severe consequences. We are theoretically doing administrative law, but the effect is in law enforcement,” he added.

In addition, if the National Guard and Reserve members are involuntarily called up for this duty under Title 10 rather than Title 32, it is unclear what funds would be used to pay them.

“Can you have an appropriation under Title 10 that pays National Guardsmen to act as a civilian judicial officer? I don’t know. Those are going to be some questions that will probably be flashed out pretty heavily here in the next couple of weeks,” Rushing said.

There is also the issue of judicial independence that comes from putting military officers into judicial roles. U.S. judges are supposed to be free from outside pressures and make impartial decisions based solely on facts and law, but military lawyers remain in a chain of command that could expose them to unlawful command influence.

“What’s going to happen to a Judge Advocate who makes several decisions in favor of the people going through the immigration proceeding? What’s going to be the effect on their career if they make a bunch of decisions that this administration doesn’t like?” Rushing said.

In the end, detailing military judges to the Justice Department is a decision the administration has every right to pursue, Rushing said. But ultimately the question is not whether this is legal or practical — it is whether this is the precedent the U.S. wants to set for the relationship between military and civilian authority.

“Using military officers to adjudicate civil proceedings involving lawful permanent residents in some cases, and asylum seekers on U.S. soil during peacetime — it’s just going to be the Wild West. We’ve always maintained this clear separation between military and civilian spheres. And that’s not tradition. It’s fundamental to democratic governance. But once you start using military personnel to perform what are inherently civilian governmental functions, you erode that boundary,” Rushing said.

“I think a lot of concern from some people is, ‘Today it’s immigration judges. Tomorrow, could it be administrative law judges for social security claims? What about the tax court?’ The principle being established here that military personnel can be deployed, essentially to address civilian judicial backlogs, really has no natural limiting principle. And how does this look internationally? We’ve always criticized other nations for military involvement in civilian justice systems,” he added.

Training to become an immigration judge

Traditionally, immigration judges are appointed by the Attorney General and serve within the Department of Justice’s executive office for immigration review (EOIR).

Until recently, the qualifications for immigration judges included admission to a state bar, several years of post bar legal experience and demonstrated knowledge of immigration law.

“A lot of people say immigration law is second only to tax law in its complexities,” Rushing said.

Immigration judges are part of the excepted service, meaning they fall outside the competitive civil service system, but they still require specific qualifications and vetting.

But the administration said it would waive those requirements to allow military lawyers to fill the roles.

“Some people have said it is like going to a cardiologist for hip surgery,” Rushing said.

Over the course of their careers, military lawyers usually gain experience as prosecutors, trial counsel and defense attorneys — they handle cases ranging from minor offense such as absence without leave to serious crimes including sexual assault, murder or espionage. They also get experience practicing international and operational law. But they get little to no exposure to immigration law during their military service.

“You theoretically could get all of the training and instruction you needed, but it’s going to be really hard, because a lot of these people who are really good at immigration law have been doing it for years and years and years, and most military lawyers typically do a little bit of everything, but really not immigration,” Rushing said.

Parnell said the Defense Department is “committed to continuing our support for our interagency partners, bringing the skills and dedication of America’s service members and civil servants to deliver justice, restore order and protect the American people.”

What’s next

Rushing said it is unclear who would even have standing to challenge this decision in courts.

“We would have to wait for, say, an asylum seeker to not like their decision and sue based on the lack of qualifications of the judge that handled their case,” he said.

“If you think of this purely as a federal administrative personnel move, I don’t know if we’ll see it in the courts as quickly as we’ll see it just having to kind of play out in a fumbling sort of manner over the next few weeks,” Rushing added.

There are also no standard operating procedures or guidelines for how military lawyers should operate as immigration judges. “It’s going to fall on a lot of military lawyers themselves to figure out what it looks like,” Rushing said.

The lawsuit alleges the president’s unilateral deployment of National Guard troops from other states to patrol the city without the mayor’s consent violates the Home Rule Act, which gives Washington residents control over local affairs, with Congress retaining ultimate authority over the district.

The lawsuit, filed by city Attorney General Brian Schwalb, argues that President Donald Trump “disregarded Congress’s decision, half a century ago, to afford the residents of the District ‘the powers of local self-government,’ including the authority to police the District as they see fit. In so doing, he has run roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy—that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.”

“No American city should have the US military — particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement — policing its streets,” Schwalb said in a statement to NBC News. “It’s DC today, but could be any other city tomorrow. We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.”

The city’s lawsuit comes the same week that a federal judge ruled the federal government illegally deployed National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in June in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, the federal law that generally prohibits the U.S. military from acting as domestic law enforcement.

At the same time as the city is pushing back on the deployment of the National Guard, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser issued an order Tuesday to formalize the city’s cooperation with federal law enforcement, including the FBI, the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

The agreement, known as 287(g), was signed by the City Manager and Police Chief without a commission vote.

Some commissioners expressed concern over potential retaliation from Gov. Ron DeSantis if they oppose the agreement.

Should it stay, or should it go?

The Tallahassee City Commission is biding its time in determining what to do about the immigration enforcement assistance agreement between the Tallahassee Police Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In a unanimous vote Sept. 3, commissioners followed the lead of Mayor John E. Dailey, who asked that the city wait for further judicial review in connection to an ongoing case in South Florida before moving forward with any resolutions.

That case questions whether Florida cities and towns are required to enter immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government. The specific agreement in question, known as 287(g), allows ""ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations to partner with state and local law enforcement to identify and remove criminal aliens who are amenable to removal from the U.S.,"" according to the ICE website.

The city's 287(g) agreement with the feds never reached commissioners but was instead signed by City Manager Reese Goad and Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell, who are both appointed.

The issue was a continuation from the commission's August meeting. Commissioners once again expressed concern over retaliation threatened by Gov. Ron DeSantis in regards to threats made to sitting local elected officials that they will be removed from office if they oppose the agreement.

""Diverting our law enforcement to help ICE ... take immigrants, who serve a major purpose in Florida, off the streets is not only inhumane but not necessary,"" said one public speaker, Sue Massa. ""I'd like to encourage the city to step up like they did during COVID and refuse and rescind the agreement they signed. Simple as that.""

City commissioners talk about commitment to community

Commissioner Jeremy Matlow kicked off discussion by claiming that what was happening with law enforcement was just profiling: ""I had a troubling conversation with a friend of mine since our last meeting. He got pulled over by the Florida Highway Patrol and the first question he was asked was, 'Are you a U.S. citizen?' ""

Matlow, also a mayoral candidate, added: ""To the threat of removal from office: Remove me. I'll be back. The governor didn't send me here.""

Commissioner Jack Porter piggybacked on Matlow's comments: ""We're the last line of defense in a state where we don't have our governor standing up for us, (nor) our attorney general and certainly not our federal government. If we allow ourselves to be silenced, we are allowing ... residents to be silenced.""

Commissioners Curtis Richardson and Dianne Williams-Cox had previously expressed hesitation on sending a message, pointing specifically to threats of losing their seats. While the hesitation remained, they said that it had nothing to do with their beliefs.

""I've taken a stand. I stood when the governor sought to remove black history from our schools. I stood at a press conference and declared that slavery was not good for us,"" Williams-Cox said. ""Don't tell me that I need to take a stand. I'm taking the stand but, unfortunately, I didn't see you standing with me.""

Dailey assured the community the commission would do the best they can.

""I'm extremely concerned about federal agents that are masked in other communities across this country, that are arresting people and carrying them away,"" Dailey said. ""We do have a responsibility to take care and protect this community, and we're going to do everything we possibly can.""","https://www.tallahassee.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/29/PTAL/83919803007-img-6477.jpg?crop=4031,2269,x0,y377&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-04 13:57:31.683081

“The president’s threats to send federal troops to Chicago are a clear blatant attack on the Black community and the immigrant community,” the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said in a statement.","CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago community leaders forged ahead Wednesday with preparations for the influx of National Guard troops and immigration agents the city is expecting, advising residents about their rights and organizing protests with fresh urgency.

Details about the operation are scant, but President Donald Trump has amped up the rhetoric about crime in the nation’s third-largest city, saying an immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment are planned despite the objections of local leaders and a federal court ruling that a similar deployment in Los Angeles was illegal.

The preparations seem familiar in the Democratic stronghold that’s often found itself in Trump’s crosshairs.

Still, leaders of schools, churches and community groups — particularly in the city’s immigrant enclaves and Black and Latino neighborhoods — say there’s increased gravity and coordination in preparing for the expected troop deployment and its accompanying deluge of attention.

Here’s how Chicago is preparing.

Protesters say they’re ready

Even without knowing what will unfold, Chicago’s energetic activist networks circulated “emergency protest” schedules, vowing to demonstrate within hours of federal intervention.

Organizers from immigrant rights groups, unions, clergy and anti-violence organizations said they’re working together more than ever.

“We have a stronger broader movement preparing to mobilize,” said Lawrence Benito, head of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “People still have to go about their lives. We’re making sure folks are prepared and we’re ready to respond.”

Immigrant communities have been on high alert since Trump took office for the second time in January and kicked off a nationwide immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.

Activists say they’ve already offered countless know-your-rights training sessions and have added hours for a hotline where people can report immigration arrests. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed an executive order reiterating the city’s longtime sanctuary policies, which bar local police from coordinating with federal immigration agents.

Trump’s plans for Chicago

Trump signaled this week that he’s ready to order federal authorities to mobilize and combat crime in Chicago despite the objections of Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Trump hasn’t given a timeline for the Chicago operation, and he muddied the outlook again on Wednesday by suggesting New Orleans as the next possible location.

Trump’s administration indicated that it would soon expand immigration operations in Chicago, and the Department of Homeland Security requested limited logistical support at the Naval Station Great Lakes outside the city.

The administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C., where he has direct legal control. His administration plans to appeal the California deployment ruling.

Trump has often singled out Chicago and other Democrat-led cities. Recently, his administration started playing up the city’s daily crime log, including using shootings over Labor Day weekend as justification for sending in troops.

“I want to go into Chicago and I have this incompetent governor,” Trump said Wednesday.

He and Pritzker have traded barbs for days about the issue. Pritzker, a two-term governor and frequent Trump critic, has been floated as a possible 2028 presidential contender.

“I can’t live in a fantasy land where I pretend Trump is not tearing this country apart for personal greed and power,” Pritzker posted Wednesday on X. At an event later in the day, he told reporters his office had not received any additional information from the federal government.

There has been little outward support for Trump’s plans in Chicago, with only a handful of Republicans and conservative leaders saying they’d welcome the intervention.

Johnson and Pritzker have repeatedly pointed to the city’s drop in crime, and asked for more federal funding for prevention programs instead.

Echoing a trend in other major U.S. cities, Chicago’s violent crime has dropped significantly overall, though it remains a persistent issue in parts of the city.

A damper on Mexican Independence Day celebrations

Chicago is home to a large and thriving Mexican community, and the threat of the troop deployment and immigration crackdown has put a damper on Mexican Independence Day celebrations planned over the next two weeks.

Organizers acknowledged the threat of immigration arrests might keep some people at home, but they’re boosting security measures and inviting more allies. It’s a similar tactic that activists tried for annual May Day protests, when fears about public gatherings were also high.

Teresa Fraga, who is organizing an event in the city’s heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood, said the event has hired more security, lawyers and neighborhood patrols.

“It’s a dark cloud that is hanging over our heads,” she said. “But we are planning a safe event.”

Worries in Black neighborhoods

Worries are also high in many of the city’s Black neighborhoods, where organizations have been busy advising residents about what their rights are should they interact with law enforcement.

Dozens of Black churches plan to take part in “Resistance Sunday” this weekend, to disseminate information about legal rights during traffic stops and other encounters.

“We need resources, not troops,” said the Rev. Marshall Hatch, a prominent civil rights activist. “We’re not interested in this charade of troops.”

Johnson and other Black mayors have called Trump’s targeting of Democratic cities racist. And Trump has often used racist narratives about urban crime when talking about the unprecedented deployment of troops in the nation’s capital.

“The president’s threats to send federal troops to Chicago are a clear blatant attack on the Black community and the immigrant community,” the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said in a statement.

City schools prepare

Chicago’s public school system suggested that families create phone trees to quickly share information and organize walk-to-school groups to “provide safety in numbers.”

“We know that the potential of increased federal presence is creating anxiety and fear about safety at school and safety within the broad community,” Chicago Public Schools wrote in a letter to parents.

What Happens Next The order blocking the Trump administration from withholding about $12 billion in foreign aid sets up an accelerated legal battle.","A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has barred the Trump administration from unilaterally withholding billions of dollars in foreign assistance funds approved by Congress, delivering a major legal setback to the president's efforts to scale back overseas aid.

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that the administration's refusal to spend roughly $12 billion in congressionally appropriated funds likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which governs how federal agencies make decisions. The decision follows months of litigation over whether the White House can delay or block spending approved under the 2024 appropriations law, much of which is set to expire on September 30 if not obligated.

Why It Matters

The case goes beyond a fight over foreign aid dollars. At stake is the balance of power between Congress and the presidency, with the courts asked to decide whether a president can effectively override appropriations by letting funds expire. The ruling could set a precedent for how future administrations handle contested spending.

It also carries immediate consequences. Billions in U.S. foreign aid, relied on by nonprofits and global health programs, hang in the balance, with potential ripple effects for American influence abroad and the survival of organizations that depend on federal funding.

What To Know

The ruling came after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sent the matter back to Ali for consideration of statutory claims under the APA.

An earlier injunction based on constitutional separation-of-powers grounds had been struck down by a divided appeals panel, which found plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to bring constitutional claims.

The panel, however, amended its opinion in late August to clarify that lawsuits alleging violations of appropriations statutes could proceed.

The dispute centers on roughly billion in foreign aid appropriated in recent years, though the immediate fight involves about $12 billion set to lapse at the end of this fiscal year.

Plaintiffs include nonprofit groups such as the Global Health Council and the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, which argue that withholding the funds harms their operations and violates the law.

Ali sided with those organizations, writing that the administration's decision ""is contrary to law in violation of the APA"" and ""arbitrary and capricious"" because it provided no rationale for disregarding Congress' directives or the reliance interests of organizations that depend on the aid.

Pocket Rescission

President Donald Trump has framed the move as part of a broader effort to rein in government spending and realign U.S. foreign policy priorities.

On January 20, he issued ""Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning U.S. Foreign Aid,"" pausing U.S. development assistance and directing agencies to review all programs.

More recently, he asked Congress to rescind $4.9 billion in funds set to expire this year, including $3.2 billion from the 2024 appropriations law.

The White House has relied on a maneuver known as a ""pocket rescission,"" under which the president proposes cuts late in the fiscal year, betting that funds could expire before lawmakers act. Russ Vought, Trump's budget director, has described the tactic as similar to a ""pocket veto.""

Critics, however, including the Government Accountability Office, members of Congress—including Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine and Mike Rounds of South Dakota—say the approach effectively allows the president to exercise a line-item veto—a power the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in 1998.

Likely Appeal

The Department of Justice is expected to appeal Ali's ruling and could ask the Supreme Court to intervene if it continues to lose in lower courts. The administration has argued that it requires clarity on its obligations before September deadlines for notifying Congress and negotiating agreements with foreign governments.

The stakes extend beyond the current fiscal year. If upheld, Ali's order could restrict the administration's ability to use timing strategies to withhold spending in future budget cycles.

What People Are Saying

U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, in his ruling on September 3: ""This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch's decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds.""

The judge emphasized that, absent congressional action to rescind funds, the executive branch ""may not disregard a statutory mandate to spend funds simply because of policy objections,"" and he concluded: ""Defendants have given no justification to displace the bedrock expectation that Congress's appropriations must be followed.""

What Happens Next

The order blocking the Trump administration from withholding about $12 billion in foreign aid sets up an accelerated legal battle. For aid groups, the decision provides temporary relief but not certainty.

The Justice Department is expected to appeal to the D.C. Circuit and, if necessary, the Supreme Court. Because the fiscal year ends on September 30, the administration may also seek emergency relief to prevent the funds from being obligated before then.

At the same time, Trump has asked Congress to rescind $4.9 billion of the aid, including $3.2 billion from the 2024 law. If lawmakers act, those amounts would be permanently cut. If not, agencies must commit the funds quickly or risk losing them when they expire. The outcome will determine not only the fate of this year's appropriations but also the scope of presidential power over spending in the future.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2715911/trump-foreign-aid-cuts-overturned.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 13:57:44.360356

During the visit, Carbajal toured the facility and engaged directly with ICE officials, raising critical questions about the well-being of the individuals detained at the facility. He inquired about access to adequate food and water, availability of legal counsel, and the process for medical evaluations. The inspection was part of the Congressman’s ongoing commitment to holding ICE officials accountable.

“Residents across the Central Coast have voiced serious concerns about ICE’s activities in our community,” said Rep. Carbajal. “As their representative in Congress, I conducted an inspection of the Santa Maria ICE facility as part of my oversight responsibilities. I met with facility officials to directly raise the issues my constituents have been calling and writing to me about. While our conversation was productive, this is by no means a ‘one-and-done’ visitation. As long as ICE continues to pursue aggressive tactics in our community, I will continue to demand answers and push for accountability to ensure that detainees are treated fairly and afforded their full constitutional rights.”

The Santa Maria ICE processing facility is where individuals taken into custody are processed for potential immigration violations. These centers handle individuals who may be subject to deportation, are awaiting immigration court proceedings, or are being held for other immigration-related reasons, such as during targeted operations.

Carbajal is a leader in Congress in pushing for commonsense immigration reform and holding federal immigration enforcement officers accountable to the communities they serve.

In June 2025, Carbajal co-sponsored the No Secret Police Act, which would require law enforcement officers and agents of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting individuals and to ban them from using home-made, non-tactical masks.

In July 2025, Carbajal co-led the introduction of the bipartisan Dignity Act, a bipartisan bill that would introduce reforms into our country’s immigration system. The bill includes commonsense reforms to legal status and protections for undocumented immigrants, border security investments, and improved asylum and visa processes.

In the same month, Carbajal reintroduced the Fight for the American Dream Act, legislation that allows participants of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program to serve in the United States military and provides them a pathway toward U.S. citizenship after their service.

In June 2025, Carbajal introduced the Protect Patriot Parents Act, which would make parents of U.S. military servicemembers eligible for Lawful Permanent Resident status, preventing potential deportations or separations of military families.",https://www.edhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ice-facility-santa-maria-gmaps.png,N,,2025-09-04 13:57:28.009260

Sues Trump Administration Over Deployment of National Guard - The New York Times,"Campbell Robertson, www.nytimes.com, campbell-robertson",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/us/dc-trump-national-guard-suit.html,"The District of Columbia sued the Trump administration in federal court on Thursday, challenging the president’s deployment of National Guard troops in the city.
The lawsuit by Washington comes two days after a federal judge in California ruled that the president’s decision to send National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles was illegal.
“We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.” Unlike in states, where governors have considerable authority over the deployment of the state guard, the D.C. National Guard is under the president’s direct command.
The suit is the second the city has filed against the administration since Mr. Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the city.
The first, filed days after the declaration, challenged the authority of the administration to take command of the D.C. police.","The District of Columbia sued the Trump administration in federal court on Thursday, challenging the president’s deployment of National Guard troops in the city.

Thousands of Guard members from the city and seven states were mobilized last month as part of a sweeping federal intervention that has also brought hundreds of federal law enforcement agents to the city’s streets.

The intervention, which President Trump has said is a response to a “public safety emergency,” has prompted criticism and protests from many people in the city who say the president wants to use his power of the federal enclave to roll back the city’s limited self-governance and punish it for policies he objects to.

The lawsuit by Washington comes two days after a federal judge in California ruled that the president’s decision to send National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles was illegal.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that the lawsuit was “nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents and visitors — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.”

Even as the Guard deployments have faced local pushback and legal challenges, Mr. Trump has been promising to send troops to other cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Like Washington and Los Angeles, Baltimore and Chicago are led by mayors who are Black and are Democrats.

“No American city should have the US military — particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement — policing its streets,” Brian Schwalb, D.C.’s attorney general, said in a statement. “We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.”

Unlike in states, where governors have considerable authority over the deployment of the state guard, the D.C. National Guard is under the president’s direct command.

But the suit argues that the deployment of the local guard for public safety reasons, and without the mayor’s consent, violated Washington’s autonomy under the 52-year-old Home Rule Act.

The suit also makes an argument similar to the one the judge in California based his ruling on: that the deployment of National Guard troops in the city runs “roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy — that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.”

Mr. Trump had made clear that such a role was his intention, saying on Aug. 11 that he was calling out the Guard to “reestablish law, order and public safety” in the city. Since then, even as federal law enforcement officers have been involved in hundreds of arrests and immigration agents have been detaining hundreds of Washington residents deemed to be in the country illegally, the National Guard troops have been posted at Metro stations and around city landmarks. Some soldiers have been seen picking up trash.

The suit is the second the city has filed against the administration since Mr. Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the city.

The first, filed days after the declaration, challenged the authority of the administration to take command of the D.C. police. The city appeared likely to prevail, given the judge’s comments during the initial hearing, but that ended with the U.S. Attorney General agreeing to take a more limited role in compelling local police to cooperate on certain tasks.

Published by the Prison Policy Initiative, the report places Tennessee in the top five states for ICE arrests per capita, with the ranking even higher for arrests occurring inside jails.

Knox County has seen particularly sharp increases, with the number of people held for ICE rising from six in January to nearly 50 by April.

Bertram noted that non-citizens are more likely to face jail time for minor offenses, such as driving without a license. “There are a number of ways immigrants can end up in the jail system for offenses that might be considered minor, but that authorities could treat as serious enough for ICE to intervene,” she said.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January requiring ICE to partner with local and state law enforcement, based on a determination by the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

ICE contacted Hudspeth in early August to set up a meeting with city leaders to discuss the agency’s 287(g) program. It describes the program as protecting the U.S. “through the arrest and removal of aliens who undermine the safety of our nation’s communities and the integrity of U.S. immigration laws.”

Today, Republicans tried to make Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-Newark) into the 29th – and they failed.
“This whole situation, this whole ordeal, has been a political attack against me since the day I went to Delaney Hall,” she said.
Republicans in Congress, however, didn’t wait for the legal battle to come to a resolution before moving ahead with an effort to reprimand McIver.
McIver said she hasn’t spoken with the defectors personally, but she did send notes of thanks.","In the long history of the U.S. House of Representatives, only 28 members have been formally censured by a full vote of the House. Today, Republicans tried to make Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-Newark) into the 29th – and they failed.

A resolution supported by most House Republicans would have censured McIver for her conduct during a scuffle last spring at a Newark immigrant detention center, and removed her from her seat on the House Homeland Security Committee. But unexpectedly, a Democratic effort to kill the resolution succeeded, with five Republican House members voting in support of a motion to table and two voting “present.”

(Every present Democrat supported the motion to table, which passed 215-207; one of the Republicans who voted “yes” later said that was a mistake, but it was too late to change his vote.)

The outcome means that the resolution, spearheaded by Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins, won’t even come up for a proper vote at all, and McIver will remain uncensured and a member of all of her committees.

McIver said that the outcome came as something of a surprise to her, and that she will remain just as defiantly opposed to the immigration policies put forward by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans as she always has been.

“This whole situation, this whole ordeal, has been a political attack against me since the day I went to Delaney Hall,” she said. “I continue to be a critic of this administration, and I think they just want to find different ways to bully me and intimidate me while I’m here. I’m not going to back down.”

The Newark congresswoman, first elected just last year, became a Republican target after a May 9 incident at the Delaney Hall immigrant detention center, at which McIver and two of her House colleagues were conducting an oversight visit. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who had attempted to accompany the three congressmembers on the visit, was arrested for trespassing, setting off a brief scuffle involving McIver, federal immigration officers, and a group of assembled protesters.

The trespassing charges against Baraka were later dropped, but New Jersey’s controversial federal prosecutor, Alina Habba, instead charged McIver with assault, and later obtained an indictment from a grand jury. A trial has been set for November, but McIver has said the charges are politically motivated and asked a federal judge to dismiss the indictment.

Republicans in Congress, however, didn’t wait for the legal battle to come to a resolution before moving ahead with an effort to reprimand McIver. The resolution stated that McIver’s actions at Delaney Hall “do not reflect creditably on the House” and that her continued presence on the Homeland Security Committee, which has jurisdiction over immigrant detention facilities like Delaney Hall, “would represent a significant conflict of interest.”

“Censure is appropriate, and historically is well in line with what has happened,” Higgins said at a Homeland Security Committee meeting in June. “Generally, by this point, a member removes themselves from their committee involvement, certainly from a committee that has direct oversight in the arena wherein the charges are to be prosecuted.”

That was a viewpoint shared even by McIver’s three Republican colleagues in New Jersey, one of whom, Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis), chaired a subcommittee hearing in May that partially focused on criticizing McIver. “If you look at the video, she was pushing and shoving and physically involved, and that’s not acceptable,” Van Drew said prior to today’s vote.

Some congressional Republicans had floated even more extreme punishments such as expelling McIver from the House, but that was never a realistic possibility given that expulsion requires a two-thirds majority and Democrats – including, critically, House Democratic leadership – were staunchly opposed to any effort to punish her.

And they were joined, unexpectedly, by a small cohort of Republicans who said that they wanted to let other processes play out before resorting to censuring McIver and removing her from a committee; “I think it’s best to let Ethics Committee finish its report,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-Nebraska) told Politico. McIver said she hasn’t spoken with the defectors personally, but she did send notes of thanks.

“I do want to thank those Republicans that sided with us to see that this was wrong, and this should be a matter of [the Ethics Committee] and letting this case play out,” she said.

The Human Rights Coordinator for Barnstable County says there has been a growing number of inquiries related to immigration and national origin received by the Barnstable County Human Rights Advisory Commission.

As of July 1st, 24-percent of the Commission’s intakes involve immigrants, up from about ten percent in the past two years.

According to the report, many of the cases involve public harassment.

Common themes include fear surrounding immigration enforcement activity, reports of aggressive enforcement tactics, family separation, and stress caused by shifts in Temporary Protected Status.

“We continue to hear from families who are anxious about enforcement activity and changes in immigration status. These fears affect daily life — from parents worried about going to work to students uncertain about attending school,” said Leslie Dominguez-Santos, Human Rights Coordinator for Barnstable County.

Illegal immigration enforcement has been a top priority for the second Trump Administration. An ICE operation in May resulted in about 1,500 immigrants taken into custody across Massachusetts, including on Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard.

On the Cape, there was particular community concern this summer in Falmouth, prompting their Select Board to release this statement on July 1st:

The Town of Falmouth is committed to enabling our residents, businesses, employees, and visitors the opportunity to live, work, and experience our town’s unique charm today, tomorrow, and for future generations. We strive to be an inclusive, welcoming, equitable, and diverse community, and we take seriously our responsibilities for economic prosperity and the health, safety, and wellbeing of residents and visitors.

Trust, including trust that constitutional and civil rights will be upheld by all law enforcement officials, is foundational to the kind of community we strive to be. Our local police work diligently to build trust and relationships – acting as guardians first, enforcers only when necessary.

In contrast, some of the tactics employed by federal immigration and law enforcement officials operating in Falmouth in recent weeks has contributed to a climate of fear that undermines the work that our town staff, including our police department, do each day.",https://www.capecod.com/wp-content/uploads/NWS_County-Seal_BF012423.png,N,,2025-09-04 11:58:45.696405

And third, the Supreme Court has frowned on recent presidents who relied on old laws to justify bold, new, costly regulations.

The appellate judges put their decision on hold until the Supreme Court rules.","President Trump has asked the Supreme Court for a fast-track ruling that he has broad power acting on his own to impose tariffs on products coming from countries around the world.

Despite losing in the lower courts, Trump and his lawyers have reason to believe they can win in the Supreme Court. The six conservative justices believe in strong presidential power, particularly in the area of foreign policy and national security.

In a three-page appeal filed Wednesday evening, they proposed the court decide by next Wednesday to grant review and to hear arguments in early November.

They said the lower court setbacks, unless quickly reversed, “gravely undermine the President’s ability to conduct real-world diplomacy and his ability to protect the national security and economy of the United States.”

They cited Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s warning about the potential for economic disruption if the court does not act soon.

“Delaying a ruling until June 26 could result in a scenario in which $750 billion-$1 trillion have already been collected and unwinding them could cause significant disruption,” he wrote.

Trump and his tariffs ran into three strong arguments in the lower courts.

First, the Constitution says Congress, not the president, has the power “to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,” and a tariff is an import tax.

Second, the 1977 emergency powers law that Trump relies on does not mention tariffs, taxes or duties, and no previous president has used it to impose tariffs.

And third, the Supreme Court has frowned on recent presidents who relied on old laws to justify bold, new, costly regulations.

So far, however, the so-called “major questions” doctrine has been used to restrict Democratic presidents, not Republicans.

Three years ago, the court’s conservative majority struck down a major climate change regulation proposed by Presidents Obama and Biden that could have transformed the electric power industry on the grounds it was not clearly based on the Clean Air Act of the 1970s.

Two years ago, the court in the same 6-3 vote struck down Biden’s plan to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in student loans. Congress had said the Education Department may “waive or modify” monthly loan payments during a national emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic, but it did not say the loans may be forgiven, the court said. Its opinion noted the “staggering” cost could be more than $500 billion.

The impact of Trump’s tariffs figures to be at least five times greater, a federal appeals court said last week in ruling them illegal.

In a 7-4 vote, the federal circuit court cited all three arguments in ruling Trump had exceeded his legal authority.

“We conclude Congress, in enacting the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not give the president wide-ranging authority to impose tariffs,” they said.

But the outcome was not a total loss for Trump. The appellate judges put their decision on hold until the Supreme Court rules. That means Trump’s tariffs are likely to remain in effect for many months.

Trump’s lawyers were heartened by the dissent written by Judge Richard Taranto and joined by three others.

He argued that presidents are understood to have extra power when confronted with foreign threats to the nation’s security.

Taranto called the 1977 law “an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm” that said the president may “regulate” the “importation” of dangerous products including drugs coming into this country.

Citing other laws from that era, he said Congress understood that tariffs and duties are a “common tool of import regulation.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/784d34a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4953x2600+0+351/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F65%2Fa4%2F52db667641ccbfcecb3d8a35d406%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2208185431,N,,2025-09-04 14:57:45.124215

Final Thought This tragic episode reminds us of the vital role immigration attorneys play in defending constitutional rights, even beyond U.S. borders.","In a development that has ignited global scrutiny and domestic legal controversy, the Trump administration recently authorized a U.S. military strike that killed 11 individuals aboard a speedboat in the Caribbean Sea, allegedly tied to Venezuela’s “criminal underworld”. The administration claims the boat was a “narco-terrorist” vessel operating under the umbrella of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the United States designated a terrorist organization earlier this year (Reuters, 9/3/25).

President Trump shared video footage of the strike on his social platform Truth Social, calling it “an incredible win” for national security. But legal experts and immigration advocates are raising serious concerns: not only about the facts of the case but about the precedent this strike sets for the use of lethal force in non-combat, non-judicial international scenarios.

Extrajudicial or Justified? Legal Analysis of the Caribbean Strike

While the Trump administration insists the strike was part of an expanded anti-narcotics campaign, seasoned analysts argue the operation may have violated both U.S. and international law.

According to Reuters, international maritime law allows for the interdiction of vessels suspected of drug trafficking, but lethal force is reserved only for self-defense or under formal wartime engagement. None of the facts released by the administration demonstrate that the 11 passengers posed an imminent threat to U.S. forces or civilians.

“It is unclear whether there was even a lawful basis for targeting these individuals,” said a former senior official at the Department of Justice. “This wasn’t a battlefield. This was open water. Drug smuggling—however serious—is not justification for a drone strike without judicial oversight.”

The U.N. Charter and Law of the Sea Convention, to which the U.S. is a signatory in principle, emphasize due process and the right to life—even in cases involving suspected criminal conduct on the high seas.

Were They Smugglers, or Migrants?

Adding to the confusion is the tactical implausibility of the administration’s account. Why, legal analysts ask, would 11 people be required aboard a speedboat transporting narcotics? Most drug operations rely on minimal crews to limit exposure and cost. The presence of such a large number of individuals suggests a different possibility: that the vessel may have been carrying migrants, not drugs.

“From a migration law perspective, 11 people on a small vessel is consistent with human smuggling, not narcotics,” said Brad Bernstein from Spar & Bernstein. “We’ve represented countless clients who’ve taken similar risks in hopes of reaching safety and reunifying with family. Those individuals deserved arrest, screening, and legal process, not death.”

The lack of confirmed evidence, the absence of verified contraband, and the absence of survivors to testify raise the specter of a politically motivated strike, intended more for show than substance. Even the authenticity of the video Trump shared is being questioned by news analysts, though Reuters has yet to verify any manipulation.

Expanding Executive Power Without Oversight

This event highlights the growing trend of executive overreach in the name of national security, particularly where immigration enforcement intersects with the use of military force.

The Trump administration has previously broadened the legal definition of “enemy combatant” to include drug cartels and smuggling organizations, creating a legal gray zone where constitutional protections are suspended. Legal scholars warn this could open the door to further unilateral military action against civilians, without oversight or accountability.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the strike, saying the U.S. could have interdicted the boat, but chose a “deterrent” approach instead. While the desire to combat transnational crime is understandable, the failure to follow arrest and prosecution procedures should alarm every legal professional and every American.

Human Rights, Immigration, and the Role of Attorneys

For immigration lawyers at Spar & Bernstein, this strike is part of a troubling shift toward the criminalization and militarization of migration. Increasingly, we see undocumented individuals—many of whom are longtime residents, parents, and contributors to our communities—being cast as criminals or terrorists.

“Whether these 11 people were migrants, asylum seekers, or wrongfully accused, they deserved due process,” says Brad. “We are here to protect the rights of the undocumented and to ensure that no one is punished without evidence, without trial, and without justice.”

If your loved one is missing, detained abroad, or possibly affected by this strike or similar military action, our office is prepared to investigate, advocate, and provide legal relief where possible. We have decades of experience litigating complex immigration and humanitarian cases—and we stand firm in the belief that the law must serve people, not politics.

Final Thought

This tragic episode reminds us of the vital role immigration attorneys play in defending constitutional rights, even beyond U.S. borders. While the political rhetoric may be harsh and the military power vast, the law remains clear: due process is not optional. It’s essential.

For those with questions about family members missing at sea, under deportation review, or affected by recent changes to immigration enforcement protocols, we encourage you to contact the attorneys at Spar & Bernstein today.

The letter urges the ACHPR to intervene by issuing a formal resolution in response to the United States of America’s unlawful transfer of migrants and asylum seekers to third countries in Africa. This was done under secretive bilateral agreements and without regard for any claims they may have to protection under refugee and human rights treaties. At least 20 migrants have already been transferred to South Sudan, Eswatini and Rwanda, and Uganda has recently signed an agreement with the United States to begin accepting more migrants expelled from the U.S. imminently.

Bella Mosselmans, Director of the Council said:

“These illegal transfers violate international and African human rights law and expose forcibly expelled migrants to arbitrary detention and serious abuses of human rights. The United States cannot outsource its obligations under international law, and African governments should resist complicity in these unlawful practices.”

As more agreements are reportedly being negotiated, the Council welcomes the latest press release from the ACHPR strongly calling for transparency of any agreements made with the United States and humane migration policies based in dignity, solidarity and justice.

The Council and its partners are now calling on the Commission to issue a resolution that firmly protects and upholds the rights of migrants and asylum seekers subject to U.S. agreements with African countries, and urges African Union member states not to enter into similar, new agreements that facilitate the unlawful expulsion of refugees and migrants from the United States of America.

Anwen Hughes, Senior Director of Legal Strategy, Refugee Programs at Human Rights First said:

“The Commission’s recent statement is a vital step, but we urge them to go further at this critical moment. With potentially hundreds more migrants expected to be transferred to the region under unlawful U.S. agreements, it is more important than ever for civil society, human rights authorities and states around the world to make clear that adherence to human rights law and due process is a legal imperative and essential to the rule of law globally.

Mr O’Flaherty said: “External co-operation on asylum and migration needs to be designed and implemented with great care, so as not to put human rights at risk.
First, states should adopt a precautionary approach by carrying out comprehensive human rights risk assessments, developing adequate risk mitigation strategies before engaging in external co-operation, and reviewing ongoing activities for their human rights impact.
This is crucial for their policies to be in line with their legal obligations to uphold human rights at home and internationally.”","Michael O’Flaherty made the remarks today as he published a new report, entitled Externalised asylum and migration policies and human rights law, which highlights the challenges that come with such arrangements.

In the absence of adequate human rights preconditions and safeguards, externalisation policies might result in people being subjected to torture or other ill-treatment, collective expulsions and arbitrary detention or may put their lives in danger, it stresses.

Such policies might also hinder effective access to asylum and deprive individuals of legal remedies.

Mr O’Flaherty said: “External co-operation on asylum and migration needs to be designed and implemented with great care, so as not to put human rights at risk.

“Governments developing externalisation policies in this field should carefully assess their potential negative impact on human rights, as such policies can expose women, men and children to significant risks of serious harm and protracted suffering.”

Today’s report identifies three areas in which risks are particularly acute: external processing of asylum claims; external return procedures, including through so-called “return hubs”; and the outsourcing of border control to other countries, some of which have a documented history of serious violations against people on the move.

In view of the human rights challenges that these measures may entail, the commissioner makes four main recommendations to Council of Europe member states, acting individually or collectively, including in the context of membership of the EU.

First, states should adopt a precautionary approach by carrying out comprehensive human rights risk assessments, developing adequate risk mitigation strategies before engaging in external co-operation, and reviewing ongoing activities for their human rights impact.

Second, they should define clear and non-negotiable principles that exclude any cooperation likely to put people at risk of human rights violations, and ensure that children and other vulnerable people are never subjected to externalised procedures.

Third, they should ensure adequate human rights preconditions and safeguards, adapted to each model of co-operation, including preventing the shifting of responsibility to other countries, ensuring no one is transferred to a partner country without a rigorous individual assessment, and limiting any use of return hubs to specific, clearly defined situations.

Fourth, they should strengthen transparency, monitoring and accountability, through robust agreements, transparent information-sharing, independent monitoring, and effective investigations of any alleged violations.

“As European states continue to pursue externalisation, the impact on the human rights and dignity of people on the move must not be overlooked,” Mr O’Flaherty said.

“Member states should assess the risks involved, commit to strong legal guarantees, and ensure scrutiny of their actions. This is crucial for their policies to be in line with their legal obligations to uphold human rights at home and internationally.”",https://www.irishlegal.com/storage/dc6f5fe539924c97331c0bc8cc20761b0e498ada.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 08:56:42.815787

“Omar might be subject to mandatory detention, meaning that the courts wouldn't even have the jurisdiction to review his case and review if he's eligible for bond,” Franco Salazar said.

“It's not just a theoretical concern. We're seeing DHS take this very same position with cases after July 8. So, our worry is rooted in recent practice that we've seen DHS employ, saying that aliens like Omar are not eligible for bond,” Monty said. “We disagree with that, and we have some legal arguments to show that. We think we're going to be able to show the judge that he is eligible for bond.”

The firm said they have taken up the case pro bono and the money raised by friends and family will be used to cover the bail and any expenses associated with the detention, including psychological support.

“We are worried about that because having to fight this case and be detained for a year is a tremendous amount of suffering, a tremendous hardship that causes many immigrants to just self-deport,” Monty said. “Omar's not going to self-deport and we're going to fight this and get some common sense to prevail on this issue.”

Politicians, journalists and commentators may legitimately hold different views on immigration and human rights. But mischaracterising how the law operates does a disservice to the public. Evidence should be the foundation of any debate, whatever view one takes on the policy questions.

Professor Başak Çalı, Bonavero Institute of Human Rights

Co-written by Victoria Adelmant, a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford and Resident at the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights, Professor Alice Donald of Middlesex University London, and Professor Başak Çalı of the Bonavero Institute, the study involved a systematic review of media reports that mentioned the ECHR between 1 January and 30 June 2025, analysing 379 news stories and opinion pieces.

Around 75% of these media reports focused on the ECHR’s role in immigration control – particularly appeals by foreign national offenders against deportation orders.

The report finds that immigration tribunal cases are frequently misreported. It highlights several high-profile examples of misleading coverage, including the so-called ‘chicken nuggets’ case – widely reported as the prevention of an individual’s deportation on the basis of his child’s dislike of foreign food, despite the decision not being based on this detail and having already been overturned. These misrepresentations, the authors argue, risk eroding public confidence in the legal system and are fuelling calls to leave the ECHR based on misleading portrayals of the role and operation of the ECHR in the UK.

Professor Donald said: 'Our findings show that much of the public discussion about the ECHR and immigration is not grounded in accurate reporting. For a debate of such importance, it is essential that arguments are based on evidence and a correct understanding of the law. Without this, public trust in the rule of law is placed at risk.'

Since 1980, the European Court of Human Rights has found against the UK in only 13 removal cases, and just four of those concerned family life. In relation to immigration rules more broadly, the Court has only three times ruled that the UK’s immigration rules violate the ECHR in the past 45 years.

Despite political and media focus on cases involving foreign national offenders, the report highlights that successful human rights-based appeals against deportation are rare. The latest available Home Office data on human rights-based appeals against deportation shows that in the 15 months to June 2021, the number of successful appeals amounted to only 0.73% of the total number of sentenced foreign national offenders.

Over a five-year period to June 2021, the number of successful human rights-based deportation appeals represented about 3.5% of the total number of deportations – and around 2.5% when looking at appeals based solely on private and family life grounds. These figures may be overestimates as they do not account for cases subsequently overturned by the Upper Tribunal.

Victoria Adelmant, Resident at the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights, said: 'The absence of systematically published Home Office data on human rights-based appeals against deportation makes it difficult to have a fully informed discussion on this topic. The Home Office has itself recently stated that its data surrounding foreign national offenders is not sufficiently robust. More regular and accessible publication of statistics and disaggregated information would enable more evidence-based public debate.'

The report clarifies that the ECHR does not grant non-citizens a right to live in the UK, and that states are free to set their own immigration policies. In deportation cases, two provisions of the Convention are typically invoked: Article 3 (prohibition of torture or inhuman treatment) or Article 8 (protection of private and family life).

The report shows that reliance on Article 8 in appeals against deportation gained significant attention in media coverage in the first half of 2025. But the possibility of claiming the right to protection of private and family life to prevent deportation is heavily restricted by legislation passed by Parliament. Under UK immigration law, deportation orders are mandatory for foreign national offenders sentenced to 12 months or more in prison, and exceptions apply only in very limited circumstances.

The report also demonstrates that judgments by the European Court of Human Rights against the UK are very rare, and that the Court has only rarely held that the UK government has violated human rights in its immigration-related decisions and policies.

Since 1980, the European Court of Human Rights has found against the UK in only 13 removal cases, and just four of those concerned family life. In relation to immigration rules more broadly, the Court has only three times ruled that the UK’s immigration rules violate the ECHR in the past 45 years.

The report warns that misconceptions about tribunal cases, the UK’s appeals system and the ECHR have real consequences: sensational coverage can fuel hostility towards migrants and human rights law, and, as senior judges have noted, can even put the safety of members of the judiciary at risk. The authors argue that responsible reporting, combined with better data, is vital for sustaining democratic debate on immigration policy.

Trump can impose tariffs under other laws, but those have more limitations on the speed and severity with which he could act.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took the fight over tariffs to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, asking the justices to rule quickly that the president has the power to impose sweeping import taxes under federal law.

The government called on the court to reverse an appeals court ruling that found most of President Donald Trump's tariffs are an illegal use of an emergency powers law.

It's the latest in a series of Trump administration appeals to a Supreme Court he helped shape, and one that is expected to put a centerpiece of the president's trade policy before the justices.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit left the tariffs in place for now, but the administration nevertheless called on the high court to intervene quickly in a petition filed electronically late Wednesday and provided to The Associated Press. It was expected to be formally docketed on Thursday.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to take up the case and hear arguments in early November.

""That decision casts a pall of uncertainty upon ongoing foreign negotiations that the President has been pursuing through tariffs over the past five months, jeopardizing both already negotiated framework deals and ongoing negotiations,"" he wrote. ""The stakes in this case could not be higher.""

But the stakes are also high for small businesses battered by tariffs and uncertainty, said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center.

""These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,"" he said.

The businesses have twice prevailed, once at a federal court focused on trade and again with the appeals court's 7-4 ruling.

Their lawsuit is one of several challenging the tariffs and erratic rollout that have shaken global markets, alienated U.S. trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.

But Trump has also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting new trade deals. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by late August, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.

Most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, did not let Trump usurp congressional power to set tariffs. The dissenters, though, said the law does allow the president to regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations.

The ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency: the tariffs first announced in April and the ones from February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over the decades, lawmakers have ceded authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.

Some Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, weren't covered by the appeals court ruling. It also does not include tariffs Trump imposed on China in his first term that were kept by Democratic President Joe Biden.

Trump can impose tariffs under other laws, but those have more limitations on the speed and severity with which he could act.

The government has argued that if the tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2b%2F86%2Fc29f4b5c436eb987b5e13b7c1484%2Fap25246583232253.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 11:59:13.497611

'City of the Big Shoulders' will stand strong against Trump So we’ll wait for Trump’s invasion.","CHICAGO — We here in this ""City of the Big Shoulders,"" this diverse, beautiful, complicated Midwestern metropolis, are preparing for a likely Donald Trump-ordered invasion of federal immigration agents, and possibly federal troops.

Yes, I used the word “invasion,” as it seems accurate. Nobody here wants them, not Chicago’s mayor, not the governor, not the people, not the advocacy groups that help immigrants or work to stop violence. If the feds or the soldiers come, they’ll be uninvited and unwelcome, and the pointlessness of their mission will be clear as a sunny late-summer day on the shore of Lake Michigan.

Folks in my adopted city don’t suffer fools lightly, and Trump is a fool who thinks he can flex his authoritarian muscles by sending troops onto the streets of Democratic-led cities. He is itching for chaos.

'They want to inflame something' – that's why Trump's targeting Chicago

As Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said recently of the rumored Trump administration plans to do in Chicago what they’ve already messily and dumbly done in Los Angeles and Washington, DC: “The intentions here are clear. Nothing to do with actually enforcing the law, nothing to do with actually keeping the peace. They want to inflame something. That is what they want.”

Like all good aspiring dictators, Trump knows if he kicks off trouble with his masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement goons or draws mass protests by militarizing the streets of a major city, it’ll give him an excuse to exert more federal power.

It’s not clever, it’s just the obvious play for a man who sees our democracy as an obstacle.

Trump keeps lying about violent crime as ICE goes after families

For whatever they’re worth in these days of Trumpian dishonesty, the facts are against the president in all regards. He can talk about ICE agents rounding up hardened criminals, but according to the most recent ICE data, 70% of those presently in ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody have no felony conviction.

Trump and his administration toadies can talk about “violent crime in big cities,” but crime in Chicago is down sharply, with a 32% drop in homicides and a nearly 40% drop in shootings.

If they come into my city, it will be for the noise and spectacle of it all, for the sole purpose of manipulating the masses with unfounded fear, not for any valiant reason or with the goal of making anyone’s life better.

Chicago cops won't help ICE, and they won't wear masks either

Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order that Chicago police ""will not cooperate with or enable any unlawful or unconstitutional actions undertaken by federal law enforcement.""

And you can bet the activists, faith leaders and concerned residents of Chicago will be organized and ready to peacefully place wrenches in the gears of Trump’s intimidation machine.

WBEZ Chicago recently quoted the Rev. Tyrone McGowan of Progressive Community Church on the city’s South Side: “We are rising, rising not because of soldiers and military occupation, but because of neighbors and organizers, health care professionals, educators, pastors and parents, young people and elders who decide to choose peace.”

Chicago's history of protest awaits Trump's federal invasion

Chicago has a long history of protest. In the 19th century, German and Irish immigrants were being blamed for crime – sound familiar? – and the city’s mayor targeted German saloon owners, leading German immigrants to rise up and clash with police on the Clark Street Bridge over the Chicago River.

The 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago led to days of riots involving police, soldiers and throngs of Vietnam War protesters.

In 2006, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Chicago to protest anti-immigration policies, and earlier this year, tens of thousands gathered downtown in Daley Plaza to rail against the Trump administration as part of the nationwide No Kings protest.

Simply put, Chicagoans know how to protest. The city has a massive network of well-organized activist groups and a baked-in intolerance for getting pushed around. People here look out for their neighbors, and they know a con artist like Trump when they see one.

The myth of Chicago as a violent hellscape is red meat for Trump's base

The president and his Republican Party have used Chicago as a culture-war cudgel for years on end, painting this city – my city – as some violent hellhole, statistics and objective reality be damned. We have problems, as do all cities and towns. Ours can seem worse, a multiplicative factor that comes with life in a place of 2.7 million people.

But among cities with a population of more than 100,000, Chicago isn’t even near the top 10 in violent crime per capita.

So Trump should take his fearmongering and false narratives and excuses to sic U.S. troops on U.S. citizens and use them somewhere really violent, like Little Rock, Arkansas, which is No. 4 on the most violent cities list.

'City of the Big Shoulders' will stand strong against Trump

So we’ll wait for Trump’s invasion. But let it be known loud and clear that this isn’t a city you mess with. This is the place that saw regular pizza and said, “Hey, what if we make that about 2 inches deeper and put more cheese on it?”

This is a place of hard work. A place where resistance runs deep.

The poet Carl Sandburg, in 1914, dubbed us “City of the Big Shoulders” and wrote, aptly, “I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer and say to them: Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.”

So we wait.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/14/USAT/84207745007-20250614-t-194738-z-710988999-rc-2-e-2-fai-1-p-5-k-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpprotestchicago.JPG?crop=5405,3041,x0,y281&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-04 11:59:04.411873

While the Supreme Court wrestles internally with some of the criticism, lower court judges are increasingly focused on their own safety.","WASHINGTON — Federal judges are frustrated with the Supreme Court for increasingly overturning lower court rulings involving the Trump administration with little or no explanation, with some worried the practice is undermining the judiciary at a sensitive time.

Some judges believe the Supreme Court, and in particular Chief Justice John Roberts, could be doing more to defend the integrity of their work as President Donald Trump and his allies harshly criticize those who rule against him and as violent threats against judges are on the rise.

In rare interviews with NBC News, a dozen federal judges — appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents, including Trump, and serving around the country — pointed to a pattern they say has recently emerged:

Lower court judges are handed contentious cases involving the Trump administration. They painstakingly research the law to reach their rulings. When they go against Trump, administration officials and allies criticize the judges in harsh terms. The government appeals to the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority.

And then the Supreme Court, in emergency rulings, swiftly rejects the judges’ decisions with little to no explanation.

Emergency rulings used to be rare. But their number has dramatically increased in recent years.

Ten of the 12 judges who spoke to NBC News said the Supreme Court should better explain those rulings, noting that the terse decisions leave lower court judges with little guidance for how to proceed. But they also have a new and concerning effect, the judges said, validating the Trump administration’s criticisms. A short rebuttal from the Supreme Court, they argue, makes it seem like they did shoddy work and are biased against Trump.

“It is inexcusable,” a judge said of the Supreme Court justices. “They don’t have our backs.”

All 12 judges spoke on condition that they not be identifiable, some because it is considered unwise to publicly criticize the justices who ultimately decide whether to uphold their rulings and others because of the risk of threats.

Judges are increasingly targeted, with some facing bomb threats, “swattings” and other harassment. Judges especially involved in high-profile cases — and their families — have reported receiving violent threats.

As of June, the U.S. Marshals Service, which protects judges, had reported more than 400 threat investigations this year. There has been a steady rise of such threats in recent years, from 224 in fiscal year 2021 to 457 in fiscal year 2023, according to congressional testimony given by the Marshals Service. An agency spokesman declined to provide updated numbers.

When judges issue rulings the Trump administration does not like, they are frequently targeted by influential figures in MAGA world and sometimes Trump himself, who called for a judge who ruled against him in a high-profile immigration case to be impeached. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller has said the administration is the victim of a “judicial coup.”

The judge who said the Supreme Court justices are behaving inexcusably has received threats of violence and is now fearful when someone knocks on the door at home.

If major efforts are not made to address the situation, the judge said, “somebody is going to die.”

With tensions so high, four of the judges said they believe the Supreme Court and specifically Roberts, the head of the judiciary, should do more to defend the courts.

The Supreme Court, a second judge said, is effectively assisting the Trump administration in “undermining the lower courts,” leaving district and appeals court judges “thrown under the bus.”

The Supreme Court has an obligation to explain rulings in a way the public can understand, a third judge said, adding that when the court so frequently rules for the administration in emergency cases without fully telling people why, it sends a signal. The court has had strong left-leaning majorities in the past, but what is different now is the role emergency cases are playing in public discourse.

The Supreme Court, that judge said, is effectively endorsing Miller’s claims that the judiciary is trying to subvert the presidency.

“It’s almost like the Supreme Court is saying it is a ‘judicial coup,’” the judge said.

Not all judges who were interviewed shared that view. Some were more reluctant to criticize the justices.

A judge appointed by President Barack Obama said that while the Supreme Court could do more to explain itself, some lower court judges had been out of line in blocking Trump policies.

“Certainly, there is a strong sense in the judiciary among the judges ruling on these cases that the court is leaving them out to dry,” he said. “They are partially right to feel the way they feel.”

But, the judge added, “the whole ‘Trump derangement syndrome’ is a real issue. As a result, judges are mad at what Trump is doing or the manner he is going about things; they are sometimes forgetting to stay in their lane.”

The 'shadow docket'

In 2015, a University of Chicago Law School professor came up with a catchy term for a hitherto obscure part of the Supreme Court’s docket, in which cases are fast-tracked outside the court’s normally monthslong appeals process: the “shadow docket.”

Those are emergency cases handled much more quickly than normal — there are rarely oral arguments, and decisions can come within days with little or no explanation, while argued cases always include some reasoning that varies from a handful of pages to dozens to, in rare cases, the length of a short book.

The shadow docket has exploded in recent years, with the first Trump administration turbo-charging the trend by rushing to the Supreme Court when lower court rulings blocked nationwide policies. An early example was Trump’s travel ban on people entering the United States from mostly Muslim-majority countries, which the Supreme Court allowed to partly go into effect in June 2017.

Before the recent surge, most emergency cases involved death row inmates’ attempts to block their executions at the eleventh hour, and the court would normally handle them via terse orders with no explanation. But the increase in cases in hot-button nationwide disputes, sparked in part by presidents of both parties relying more on executive orders than passing legislation via Congress, has put greater scrutiny on the court’s reasoning.

The growing reliance on the shadow docket has drawn criticism from legal experts about the lack of time and process the Supreme Court spends on what can be incredibly consequential decisions.

Since Trump took office again in January, his administration has asked the Supreme Court 23 times to block lower court rules on an emergency basis.

The court has granted the government’s emergency requests in 17. It rejected the government in two cases, while three other cases were resolved without decisions, and one request is pending.

Notable victories include rulings that curbed lower-court injunctions that had blocked his contentious plan to end automatic birthright citizenship and his efforts to fire federal workers. The Supreme Court has also overturned lower court rulings that would have hindered Trump’s tough immigration policies. It has, though, pushed back against the administration in two other high-profile immigration cases.

By comparison, the Biden administration filed 19 applications during its entire four-year term, with the court granting its requests 10 times, according to Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown Law professor who has written a book about the subject.

An NBC News review of the Trump decisions showed that five of the 17 cases overturning lower court rulings included no substantive reasoning at all. Seven of the others included less than three pages of explanation. That critique extends back to the Biden administration, when the court failed to explain its decisions in eight out of the 10 wins for the government.

“Judges in the trenches need, and deserve, well-reasoned, bright-line guidance,” a judge said. “Too often today, sweeping rulings arrive with breathtaking speed but minimal explanation, stripped of the rigor that full briefing and argument provide.”

Ten of the judges, both Republican and Democratic appointees, agreed the court’s lack of explanation is a problem. Judges must follow Supreme Court precedent, but they can find it difficult to assess what the justices are asking them to do.

That was the situation in which Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox found himself this year after Trump fired three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Like certain other federal agencies, it was set up by Congress to be insulated from political pressures. While the president could nominate members to fixed terms, he could not fire them except for “neglect of duty or malfeasance.”

On paper, Maddox’s job was an easy one: As a district court judge, he has to follow the Supreme Court’s previous rulings. In 1935, in a case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld a law preventing the president from firing members of the Federal Trade Commission — a setup similar to the CPSC’s — without cause.

The Supreme Court’s current conservative majority has undermined that precedent in recent years, but, crucially, it has not overturned it.

But before Maddox issued his decision, the Supreme Court on May 22 allowed Trump to fire members of two other independent agencies with similar restrictions, the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board.

The Supreme Court’s two-page order was paltry, sending mixed messages by allowing the firings while expressly saying the court would wait to decide whether to overturn Humphrey’s Executor.

Maddox was left to grapple with how that decision applied to his case. He ultimately rejected the Trump administration’s arguments in two separate rulings in June, concluding that he was bound by the 1935 precedent.

“Humphrey’s Executor remains good law,” he wrote.

But Maddox did not have the final word. The Trump administration once again quickly turned to the Supreme Court, which granted its emergency request to allow the firings a month later.

The case was “squarely controlled” by its May decision, the conservative majority said in a one-page decision overturning Maddox.

In both cases, the court’s three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing in the second one that the majority had “all but overturned” Humphrey’s Executor despite never having heard arguments or issued a full ruling on the underlying legal question.

Kagan spoke about the difficulties lower court judges face in such cases at a legal conference in Monterey, California, this summer.

She referred to a different case in which Massachusetts-based Judge Myong Joun issued a ruling that blocked Trump administration plans to downsize the Education Department. The administration quickly appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the government.

Kagan noted that the case raised several legal issues, including what authority Joun had to step in, but the Supreme Court’s terse order did not explain on what grounds it was blocking his decision. The only writing was from liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who penned an 18-page dissent.

“What’s that court supposed to think?” Kagan asked, referring to Joun. “It’s just impossible to know, and that puts the [lower] court in a very difficult situation.”

But there is no unanimity within the Supreme Court about that issue. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion last month when the court ruled in favor of the Trump administration in another emergency case that was scathing about what he perceived as lower court judges’ failure to follow the Supreme Court’s orders.

“Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” he wrote.

A judge who spoke to NBC News expressed frustration that judges’ role in the judicial system is being undermined by the Supreme Court’s frequent interventions, before there has been extensive litigation and, potentially, a trial.

“It’s very discouraging,” the judge said. “We are operating in a bit of a vacuum.”

While agreeing that “it would be nicer” if the court gave fuller explanations in emergency decisions, another judge said it is too early to really cast judgment on how the Supreme Court has responded to the Trump administration, with litigation still ongoing in most cases.

It is up to the Supreme Court whether it wants to issue detailed decisions in emergency cases, the judge added, calling it “entirely a matter of grace.”

Lower court judges know that being overturned by the Supreme Court is part of the job, but the judge who said the justices have an obligation to explain themselves added that they can disagree with a lower court’s legal reasoning while also defending it as a good-faith attempt to address complex legal issues.

The judge suggested the Supreme Court should say, “Let’s be clear, it’s not some crazy opinion, and this judge is not a monster.”

Head of the judiciary

As chief justice, Roberts has a dual role. As well as being one of the nine justices on the Supreme Court, he is head of the U.S. Judicial Conference, the administrative arm of the courts, where he represents the interests of the judiciary as a whole.

Four judges who spoke to NBC News think Roberts, a conservative about to mark 20 years in the position, could do more to speak out when Trump allies complain about judicial overreach.

Roberts did issue a rare statement in March pushing back against Trump’s call to impeach the judge who ruled against the administration in the major immigration case.

“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said.

He also defended the judiciary in his annual end-of-year statement in December, in which he referred to an increase in threats to judges in recent years and called out “illegitimate activity” that seeks to undermine the judiciary.

But the judge who said the Supreme Court's frequent interventions are discouraging added that while Roberts may sometimes step up, “the conduct is undermining it,” referring to the court’s regular unexplained rulings in favor of Trump.

Roberts, who generally does not seek public attention, has long been known as an institutionalist who looks out for the interests of the Supreme Court, but several judges wondered whether that instinct extends to lower courts.

“He should be doing everything he can internally to insist on ordinary process,” the judge who has received threats said in reference to the emergency cases. Roberts' end-of-year report was “not enough,” the judge added.

Another judge said: “He hasn’t been completely absent, and he’s trying to do the best he can. I wish he would be a little bit more assertive and aggressive.”

Other judges are less willing to criticize Roberts.

“I do sympathize with the predicament the court is in, doing a dance with the administration, and particularly I’m sympathetic to Roberts,” the Obama-appointed judge said.

A district court judge indicated it was counterproductive to criticize Roberts or the court when the judiciary as a whole is under attack.

“We need to be united, not divided,” the judge said.

Roberts did not respond to a request for comment.

A federal judiciary employee familiar with Roberts’ institutional role said there are various reasons he is restrained from speaking out more. If he did, the employee said, the force of what he said would be diluted through repetition, and, with litigation pending in lower courts, he could face accusations of bias or calls for his recusal when he comments on specific cases.

“The chief justice has spoken out strongly against attacks on judges in various contexts, but he has been appropriately judicious in his statements, focusing on institutional norms and not personalities,” the employee said.

“The chief justice can’t be the public spokesperson against the administration and still do his job of deciding cases, including matters that involve the administration,” the person added.

So far, the only recent public defense from the court has come from conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who said at a legal conference in Kansas City, Missouri, last month that the court has been “doing more and more process to try to get the right answer” and offers more explanation in such cases than it did in the past. In the birthright citizenship cases, for example, the court heard oral arguments and issued a 26-page opinion explaining the decision.

One reason for keeping emergency decisions short, Kavanaugh said, is that the justices have to make decisions but do not necessarily want to pre-judge how cases will ultimately be decided when they come back to the court via the normal appeals process.

“There can be a risk ... of making a snap judgment and putting it in writing,” even though it might not reflect the court’s ultimate conclusion further down the line, he said.

While the Supreme Court wrestles internally with some of the criticism, lower court judges are increasingly focused on their own safety.

Judges have been calling for increased security in light of the frequent threats facing those who rule against or criticize the Trump administration, with some wondering whether the Supreme Court justices, who have faced harassment and threats, too, realize how vulnerable they are.

While the Supreme Court has its own police department to assist with security, other judges rely solely on the Marshals Service, which is under the control of Trump’s Justice Department, creating what some view as a potential point of vulnerability if tensions between the judiciary and the White House continue to mount.

The judge who reported receiving threats said that even if the Supreme Court is insulated from some of the violent rhetoric and believes the Trump administration will follow its rulings, the rule of law cannot function if it does not defend the lower courts.

“If the entire foundation falls out from under your house, it does no good to have a really well-insulated attic,” the judge said. “It sure would be nice if someone had our backs.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250815SCOTUSvJudgesBernis-jg-ef3ad9.jpg",N,,2025-09-04 05:56:56.808276

The tough penalties usher in an unprecedented era of zero tolerance for people who remain in the country if their asylum claims are denied. As a frontier state, long viewed as a gateway to Europe, Greece has had a surge in migrant arrivals this year.

“We are accountable to Greek citizens, and Greek citizens want to be protected,” the migration minister, Thanos Plevris, told MPs ahead of voting. “The message is clear [for migrants]: if your asylum request is rejected, you have two choices. Either you go to jail or return to your homeland. The Greek state does not accept you … You are not welcome.”

An unabashed rightwinger whose stance has caused ripples among the more moderate members of Greece’s centre-right government, Plevris insisted asylum would continue to be granted to applicants who fulfilled the need for international protection.

But under the new law, asylum seekers who have their claims rejected and do not leave the country within 14 days face prison terms of two to five years. Deterrence measures will also be toughened: people who arrive without the proper paperwork will be detained for 24 months, up from the current 18 months, while unregulated migrants who have been in Greece for seven years will no longer have the right to legalise their status. Those found guilty of illegal entry will be fined €10,000.

The measures come barely two months after the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, announced a controversial 90-day pause on asylum applications amid a rise in arrivals on the islands of Crete and Gavdos from Libya. In the first week of July, more than 2,000 people successfully made the crossing – a significant increase in a country where migrant numbers have fallen dramatically since 2015, when more than 850,000 people arrived at the height of the refugee crisis.

Mitsotakis insisted the suspension was aimed at sending smuggling rings a resounding message that “the passage to Greece is closed”, though it was condemned by human rights groups as a grave violation of international law.

In power since 2019, the government describes its migration policies as “tough but fair”, denying allegations of illegal pushbacks to keep asylum seekers at bay.

Addressing parliament, Plevris said he was proud to have overseen the legislation, which will put Greece at the forefront of policies that few EU members have wanted to enforce.

But on Wednesday the backlash was as instant as it was broad, with judges taking the unprecedented step of weighing in to criticise the legislation’s emphasis on repression.

Highlighting the lack of consensus over the measures, Dimitris Kairidis, who stepped down as migration and asylum minister in 2024, told the Guardian that while deterrence remained paramount, it was vital Athens also eased legal pathways of migration at a time when labour shortages were acute.

“Greece needs both to counter illegal, but also encourage legal, migration as needed by its growing economy,” he said.

During his tenure, Kairidis legalised the status of 30,000 unregistered migrant labourers desperately required in the agriculture, construction and tourism sectors.

With Greece gripped by a demographic crisis that last week forced the education ministry to close more than 750 schools because of the lack of pupils, migrant solidarity workers called the law racist and nonsensical.

“It’s so contradictory that this should be passed when Greece’s population is in such freefall, and when migrants offer the solution to labour shortages,” said the director of the Greek Council for Refugees, Lefteris Papagiannakis. “Mitsotakis has managed to hold the centre ground. With this openly racist law, he is clearly trying to enlarge his voter pool by appealing to the far right.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/490abce60aef3f9a1dae85dcec8d2e091fe3b0b5/426_523_3515_2811/master/3515.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30dcc6e4120ef67d22269e0af9a0b234",N,,2025-09-04 07:56:24.927360

But to find them, Congress must create a role for DHS in the sponsor-screening process from the outset,” Arthur wrote.
If UACs don’t have an asylum or trafficking claim, however, they should be transferred to their own governments for placement abroad.”","The number of immigrant children trafficked across the borders of the U.S. skyrocketed between 2021 and 2024, but federal law enforcement officials have seen those numbers plummet almost to nothing over the past seven months. According to data released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), President Donald Trump’s administration has overseen a sharp decline in the number of unaccompanied alien children (UACs) encountered by federal law enforcement officials, falling from 6,862 encounters in December to only 515 encounters in July: a 92.5% decrease. Since Trump returned to office at the end of January, CBP and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) divisions have encountered a total of just over 4,733 UACs, compared to the annual average under the Biden administration of over 127,500, a 96% decrease.

Under the Biden administration, the number of unaccompanied minors subjected to sex-trafficking more than tripled, rising from an annual average of 625 sex-trafficked children to 1,143 in then-president Joe Biden’s first year in the White House. The numbers continued rising from there. According to border czar and former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) chief Tom Homan, over 300,000 UACs went missing under the Biden administration, with many suspected of having been sex trafficked. “We’re gonna find some of them living with pedophiles, living in sex slavery, some are gonna be dead, but we gotta find these children,” Homan said shortly before Trump returned to office.

One of the reasons cross-border child-trafficking has decreased so steeply is the presence of ICE agents at meetings between UACs and adult sponsors. Reportedly, ICE agents have begun attending the meetings during which migrant children are to be released from DHS custody to the care of their U.S.-based “parents” or sponsors, who are often illegal immigrants themselves. The new policy directive was issued by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for the care of those minors. The new policy requires sponsors seeking custody of immigrant children to attend in-person meetings, rather than submit identification documents online, for more stringent vetting. Other measures taken by the Trump administration to protect immigrant children include mandatory fingerprinting of adult sponsors and all adult members of their households and allowing immigration officials to conduct home inspections and home visits.

Andrew Arthur, resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, explained in a recent article that a particular provision of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2008 essentially created a loophole facilitating the trafficking of immigrant children. Section 235 of the TVPRA categorized unaccompanied minors as either coming from a “contiguous country” such as Canada or Mexico, allowing federal authorities to quickly deport the child if there was no credible fear of return, and those from “non-contiguous countries,” meaning everywhere else in the world. UACs from non-contiguous countries were required to be placed in the care of ORR and, if possible, eventually transferred to a sponsor in the U.S. “Not surprisingly, the number of non-contiguous UACs soared after Congress passed section 235 of the TVPRA, as parents (and more importantly smugglers) realized it essentially guaranteed that any child who could make it illegally across the line would be released into this country,” Arthur wrote. “ORR struggled to handle that UAC surge, to put it politely,” he added.

“You’d think that after all these hearings Congress would review … section 235 of the TVPRA, and either rescind [it] or at least fix the most glaring issues with the current UAC process,” Arthur quipped. He continued, “Congress premised that process on three naïve (and erroneous) propositions: (1) all UACs are better off with sponsors than in government custody; (2) most adult sponsors can be entrusted with a kid; and (3) it’s in the ‘best interests’ of alien children to come illegally with smugglers rather than to remain back home.” Arthur observed, “ORR has few defenders, but respectfully, in its haste to move UACs out of immigration custody, Congress failed to provide the office with any guidance on how to screen and when to deny would-be sponsors.” He continued, “As a result, it’s beyond cavil that children are raped, trafficked, exploited, and abused thanks to the [Homeland Security Act of 2002] and TVPRA, and whenever the volume of UACs at the border rises, those hells compound exponentially.”

Arthur pointed out that, under federal law, the smuggling of non-citizens into the U.S. qualifies as a class D felony, with a penalty of up to a decade in prison. “There’s no exception for adults who conspire to smuggle kids here, and if DHS throws a few would-be sponsors cum conspirators in jail for a decade, you’ll see the child-smuggling industry dry up quickly. But to find them, Congress must create a role for DHS in the sponsor-screening process from the outset,” Arthur wrote. He added, “Ideally, alien children encountered at the border would be handed over to USCIS officers to determine whether they have viable asylum or trafficking claims, and only if they do should they be placed with a sponsor here. If UACs don’t have an asylum or trafficking claim, however, they should be transferred to their own governments for placement abroad.”",https://www.frc.org/img/domain/frc/item/AE25I12_NORMAL.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 08:56:28.409987

Visas for representatives of foreign media outlets would be limited to 240 days under DHS’s proposal.

The proposed rule seeks to limit the validity period for beneficiaries of those visas relative to the current rules.

Impact:

Under current regulations, persons who are beneficiaries of F visas for foreign students, J visas for exchange visitors, and I visas for representatives of foreign media outlets that have a home office in a foreign country, have their visas approved for a period that does not have a set duration, but instead is tied to specific program the visa holder is participating in or their employment. (This is known as being approved for a “duration of status.”)

DHS’s August 28 proposed rule seeks to change this to limit most admissions for foreign students at four years and possibly limit English language program students for two-years. The rule also proposes to shorten the grace period for leaving the country after completion of studies from 60 to 30 days. Visas for representatives of foreign media outlets would be limited to 240 days under DHS’s proposal.

There are nearly 1.6 million active records for persons who hold F-1 and M-1 visas; a miniscule share of those are M-1 holders, as there were 6,322 M-1 visas issued in 2024 (M-1 visas are not impacted by the proposed rule but are lumped together with F-1 by DHS in data reports). There were over 400,000 new F-1 visas issued by the State Department in 2024, 323,000 J-1 visas, and nearly 13,000 I visas.

DHS notes in their reasoning for the proposal that the current system undermines the agency’s ability to monitor and enforce compliance and results in fewer check-ins with DHS to verify compliance, and leads to insufficient monitoring of beneficiaries. DHS also cited national security concerns. It is difficult to know if these measures will significantly impact demand for visas in these three categories, but the President’s Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a lobby group for universities, argues that it will burden schools and students and deter foreign students and academics from coming to the United States.",https://files.epi.org/uploads/Federal-Policy-Watch-Project-2025-action-950x534.png,N,,2025-09-04 05:56:48.391673

Washington, D.C., September 3, 2025—On September 9, the U.S. Census Bureau will release national Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance data for 2024. We expect the numbers to show more poverty in 2024, particularly among children, and more people without health insurance. When we see the data, however, we must consider that the outlook for 2025 and beyond is ominous, given how precipitously the conditions for people facing economic insecurity have declined this year.

Since the beginning of President Trump’s second term, the administration and Congress have unleashed a cascade of attacks on people with low incomes, including communities of color, immigrants and their families, and others who have been historically marginalized. These attacks have included slashing public benefit programs; issuing executive orders dismantling diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives; ripping families apart through a horrific mass deportation effort and gutting protections and services to immigrants, including U.S. citizen children; eliminating labor protections for millions of workers; and decimating the nation’s data collection efforts that are critical to accurate and equitable decision-making. Through these and other actions, the Trump Administration’s reckless disregard for people’s health, safety, and well-being will have dire consequences for the future of the country.

These attacks are particularly evident in the reconciliation bill passed by Congress, which is causing unprecedented harm to workers, people of color, immigrants, women, and children. In addition to excluding many families with low incomes from the Child Tax Credit, the bill cuts essential benefit programs, including Medicaid and SNAP. Although these changes will not be fully implemented until 2026 and beyond, they are already having a chilling effect among people who rely on these programs to meet their basic needs. Congress made these cuts to fund historic increases in immigration enforcement that undermine family unity and well-being and to provide tax cuts to the wealthy, which will only exacerbate poverty and wealth inequality.

The September 9 data will likely show another annual increase in people without health insurance coverage. The end of Covid-era protections for Medicaid coverage caused many people to lose coverage in 2024, although the availability of enhanced premium tax credits in the Marketplace likely offset some Medicaid losses. Congress’s action in 2025 to cut Medicaid and enhanced Marketplace tax credits by more than $1 trillion is estimated to cause nearly 15 million people to lose coverage in the coming years.

The full effect of millions of people losing health insurance, food assistance, and other supports—and how that loss will harm not just individuals but their families, communities, and the larger economy—will drive even more people deeper into poverty and instability for years to come.

We will have more to say after the Census Bureau releases the data next week.

Jana Favero, deputy CEO of the Melbourne-based Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the deal with Nauru was “discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous”.
Favero said the broad wording in the deal could enable many thousands of people to be deported from Australia.
Nauru was one of two countries Australia initially sent asylum seekers to when it first began its controversial offshore detention programme in 2001.
In June 2023, the last refugees remaining on Nauru returned to Australia after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese fulfilled an election promise to end offshore detention.","The Australian government has agreed to pay the small Pacific island nation of Nauru some $1.6bn over three decades to resettle former detainees who have “no legal right to remain in Australia”, in the latest iteration of Australia’s controversial offshore detention policies.

Both governments signed a secretive deal last week under which Nauru will resettle up to 354 people who have no legal right to stay in Australia in exchange for an initial 408 million Australian dollar payment ($267m) and about 70 million Australian dollars ($46m) each year thereafter.

Independent Senator David Pocock said a “snap Senate hearing” on Wednesday night revealed that the “agreement with Nauru to send asylum seekers there” could cost the Australian government up to 2.5 billion Australian dollars ($1.6bn) over 30 years.

The Senate hearing came after Australia’s Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke announced last week that he had signed a memorandum with Nauru’s president “for the proper treatment and long-term residence of people who have no legal right to stay in Australia, to be received in Nauru”.

“It’s in both nations’ interest to move through this as efficiently as we can,” said Clare Sharp, head of immigration from the Department of Home Affairs.

“It’s in Nauru’s interest, because money doesn’t flow until people arrive,” she said.

With an estimated population of some 12,500 and a mainland measuring just 21 square kilometres (8.1 square miles), Nauru is among the world’s smallest countries.

Nauru’s President David Adeang said in a statement on Sunday that the agreement with Australia will “support Nauru’s long-term economic resilience”.

Jana Favero, deputy CEO of the Melbourne-based Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the deal with Nauru was “discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous”.

Favero said the broad wording in the deal could enable many thousands of people to be deported from Australia.

“That’s tens of thousands of lives at risk – not the tiny number the government would have Australians believe,” Favero said in a statement.

Australian immigration officials said there are no guarantees all 354 people – including some convicted of serious crimes – will be deported to Nauru, with the Pacific island making the final decision.

Australia’s government has struggled to find a way to deal with immigrants who have no other country to go to when their visas are cancelled. The country’s High Court ruled in 2023 that indefinite detention was unlawful if deportation was not an option, leading to the release of 220 people.

The number of people in that situation in Australia now numbers 354, government officials said.

In February, Australia paid an undisclosed sum for Nauru to accept three immigrants convicted of violent offences, though legal challenges have reportedly stalled their transfer.

Nauru was one of two countries Australia initially sent asylum seekers to when it first began its controversial offshore detention programme in 2001.

In June 2023, the last refugees remaining on Nauru returned to Australia after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese fulfilled an election promise to end offshore detention.

In January this year, the United Nations Human Rights Committee found Australia’s offshore policy had violated two provisions of the legally-binding 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – one on arbitrary detention and one protecting the right to challenge detention in court.

Nauru has in recent years turned to other migration-related schemes in attempts to revive its economy, which historically has relied on thriving exports of phosphate, a key ingredient used in fertiliser. But those supplies have long dried up, and researchers today estimate 80 percent of Nauru has been rendered uninhabitable by mining.

Last month, Nauru’s government announced it had welcomed its first new citizens under an Economic and Climate Resilience Citizenship Programme, which provides citizenship and a passport for a minimum investment in the country of $105,000.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP24015247834742-1756956177_7da4ac-1756956748.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80,N,,2025-09-04 01:56:29.929818

These are not ordinary times. It’s not just that the Trump administration is taking actions that horrify and offend us. It’s that in just seven months, President Trump has all but dismantled a democratic system that took more than 200 years to build.

He and his team have failed to comply with nearly a third of major judicial rulings against them. They have created heavily-armed goon squads that seize people off the streets without warrants or due process.

They have eliminated, intimidated or coerced into submission all the institutions — the free press, academia, the courts, independent inspectors general, regulators, scientific panels and data — that used to guard against corruption and abuse.

Republicans in Congress have completely abdicated their power of the purse. Whatever checks and balances that once existed are ceasing to function.

We are now, for all intents and purposes, living in a dictatorship where the rules are made and changed at the whim of a single person, and the only beneficiaries are the ultra-rich.

Yet Democrats in Congress are largely conducting business as usual, as if this were merely a policy squabble. They continue to attend sham hearings, cooperate with Republicans in drafting legislation that will be ignored or circumvented by the administration and allow nominations to go through without a serious fight.

Lacking the votes to stop the worst excesses of Trump and his sycophants, Democratic legislators seem to think their options are limited to negotiating deals that are less horrendous or voting “no.”

But there is more that Democrats can and should do if they want to demonstrate a credible alternative to the current mayhem and win back the trust and support of the American people.

First, they should stop playing ball with Republicans and adopt a policy of strategic non-cooperation. They should refuse to help Republicans make a quorum, negotiate budget deals and pass legislation.

There is no point in making terrible bills marginally less bad when money they add goes unspent, restrictions they insert go unheeded and protections they demand are subverted. Instead, they should use the rules to obstruct and delay proceedings that are likely to end in further erosion of our rights.

As Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) put it, “every time that we go along with these appropriations bills, we’re putting a bipartisan veneer of endorsement on an illegal process that’s ultimately part of his campaign to destroy our democracy.”

Second, they should show who and what they stand for and how they would govern differently.

Congressional Democrats should establish caucuses that function as shadow committees, holding their own hearings, issuing their own reports, and conducting their own investigations on issues of key importance to the American public.

Together with governors and party leadership, they should create a shadow cabinet, akin to the United Kingdom’s Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet. This would give Democrats an opportunity to show what they would do if they were in charge.

The shadow secretaries would lay out their vision and budget for their respective departments and issue detailed critiques of the current administration’s actions and omissions.

The party should adopt a clear and simple set of priorities, such as increasing affordability, improving family health and security and limiting the power of big money.

Third, Democrats in Washington should spend more time in their home states and districts, listening to local communities and supporting local leaders. With nothing useful happening in the nation’s capital, the momentum for change has shifted to municipal governments and civic campaigns.

National legislators can do more good by learning from and lending their voice to local movements than by giving floor speeches and proposing federal legislation that goes nowhere.

Finally, Democrats should build closer relationships with their counterparts in countries that have successfully emerged from authoritarian rule.

Organized resistance movements in Spain, Chile, Poland, South Africa and South Korea helped bring about peaceful democratic transitions, and they have much to teach us about preventing, countering and surviving tyranny.

If the last seven months have taught us anything, it should be that democracy is fragile and requires vigilance. Fascism can happen here, too.

Requirement to Carry Proof of Registration All foreign nationals over the age of 18 who are required to register must carry their proof of registration with them at all times.
Foreign nationals must also notify DHS of any change of address within 10 days of the change.","Real World Impact: Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published an interim final rule (IFR) that provides a new online process for unregistered foreign nationals to comply with the decades-old but rarely enforced registration requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The IFR also requires foreign nationals over the age of 18 to carry proof of registration with them at all times. Failure to register or carry proof of registration is punishable by fines and possible imprisonment.

Background: Under the INA, with limited exceptions, foreign nationals age 14 or older who were not registered or fingerprinted (if required) when they applied for a visa and who are staying in the U.S. for 30 days or longer must apply for registration and fingerprinting. Parents and legal guardians of foreign nationals under age 14 must ensure they are registered. Within 30 days of turning 14, a foreign national, regardless of whether they previously registered, must apply for registering and fingerprinting.

Who is Already Considered Registered?

Certain foreign nationals are considered preregistered, and no additional registration action is needed: lawful permanent residents, those with Employment Authorization Documents (EADs), those on sponsored work visas who have an I-94, their family members who have a valid I-94, and a few other categories. A full list of those who are considered preregistered is available on the USCIS website at: https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration.

Who is Not Considered Registered?

Certain foreign nationals are not considered registered and must do so, including those who entered the U.S. without inspection, children who are turning 14 (as noted above), and visa-exempt Canadian visitors who entered at a land port of entry, were not issued an I-94 upon entry, and are staying in the U.S. longer than 30 days.

New Registration Form

USCIS has developed a new registration form that those who are not registered can use: https://www.uscis.gov/forms/all-forms/g-325r. Note that the use of this form to register is not an immigration status and does not confer employment authorization or provide any other right or benefit under the INA or other U.S. law.

Evidence of Registration

The following documents are considered evidence of registration:

I-94, Arrival-Departure Record—Aliens admitted as nonimmigrants; aliens paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; aliens whose claimed entry prior to July 1, 1924, cannot be verified, having satisfactorily established residence in the United States since prior to July 1, 1924; and aliens granted permission to depart without the institution of deportation proceedings.

I-95, Crewmen's Landing Permit—Crewmen arriving by vessel or aircraft.

I-184, Alien Crewman Landing Permit and Identification Card—Crewmen arriving by vessel.

I-185, Nonresident Alien Canadian Border Crossing Card—Citizens of Canada or British subjects residing in Canada.

I-186, Nonresident Alien Mexican Border Crossing Card—Citizens of Mexico residing in Mexico.

I-221, Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing—Aliens against whom deportation proceedings are being instituted.

I-221S, Order to Show Cause, Notice of Hearing, and Warrant for Arrest of Alien—Aliens against whom deportation proceedings are being instituted.

I-551, Permanent Resident Card—Lawful permanent resident of the United States.

I-766, Employment Authorization Document.

Form I-862, Notice to Appear—Aliens against whom removal proceedings are being instituted.

Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge—Aliens against whom removal proceedings are being instituted.

USCIS Proof of Alien G-325R Registration, or its successor form (this newly developed form is discussed above).

See https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-264/section-264.1. In addition to the documents listed above, a valid, unexpired DHS admission or parole stamp in a foreign passport constitutes evidence of registration.

Requirement to Carry Proof of Registration

All foreign nationals over the age of 18 who are required to register must carry their proof of registration with them at all times. For green card holders, this means carrying their Permanent Resident cards with them at all times. As with any important personal documents, we recommend people make copies of their proof of registration in case of loss or theft. Foreign nationals must also notify DHS of any change of address within 10 days of the change. A failure to comply with either of these requirements is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 and imprisonment of up to 30 days, or both.

The Bottom Line

While most noncitizen employees will be considered preregistered and do not need to reregister, it is important that they ensure they have proof of registration with them at all times. Few arrests have been reported for failure to possess proof of registration, but it is important to ensure that foreign nationals are prepared to demonstrate their compliance with the registration requirement in light of the USCIS’s increased focus on worksite enforcement. If someone is detained and asked to provide this documentation, they are not required to answer any questions and can ask to speak to their lawyer. Following arrests for failure to register, some courts have dismissed charges where prosecutors were unable to articulate probable cause for the defendant’s knowledge of the registration requirement and/or intentional refusal to register. Accordingly, awareness of the registration requirement appears important for any related criminal liability.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.854_4308.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 01:56:35.007936

The Trump administration has claimed — without providing evidence — that the casualties of the strike were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based gang that it has designated a foreign terrorist organization.

“Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, following the attack. “Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!”

The White House posted an image on social media of Trump looking at a phone showing footage of the boat being hit. “TERRORISTS ELIMINATED. ADIÓS,” the post says, with an emoji of a person placing items in the trash.

In another post, the White House said: “ON VIDEO: U.S. Military Forces conducted a strike against Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists. The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the U.S. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action.”

The Trump administration has circulated a brief black and white video that it says shows the fatal strike. AP reports that the White House “did not immediately explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members.” The outlet also noted that the video “is not clear enough to see if the craft is carrying as many as 11 people” and “did not show any large or clear stashes of drugs inside the boat.”

Experts say the administration’s deadly strike violated international law.

“Labeling someone a terrorist and deploying the military does not make them a military target,” Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement to Truthout. “These actions amount to an extra-judicial killing, a violation of international law, which should raise extraordinary concerns.”

“Without clear limitations on presidential and military authority, we may find this administration claiming that it can execute alleged drug dealers at home without any judicial process as happened under the Duterte regime in the Philippines,” Warren continued. Former president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte is now at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, accused of committing crimes against humanity, including rape, murder, and torture, in the context of the government’s so-called “war on drugs” campaign.

“Using military forces to kill alleged drug traffickers is an act of murder, not war,” Wells Dixon, a senior attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, told Truthout in a statement following the attack on Tuesday.

Civil rights attorney Alec Karakatsanis called the killings “extra-judicial assassinations — a preemptive death penalty with no process — for vague alleged nonviolent drug distribution offenses.”

Trump has a long history of calling for U.S. intervention to overthrow Venezuela’s government, and has escalated tensions in recent days by building up the U.S. military’s presence near the country. The Trump administration has also frequently accused people of belonging to Tren de Aragua to justify violations of their human rights.

Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order declaring Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization and subsequently invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to send more than 250 Venezuelans living in the United States to El Salvador’s notoriously brutal prison, CECOT. The administration repeatedly accused the men of being Tren de Aragua members, despite the fact that a majority did not have criminal convictions.

After four months, they were sent home to Venezuela in a prisoner swap deal between Venezuela and the United States. The men, including a soccer coach, a makeup artist, and a musician, have reported that they were physically and psychologically tortured at the prison.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025-9-3-trump-at-white-house.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 01:56:38.351940

A majority of justices will, of course, never say that they believe this nonsense about Tren de Aragua conducting an invasion or predatory incursion against the United States.","The Situation last week contemplated the deployment of National Guard and federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C.

And I fully expected when I awoke this morning to continue in the same vein today and discuss Mayor Muriel Bowser’s executive order aligning city policy with Trump’s federal law enforcement posture vis-a-vis the city—a subject to which I will return.

But when I woke up and glanced at my computer, I found news that genuinely surprised me: The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals had rejected President Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans accused of being members of Tren de Aragua. The Fifth Circuit is perhaps the most conservative appeals court in the country. What’s more, I had listened to the oral argument in the case, and it frankly didn’t lead me to think the opinion would come out like this.

Yet there it was: a 2-to-1 opinion in which the majority holds that President Trump just can’t make the Alien Enemies Act, which allows deportations when the president determines there has been an “invasion” or “predatory incursion,” cover immigrants from Venezuela by issuing a proclamation claiming that the Tren de Aragua gang is state-controlled and that the immigration is some kind of incursion.

I have a few observations about this case:

The first is that opinion, by Judge Leslie Southwick, is a slog to read. It is not especially well argued or reasoned, in my view. It will not go down in history as a wonderful piece of legal writing. There are no memorable lines.

But the quality of the opinion actually doesn’t matter very much. Not all opinions can have soaring rhetoric that makes one’s heart go pitter-patter. Not all the children can be above average. And some opinions are important less for their quality or reasoning or writing than as indicators.

This opinion is an indicator—an indicator that not all conservative judges feel the need to defer to the bullshit. It’s not the first such indicator. And it’s not the most eloquent. But it’s the strongest evidence we’ve seen so far in the Alien Enemy Act context. And that’s a hopeful sign.

The key point here is that the Trump administration had a chance to argue its extravagant claim of power to deport people based on complete fiction before one of the few courts of appeals in the country that is consistently more conservative than the Supreme Court. And it couldn’t persuade a panel of that court to uphold its invocation of an 18th Century legacy of the John Adams administration to deal with a 21st Century gang. That does not bode well for Trump’s chances before Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett—who together define the legal scope of modern American presidential autocracy.

The Fifth Circuit here is just a waystation. What matters here is only the signal that this is an issue that will divide conservative jurists.

But let’s pause a moment to be candid about the legal issue at stake in this case, and let’s bother to state it more precisely than the Fifth Circuit did. The issue the case presents is what deference, if any, the courts owe to official presidential lies. Do judges owe such deference to knowing and intentional untruths as to detain and deport people based on them? Or are they allowed to, in the common vernacular of our time, call bullshit on the president?

This is not an exaggeration meant for effect. I mean it very literally. The March 15 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act is predicated on the following statements: “I find and declare that [Tren de Aragua] TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.”

That is not a true statement, and Trump’s finding and declaring it doesn’t make it true.

And on the basis of this untrue statement, the president finds that “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.”

So now let me distill for you a lengthy and turgid judicial opinion into three short sentences of plain English:

Tren de Aragua is not, in fact, perpetrating or attempting an invasion or predatory incursion of the United States by any reasonable understanding of the terms in question.

Whatever crimes its members may be committing, it is not conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States—at least not such as might be considered a predatory incursion.

Consequently, Venezuelan citizens cannot lawfully be apprehended and removed as Alien Enemies.

The majority opinion does not call the statements in Trump’s proclamation lies, because in the mannered style of judicial opinions, one just doesn’t say that the president is gaslighting the public in an official presidential proclamation. Comity between the branches or something like that.

But I’m going to be blunt about it: I don’t believe for a second that Trump or his lawyers actually believe that Venezuelan immigration, even by Tren de Aragua members, constitutes an invasion or predatory incursion within the meaning of the Alien Enemies Act. They are relying instead on a claim about the unreviewable nature of the president’s power to decide these things, not about the truth or reasonableness of what he has decided.

And that question of reviewability is what divides the panel.

The dissent, by Judge Andrew Oldham, argues that the court is obliged to accept these lies. “What is the upshot of this series of cases?” he asks, having gone over the relevant case law. “All of them recognize one fundamental principle: The President’s judgment call as to the existence of a state of war, invasion, or insurrection is conclusive.”

Judge Oldham may well prove correct as a bellwether of where a majority of the Supreme Court comes down. A majority of justices will, of course, never say that they believe this nonsense about Tren de Aragua conducting an invasion or predatory incursion against the United States.

But they could end up signing off on the happy fiction that they have to pretend they believe that President Trump really believes this garbage (comity between the branches being what it is and all, and he having sworn an oath to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and all). And they thus could end up taking the position that it is not their job to determine, as Judge Oldham put it, that “the Executive’s finding [is] so implausible it should be overridden by a handful of generals-in-robes.” Even though it is so implausible that generals-in-robes who refuse to override it should be careful about calling themselves lawyers.

But while Judge Oldham may get the last laugh, Judge Southwick’s opinion offers proof that at least some conservative jurists look—and thus hope that maybe two Supreme Court justices will look—at the president’s proclamation and say that there has to be some limit to the deference owed to the president when he is just blowing smoke in the faces of the judges.

If the president had issued a proclamation that said, “I find and declare that an eggplant is perpetrating an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States” and that therefore “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA” are deportable, would any judge find such a statement “conclusive” as to an individual’s detainability or removability? The current order is hardly less nonsensical a basis on which to lock people up and put them on planes.

DECORAH — Calls to protect immigrant residents from federal enforcement dominated Tuesday night’s Decorah City Council meeting, as speakers urged adoption of a proposed ""separation ordinance"" that would limit local cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The issue appeared on the agenda as ""Discussion on Public Comment Received Regarding Jail Services and Arrestees,"" after weeks of organizing by residents and the advocacy group Decorah Community for Immigrant Rights. Supporters said the ordinance would prevent local police and jail services from going beyond what federal or state law requires in working with ICE.

During public comment, Ruth Palmer, a volunteer with the Immigration Action Network, told the council she opposed the federal agency’s practices but urged unity in the local debate.

""With the group that’s gathered here, I share a common concern for the rights of immigrants, but I oppose their proposed separation ordinance, because the focus of all in this room needs to be on protecting rights. On building unity, not separation,"" Palmer said.

""We need the passion, the energy, the ideas of every person here to commit to the protection of the most vulnerable in our community, recognizing that we are only as strong as our weakest link.""

Other speakers demanded clearer limits on cooperation with ICE. Christine Mohrhauser of DCIR cited deaths and abuses in immigration detention on a federal level.

""Do the people of Decorah really want to be known as complacently handing over our neighbors?"" she asked. ""We do not want our police department aiding this known abusive agency any more than that which is absolutely legally necessary.""

Matthew Alexander, a Decorah resident of more than 30 years, invoked his Norwegian immigrant ancestors in urging support.

""When I consider what it would have been like for my Norwegian great-grandparents to have experienced such cruel action, it stops me in my tracks,"" he said. ""We support this proposed separation ordinance to allow for respect and pause in the lightning attacks on people and to give inherent human rights and freedoms.""

Some residents framed the proposal as both moral and practical. Andrea Beck, who immigrated from Spain in 2013, told council members: ""As a former immigrant myself, I support this ordinance because it helps Decorah comply with federal immigration enforcement without giving away extra information that could compromise the safety of our immigrants.""

She warned that many local immigrants ""don't feel safe walking around in our community anymore.""

But opponents questioned whether the city had the authority to act. Retired Spanish teacher Margaret Betteridge, who volunteers as an interpreter for IAN, said: ""This proposed ordinance is not something that our city can realistically adopt. This type of reform needs to happen at the state or national level. Unfortunately, our city government can’t legislate ICE.""

Others rebutted that claim. Eric Rovelo of DCIR told the council the ordinance was designed only to ensure local agencies ""do exactly what’s required under the law and nothing that isn’t explicitly required."" He noted that more than 40 cities and 160 counties across the U.S. have passed similar measures.

City Manager Travis Goedken prefaced the council’s discussion by reading a prepared statement, cautioning that nothing discussed should be seen as restricting cooperation with federal agencies.

""Nothing that I give as a statement should be construed as discouraging, prohibiting or restricting law enforcement officers, employees or officials from cooperating with or assisting in federal immigration law enforcement activities,"" Goedken said, citing Iowa Code Chapter 27A.

Council Member Cody Whittle said he asked for the item to be placed on the agenda because the community deserved transparency.

""When I think about how I want government to work, I think if the public brings something forth and wants to discuss it, I think that we owe it to them to do that in an honest and open way,"" Whittle said. He praised both sides of the debate for ""so much in common … they care so much about human rights and share a deep concern for immigrants.""

Council Member Emily Neil said she deliberated at length before agreeing to place the item on the agenda. While she called it ""a moral moment,"" Neil asserted the ordinance as drafted would not protect immigrants and could instead draw harmful attention.

""The ordinance proposed is either outside of the jurisdiction of the city council, against the law, or in some cases already practiced and covered by other city ordinances,"" Neil said. ""Additionally, it opens up our city manager and our officers to unnecessary conflicts as they try to determine how to enforce a city ordinance that is in direct opposition to state law.""

Neil also stressed that the city has no control over the county jail, a focal point of the ordinance.

""The county owns the jail and is responsible for its oversight. To be clear, the Decorah City Council has no oversight of the county jail. It merely sits on land owned by the city,"" she said.

Council Member Brent Parker echoed that point, saying the ordinance confused the roles of city and county.

""We have no say in what our elected sheriff does in his jail,"" Parker said. ""If you have issues, maybe this is talking to him, not using the city of Decorah to circumvent that.""

Council Member Steve Zittergruen pointed to the city’s police department as already taking steps to support immigrants. He noted that officers use a language line to communicate with non-English speakers and provide a complaint process, and that no formal complaints had been received.

""I think they’re reaching out and doing the right things,"" Zittergruen said, citing Police Chief Trisha Thein’s prior experience in Marshalltown, a city ""with a more diverse population.""

Council Member Christopher Miculinich called the ordinance’s supporters sincere and urged broader collaboration.

""At the end of the day I don’t want to take a professional position on the set ordinance,"" Miculinich said. ""I think it’s great we’re having the conversation, but … we do have a bunch of other local organizations that are fighting for the same needs in our community. I would urge a collective effort.""

Despite rejecting the ordinance in its current form, members repeatedly thanked residents for their comments.

""I appreciate the conversation that has occurred here tonight. I know that’s not an easy thing,"" Miculinich added. ""The fact that you guys are getting up and having these conversations is a great thing to see.""

At a press conference held after the meeting, members of DCIR described the council discussion as a breakthrough, despite the council’s stance on the ordinance.

""Tonight, City Council made a critical move by putting the separation ordinance on the agenda, and that matters,"" Aime Rovelo, a member of DCIR, said. ""Its goal is simple: keep our community safe by drawing a clear line between local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement.""

Speakers said codifying limits on cooperation is necessary to protect against future changes in leadership.

""Nothing in this ordinance is against the police,"" Joshua Ratel-Khan said. ""What we’re asking for is to codify what those discussions have looked like. You cannot guarantee that all police officers or the chief of police will continue to enact this law, especially in the political climate we’re in.""

They also rejected claims that state law blocks local action.

""They may say that Code 27A prevents us from enacting many of these things in this ordinance, but again, that’s not true,"" Ratel-Khan said. ""Our ordinance doesn’t say we don’t want our police to cooperate with ICE. It says we don’t want to go above and beyond what the law requires.""

Advocates framed the measure as part of a broader national movement.

""This ordinance comes from the people, from years of organizing by immigrant-led groups across the country … We know ICE is already in Iowa. Arrests are climbing. This is not a hypothetical scenario, it is very real,"" Rovelo said. ""We will keep organizing, keep showing up and keep fighting until every immigrant in Decorah can live with dignity, safety, and freedom from deportation.""",http://dircx6nshkvfy.cloudfront.net/360_Decorah_Live/0/0/0/0/19/948/19948_1,N,,2025-09-04 01:56:42.916339

Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/landor-v-louisiana-department-of-corrections-and-public-safety/,"When he sued the prison employees for violating his rights under RLIUPA, the district court held that RLIUPA does not provide for damages against individual state officials.
The Fifth Circuit affirmed, and Landor asked the Supreme Court to hear his case.
Finally, there is no principled reason that state employees in particular may not be personally liable for damages under RLUIPA.
State employees are uniquely positioned as state actors to be held liable for actions in violation of funding terms that the state knowingly accepted.
The Supreme Court should reverse the Fifth Circuit, allowing Damon Landor to seek damages.","The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act protects the religious freedom of incarcerated people. Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian, wore his hair in dreadlocks in accordance with his religion. After serving the first four months of his sentence at facilities where administrators respected his religious practice, that changed with his transfer to Raymond Laborde Correctional Center. There, when Landor showed the prison officials a printout of a Fifth Circuit decision holding that RLIUPA protected his right to keep his dreadlocks, they threw the decision into the trash, held him down, and shaved his head. When he sued the prison employees for violating his rights under RLIUPA, the district court held that RLIUPA does not provide for damages against individual state officials. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, and Landor asked the Supreme Court to hear his case.

In September 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in support of Landor. Our brief makes three principal points.

First, Congress has broad discretion to make federal funding contingent on statutory conditions and craft remedies for violations of those conditions. The Spending Clause authorizes Congress to spend for the “general Welfare of the United States.” The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress has substantial discretion to define “the concept of the general welfare” and exercise its spending power accordingly. When Congress grants federal funds to a state subject to conditions it deems to be in furtherance of the general welfare, it also has significant discretion to ensure compliance with those conditions, including by using its legislative power to craft remedies for noncompliance, such as private rights of action. The Constitution’s Necessary and Proper Clause underscores Congress’s authority in this area.

Second, the court below erred when it claimed to import contract law “wholesale” to rewrite RLIUPA’s express private right of action. The Supreme Court has used contract law principles to interpret the application of the Spending Clause in two limited scenarios: to ensure that funding recipients had sufficient notice of the specific conduct prohibited by Congress, and to fill in statutory gaps about the type of relief available. The Court has refused to employ the contract-law analogy to displace or invalidate clear statutory text, emphasizing that the contract-law analogy does not sanction incorporating contract law “wholesale.”

The contract-law analogy has limited utility in this case: it simply raises the question of whether state funding recipients had sufficient notice when they accepted federal funds that their employees may be held individually liable for damages if they violate RLUIPA’s substantive provisions. The answer to that question is yes. The Supreme Court has held that identical language in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act protected the ability to seek damages against state employees in their individual capacity. The Fifth Circuit supplied no reason to interpret the identical language in RLIUPA differently, because there is none.

Finally, there is no principled reason that state employees in particular may not be personally liable for damages under RLUIPA. RLUIPA does not impose liability on just anyone for violating its terms. It imposes liability on employees of the state. State employees are uniquely positioned as state actors to be held liable for actions in violation of funding terms that the state knowingly accepted.

Notably, just two years ago the Supreme Court reaffirmed that Spending Clause statutes, like all other federal laws, may give rise to privately enforceable rights pursuant to Section 1983 even where Congress does not include a cause of action in the statute itself. Here, Congress explicitly authorized private parties to enforce RLUIPA against state officials by importing Section 1983’s language into RLUIPA’s express cause of action. Rather than honor that statutory text, the Fifth Circuit effectively penalized Congress for its clarity.

The Supreme Court should reverse the Fifth Circuit, allowing Damon Landor to seek damages.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-09-03 23:56:40.429640
,Litigation,2025-09-04 02:06:39+00:00,Miami Herald,Trump ends TPS deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans,"Syra Ortiz Blanes, Antonio Maria Delgado, D.A. Varela",,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article311962644.html,"The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States would lose their deportation protections and work permits under Temporary Protected Status by next week.
The decision will also be heavily felt in South Florida, the heart of the Venezuelan community in the United States.
“Venezuelans under TPS are not a burden—they are a resilient community that brings value, hope, and integrity to this nation.
It then created a second TPS designation in 2023 that further expanded the protections so more people would benefit.
It also similarly invoked the argument that the TPS designation was not in the national interests of the United States.","The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States would lose their deportation protections and work permits under Temporary Protected Status by next week.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the agency had reviewed conditions in Venezuela in collaboration with the State Department, and that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had determined that the 2021 TPS designation for Venezuela was “contrary to the national interest.”

“Given Venezuela’s substantial role in driving irregular migration and the clear magnet effect created by Temporary Protected Status, maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelan nationals directly undermines the Trump Administration’s efforts to secure our southern border and manage migration effectively,” said an agency spokesperson in a statement.

The decision leaves about 257,000 Venezuelans, including many in South Florida, vulnerable to being deported to a homeland deep in crisis and under the repressive governance of leader Nicolas Maduro.

The decision will also be heavily felt in South Florida, the heart of the Venezuelan community in the United States. On Wednesday, advocates and leaders were already reeling from the announcement.

“Venezuelans under TPS are not a burden—they are a resilient community that brings value, hope, and integrity to this nation. Ignoring their reality would be a failure to uphold the fundamental principles of compassion and justice that have long defined the United States,” said Helene Villalonga, a Venezuelan activist and president of the Multicultural Association of Activists for Voice and Expression.

In a separate announcement in February, the Trump administration ended TPS protections for another group of approximately 350,000 Venezuelan beneficiaries, arguing that conditions in the country have changed sufficiently to allow them to safely return. The vast majority currently do not enjoy TPS protections, and only about 5,000 currently have their TPS work permits as a result of ongoing litigation out of a federal district court in California. Their fate lies in the hands of Judge Edward Chen, who has been overseeing that lawsuit.

Substantial evidence suggests that many TPS holders would face severe consequences if repatriated. Many could be subjected to imprisonment, torture, or even death at the hands of the same government they once fled.

“The situation has definitely not improved in Venezuela,” Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, told the Miami Herald in a recent interview. “On the contrary, following the July 28 elections of 2024, repression and political persecution have intensified. We currently have at least 890 political prisoners, including 72 foreigners, and at least 66 people who are missing, with their whereabouts still unknown.”

In addition to political persecution, returning Venezuelans would reenter a country teetering on collapse—maligned by hyperinflation, soaring unemployment, rampant crime, frequent power outages, water shortages and chronic scarcities of food and medicine.

Ironically, the assertion that Venezuela is safe is not consistently reflected across the Trump administration. The State Department has repeatedly urged U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Venezuela under any circumstances.

“Do not travel to or remain in Venezuela due to the high risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure. All U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately,” a State Department advisory stated in May.

The Biden administration first granted Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans in 2021, a move that was largely celebrated in South Florida, home to one of the largest populations of people from the South American country. It then created a second TPS designation in 2023 that further expanded the protections so more people would benefit.

In February, the Trump administration ended the 2023 designation, a move which has led to fierce battles in the federal courts. The Trump administration ended the 2021 designation on Tuesday. It is set to expire on Sept. 10.

Wednesday’s announcement will face challenges in the federal courts. Last week, a federal appeals court in San Francisco unanimously affirmed Judge Chen’s decision decision to keep TPS while litigation is ongoing. It also ruled that TPS for Venezuelans should be kept until October 2026, like Chen had ruled in a preliminary injunction in March, because conditions in the country have not improved and Noem had ended it improperly. Venezuelans are now awaiting for Chen in San Francisco to issue a final determination on the matter.

However, earlier this year, the Trump administration went to the Supreme Court asking the nation’s top judges to intervene in the lower court’s case in an emergency order. It ruled that Homeland Security had the authority to end TPS but did not rule on the merits of the case Chen is overseeing or shut down active lawsuits.

In the federal register notice that ended the 2023 designation in February, the Trump administration said that there were notable improvements in areas such as the “economy, public health, and crime” which allowed Venezuelans to go back. It also similarly invoked the argument that the TPS designation was not in the national interests of the United States.

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has targeted Venezuelans through his mass deportation efforts. He has ended a parole program for several countries that allowed over 117,000 Venezuelans to legally live and work in the United States for two years and invoked a wartime act to send hundreds of Venezuelans the government accused of being gang members to a notorious terrorist prison in El Salvador.

The end of TPS also comes one day after the Trump administration blew up a boat, killing 11 people which federal officials say were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua transporting drugs to the United States. Typically, boats engaged in the illicit drug trade would be intercepted at sea by federal authorities and occupants are processed through the criminal justice system.

Adelys Ferro — the director of the Venezuelan American Caucus and who has been involved in the ongoing federal litigation — said that it’s a contradiction that the administration is launching an aggressive campaign against drug trafficking and gangs in Venezuela while saying that Venezuelans in the United States can return.

“We will continue fighting,” she said.

José Antonio Colina, the president of the Miami-based Organization of the Politically Persecuted Venezuelans in Exile, said that his hope now rested on the District Court.

“In the midst of all this political and military situation between the United States and Venezuela, sending Venezuelans back there, where their lives are at risk, is basically exposing them to a death sentence,” he said

""It keeps people silenced, which domestic violence already inherently does; and then you add a layer of immigration status on top of that?","Witnesses say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted outside of the Domestic Violence Courthouse in Chicago's West Loop on Wednesday, taking at least one person into federal custody ahead of their scheduled court appearance.

The incident comes as the Trump administration has been preparing to launch a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago by the end of the week.

The courthouse at 555 W. Harrison St. opens at 8:30 a.m. each weekday. One woman, whose name CBS News Chicago is withholding because of the nature of her case, was set to appear in court at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, but didn't make it there.

According to court records, she wasn't in court because she was in ICE custody.

Witnesses said they saw a man, who they believe to be a federal officer, assist in her arrest outside the courthouse about 15 minutes before her scheduled time to appear.

A victim advocate asked why the woman was being arrested, and said an agent told her, ""We're going to speak to her about her immigration status"" before putting the woman in handcuffs.

CBS News Chicago has learned the woman in this case was an accused abuser, arrested by the Chicago Police Department and charged with two misdemeanor counts of domestic battery.

Court records indicated the charges were dropped on Wednesday.

""Sounds like as soon as we got word, my advocates and a bunch of other advocates and legal aid attorneys came down and started passing out 'know your rights' information,"" said Tessa Kuipers, program director and policy advisor at Family Rescue.

Victim advocates said the incident has people concerned they'll need to choose between reporting domestic violence and facing ICE when they show up to court.

There have been previous reports about ICE agents showing up to the Chicago Immigration Court, but no such reports of them showing up at Domestic Violence Court until now.

After the arrest, standing in the lobby of the Domestic Violence Courthouse, it was clear others decided not to attend their hearings because they were afraid to face ICE.

""My advocates were calling the survivors that had planned to come to court today, and telling them that ICE is there,"" Kuipers said.

Kuipers works as a victim advocate at the courthouse. She said she worries the arrest will deter victims of domestic violence from reporting their abusers.

""Just making people, survivors, unsafer. Obviously, survivors are going to know ICE was here. They're going to have hesitancy about seeking protections, about connecting with their advocate and orders of protection and criminal charges that might be a tool for safety for them,"" Kuipers said.

In a statement, Amanda Pyron, the CEO of The Network: Advocating Against Domestic Violence, encouraged virtual hearings for the courthouse moving forward.

""These actions will undermine survivors' trust in our legal system to be a resource to them and will discourage survivors from coming forward if they fear immigration will be at their next court hearing and take their loved ones,"" Pyron said.

Kuipers said she's already seen a downward trend in survivors showing up to court.

""We've been noticing that this past year that survivors from certain communities feel like it's much less likely for them to pursue legal assistance,"" she said.

Advocates said the fear caused by Wednesday's arrest won't be easily forgotten.

""It keeps people silenced, which domestic violence already inherently does; and then you add a layer of immigration status on top of that? It's silencing people, and it's keeping them in dangerous relationships, and it's making them kind of safety plan what is less dangerous – staying in an abusive relationship or potential deportation,"" Kuipers said.

Under the challenged policy, immigration courts apply mandatory detention provisions typically reserved for individuals apprehended at the border to long-term residents arrested in the interior.
The lawsuit argues this violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides different detention authorities for different categories of individuals.","AURORA, Colorado — The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and a Denver immigration attorney have filed a federal class-action lawsuit challenging what they describe as an unlawful policy by immigration courts that denies bond hearings to immigrants detained in Aurora.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of Nestor Esai Mendoza Gutierrez and others similarly situated, alleges that immigration authorities have abandoned 30 years of established practice by denying bond eligibility to anyone who entered the country without permission.

""About two months ago, there was a 180-degree change in position by the immigration courts in Aurora, categorically denying anybody who ever entered the country without permission from being eligible for bond at all,"" said Hans Meyer, an immigration attorney with the Meyer Law Office who represents the plaintiff.

The policy change affects long-term U.S. residents who have been living in the country for years or decades. Mendoza Gutierrez, the named plaintiff, has resided in the Denver metro area for over 26 years, owns a construction business, has two U.S. citizen children and has applications for immigration status currently pending with the government.

According to court documents, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Mendoza Gutierrez on May 25 following a false accusation that was later dismissed ""in the interest of justice"" by prosecutors. Despite his long-standing community ties, an immigration judge denied his bond request on June 23, ruling the court ""lacks jurisdiction.""

The lawsuit alleges this interpretation contradicts federal immigration law. Meyer explained that, ""for 30 years, the immigration courts have consistently interpreted the federal statute to provide people with the opportunity to seek release on bond.""

The policy shift comes from the Trump administration, and Meyer believes it's an effort to reach or inflate Trump's enforcement goal.

""The suit is to challenge what we believe is an illegitimate practice that's designed to metastasize the immigration detention system and to sort of balloon the number of people that the Trump administration can detain and coerce into taking deportations, as opposed to being able to legitimately fight their cases and maybe obtain status that they're entitled to under existing immigration law,"" Meyer said.

The practice first appeared in Tacoma, Washington. Meyer said Aurora became the second location to implement the new policy. Litigation in Tacoma successfully overturned the administration's interpretation of the statute and agreed that bond should be granted. Meyer and the ACLU hope for a similar outcome in the Colorado case.

Without access to bond hearings, detainees face prolonged detainment while their cases proceed through the immigration system.

""Categorically denying people bond can have them be stuck in detention for anywhere from a set of months to a set of years while they're waiting to get a case adjudicated,"" Meyer said.

The lawsuit argues this creates unnecessary costs for taxpayers.

""For U.S. taxpayers, we're paying corporations over $150 a day to hold a human being in detention for no ascertainable reason,"" Meyer said, speaking about the GEO Group and Core Civic, which are for-profit companies operating detention facilities.

Under the challenged policy, immigration courts apply mandatory detention provisions typically reserved for individuals apprehended at the border to long-term residents arrested in the interior. The lawsuit argues this violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides different detention authorities for different categories of individuals.

The case seeks declaratory relief establishing that class members are entitled to individualized bond determinations and requests that the court vacate the detention policies under the Administrative Procedure Act.

It is estimated that 156,000 undocumented immigrants currently reside in Colorado, with the vast majority having entered without inspection and potentially subject to the challenged policy if apprehended.",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/1fdad244-8ebd-4276-aa5d-0014e5925b40/20250904T002257/1fdad244-8ebd-4276-aa5d-0014e5925b40_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 22:57:39.039514

Similar legal challenges to efforts to deport Guatemalan children are also ongoing in Arizona and Illinois.
The case now shifts from Judge Sooknanan, who was covering emergency hearings over the holiday weekend, to U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly.","Attorneys for Guatemalan migrant children in the U.S. have asked a federal court to extend a temporary ban blocking their deportation, saying that sending them to Guatemala puts them at risk of ""grave and irreparable harm."" They say that last weekend's attempt to hastily remove them in the middle of the night was a violation of their due process rights in the U.S. as well as federal law.

The 76 Guatemalan minors who came to the US unaccompanied and without legal documents were roused from their beds around 1:00 a.m. Sunday, Aug. 31, and brought by immigration authorities onto three planes. One took off, according to the children's lawyers, but turned around after a federal district court judge temporarily blocked their deportation. Attorneys with the National Immigration Law Center who sought that temporary restraining order over the holiday weekend, made a new request Wednesday for a longer-term injunction.

What do we know about these children?

New court papers offer details about the minors, their circumstances of abuse and neglect in their native Guatemala, and their ""harrowing experience during the weekend attempt to deport them from the U.S.

According to court filings a 17-year-old Guatemalan boy says he was awakened at 2 am, was very scared, lost his breath and started to pray. Another says simply she was ""totally traumatized."" One young girl was so scared that she vomited, according to an unidentified witness cited in the papers.

Many of the minors explain why they are ""terrified"" by the prospect of returning to Guatemala after having been threatened by gang members, for example, or having been a victim of human trafficking.

Several share details of ""abuse and neglect"" from family members and one describes how she ""suffered from physical and emotional abuse"" from both her parents.

""They hit me with a belt, with their hands and with sticks, and sometimes I would bleed,"" she stated. ""I fear that if I were to return to Guatemala my life would end.""

Another, who identifies as LGBTQ expressed fear of being raped and forced into a marriage, and stated ""If I had to return to Guatemala, I would kill myself.""

""In the dead of night on a holiday weekend, the Trump administration ripped vulnerable frightened children from their beds and attempted to return them to danger in Guatemala,"" said Efren Olivares, a lead attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.

The judge said her order applied to all Guatemalan minors being held by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which could be as many as 700 children.

Why are they being deported?

The U.S. government says the Guatemalan families of the unaccompanied young migrants sought their return. The Guatemalan government has said it proposed a repatriation plan to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in June. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo said to reporters on Monday that he wanted to prevent vulnerable children from being sent to ICE detention centers. Arevalo said that his officials have ""toured detention centers for Guatemalans"" and were very concerned for the young migrants.

Trump administration officials have denounced the judge's order stopping the deportations.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, wrote on X that the move blocks ""flights to *reunify* Guatemalan children with their families. Now these children have to go to shelters. This is disgusting and immoral.""

Lawyers for the minors dismiss that as a ""false narrative.""

""If these are benign repatriations,"" says Olivares, waking kids up in the middle of the night with no notice, ""is not how that would have happened.""

What is the legal case against the deportations?

Immigration defense lawyers say the move was a blatant violation of the minors' due process rights, as well as immigration and federal laws which entitle the minors to a full opportunity to challenge their removals. They accuse the Trump administration of ""flouting their legal obligations"" to unaccompanied children that were passed by Congress, due to minors' ""unique and vulnerable situation.""

""This is not the government doing international family reunification. It's not repatriation,"" said Gladis Molina, executive director of the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights -- one of several advocates who briefed congressional staffers about the case on Tuesday.

""This is the government trying to put on a veil of legal authority to something that is completely violating international and domestic law,"" said Molina ""It's the turning back of people that are seeking protection under international and domestic asylum law.""

Similar legal challenges to efforts to deport Guatemalan children are also ongoing in Arizona and Illinois.

What does the judge's initial ruling mean?

U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan's early morning emergency order imposed a 14-day freeze on the deportations

Sooknanan ordered the government to ""cease any ongoing efforts to transfer, remove or otherwise facilitate the transport"" of the minors, noting, ""I do not want there to be any ambiguity about what I am ordering.""

In a similar incident in March, a judge attempted to stop the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador. Despite the judge's order, government officials did not turn the planes around midflight.

What happens now?

The case now shifts from Judge Sooknanan, who was covering emergency hearings over the holiday weekend, to U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly. Kelly will hear more arguments from lawyers for both sides.

Lawyers for the Trump administration must file an opposition to the request for an injunction by Sept. 6, and the next court hearing is set for Sept. 10.

Olivares says he and other attorneys will use ""every legal tool … to force the administration to respect the law and not send a child into danger.""

""The Constitution and federal laws provide robust protection to unaccompanied minors specifically because of the unique risks they face,"" he said.

Bataillon last month ordered the release of three other Glenn Valley workers held under similar circumstances.","OMAHA — Again on Wednesday, a federal judge rejected the U.S. government’s effort to deny bond to workers detained and facing deportation proceedings following their arrest in Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods immigration raid.

This time, U.S. District Court Senior Judge Joseph Bataillon presided over a combined hearing in Omaha for three undocumented workers. His decision mirrored that of similar Glenn Valley cases he had ruled on the past several weeks.

Bataillon found that the government was violating due process rights of all three by unlawfully detaining them under an “automatic stay” of a bond an immigration judge earlier had determined was appropriate.

He ordered the detainees to be immediately released upon reposting the respective bond amounts that weeks ago had been set by an immigration judge, but then were swiftly challenged by the federal government.

The three — Sabina Carmona-Lorenzo, Diego Palma Perez and Ernesto Cortes Fernandez — were among about 75 Glenn Valley plant workers arrested during a June 10 workforce enforcement operation led by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

ICE described the operation as a “federal criminal investigation into over 100 cases of stolen identities.” But the three in court Wednesday have faced no criminal charges, their lawyers said. They face administrative offenses and deportation for allegedly being in the country without authorization.

Federal attorneys representing the Department of Homeland Security and ICE challenged the bonds based on new July 8 guidance from the Trump administration that looks to end bond hearings for almost all undocumented immigrants as they fight deportation.

That mandatory detention guidance hangs on a section of immigration law applied historically to newly arrived migrants, not those who, like the Glenn Valley workers, already had been in the U.S. for years, even if they entered without authorization.

Bataillon noted that ICE had arrested the Glenn Valley workers under one provision of the law, but then government attorneys wanted to hold them under the different section of law that applied to migrants who just arrived.

Attorney Christopher Ferretti, representing the feds, said during the hearing that his team still asserts that no-bond should apply. Given “short shrift” in the discussion he said, is the government’s interest in “controlling its borders.”

Jamie Arango, a Lincoln immigration attorney representing two of the Glenn Valley workers Wednesday, said the government’s strategy to prolong detention can drive some migrants to self-deport.

“It’s depriving them of due process,” she said.

Arango said family commitments led her clients to endure more than two months in a North Platte jail. Both have several children, she said, and have been in the country working for decades. “They didn’t want to leave their families behind.”

After release on bond, the migrants’ legal teams still must build cases as to why their clients should be able to remain in the U.S.

Arango said she represents another Glenn Valley worker in a similar situation, awaiting a federal hearing.

Arango said there are numerous people like her clients in Nebraska and across the country. “They’re not letting anyone out on bond,” she said, adding that it is clogging up the immigration justice system.

Grant Friedman of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, who represented Carmona-Lorenzo, said the ACLU has at least one more client arrested in the Glenn Valley raid awaiting a similar hearing.

Bataillon last month ordered the release of three other Glenn Valley workers held under similar circumstances.

Carmona-Lorenzo had been in the U.S. for more than 20 years when she was detained in June, her lawyers said. She and her husband have five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. Three are minors, one is in college, and the other serves in the military.

The Glenn Valley workers’ lawyers challenged the prolonged detention in federal civil rights lawsuits that argue the automatic stay unlawfully violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and goes beyond ICE authority by overriding an immigration judge’s decision on a bond.

“There is no due process when the government, who lost the argument in court, gets to do what they want anyway,” the ACLU wrote.

ICE officials have said repeatedly that the focus after the raid should be on American “victims” whose identities were allegedly stolen by migrants to work at the Glenn Valley plant.

“We’re using every tool at our disposal to put a stop to this behavior,” said Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto.

The operation unfolded at the same Home Depot where federal agents jumped out of a Penske rental van and took a dozen people into custody.

U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, a Biden-era appointee, imposed the temporary restraining order in Los Angeles more than a month ago, but arrests in locations frequented by Latino workers, such as Home Depots and car washes, have become daily occurrences.

“It’s a complete disregard,” said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA. “It’s almost like the rounding up of cattle in the road.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, denies racially profiling people in its efforts to carry out President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda.

“Unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people,"" DHS said Wednesday in an emailed statement. ""What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

The American Civil Liberties Union and Public Counsel, which filed the original lawsuit in July, filed a new motion Tuesday asking Frimpong to order additional evidence from the federal government “in light of apparent violations” of her order.

“This limited discovery is needed to determine whether further action may be necessary to enforce the Court’s TRO and to inform what additional measures, if any, may be needed to ensure compliance with any preliminary injunction the Court may issue,” the motion reads.

It details six arrests in August — three at Home Depots and three at car washes in Los Angeles County — that appear to undermine the temporary restraining order.

In one instance, on Aug. 22, federal agents detained seven people at a Pasadena car wash, including a legal resident, according to the motion. The man was handcuffed and detained despite having proper documentation nearby, the motion said. He was later released but described the incident as “devastating and humiliating.”

Frustrated by the lengthy court battle, immigrant rights' organizers say communities are being torn apart while lawyers file motion after motion. But local officials say the order has been difficult to enforce while litigation remains ongoing.

“We’re using every tool at our disposal to put a stop to this behavior,” said Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto.

Last month, Soto's office led a coalition of 20 California cities — including Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Long Beach — in joining a federal lawsuit alleging that the federal government conducted unconstitutional and unlawful arrests and raids without reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

The organizations asked the court to stop federal agencies from using “disproportionate force,” which has sometimes led to U.S. citizens being detained.

The federal government twice challenged the temporary restraining order, first in the 9th U.S. Circuit of Appeals and then in the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling was upheld in the appeals court, and the Supreme Court has not weighed in on the issue.

The lawsuit is set for a hearing on Sept. 24 for a preliminary injunction that would extend the order as the case progresses through the courts.

Meanwhile, immigration advocates said they recorded more than a dozen arrests at Home Depots and car washes in Los Angeles and Orange counties Tuesday.

Volunteers who witnessed the arrests or went to the scene to help families get information about their missing loved ones said the workers all spoke Spanish.

Eight people were arrested last week outside a Home Depot near a day labor center, which has been the target of at least three previous enforcement actions, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Video shot by immigration advocates and circulated on social media shows federal agents arriving in unmarked cars as workers run, some tripping over themselves.

DHS said in a statement that three of the eight people had “extensive rap sheets,” but did not mention the other five.

“Every day, DHS is enforcing our nation’s laws across all of LA not just Home Depots,” the department said in Wednesday's emailed statement.

The operation unfolded at the same Home Depot where federal agents jumped out of a Penske rental van and took a dozen people into custody.

Joshua Erazo, a day laborer organizer who connects workers with employers at the center, told NBC Los Angeles that the people who were detained included street vendors.

Data compiled by CHIRLA shows that 471 of the 2,800 arrests made by the Department of Homeland Security from June 6 to July 20 occurred in predominantly Latino neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley.

As of Wednesday, Homeland Security has made more than 5,000 arrests in Los Angeles, ""including murderers, rapists, and child abusers,"" it said in the statement.

Believing they have little recourse, some residents have filed individual lawsuits instead of waiting for the temporary restraining order to be enforced.

Lawyers representing a Los Angeles mother took the first step last week toward suing the federal government after her teenage son was detained by agents at gunpoint in a case of mistaken identity. They filed a claim for $1 million in damages for personal injury, including ""assault, battery, false arrest, false imprisonment,"" according to court documents.

Andreina Mejia said she and her son, who is 15 and has special needs, were sitting inside her parked car outside Arleta High School when masked federal agents approached them with guns drawn. They were both pulled out and Mejia was handcuffed while agents questioned her son, she said.

“He didn’t know what was going on,"" she said. ""So, I just told him, ‘Don’t make any movement, don’t move, just follow instructions.’”

Agents asked for the whereabouts of a person whose name her son did not recognize and briefly detained him when he could not provide information, Mejia said. One of the agents appeared to realize they had the wrong person and let her son go, she said.

Mejia and her son are U.S. citizens. Agents said they were looking for a young man from El Salvador.

“The family is Mexican American,” said Mejia’s attorney, Christian Contreras. “It feels as if they were exploited, abused and taken advantage of because of the color of their skin.”

The interaction has left lasting scars on her son, who now suffers from nightmares and sometimes “breaks down” in tears when she’s driving, Mejia said.

“People with the slightest shade of brown in their skin in L.A. fear that they may be the target of immigration officials,” Contreras said. “It’s across the board now.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yjoX8IkcxnarRcRqWI.4iw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/7fc3ea2851650148a91a01ab0228ccf3,N,,2025-09-03 20:57:27.889360

At capacity, the new facility, dubbed ""Louisiana Lockup,"" can hold more than 400 individuals, Landry said.

The individuals are being housed at what was formerly known as ""Camp J"" on Angola's 18,000-acre campus north of Baton Rouge. Camp J used to house ""disruptive"" inmates, but it fell into disrepair, Landry said.

Now, it's been fixed and is climate-controlled, and will house the 'worst of the worst' undocumented immigrants, the Governor's Office said.

As of now, the facility will only accommodate men, but Landry said he's open to discussing housing women as well.

Immigration attorney Glen Wasserstein said housing detainees at Angola would be another attempt to frighten immigrants into self-deporting.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Krisit Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan urged individuals to return home at the press conference.

Critics argue that housing immigrant detainees alongside those convicted of violent crimes raises safety and human rights concerns.

Landry said that Angola prisoners and those being held at ""Louisiana Lockup"" will not mix.

The governor stated that the contract to operate the facility is between ICE, Louisiana's Department of Corrections, and GOHSEP.

It's unclear how much Louisiana is spending and receiving from the feds to run the operation.

One of the deportees has been identified as a Jamaican national who came to the U.S. legally and was convicted of murder. Despite completing his 25-year sentence, the 62-year-old was deported to Eswatini. He had been working in a men's shelter at the time and wasn't accused of any new crimes.

Eswatini is among several African nations that have entered agreements with the U.S. to accept non-citizen deportees. Other countries involved include Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda, each seen as part of a program that has largely operated in secrecy. Several other African nations are reportedly considering similar agreements.

Ariel Ruiz Soto, a Senior Policy Analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told Scripps News Group that while third-country deportations are not new, the current administration is focusing on deporting individuals to more locations at an accelerated rate.

""The key concern is not just the number of people being sent to third countries where they are not from, but also that they are not necessarily given the review and due process to consider their protection or asylum claims,"" Soto said.

Defending this process in a statement to Scripps News, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said, ""The average illegal alien gets far more due process than most Americans. The fact of the matter is those who are in our country illegally have a choice—they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported.""

Human rights and legal advocates argue this expedited deportation process may result in individuals being sent to countries deemed unsafe, potentially violating international law.

The North Carolina court of appeals ordered the board to seek the information from voters before allowing them to vote in future elections, and the Republican-majority board was going to comply before the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and voting rights groups in the state intervened.

The woman was a defendant in a case that was scheduled to be heard 15 minutes later. Her domestic violence charges were dismissed during the hearing, and the presiding judge wrote in a court document that the woman was in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“She had a case here, just trying to come to court,” Hanna said. “That’s the chilling part.”

The woman was the second person detained by immigration officials this week at the courthouse at 555 W. Harrison St., according to Tessa Kuipers, of Family Rescue, who said another person was taken into custody Tuesday. Kuipers said ICE agents hadn’t been spotted at the courthouse previously.

ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration is sending hundreds of federal agents from Los Angeles to a suburban naval base, according to sources with knowledge of the operation. Naval Station Great Lakes, the Navy’s largest training station and the largest military installation in the state, could also be used to accommodate national guard troops.

The plan to target Chicago with a flood of federal resources comes after Trump federalized the police department in Washington, D.C., and deployed the National Guard there to address crime.

Trump previously ordered an immigration blitz in Los Angeles this summer and called in the National Guard in response to protests that at times grew violent.

Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters Tuesday that Trump’s administration may have already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment here. Pritzker also said ICE had informed his office that the agency planned to step up enforcement in Chicago this week.

At the courthouse, Kuipers and fellow advocates passed out “know your rights” flyers and warned those entering the building of the law enforcement presence. An advocate for immigrants said at least one person turned around and left.

Kuipers said just the threat of immigration enforcement has kept some people away from the courthouse over the last year. She said she worries survivors of domestic violence will now become even more fearful.

“They’re going to have hesitancy about seeking protections, about connecting with their advocate, and of course, criminal charges that might be a tool for safety for them,” Kuipers said. “It’s silencing people, and it’s keeping them in dangerous relationships, and it’s making them [consider] what is less dangerous: staying in an abusive relationship or potential deportation.”

The Network: Advocating Against Domestic Violence has encouraged survivors to file for orders of protection online and contact the Illinois Domestic Violence Hotline for legal help.

“This decision to conduct ICE raids at a courthouse — filled with vulnerable domestic violence survivors and their families seeking justice and safety from the legal system — is deplorable,” The Network wrote in a statement. “These raids aren’t creating safety — this is fearmongering and traumatic for survivors of domestic violence and their families.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b4efab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3424+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9a%2F45%2Fe25ca41e4539baf41fba652c5f08%2Ficecourt-090425-08.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 20:57:19.397389

In a 2–1 decision on Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld a lower-court order restoring Slaughter to her post, citing the Supreme Court's 1935 ruling in Humphrey's Executor v. United States, which recognized statutory protections against the removal of Federal Trade Commission members except for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.""

Why It Matters

At the heart of the dispute is whether presidents can unilaterally remove leaders of independent agencies.

The outcome will determine not only the future of Slaughter's tenure at the FTC, but also whether longstanding protections that insulate regulators like the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission from partisan control remain intact, or whether presidents will gain sweeping new authority to remake those agencies at will.

For nearly a century, the Supreme Court has declined to overturn Humphrey's Executor, reaffirming its limits on presidential removal power in a series of cases, even as it has narrowed them in other contexts.

What To Know

In March, Trump dismissed Slaughter, who had been appointed by former President Joe Biden, without providing a reason.

The Trump administration maintained that Congress's limits on removal powers were unconstitutional.

""The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the President's constitutional authority to fire and remove executive officers who exercise his authority,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said after the district court initially ruled against Trump in July.

""The Trump Administration will appeal this unlawful decision and looks forward to victory on this issue,"" he said.

The case illustrates a broader conflict between Trump and independent regulatory bodies. In recent months, courts have considered challenges to Trump's removal of Democratic appointees at agencies including the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.

In June, a federal judge in Maryland ruled that Trump acted unlawfully when he removed three CPSC commissioners without cause. ""The Court finds no constitutional defect in the statutory restriction on Plaintiffs' removal and that Plaintiffs' purported removal from office was unlawful,"" the opinion stated.

Trump has also faced legal challenges for attempting to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, alleging mortgage fraud—a claim she disputes—which underscores that the FTC case is part of a broader campaign to reshape independent agencies.

Supreme Court Signals

The Supreme Court has already shown interest in similar disputes. In April, Chief Justice John Roberts stayed two district court rulings in unrelated cases that had blocked Trump from removing officials at the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board.

That action suggested the justices could revisit Humphrey's Executor, a precedent that has withstood repeated calls for reconsideration but has been narrowed in later rulings.

In Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2020), for example, the Court struck down tenure protections for the CFPB's single director while leaving Humphrey's Executor formally intact. More recently, in Collins v. Yellen (2021), the Court emphasized that the precedent had not been overruled but declined to extend it beyond multimember commissions.

The legal fight over the FTC echoes earlier courtroom showdowns during Trump's first term, when attorneys like Lee Gelernt of the ACLU led successful lawsuits against high-profile administration policies, including the family separation policy at the border.

The Trump administration argues that the FTC's powers have expanded since 1935, making its commissioners more akin to executive officers who should be subject to presidential control. The appeals court majority rejected that reasoning, finding that ""the present-day Commission exercises the same powers that the Court understood it to have in 1935.""

Newsweek reached out to Gelernt via email for comment outside of normal office hours on Wednesday.

What People Are Saying

Judges Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard, both appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote in the majority: ""To grant a stay would be to defy the Supreme Court's decisions that bind our judgments. That we will not do.""

Judge Neomi Rao, appointed by Trump, dissented, arguing that courts ""likely"" lacked power to reinstate an executive branch official during ongoing litigation. Rao also pointed to recent Supreme Court emergency orders allowing Trump to remove other officials while challenges were pending, underscoring her view that reinstatement intrudes on presidential authority.

She wrote that ""an injunction reinstating an officer the President has removed, harms the government by intruding on the President's power and responsibility over the Executive Branch.""

What Happens Next

The next step is almost certainly the Supreme Court, where the Trump administration plans to appeal the D.C. Circuit's ruling reinstating Slaughter. Trump may also seek emergency relief to suspend Slaughter's return to the FTC, as the Supreme Court has granted in other recent removal cases.

The justices are likely to view this alongside similar disputes over the Consumer Product Safety Commission and other boards, making it a coordinated test of whether the Humphrey's Executor precedent still shields independent agencies from at-will dismissal.

If the Court sides with Trump, it could greatly expand presidential control; if not, existing protections for regulators would remain in place.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2714844/rebecca-kelly-slaughter-reinstated.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 20:57:39.524532

Nadine YousifBBC News, Toronto

In a quiet, leafy suburb of Toronto, a 30-year-old Afghan woman spends most afternoons on the phone, hoping she can reach her two younger siblings and father.

They are not in Afghanistan, but instead just miles away, across the border in the US, held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention.

The three have been there in crowded cells for months, stuck in what their lawyers say is a bureaucratic limbo between Canada and the US.

They are eligible for asylum in Canada because they have immediate relatives who are legal refugees in the country, but can only file their claim at the land border - and US officials insist that they will only be released if they enter Canada by air, which they can't do without a visa, their US lawyer told the BBC.

That visa application is currently under review and they remain stuck, currently unable to make a claim in Canada and facing deportation from the US.

From her home near Toronto, ""Asal"" says she has tried everything to get them released. The BBC is using an alias because her family belongs to an ethnic and religious minority group facing persecution in Afghanistan.

She has hired attorneys in both countries to press their case and even offered to cover the costs of ICE agents escorting them to the Canada-US border, to no avail.

The family's case illustrates how some asylum seekers have been caught in rapidly changing policies under the Trump administration, their lawyers and experts say. It also raises questions about whether Canada has a responsibility to expedite entry for people in ICE detention who have ties to that country.

In the meantime, Asal's family members could be sent back to Afghanistan or a third country not of their choosing – ""the scariest move of all"", argues their American lawyer Jodi Goodwin. That option ""puts them at risk of being sent to God knows where, with no assurances of protection,"" she said.

The father had worked with US troops as a contractor, Asal said, making him a potential target for the Taliban if deported back to Afghanistan.

For the last eight months, Ms Goodwin has been working to stop US authorities from sending the family to their native country.

Meanwhile, their lawyers in Canada have been pressing authorities to grant the visas they need to get on a plane. Under an immigration pact between Canada and the US - the Safe Third Country Agreement - migrants without a visa must claim asylum at a land border crossing.

Asal speaks with her detained family when she can. ICE allows online ""visitations"", and she often gets through to her 18-year-old sister.

On a recent call, made using an iPad that she shares with around 80 other cellmates, her sister offered details of her daily life - her struggle to get a good night's rest, her habit of doing the laundry just to keep busy - before she bursts into tears.

In Canadian legal filings shared with the BBC, she states that she has been ""shocked"" by the conditions in ICE detention.

""Every aspect of our life is controlled, even though we are not criminals,"" she said.

She describes being strip searched, served ""nearly inedible"" food and how inmates who refuse to eat are threatened with ""solitary confinement"".

The BBC sought comment from ICE. Administration officials have previously defended reports of poor conditions in migrant detention facilities in the US as false.

Asal and other family say they struggle to get information about the well-being of those detained, including the youngest brother who was admitted to hospital for 10 days due to seizures and who is now back in ICE detention.

'They just didn't get to their paperwork in time'

The first part of the family, which included Asal and two siblings, arrived in Canada in February 2023, she told the BBC.

It was their preferred destination after reluctantly fleeing Afghanistan as violence rapidly escalated after the Taliban took over.

They trekked to Iran and from there to Brazil then up to the US, where they were held by ICE for four days before heading to the northern border and crossing into Canada via Roxham Road, at the time a well-travelled but unofficial crossing between New York state and Quebec. Once in Canada, they successfully filed for asylum.

""It is safe. There is security, and the community is good,"" Asal said.

In August 2024, more family members were able to leave Afghanistan and arrived in Canada following a similar path.

But by the time the final group - her mother and father, and her three siblings - made the trip, politics in North America had shifted.

Roxham Road - that unofficial route for thousands of asylum seekers entering Canada between 2017 and 2023 - had been closed, and the US was struggling to deal with a surge of migrants at its southern border.

After unsuccessfully trying legal options to enter the US from Mexico, in December Asal's family remaining members paid to be smuggled across the border, where they then surrendered to authorities.

In February, Asal's mother and one of her sisters were released shortly after Trump took office and signed an executive order expanding the detention and deportation of migrants, and made their way to Canada.

But the remaining three are still in ICE custody, with US authorities refusing to release them under the new rules, Ms Goodwin says.

The fact they weren't released along with the others in February came down to bad timing.

Ms Goodwin says an official told her ""they just didn't get to their paperwork in time"".

In response to questions from the BBC about the family's case, a senior official with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says, ""ICE would happily return them to their origin country"" should they request a voluntary departure.

They add that the US ""is NOT going to pass off illegal aliens seeking asylum from our country to Canada and vice versa. This is part of being good neighbors and partners"".

Adam Sadinsky, one of the family's Canadian lawyers, said Canada has an opportunity to allow this family to be reunited.

""We don't want Canada to be complicit in this treatment, and the potential result that they could be sent to any number of countries with their own abysmal human rights record,"" he tells the BBC.

Mr Sadinsky also argues that allowing them to enter Canada would be in line with the Safe Third Country Agreement, which contains exemptions aimed at reuniting families.

In a statement to the BBC, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada says it would not comment on the family's case, citing privacy legislation.

The case poses a conundrum for Canadian officials, says immigration lawyer Richard Kurland.

Mr Kurland, who is not involved with their case, told the BBC that allowing entry to the family could set a precedent for others in ICE detention with ties to Canada. ""How can you say 'yes' to just one family, and then, 'no' to everyone else?""

But he adds that he believes both Canada and the US have a responsibility to at least ensure the family is not sent back to Afghanistan.

""It's cruel for the US not to rule out the Kabul flight,"" he said. ""The Americans know what is in store, because they were right there in Kabul for over 20 years.""

For now, Asal and her family in Canada continue to agonise about the case, wishing for a reunion.

""Trust me when I say that I cannot sleep most of the night,"" she said.

But she is hopeful Canadian officials come through and ""that they will not leave us alone in this situation"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6652/live/5a034df0-88cb-11f0-85f1-5f1042c3058b.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 22:57:16.585452

Now it's Chicago and then back to Boston, with more cities planned.","President Trump plans to escalate immigration enforcement in Chicago and Boston, continuing the administration's pattern of targeting Democrat-run cities it views as hostile to Trump's agenda.

Driving the news: A surge of immigration agents is expected imminently in Chicago, and Trump vowed Tuesday to deploy National Guard troops there in a game plan that appears similar to the one that recently boosted arrests and drew protests and outrage in Los Angeles and D.C.

""I'm very proud of Washington, it serves as a template"" for Chicago, Trump told reporters on Tuesday in the Oval Office. ""We're going in.""

His remarks came on a day when a California judge ruled that National Guard troops deployed there in June illegally performed law enforcement duties. The decision applies only to California but could affect how the administration approaches using Guard troops elsewhere.

Zoom in: Trump's immigration and anti-crime crackdowns have been panned by nearly all local and state officials whose cities have been or could be affected — a chorus that includes Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who on Tuesday blasted the plans unfolding in that city.

But it's clear that more cities will see such immigration surges, and possibly troops. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official told Axios that the Chicago and Boston immigration crackdowns would happen ""soon.""

""President Trump has been clear: We are going to make our streets and cities safe again,"" a senior Department of Homeland Security official said in a statement.

""What we are seeing now is a power grab that goes beyond the boundaries of the law,"" Boston Mayor Michelle Wu (D-Mass.) said ahead of the increased ICE presence there.

Immigration advocates in Chicago have been building a broad coalition to oppose the surge of federal agents — and particularly the National Guard — in the city.

The coalition is planning on quick-response protests when members see spikes in immigration enforcement or troops deploying.

""This is a unifying moment for Chicago and Illinois because there are people stepping up and speaking out against the impending occupation, who might not otherwise have spoken up,"" said Brandon Lee of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

The ICE official said the agency is not coordinating with the National Guard in Chicago, as it did in L.A.

Zoom out: Trump's administration repeatedly has targeted sanctuary cities, in which local law enforcement officers don't partner with ICE agents. This prevents coordination for an immigration arrest when someone who is undocumented is released from local custody for any other offense — a primary way ICE makes arrests.

First it was Boston, where a surge of federal agents led immigration arrests to jump from about 300 in January to about 1,500 in May, according to data from the Deportation Data Project.

After the White House encouraged ICE to hit a 3,000 daily arrest quota, Los Angeles was flooded with agents backed up by National Guard troops to protect federal buildings and operations amid protests.

Then D.C. became a focal point, prompting more than 500 arrests.

Now it's Chicago and then back to Boston, with more cities planned.

""You're going to see a ramp of operations in New York, you're going to see a ramp up of operations continue in L.A.... Portland, Seattle, all these sanctuary cities that refuse to work with ICE,"" Trump border czar Homan recently told reporters at the White House.",https://images.axios.com/gkPfH4onMuf0kJi2SiUBSq67p-Y=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/09/02/1756835786400.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 22:57:00.459158

Ramirez (D-IL-3) and 54 other members of Congress in opening a new investigation into the Trump administration’s arrest, detention, and deportation of non-citizen service members, veterans, and military families. The lawmakers wrote to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) demanding an explanation for these practices, which go against decades of precedent and long-standing DHS policy indicating that military service offers protection from immigration enforcement for military service members, veterans, and their immediate family members.

“The Trump administration’s [actions] threaten U.S. national security interests and erode the U.S. military’s credibility when it makes promises to its service members who have put their lives on the line for our country,” wrote the lawmakers.

In April, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rescinded its former policy of considering military service a “significant mitigating factor” when deciding whether to pursue immigration enforcement and issued a new policy less protective of service members and their families.

Following the policy change, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children was detained by ICE during a green card application appointment—despite having lived in the United States for over a decade. Then, in June, a father of three Marines was repeatedly punched in the head by masked ICE agents, and a U.S. citizen who served in the Army was rounded up in an indiscriminate raid and held without explanation. The Trump administration’s actions against veterans and non-citizen military families have even prompted at least one veteran to leave the United States.

Multiple constituents affected by the administration’s reckless changes to immigration protections for military families have shared their stories with representatives in Congress. For example, in Arizona, Maria Pelaez, a mother of an active-duty U.S. Marine, was detained by ICE, and ICE has refused to release her despite a judge’s decision to grant her bond. Additionally, Sae Joon Park, a disabled Purple Heart veteran residing in Hawaii, was forced to self-deport by the Trump administration despite having lived in the U.S. for nearly five decades.

The Trump administration may be targeting military families using information they voluntarily provided to the federal government in connection with their service. When applying for immigration benefits, like “parole in place,” military families provide extensive personal data, including their physical addresses, physically-identifying information like eye color and height, country of birth, and more. Now, USCIS may be using that information to refer service members or their families to ICE for removal proceedings, even if they were previously deprioritized for enforcement actions.

“We demand an explanation for why DHS is betraying its promises to service members who play a key role in protecting U.S. national security,” wrote the members.

The group of lawmakers asked the two agencies to provide, by September 16, 2025: information about the number of non-citizens serving in the military; a list of service members, veterans, and family members who have been arrested, detained, or deported since January 2025; the impact of these new immigration policies on recruitment, readiness, and morale; what information about non-citizen service members and military family members the Pentagon provides DHS and ICE; and more.",https://www.kelly.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Kelly_Favicon-150x150.png,N,,2025-09-03 21:57:20.392747

Jeff Landry and officials with the Trump administration announced Wednesday.

Landry said the facility “will house the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens arrested by ICE.”

A complex at the state prison is already being used to house 51 detainees and has a total capacity of 416.

Joining Landry at the prison to make the announcement were U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheehan, who previously served as Landry’s Wildlife and Fisheries secretary.

“Louisiana, you’re going to be an example for the rest of this country,” Bondi said.

Landry declared a state emergency in late July to allow the expedited repair of Camp J at Angola. The four-building complex had been closed since 2018, with its only use as a quarantine site during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Neither the governor nor Noem shared whether the facility will be used as a post-conviction facility or as another ICE detention center where detainees await charges or trial.

The detainees will join more than 4,000 inmates at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which stands on the site of a former slave plantation that is still a working farm now staffed with prisoners.

Workers on the prison’s “farm line,” who pick vegetables that help feed the prisoners, are currently suing the state, alleging dangerous working conditions. Inmates at Angola can earn a maximum of $8 a week, regardless of the type of work they do.

Landry touted Angola’s natural features, including “forests full of bears” and “swamps full of alligators” as among the new facility’s safety features.

The Camp J section of the prison where ICE detainees are being held was once known as the “Dungeon.” It was designated as solitary confinement to segregate prisoners for disciplinary reasons. Prison officials closed it seven years ago after its cell locks malfunctioned, allowing inmates to evade security checks. Dozens of weapons were discovered after its closure, and more than 80 prison employees quit, retired or were fired related to misconduct at Camp J.

Though it was rumored Camp J would be renamed Camp 47 to honor President Donald Trump, it has instead been renamed Camp 57 in honor of Landry, the 57th governor of Louisiana.

The governor also referred to the facility as “Louisiana Lockup,” a title that was featured prominently on an oversized licensed plate that adorned the lectern he, Bondi and Noem used at a news conference in front of the facility.

Landry’s emergency order in late July suspended state procurement code and public bid law to allow the officials to secure any materials and write or amend any contracts needed to respond to the emergency.

Despite being asked by reporters multiple times, Landry would not disclose how much money the state spent on renovations or operations or whether the federal government would reimburse the state for any of its costs.

Sheehan said the facility has been brought up to ICE standards, and detainees will have access to attorneys and a law library.

Aside from its state penitentiary, Louisiana has become a go-to location for the Trump administration since it placed a heightened emphasis on immigration enforcement in January. The state’s nine ICE processing and detentions centers have a combined capacity of 6,000 people, second only to Texas with more than 28,000.

Louisiana State Penitentiary has room to hold more than 6,000 incarcerated people. Its population was 4,253 as of June 30, according to the most recent statistics from the Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety.

Immigrant rights advocates say the Louisiana ICE facilities have been full for several months because Bondi and the U.S. Department of Justice consider federal courts in the South to be more friendly venues for its immigration cases.

According to data analysis from the Deportation Data Project, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 1,989 people in Louisiana from when Trump returned to office Jan. 20 through June 26. More than half of those arrestees have since been deported or removed from the United States.

The analysis also found that just 6% of ICE arrests in Louisiana over the period were convicted violent criminals.

Critics of the Trump administration’s approach to immigration have called on federal courts to uphold the U.S. Constitution’s requirement of due process for persons who are arrested. They note the vast majority of immigrant detainees have not been allowed to post bail while awaiting trial and are therefore unable to build their defense and secure witnesses.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bondi-Noel-Landry-Angola.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 22:57:25.314822

""This all started on a Monday afternoon, and we were sitting on a bench not knowing what to do and today we're surrounded by a whole community who is willing to support us,"" Issy said.

The family said they were initially allowed to visit with her at the emergency department but later that day were asked to leave. Communication after that was not allowed, and the family says federal agents were outside her door.

Doctor Yusra Hussain was contacted by the family to check on Rodriguez as her primary physician. She's also part of the Healthcare Workers for Palestine.

""I can actually say they were providing her with good medical care, it's just that part of healing is the psychological component that was severely lagging,"" Hussain said.

""The fact that ICE decided they were going to stand watch over this woman while she had medical care and stay there overnight for a few days outside her door, that's a whole new world,"" Hing said.

On Tuesday, a bill that would limit ICE access in healthcare facilities passed the legislature and now heads to the Governor's desk. State Senator Jesse Arreguín authored the bill.

""So this is absolutely critical, because it's happening right now,"" Arreguín said.

Rodriguez's family says the last they know, she was discharged from Stanford on August 29th, and taken to the ICE detention center in Bakersfield.

The president spent part of yesterday dismissing questions about a decline in his health, saying he was, quote, ""very active."" Today, some members of Congress are trying to force a vote to make the Trump administration release the Epstein files. Trump's Justice Department first promised to release more information about Epstein and then abruptly said, move along. Nothing to see here.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is with us now to tell us more about all this. Good morning, Domenico.

DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Michel.

MARTIN: So explain what these lawmakers are trying to do.

MONTANARO: Well, the two members of Congress who are at the center of this effort are Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democrat Ro Khanna of California. Massie filed what's known as a discharge petition on Tuesday. That's a procedural maneuver to try and get around leadership and force a vote. They need 218 House members to sign it and force that vote. It would still need to pass the Senate, though, so this wouldn't force a release on its own. But proponents hope that this'll ramp up political pressure on the administration to do more. To an extent, it's already having an effect. I mean, after the petition was filed, the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee released some 30,000 more pages of documents related to the investigation, but a lot of that information is already public. It's not new. And those in favor of the release - of more release are saying, don't be fooled by that.

MARTIN: So what exactly do those calling for the full release of the files want or expect to find?

MONTANARO: Well, I want to highlight how Ro Khanna describes what this effort and discharge petition are about here on MORNING EDITION on Tuesday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)

RO KHANNA: The petition is about restoring trust in government. It protects victims' identity. It's simply calling for the release of all of the Epstein files to hold rich and powerful men who abused underage girls accountable.

MONTANARO: You know, more than this being about individual men who are Democrats or Republicans, this is seen as a question of who has power, money and influence and how it's used or abused. Very rarely have we ever seen Congress really involve itself in the Department of Justice and its investigations quite in this way.

MARTIN: You know what? We don't want to discount the fact that there are young women here who experienced something terrible, OK? But how much of this pressure is really about political opportunity?

MONTANARO: Politically, a day that's focused on Epstein is a day that is likely more helpful than not to Democrats. I mean, it's an irritant for Trump, especially since he's had a longtime friendship with Epstein. The White House says Trump and Epstein had a falling out in the early 2000s because Epstein was, quote, ""being a creep."" Other reporting has said it was over a property dispute. Nonetheless, there's a lot we don't know about their relationship. The association is certainly something Democrats, though, don't mind reminding people about. And polling has shown big majorities of people don't think the government is being transparent enough and disapprove of how Trump is handling this.

MARTIN: Can you say more about that polling very briefly? Is this something that's resonating with voters?

MONTANARO: You know, it's hard to say that this is going to be something that factors into people's minds more so than, say, prices, crime or immigration. But that's not to say it doesn't matter to people. It's one of the rare areas where we've seen some splits with people who are key in Trump's base.

MARTIN: That is NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thank you.

At least 60 days before a TPS designation expires, the secretary of homeland security, after consultation with appropriate U.S. government agencies, must review the conditions in a country designated for TPS to determine whether the conditions supporting the designation continue to be met and, if so, how long to extend the designation.

United States

DENVER — The ACLU of Colorado, American Civil Liberties Union, and the Meyer Law Office filed a class-action lawsuit yesterday challenging a recent Trump administration policy that ends bond eligibility for millions of immigrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The filing amends a habeas petition brought by Alyssa Reed, of Reed Immigration, LLC, on behalf of Nestor Esai Mendoza Gutierrez, a longtime Colorado resident and small business owner. It also seeks class certification for others in Colorado subject to the new policy.

On July 8, ICE issued a new policy declaring that all people alleged to have entered the country without documentation be denied eligibility for bond during the entirety of their removal proceedings; this would impact millions of immigrants in the country, regardless of how long they have been living in the United States. The lawsuit argues that the new policy is unlawful and a profound and far-reaching departure from longstanding immigration law.

“This illegal policy threatens to imprison millions of hardworking immigrants with no criminal records and deep ties to their communities, with no recourse,” said Tim Macdonald, ACLU of Colorado legal director. “Having secured billions of dollars to build more ICE detention in Colorado and across the country, this administration now wants to fill up its immigration detention centers. This unlawful new policy is a cruel twist on the adage ‘if you build it, they will come.’ Nestor, however, has decided to bravely fight back against this sweeping expansion of ICE’s detention and deportation machine.”

“The brutality of this Trump administration policy is eclipsed only by its intellectual dishonesty and departure from decades of agency practice,” said Hans Meyer, owner of the Meyer Law Office. “This is a fatuous attempt to weaponize immigration detention to illegitimately bolster deportation numbers and intimidate immigrant communities. But ICE is wrong on the law, and we will hold the agency to account for its lawlessness.”

Current federal law mandates detention without bond eligibility only under limited circumstances. The lawsuit asserts that Mendoza Gutierrez and others similarly situated do not meet these statutory criteria that limit bond eligibility.

The lawsuit also argues that Mendoza Gutierrez’s detention without eligibility for bond raises serious constitutional concerns and violates fundamental safeguards for due process. These constitutional protections apply to all people in the country, regardless of immigration status.

“The Constitution guarantees all persons living in the United States rights to due process under the law, full stop,” said Michael Tan, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “The Trump administration seeks to rewrite our constitutional bedrock, denying millions of immigrants in detention facilities the ability to seek bond. But the Constitution doesn't allow the government to lock people up without basic due process.""

“The ACLU and other immigrants’ rights advocates already filed a class-action lawsuit in California challenging ICE’s new bond policy in July 2025. The California lawsuit seeks to represent a class of individuals subject to the ICE policy, as well as a class of individuals denied bond hearings by the Adelanto Immigration Court.

The complaint is here.

“Haitian TPS recipients in Massachusetts are hardworking members of our state economy, often filling critical roles in the health care and elder care industries.
In their brief, AG Campbell and the coalition argue that unlawfully terminating Haiti’s TPS status would separate families, damage economies, deplete workforces, increase health care costs, and harm public health and safety.
Massachusetts is home to one of the nation’s largest Haitian populations, including more than 15,000 Haitian TPS holders.
Massachusetts’s Department of Developmental Services alone employs dozens of Haitian TPS holders, who provide care to some of Massachusetts’s most vulnerable populations.","Boston — Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell today co-led a coalition of 18 attorneys general in filing an amicus brief in Miot, et. al. v. Trump, et al. in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia. The brief supports a challenge to the Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to terminate Haiti’s Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation and strip legal immigration status from hundreds of thousands of Haitians living and working in the United States.

“Haitian TPS recipients in Massachusetts are hardworking members of our state economy, often filling critical roles in the health care and elder care industries. The Trump Administration’s unlawful attacks on Haiti’s TPS designation have no logical basis and are yet another example of his mistreatment of the immigrant communities that make our Commonwealth, and our country, stronger,” said AG Campbell. “I will continue to fight back against illegal policies that harm our state economy and threaten the wellbeing of the roughly 15,000 Haitian TPS holders in Massachusetts and the families, patients, and employers who rely on them.”

TPS is a humanitarian immigration status created by Congress to protect foreign nationals who cannot safely return to their home country because of war, natural disaster, or other extraordinary conditions. TPS allows recipients to live and work in the United States as long as their home country has a TPS designation. Haitian immigrants have been eligible for TPS since 2010, when a devastating earthquake hit the country. The protections have continuously been extended due to unsafe conditions in Haiti, including widespread violence, homelessness, and starvation.

On July 1, 2025, the Trump Administration sought to formally terminate Haiti’s TPS status without any evidence that the dangerous conditions in Haiti had improved and despite the fact that the U.S. State Department continues to classify Haiti as a “Level 4: Do Not Travel” country—its highest risk designation.

In their brief, AG Campbell and the coalition argue that unlawfully terminating Haiti’s TPS status would separate families, damage economies, deplete workforces, increase health care costs, and harm public health and safety. Across states, thousands of TPS recipients providing important public services as health care providers, teachers, entrepreneurs, construction workers, and more would be stripped of their legal status and forced to either face life in uncertainty and vulnerability without legal protections or return to a country that continues to have exceedingly dangerous conditions that pose ongoing risk of violence and human rights abuses.

TPS-eligible Haitians contribute $4.4 billion annually to the U.S. economy. Sixty-nine percent of Haitian immigrants aged 16 and older were members of the civilian labor force in 2022, with high rates of participation in health care support and service industries. Furthermore, a recent estimate found that 75,000 TPS-eligible Haitians work in labor-short industries.

Massachusetts is home to one of the nation’s largest Haitian populations, including more than 15,000 Haitian TPS holders. Massachusetts’s Department of Developmental Services alone employs dozens of Haitian TPS holders, who provide care to some of Massachusetts’s most vulnerable populations. Stripping TPS recipients of their legal status and work authorization will cause irreparable harm to families, workforces, and state economies.

In submitting their brief, AG Campbell and the coalition are asking the Court to grant the Plaintiffs’ motion to postpone the effective date of termination of Haiti’s TPS status, which would protect the hundreds of thousands of Haitians legally in the United States under the program while the litigation proceeds.

Joining AG Campbell in submitting this brief, which she co-led with the attorneys general of California and New York, are the attorneys general of Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

Background President Trump had reportedly flirted with the idea of using military force against drug trafficking organizations during his first term.
With respect to self-defense, the Trump administration has indicated that it is countering the flow of drugs to the United States.
But drug trafficking by itself does not constitute an “armed attack,” nor a threat of an imminent armed attack, for the purposes in international law.
Of a piece with the deployment of troops to U.S. cities, the strike is an unnecessary and performative use of the U.S. military—a use that is legally fraught at best.","On Sept. 2nd, the Trump administration announced what it described as a “lethal strike” against an alleged drug smuggling vessel in the Caribbean. In a post on social media accompanied with a video of the strike, President Donald Trump stated that the attack was “against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists.” Trump also noted that Tren de Aragua had previously been designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). The social media post also asserted that the strike had occurred in international waters and killed “11 terrorists.”

Although the facts are still emerging, the Trump administration’s extraordinary lethal attack on this purported smuggling vessel – and its vow that the strike was a start of a campaign – raise a number of significant potential legal issues. And even apart from these legal concerns, the strike constitutes a deeply troubling gratuitous use of the military that resulted in the unnecessary killing of 11 individuals.

Background

President Trump had reportedly flirted with the idea of using military force against drug trafficking organizations during his first term. Early in his second term, his administration began to cast drug trafficking organizations as terrorists and hinted at possibly using targeted killing tools developed over the last few decades in the counter-terrorism context. In February, the State Department for the first time designated eight drug trafficking organizations, including Tren de Aragua, as FTO). To be clear, this step does not by itself provide authority for the use of force. In the past, however, it has paved the way to military action, including the strike on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.

Certainly, the rhetoric from key figures close to Trump suggests that the administration views FTO designation as a stepping stone to using force. Soon after the designations were publicly revealed, Elon Musk commented on social media that listing “means they’re eligible for drone strikes.” The Trump administration’s “border czar” Tom Homan said in November that the president was “committed to calling [the cartels] terrorist organizations and using the full might of the United States special operations to take them out.” Secretary of Defense Hegseth stressed on Fox News that “all options will be on the table if we’re dealing with what are designated to be foreign terrorist organizations who are specifically targeting Americans on our border.”

The Trump administration would cite the FTO designation of Tren de Aragua and lean further into the use of military tools against the group when in March it invoked the wartime authority of the Alien Enemies Act—and then relied on that authority to rendition hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador.

The September military strike occurs in the context of a broader military deployment to the Caribbean—a deployment reportedly pushed by Secretary of State Rubio to put pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. The deployment includes three destroyers and an amphibious assault group with 4,500 sailors, including 2,500 marines, on board. U.S. forces in the region were further bolstered by a guided missile cruiser and at least one submarine, the nuclear-powered USS Newport News.

Domestic Legal Authority for the Use of Force

A U.S. president may direct the use of military force pursuant to either (1) a congressional authorization for the use of force/declaration of war or (2) inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution, typically as commander in chief of the U.S. military. The scope of the president’s authority to direct the use of force under Article II in the absence of congressional authorization is contested. Although there is broad agreement that the president may use force to repel “sudden attack,” the U.S. executive branch has taken a much more expansive view of the president’s unilateral war powers.

Here the Trump administration will almost certainly rely solely on Article II of the Constitution as the source of authority for the attack on this vessel. Despite labelling the targets “narcoterrorists,” there is no plausible argument under which the principle legal authority for the U.S. so-called “war on terror”—the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force—authorizes military action against the Venezuelan criminal entity Tren de Aragua.

Under the executive branch’s two-prong test for when a president may use force without congressional authorization, the contemplated operation must advance an important “national interest” and must not amount to “war in the constitutional sense,” which the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has recognized as an outer limit on the president’s unilateral warmaking authority. That said, OLC precedent marks out remarkably wide latitude, with the first prong in particular having been critiqued as being unconstraining, and it is not clear whether it would have limited the president in this instance even assuming OLC advice was sought before the strike took place.

Further, though Trump and others in his administration have emphasized the prior designation of Tren de Aragua as an FTO, such designation does not by itself convey authority to use force. Nonetheless, such FTO designations are widely and mistakenly perceived as authorizing such action within the executive branch. Thus, designation of Tren de Aragua and a number of other Latin American criminal entities as FTOs in February foreshadowed this week’s attack in the Caribbean, despite providing no actual legal authority for it.

War Powers Resolution

When the U.S. president directs certain military actions in the absence of prior congressional authorization, those actions must be reported to Congress under the 1973 War Powers Resolution. Further, when U.S. armed forces are introduced “into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances,” the president must not only report the action to Congress within 48-hours but terminate such military action within 60-days unless Congress votes to authorize it.

The War Powers Resolution does not define what it means for U.S. armed forces to be introduced into hostilities. Nonetheless, the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s report on the Resolution explains:

The word hostilities was substituted for the phrase armed conflict during the subcommittee drafting process because it was considered to be somewhat broader in scope. In addition to a situation in which fighting actually has begun, hostilities also encompasses a state of confrontation in which no shots have been fired but where there is a clear and present danger of armed conflict. “Imminent hostilities” denotes a situation in which there is a clear potential either for such a state of confrontation or for actual armed conflict.

Unsurprisingly, the executive branch has espoused different, narrower interpretations of these terms that are less likely to constrain the president’s ability to use military force without congressional authorization. In the most oft-repeated formulation, the State Department’s Legal Adviser informed Congress in a 1975 letter that its working definition of “hostilities” meant “a situation in which units of the U.S. armed forces are actively engaged in exchanges of fire with opposing units of hostile forces.” “Imminent hostilities” means “a situation in which there is a serious risk from hostile fire to the safety of United States forces.”

The executive branch has at times taken the position that supposedly defensive action by U.S. armed forces is exempt from the reporting and withdrawal requirements of the War Powers Resolution because U.S. armed forces were not “introduced” into hostilities, but instead hostilities were introduced to U.S. armed forces. The Biden administration adopted this legal theory to wage a yearslong military campaign against the Houthis without congressional authorization despite the restrictions of the War Powers Resolution.

The White House has in the past sometimes treated U.S. attacks on foreign vessels as introductions into hostilities triggering the War Powers Resolution. This was the case for the 1986 Gulf of Sidra incident involving air and naval fighting with Libya and a 1988 episode during the Tanker War when U.S. helicopters in the Persian Gulf responded to the distress call of a tanker under attack by (presumably Iranian) small boats, were fired on by the boats and returned fire in self-defense.

In my view, the U.S. attack on this supposed smuggling vessel constituted the introduction of U.S. armed forces into hostilities, triggering both the reporting requirements of the War Powers Resolution as well as its 60-day clock for withdrawing U.S. forces. The attack not only resembles previously reported incidents during the Reagan administration, but U.S. armed forces were deliberately introduced into the situation with the U.S. president himself reportedly giving the order to “blow up” the supposed smuggling vessel.

UN Charter

Any use of force by the United States must also comply with the UN Charter—both as a matter of international and domestic law. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter provides that: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”

The UN Charter safeguards states from the use of force. It is not currently clear what states (if any) were impacted by the U.S. attack on this vessel and thus whether Article 2(4) of the Charter is implicated by this strike. According to the Trump administration, the strike occurred in international waters. There is no indication that the vessel was flagged under any country (which would make an attack on the vessel an attack on the flag state in the view of the United States) Although some countries (such as the United States) have in the past treated attacks on their nationals abroad as attacks on the state itself, as of publication no country has claimed the 11 people reportedly killed in this attack and the Venezuelan government claimed the video of the incident was generated by artificial intelligence.

Use of Lethal Force

Working in collaboration with the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy has for many years conducted maritime interdictions of suspected drug smugglers under a law enforcement paradigm—including during the current Trump administration. In such operations, U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement personnel board the suspect vessel and take the crew into custody.

The attack on the smuggling vessel in the Caribbean was so extraordinary because there was no reported attempt to stop the boat or detain its crew. Instead, the use of lethal force was used in the first resort. According to Secretary of State Rubio, President Trump was given the option of conducting a maritime interdiction but instead elected to blow up the vessel to send a message. Such use of lethal force raises a number of distinct legal issues.

Assassination Ban

Executive Order 12333 prohibits assassinations, providing that “No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination.” Under executive branch legal doctrine, “assassination” is understood to include the targeted killing of individuals. (The Uniform Code of Military Justice also of course criminalizes murder.)

Public reporting on the past interpretation of the assassination ban indicates that the U.S. executive branch has recognized two potentially relevant exceptions to the prohibition in recent decades: (1) actions taken in self-defense; and (2) use of lethal force consistent with the law of war.

With respect to self-defense, the Trump administration has indicated that it is countering the flow of drugs to the United States. But drug trafficking by itself does not constitute an “armed attack,” nor a threat of an imminent armed attack, for the purposes in international law. Nor does drug trafficking represent the predicate for self-defense commonly recognized as required for the invocation of self-defense under criminal law in the United States.

The Law of War

Although not explicit, the administration’s framing of its attack on the alleged Tren de Aragua smuggling vessel suggests that it is targeting the group as if it were a terrorist organization with which the United States is engaged in an armed conflict. Such a law of war framework in turn raises a number of subsidiary questions.

Even assuming that Tren de Aragua constitutes an organized armed group (which there is reason to doubt) with which the United States is involved in a non-international armed conflict, it is far from clear that the attack on the vessel and the killing of those aboard was lawful under the law of war. The administration has not sought to explain how either the boat or its passengers were lawful military objectives.

In armed conflict, combatants/fighters (not hors de combat) may be targeted on a status basis. Further, civilians directly participating in hostilities may also be made the object of attack. Smuggling drugs by itself does not render a civilian a combatant/fighter subject to status-based targeting. Nor does it constitute direct participation in hostilities.

Nor has the administration argued that the cargo of the vessels was somehow a lawful military objective and the passengers somehow lawful collateral damage consistent with the principle of proportionality.

Assuming arguendo that the United States is operating under the law of war in targeting this supposed Tren de Aragua vessel, attacks directed against civilians or civilian objects violate the law of war.

Moreover, certain violations of the law of war constitute war crimes under both international and U.S. domestic law. Specifically, the U.S. War Crimes Act criminalizes murder, defined as the

“act of a person who intentionally kills, or conspires or attempts to kill, or kills whether intentionally or unintentionally in the course of committing any other offense under this subsection, one or more persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including those placed out of combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause.”

Many other states not only criminalize this offense but have universal jurisdiction over the crime, regardless of who perpetrates it.

We still lack details about the individuals aboard the targeted vessel as well as the legal rationale for the attack. But if U.S. forces are targeting individuals who are civilians—not qualifying as combatants/fighters or directly participating in hostilities—this raises the specter of accountability under the War Crimes Act.

The Right to Life in Human Rights Law

Such attacks may also violate the right to life under international human rights law. And while the U.S. government has not consistently acknowledged the extraterritorial application of the relevant legal obligation as a matter of treaty law (see this 2014 Just Security symposium for long-running debate on that issue), DoD’s 2024 Operational Law Handbook (pages 98-99) adopts the view that murder is prohibited by a peremptory rule of customary international law applicable even extraterritorially.

An Extraordinary and Unsettling Action

The Trump administration’s military attack on this alleged smuggling vessel is not only extraordinary and unsettling in its own right, but also because of the context in which it occurs and for what it may portend for future action.

The use of lethal force in this attack appears gratuitous and the administration has not explained why law enforcement tools were inadequate to address the situation. Of a piece with the deployment of troops to U.S. cities, the strike is an unnecessary and performative use of the U.S. military—a use that is legally fraught at best. (Indeed, Trump threatened Chicago with a troop deployment in the same Oval Office appearance in which he announced the strike.) And the use of lethal force against these supposed terrorists is ominous both because the Trump administration has vowed further such strikes in Latin America and because this administration has deployed the “terrorist” label more broadly domestically, including against migrants and political opponents.

Congress—which has largely been missing in action this year—needs to reassert its own prerogatives over war powers and the use of these military tools as the White House seeks to further abuse these instruments both abroad and at home.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2232787145.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 19:56:52.711226

“I didn’t think our country would ever get to that point.” Waukegan officials also expressed concern about the federal plans ahead of a Sept. 14 event celebrating Latin American independence.
“This is a fluid situation.” Elizabeth Marrero, one of the organizers of the Waukegan parade, said she plans to make an informed decision about whether to hold or cancel the parade.
Though President Donald Trump keeps talking about sending troops to Chicago, Cunningham worries Waukegan may not be spared.
“They’re (staying) much closer to Waukegan and North Chicago than Chicago,” the mayor said.","Roughly 300 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will be sent to the Chicago area as part of increased operations ordered by the Trump Administration, suburban officials have been told.

With Naval Station Great Lakes serving as the nerve center for the effort, federal officials met with Lake County law enforcement Wednesday morning to brief them on the agents’ arrival and the potential for the National Guard’s deployment, according to Gregory Jackson, the chief of staff for North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. The city’s police chief, Laz Perez, was among those in attendance, Jackson said.

As a result, Rockingham and Waukegan Mayor Sam Cunningham said they are taking steps to ensure the safety of people in their communities, where there is fear of family separation in mixed families where some members are documented and others are not.

“I don’t believe that a time has come in our country where the National Guard and ICE are coming into our community to basically scare the Latino population,” Rockingham said. “I didn’t think our country would ever get to that point.”

Waukegan officials also expressed concern about the federal plans ahead of a Sept. 14 event celebrating Latin American independence. A similar Fiestas Patrias parade and festival scheduled for that day in North Chicago was cancelled on Wednesday afternoon, Jackson said.

Jackson said as many as 300 ICE agents will be part of the operation. The officers will stay in hotels in Waukegan, Gurnee and possibly other area communities. National Guard troops will be used as they were in Los Angeles to protect federal buildings, he said.

Federal buildings in the area include the Navy base, the James A. Lovell Federal Healthcare Center and an FBI firing range in North Chicago, as well as a U.S. Social Security Office in Waukegan.

Along with representatives of law enforcement from neighboring communities, Jackson said U.S. Navy personnel and naval police were at the briefing, as well as representatives of ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Perez declined to comment on the meeting.

With the parade celebrating Mexican Independence Day and the freedom of other Latin American countries still on in Waukegan for Sept. 14, local officials and parade organizers are concerned about the safety of local residents.

Cunningham said due to the influx of federal officials into the area, he and members of his staff spent about an hour with Mexican Consul General Reyna Torres Mendivil discussing ways to keep people safe.

“She will be in touch with the various organizing groups and will advise them on the best way to ensure the safety and security of their families,” Cunningham said. “This is a fluid situation.”

Elizabeth Marrero, one of the organizers of the Waukegan parade, said she plans to make an informed decision about whether to hold or cancel the parade. Her primary concern is the safety of the community.

“We’re watching very closely, and I’m trying to get the feel of the community,” she said. “It is a great concern. It’s 11 days away. We’re going to see what happens.”

Cunningham said his concerns go beyond the parade. Though President Donald Trump keeps talking about sending troops to Chicago, Cunningham worries Waukegan may not be spared.

“They’re (staying) much closer to Waukegan and North Chicago than Chicago,” the mayor said. “I’m worried about ICE in our neighborhoods. Thoughts of that in the Latino community really scares people.

During the Waukegan City Council meeting on Tuesday at City Hall, Cunningham tried to calm people during his opening comments. He said immigrants formed the fabric of Waukegan since its earliest days in the 1800s. It is as true today as it was then, he said.

“We want our community to know challenges may arise, and we will face them together with courage and resolve,” Cunningham said. “The people of Waukegan do not hide from fear. We stand up and support one another.

“That is our stand until this situation has passed us,” he continued. “If we stick together and stay focused on leading our residents through this, this too shall pass.”

With ICE increasing its presence in the area, Mano a Mano Executive Director and Waukegan Township Trustee Dulce Ortiz said Wednesday people must know their rights if they encounter an agent. They are masked and do not resemble other law enforcement officers, she said.

“The Trump administration is terrorizing the Brown community by trying to bring his agenda to us,” Ortiz said.

Should people encounter an ICE agent, she said they have the right to remain silent or ask to speak to a lawyer. If an agent comes to a person’s home, they do not have to open the door unless the person there has a warrant signed by a judge, Ortiz said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ctc-l-federal-deployment001_233915059.jpg?w=1024&h=691,N,,2025-09-03 20:57:23.024495

The Trump administration has claimed the children in question were being sent to Guatemala because their families wanted them back.
“You’re not going to be able to remove any of these children until … I can rule,” she told the government.
One red flag: In Pittsburgh and elsewhere, court hearings for children in the system began disappearing from the master calendar.","A holiday-weekend attempt by the Trump administration to remove hundreds of Guatemalan children — including several in Pittsburgh — from the United States was temporarily halted Sunday by a federal judge in Washington, D.C. But advocates say they doubt the fight is over — and that it already has added to the trauma of children who fled danger to come to the U.S. on their own.

The children, said to number between 600 and 700 nationally, are in the custody of the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, which contracts with service providers to house “unaccompanied minors” until more permanent arrangements can be found. Many of the children, say advocates, fled dangers such as trafficking or violence — from family members, criminals, or military groups.

The children in Pittsburgh are “upset and worried and scared,” said Dana Gold, chief operating officer of Jewish Family and Community Services, which provides the minors with legal representation. “They're in a situation that's totally outside of their control in a country they had hoped to trust.”

The effort to remove the children came with little public warning.

On Friday, CNN reported that the children had been identified across the country for removal in a “pilot program” crafted with Guatemalan officials. Locals worried that children could be removed from local facilities as early as 8 a.m. Saturday morning. That didn’t happen in Pittsburgh, but roundups elsewhere led the National Immigration Law Center to file a suit late Saturday night on behalf of 10 children from around the country, asking U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan to issue a restraining order that would prevent any children from being removed.

The Trump administration has claimed the children in question were being sent to Guatemala because their families wanted them back. Drew Ensign, a lawyer for the government, told Sooknanan in a hearing Sunday afternoon that it was “outrageous” that lawyers for the children were “trying to interfere with these reunifications. “

Sooknanan appeared unconvinced: She cited statements from children expressing fear about their return, and she noted they had been rounded up “in the wee hours of the morning on a holiday weekend” and been placed on airplanes by the time she issued her order.

But an early version of Sooknanan’s order did not make clear whether it protected all 600 children or just those named in the suit. Local attorneys prepared to file a suit on behalf of the Pittsburgh refugees until Sooknanan revised the order to explicitly cover every child the government had deemed subject to removal.

“You’re not going to be able to remove any of these children until … I can rule,” she told the government.

While shelters in other parts of the country reportedly received letters warning them not to interfere with immigration officials, Gold said she was unaware of such a letter being received locally.

Still, she said, children in the Pittsburgh area had been hearing “that children in shelters in another part of the United States were ripped out of their beds in the middle of the night, taken away by people they don't know. … They do not know what's going on.”

Gold was wary of identifying the number of children beyond saying they were housed in ""multiple facilities.” She noted that unaccompanied minors stay in shelters just long enough to find a sponsor — typically a family member in the country — who can care for them while their case makes its way through the system. But sources say the number of Guatemalan minors being cared for locally is currently less than a dozen.

‘A really troubling practice’

As rapidly as the situation unfolded this weekend, there had been recent omens of what was to come. In mid-August, immigration agents sought interviews with refugee children at Pittsburgh’s Holy Family Institute, which has long cared for refugee children, and in similar facilities nationwide.

Holy Family declined to comment to WESA at the time, and Gold said she wasn’t sure what the agents sought to discuss.

But CNN, which first reported on the interviews, called them an ”escalation in the [Trump] administration’s focus on immigrant children.” And observers suspected they were efforts either to lay the groundwork for deportation or to help immigration authorities remove the people who were identified as likely sponsors of the children.

“It’s a really troubling practice,” Keith Armstrong, a fellowship attorney on immigrant-rights issues for the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, told WESA at the time.

“The fact that [immigration enforcement] is speaking with them comes across as intimidation and harassment,” he added — especially for kids who “often have experienced trauma in the past.”

ORR is not an immigration-enforcement agency: It is housed with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services rather than Homeland Security, whose purview includes immigration control. Its function has been to provide support for minors who lack a parent or other caretaker.

But even before this weekend’s events, Jennifer Podkul of the child-advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense told WESA that the Trump administration appeared to be shifting its focus.

She noted that the acting head of ORR, Angie Salazar, is a former ICE official. And Project 2025, a conservative blueprint proposed for Trump’s administration during the 2024 campaign, proposed that the office function more like a law-enforcement agency.

The interviews and shift in priorities are “a core attack on children — some of the most vulnerable kids who are in this country, and who may already have escaped horrific situations,” Podkul told WESA last month.

Word that children in Pittsburgh could be removed began circulating among activists Friday night, though Gold said lawyers were tracking the concern earlier in the week. One red flag: In Pittsburgh and elsewhere, court hearings for children in the system began disappearing from the master calendar.

“It was really alarming when we checked the master calendar hearings and saw our clients — these vulnerable children's names — no longer on the docket where they had been a few hours earlier,” Gold said.

For now, Sooknanan’s order prevents those children from being removed. But advocates doubt it will be the last word.

“Folks sprung into action so that these things could be prevented,” said Monica Ruiz of the local immigrant-advocacy group Casa San Jose. “But I think it’s just temporary. I think [administration officials] are going to figure out a way to do it.”

“I thought the idea was to go after criminals or people who were taking jobs. But this just proves that was never really the goal,” Ruiz added. “A lot of people don’t think this is happening, but it’s happening literally in their backyard. It’s here. It’s really here.”

Gold said that by Wednesday, lawyers hope to have declarations from Guatemalan children about their fears of being returned — statements they will present to the National Immigration Law Center for potential inclusion in the District of Columbia case. More broadly, she said, they are gathering such declarations from every unaccompanied minor housed locally, no matter what their country of origin.

“We're going to begin the process for kids from every nationality,” Gold said. “Because we anticipate that this is something that's just going to continue.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c427b53/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1538x807+0+66/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2Fb8%2F88c2d57543e593e089728994def9%2Ftexas-migrant-children-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 17:57:36.062442

U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, a Biden-era appointee, imposed the temporary restraining order in Los Angeles more than a month ago, but arrests in locations frequented by Latino workers, such as Home Depots and car washes, have become daily occurrences.

“It’s a complete disregard,” said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA. “It’s almost like the rounding up of cattle in the road.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, denies racially profiling people in its efforts to carry out President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda.

“Unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people,"" DHS said Wednesday in an emailed statement. ""What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

Immigrant rights' organizers and local officials say the order is difficult to enforce while the litigation winds its way through the courts.

“We’re using every tool at our disposal to put a stop to this behavior,” said Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto.

Last month, Soto's office led a coalition of 20 California cities — including Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Long Beach — in joining a federal lawsuit alleging that the federal government conducted unconstitutional and unlawful arrests and raids without reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

In the complaint, filed in July by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigration and civil rights groups, they said the federal government's enforcement actions have had a ""chilling effect"" on local communities.

The organizations asked the court to stop federal agencies from using “disproportionate force,” which has sometimes led to U.S. citizens being detained.

The federal government twice challenged the temporary restraining order, first in the 9th Circuit of Appeals and then in the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling was upheld in the appeals court, and the Supreme Court has not weighed in on the issue.

The lawsuit is set for a hearing on Sept. 24 for a preliminary injunction that would extend the order as the case progresses through the courts.

Meanwhile, immigration advocates said they recorded more than a dozen arrests at Home Depots and car washes in Los Angeles and Orange counties on Tuesday.

Volunteers who witnessed the arrests or went to the scene to help families get information about their missing loved ones said the workers all spoke Spanish.

Eight people were arrested last week outside a Home Depot near a day labor center, which has been the target of at least three previous enforcement actions, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Video shot by immigration advocates and circulated on social media shows federal agents arriving in unmarked cars as workers run, some tripping over themselves.

DHS said in a statement that three of the eight people had “extensive rap sheets,” but did not mention the other five.

“Every day, DHS is enforcing our nation’s laws across all of LA not just Home Depots,” the department said in Wednesday's emailed statement.

The operation unfolded at the same Home Depot where federal agents jumped out of a Penske rental van and took a dozen people into custody.

Joshua Erazo, a day laborer organizer who connects workers with employers at the center, told NBC Los Angeles that the people who were detained included street vendors.

Data compiled by CHIRLA shows that 471 of the 2,800 arrests made by the Department of Homeland Security from June 6 to July 20 occurred in predominantly Latino neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley.

As of Wednesday, Homeland Security has made more than 5,000 arrests in Los Angeles, ""including murderers, rapists, and child abusers,"" it said in the statement.

Believing they have little recourse, some residents have filed individual lawsuits instead of waiting for the temporary restraining order to be enforced.

Lawyers representing a Los Angeles mother took the first step last week toward suing the federal government after her teenage son was detained by agents at gunpoint in a case of mistaken identity. They filed a claim for $1 million in damages for personal injury, including ""assault, battery, false arrest, false imprisonment,"" according to court documents.

Andreina Mejia said she and her son, who is 15 and has special needs, were sitting inside her parked car outside Arleta High School when masked federal agents approached them with guns drawn. They were both pulled out and Mejia was handcuffed while agents questioned her son, she said.

“He didn’t know what was going on,"" she said. ""So, I just told him, ‘Don’t make any movement, don’t move, just follow instructions.’”

Agents asked for the whereabouts of a person whose name her son did not recognize, and briefly detained him when he could not provide information, Mejia said. One of the agents appeared to realize they had the wrong person and let her son go, she said.

Both Mejia and her son are U.S. citizens. Agents said they were looking for a young man from El Salvador.

“The family is Mexican American,” said Mejia’s attorney, Christian Contreras. “It feels as if they were exploited, abused and taken advantage of because of the color of their skin.”

The interaction has left lasting scars on her son, who now suffers from nightmares and sometimes “breaks down” in tears when she’s driving, Mejia said.

“People with the slightest shade of brown in their skin in L.A. fear that they may be the target of immigration officials,” Contreras said. “It’s across the board now.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250903-ice-agents-ch-1316-0388cc.jpg",N,,2025-09-03 17:58:08.700423

Encountering Law Enforcement And Military Troops In D.c.. Explore Your Rights.

For the more than 700,000 people who call D.C. home — and the many more who visit the capital every day — the federal government’s militarized presence is impossible to ignore. Armed National Guard troops are stationed in metro stations, at parks, and on popular streets filled with bars and restaurants, costing taxpayers an estimated $1 million a day. Police checkpoints manned by unidentified federal agencies are popping up across the city, waiting to catch someone who doesn’t have a seatbelt on. Armored military vehicles run red lights and cause accidents in quiet neighborhoods, while heavily-armed, often masked federal agents violently arrest people who are immigrants, and people of color while refusing to identify themselves or provide any information to the bystanders trying to help.

Recently, The Washington Post reported that President Trump plans to deploy military troops and federal agents to Chicago this September, and he has threatened to do the same in Baltimore, New York City, Oakland, and San Francisco, disregarding state and local officials who have loudly proclaimed that this would be unwanted and unjustified.

At the ACLU, we are making clear to Congress that troops do not belong on our streets and urging Congress to pass the VISIBLE Act, which would ban federal agents from hiding their identities. We also know that no matter what agency someone is with—whether federal or local, law enforcement or the military—the Constitution constrains how government employees can treat us.

If you’re in a city where law enforcement or military troops are present, it’s important to know your rights. If you are stopped on the street, you may ask, “Am I free to go?” If the answer is “yes,” you are free to walk away. If arrested or detained, you have the right to remain silent. In certain circumstances, you can also refuse searches of your belongings or car. If you witness or document police or military activity, you generally have the right to record in public spaces as long as you do not interfere with law enforcement activity.

If asked about your immigration status, you can remain silent, though if you are not a U.S. citizen, the law may require you to carry with you and provide specific immigration documents for your specific immigration status when an immigration agent requests your immigration papers. If you do not have these papers or if you choose to remain silent regarding immigration or citizenship status, an immigration officer might detain you for longer to verify this information. There may also be immigration and other legal consequences if you make this choice. Never lie or present false documents.

The threats to our rights and safety are real, but so is our power and resilience. Knowing our rights is critical to how we hold power accountable.

Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus recently sent a letter to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing concern over incidents in which her agency and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement have prevented members of Congress from inspecting ICE immigrant detention facilities.

The letter contends that new DHS protocols — which require seven days’ notice for a visit, among other provisions — violate federal law and urges Noem to “immediately rescind the facility visit guidance that impedes congressional access to detention facilities and ensure full compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.”

The ICE facilities, the letter said, “are funded by billions of taxpayer dollars and exhibit persistent issues related to health and safety, human rights, and waste, fraud, and abuse. It is imperative that Members conduct timely oversight to determine whether public funds are being spent as mandated by Congress and ensure the safety and wellbeing of individuals who are detained by the government.”

Vasquez visited the Otero County Processing Center in July where, as Source previously reported, he was unable to speak with detainees; ICE officials were “unwilling and unable” to provide clear answers about their treatment of detainees; and inmate phones were broken and toilets would not flush.

Staff members for U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) visited the Torrance County Detention Facility in May, and heard at least 10 people file complaints with an ICE official for verbal and physical abuse; lack of access to laundry; being forced to wear old, dirty clothing; and lack of medical care, according to a letter Heinrich sent to Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

“Congress needs and must be able to inspect and enforce the inspection of detention facilities,” Vasquez told Source on Wednesday. “Part of our job is oversight of federal facilities like ICE facilities, and we’re being denied that right all across the country. And so this is essentially a letter that spells out what the clear letter of the law is.”

A dozen Democratic members of the U.S. House have also gone to court over being denied access.

“Glendy Marleny Lopez Cano (‘Lopez Cano’), a native and citizen of Guatemala, sought cancellation of removal, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (‘CAT’). An immigration judge (‘IJ’) denied her applications. The Board of Immigration Appeals (‘BIA’ and, together with the IJ, the ‘agency’) affirmed that decision on all grounds. First, the BIA found that Lopez Cano’s petition for cancellation of removal failed because she did not show that her U.S. citizen children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship upon her removal. The BIA held, too, that her withholding of removal petition lacked merit because Lopez Cano did not show the requisite nexus between her past and feared future harm and a statutorily protected ground. And finally, the BIA considered Lopez Cano’s CAT claim waived because she failed to properly challenge the IJ’s ruling on that score. Lopez Cano now petitions us for review. Because we discern no error, we deny her petition. …

“Before the IJ, Lopez Cano recounted the circumstances that led her to immigrate to the United States. Before exiting Guatemala, Lopez Cano worked at a meat shop owned by her father. She described receiving death threats from people she claims were jealous of her father’s success in business and who sought to extort the business. … In her application for withholding of removal, Lopez Cano claimed that the threats were on account of a statutorily protected ground because they were based on her relationship with her father, and she maintained that ‘the Lopez family’ constituted ‘a particular social group’ within the meaning of the relevant statute. 8 U.S.C. §1231(b)(3)(A). …

“Lopez Cano challenges the denial of her application for cancellation of removal on two grounds. First, as far as we can glean, Lopez Cano challenges the agency’s weighing of the facts in concluding that she did not satisfy the hardship standard. She contends that the agency failed to give adequate weight to Tommy’s ‘hardship of not having his mother’s care and presence in the USA.’ Second, she argues that the agency committed legal error by not properly analyzing required hardship factors articulated in In re Matter of Monreal-Aguinaga, 23 I. & N. Dec. 56 (BIA 2001) (henceforth, ‘Monreal’) and In re Matter of Gonzalez Recinas, 23 I. & N. Dec. 467 (BIA 2002) (hereafter, ‘Recinas’). …

“Accepting the agency’s factual findings as they are, and affording deference to the agency, we discern no error in the BIA’s conclusion that Lopez Cano failed to satisfy the hardship standard. The BIA accepted the IJ’s finding that Tommy suffers from anxiety but, like the IJ, found no basis for concluding that the hardship to Tommy, or the cumulative hardship to Lopez Cano’s three children, would be exceptional and extremely unusual. In making that determination, the BIA emphasized the scanty evidence in the record concerning Tommy’s anxiety, which manifested in nail-biting. The BIA pointed out that Lopez Cano did not make clear whether her children would accompany her to Guatemala and, if so, whether Tommy’s anxiety could be treated there. The BIA stated that, without evidence on those matters, ‘the record does not establish that [Tommy’s] health issues are so serious that they rise to the level of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.’ … In addition, the BIA noted that Lopez Cano’s ‘two younger children are healthy and have no problems in school.’ Based on this state of the record, the BIA observed that Lopez Cano failed to show that the difficulty for her children, including Tommy, would be ‘substantially beyond the ordinary hardship that would be expected when a close family member leaves the country.’ Monreal, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 62. We discern no error in that assessment. To the extent Lopez Cano challenges the IJ and BIA’s factual findings, we lack jurisdiction to review that argument. …

“For these reasons, we reject Lopez Cano’s challenge to the BIA’s decision to deny cancellation of removal. …

“Next, we consider Lopez Cano’s challenge to the BIA’s denial of her application for withholding of removal. …

“The BIA held that Lopez Cano did not meet the nexus requirement because she did not show her membership in her family was the reason she and her father were (or would be) targeted. Before us, Lopez Cano only challenges the BIA’s determination that she failed to ‘establish a well-founded fear of persecution on account of her’ membership in the Lopez family. In particular, as far as we can tell, Lopez Cano contends that the evidence in the record compels the opposite conclusion. Not so.

“Nothing in the record compels the conclusion that Lopez Cano’s family will be a central reason Guatemalan criminal gangs would target her. Rather, Lopez Cano’s own testimony supports the agency’s no-nexus finding. … Accordingly, the BIA’s denial of withholding of removal to Lopez Cano is supported by substantial evidence in the record.”

He is a former partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher and a former partner at Sidley Austin. He clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia from 1987-88 and Judge Amalya Kearse from 1986-87.

Yesterday, federal District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that the Trump Administration’s federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles to assist in immigration law enforcement violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which is 18 U.S.C. section 1385. The Posse Comitatus Act bars use of the military for law enforcement, “except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.” The Trump Administration argued that the National Guard authorization statute on which it relied—10 U.S.C. section 12406(3)—is an express exception. Judge Breyer’s ruling to the contrary, at pages 26-32 of his decision, was his core holding. Although the Los Angeles deployment was not about elections, if an appellate court adopts certain arguments made by the Trump Administration in that case, such a decision could set our country on a path to military interference in the 2026 elections.

It would be criminal for any Administration to use the military to interfere with voting or vote counting in any election. In particular, 18 U.S.C. sections 592 and 593 (“Sections 592 and 593”) criminalize both having troops at the polls and military interference with voting, conducting elections, or election officers. These statutes apply to use of both the regular military and members of National Guard units “called into Federal service.” 10 U.S.C section 12405; see also 10 U.S.C. section 10106. Although Sections 592 and 593 apply only to officers and members of the military, 18 U.S.C. section 2 also makes it criminal for others—for example, a member of the Cabinet or a White House official—to aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, procure, or willfully cause violations of Sections 592 and 593. And 18 U.S.C. Section 371 makes it criminal for both military and non-military officials to conspire to violate Sections 592 and 593.

But, in the Los Angeles case, in addition to the Trump Administration’s expansive interpretation of 10 U.S.C. section 12046(3), the Administration has raised three arguments that, if adopted by the Ninth Circuit or the Supreme Court, would disable federal court enforcement of Sections 592 and 593 and thus encourage using the military to interfere in the 2026 elections. The first such Trump Administration argument is that the President has an inherent power to use the military to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions and that this inherent protective power is not subject to federal statutory limitations. One can almost hear the Trump Administration arguing in 2026 that it is using the military to protect the federal function of federal elections. But Judge Breyer’s decision at 33-42 exhaustively surveyed the precedents and correctly decided that any inherent protective power to use the military domestically is subject to federal statutory restrictions. Under this ruling, no inherent protective power would override the statutory prohibitions in Sections 592 and 593 against employing the military to interfere with elections.

The second Trump Administration argument is that it does not matter if deploying the military violates a criminal statute, because federal courts lack the equitable power to enjoin violations of criminal statutes. Judge Breyer’s decision at 46-48 rejected this argument on a number of grounds. Most important for election law, Judge Breyer relied on the history of the Posse Comitatus Act, where its triggering cause was the deploying of the military at elections. “It is ahistorical and illogical to think that Congress reacted to this by passing a statute that had as its sole enforcement mechanism federal prosecution of individual troops by the same federal government that would have ordered the troops to engage in domestic law enforcement.” (P. 48, emphasis in original) This deficiency in the government’s argument would be as obvious for violations of Sections 592 and 593.

The third Trump Administration argument suffers from a similar deficiency. The Plaintiffs in the Los Angeles case sought ultra vires relief as the vehicle to stop violations of the Posse Comitatus Act. Ultra vires relief is a remedy for official actions that lack constitutional or statutory authority. The Trump Administration argued that ultra vires relief should be unavailable for violation of a federal criminal statute. That would mean that the only remedy would be the possibility that the same executive branch that violated the criminal statute would bring a prosecution. Judge Breyer’s decision at 48-50 rejected this argument, commenting that its implications meant the Posse Comitatus Act “would have been ineffective when passed and would remain so today.” (P. 50.) The same absurd implications would apply if ultra vires relief was unavailable to stop military interference with elections that violates Sections 592 and 593.

If an appellate court adopts any of these three arguments of the Trump Administration, such a decision would neuter the federal criminal prohibitions on the use of the military, including National Guard units in federal service, to interfere with elections. These arguments are thus a dagger pointed at elections–the heart of our Republic.

This danger to federal elections is not far-fetched. In December 2020, private counsel working in support of President Trump drafted executive orders that would have deployed National Guard units in federal service to seize voting machines and records. See Brief Amici Curiae of Danforth, et al., at 29-31, filed April 4, 2024, in Trump v. United States, No. 23-939 (U.S. Sup. Ct.). Thankfully, President Trump did not issue those executive orders. If any court adopts any of the three Trump Administration arguments described above, however, next time our Republic might not be so lucky.

We live in an age where what was once unimaginable has become commonplace. The courts on appeal in the Los Angeles case should protect our country by rejecting any Trump Administration argument that would provide a precedent for criminal military interference in the 2026 or subsequent elections. Even for a judge or Justice whose judicial philosophy often supports expansive executive powers, please remember Justice Scalia’s warning against limitless legal arguments: “Fun’s fun, but you can’t die laughing.”

BY EVAN COOPER

The Trump administration has taken a seemingly drastic approach to State Department reform. First, the remnants of USAID were merged into State’s regional bureaus. This was followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s sweeping reorganization, which eliminates most staffing in the Bureaus of Conflict and Stabilization Operations and Population, Refugees, and Migration; the Office of Global Partnerships; and dozens of other offices. The plan also seeks to cut at least 15 percent of State’s U.S.-based workforce through the reduction-in-force procedure and early retirements.

While the attempt to shrink the size of the department is unprecedented, many of the second Trump administration’s State Department reforms are drawn from past efforts by his first administration and others, which ultimately did not stick. They risk failing again for the same reason: a consistent inability to work effectively with Congress. Both sides are at fault; administrations have not engaged Congress to codify reforms for the long term, while the modifications to State that Congress has pushed are done without buy-in from the bureaucracy.

The administration’s “move fast and break things” approach to the State Department is unlikely to work if there is not congressional authorization of these changes, followed by oversight and evaluation of enacted reforms.

Reforms Again and Again

Every administration in the 21st century has attempted to reform the State Department, and some of these efforts are reflected in the Trump administration’s recent moves. For example, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sought to overhaul foreign assistance, trying to align it with the strategic diplomatic goals of the George W. Bush administration while making assistance more transparent and ensuring greater oversight.

This push for reform was “due in large part to the Secretary’s inability to answer congressional inquiries regarding U.S. spending on democracy promotion,” wrote Gerald Hyman in a 2008 report published by the Carnegie Endowment. Similar concerns about democracy promotion spending have been cited by the Trump administration as reason for cutting foreign assistance; moving assistance programs under the purview of the regional bureaus; and drastically shrinking the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.

The Obama administration undertook an even broader approach to State Department reform than the Bush administration, implementing the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR). Ultimately, the QDDR did not live up to its name, with reviews published only in 2010 and 2015. In 2012 a group of senators (including then-Senator Marco Rubio) introduced the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review Act, which sought to codify the QDDR process and authorized the Secretary of State to establish an Office of Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review.

Every administration in the 21st century has attempted to reform the State Department, and some of these efforts are reflected in the Trump administration’s recent moves.

While the QDDR effort obtained support from Congress, there was no institutional buy-in on the State side to facilitate the continuing review process. “Stakeholders largely viewed the resulting document as anchored by wish lists instead of real strategy,” Daniel Runde and Helen Moser wrote in an assessment of the 2010 QDDR process for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. One of the principal recommendations in the 2010 QDDR was that State reduce the use of contractors—a recommendation that was never pursued and has since returned as a goal of the second Trump administration’s State reform agenda.

The first Trump administration did go to Congress with a State Department reform proposal in 2017 that aimed to “improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of the executive branch.” According to the 2021 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, “Congressional Oversight of the State Department: Review of Selected Organizational Reform Efforts,” Congress viewed the “Redesign” plan with hostility and “was able to leverage its oversight authorities to prevent the Trump administration from implementing a major reorganization” of the department. The proposed reforms in 2017 included merging USAID into State; Trump’s team did not seek approval from Congress for such a merger the second time around. The Trump administration appears to have taken the lesson from its first reform effort that it should act without the support of Congress and only later ask Congress to codify the changes it has made.

The Biden administration’s Modernization Agenda took a more focused approach than the first Trump administration and sought to work with Congress to enact its proposed changes. Notably, this led to the creation of the new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which has had bipartisan support from Congress and which the second Trump administration has not sought to eliminate. Other aspects of Biden’s Modernization Agenda, however, that do not enjoy broad congressional support, particularly those related to workforce modernization, have quickly been overturned by the current administration. Republican members of Congress, including Rubio, criticized the Biden administration’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts at State. The incoming Trump administration celebrated its early elimination of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, seeing it as a political win that was unlikely to receive pushback from Congress.

The Way Forward: The Role of Congress

Several lessons from past reform attempts should inform future efforts. The most important is that while reform proposals should come from the executive branch, they must be designed with workforce buy-in and congressional support in mind.

The executive branch decides how to deploy the State Department. To do this, it must understand what the institution’s capabilities and weaknesses are. The executive branch should source ideas from within the department’s ranks and choose which ideas it wants to advance. But those ideas need to be communicated to Congress early on, with a focus on explaining why the changes are needed and identifying how Congress can help sustain any changes past the current administration. Successful reform efforts will not be implemented in four- or even eight-year cycles; they require funding and oversight from Congress and cultural adoption from within the bureaucracy.

To be successful, reforms need to be implemented through a consistent and iterative process, which has thus far been lacking.

Congress’ best tool for implementing reforms is a State Department authorization, but lawmakers have failed to pass a stand-alone authorization bill since 2002. While State Department authorizations have been tacked on to the National Defense Authorization Act for the last three years of the Biden administration, these bills only authorized appropriations on a narrow set of issues rather than broadly authorizing State Department accounts. Furthermore, as the 2025 CRS report “Foreign Relations Reauthorization: Background and Issues” highlights, attaching State authorization to NDAA legislation includes committees in the decision-making that would not otherwise have oversight authority over State. This contributes to the narrowing of the authorizations and prevents funding for new initiatives.

For a future State authorization to be successful, the administration will need to work with Congress, specifically the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to understand what is politically viable. State should strive to make Foreign Service (FS) and Civil Service (CS) officers available to speak with Congress about how structural changes would affect their jobs, which could provide useful information to Congress while helping obtain buy-in from the workforce.

Use the Congressional Commission

The Congressional Commission on Reform and Modernization of the Department of State, which was authorized in 2023 and fully funded in 2024, offers a useful forum for information sharing between the executive branch and Congress. The commission was designed to bring together lawmakers, State’s leadership, and outside experts to elevate not just useful concepts for reform but insights into how they can be implemented. The commission should be utilized by both sides to put forward concepts for reform and test their viability before going through the legislative process. There is a risk that the commission will fall by the wayside under the Trump administration, but members of Congress and the administration should staff and employ the body for their own benefit.

The commission should prioritize engaging the longest-serving members of the FS to develop an understanding of what the opportunities and impediments are to receiving institutional buy-in for reforms. The QDDR was an earnest attempt to implement a procedure that could be adopted by future administrations, but it was so far detached from the experience of State Department personnel that it came to be seen as an aspirational review divorced from practical plans for implementation. High-level reviews that do not receive support from the workforce risk bureaucratic slow-rolling and quiet resistance.

The reform process should engage with employees early and in depth but should not off-load responsibility onto them. There is a risk of tasking the workforce with a burdensome review, only for their own reform proposals to be dismissed; when that happens, the process will ultimately be seen as superficial by those whose buy-in matters most. Mandated integrated country strategies, for example, create a large amount of work for missions but rarely lead to significant policy changes and are thus seen by many in the FS as perfunctory. Asking the workforce to develop ideas for reform without providing the resources needed to implement the ideas is a recipe for a disillusioned bureaucracy.

State Department reform does not have a finish line to be crossed. To be successful, reforms need to be implemented through a consistent and iterative process, which has thus far been lacking. There is a rich body of ideas for changes to State Department operations, but implementation of those concepts has failed because of a disjointed relationship between the State Department workforce, executive branch leadership, and Congress. As the Trump administration attempts to reshape State, it should view both Congress and State’s workforce as integral partners in this process rather than impediments to its vision. It will only be through the work of department staff, funded and overseen by Congress, that any positive reforms will last beyond the current administration.

MARTIN: So you've been telling us that the use of the Alien Enemies Act has attracted many lawsuits.
MARTIN: And the Supreme Court has already issued a few emergency decisions related to the Alien Enemies Act.
Then, in May, the Supreme Court issued an order overnight to stop the deportation out of a facility in North Texas.
Generally, challenges to the use of the Alien Enemies Act has been playing out at individual courts across the country.","MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

And we have one more story that involves alleged gang members from Venezuela. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a late-night ruling blocking the Trump administration's use of an 18th-century wartime power to deport Venezuelans it says are gang members. The administration has been using the Alien Enemies Act to quickly remove people it suspects of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Now the ultimate question of whether the president's invocation of the act is legal could be headed to the Supreme Court. NPR's Ximena Bustillo has been following the case, and she's with us now. Good morning.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.

MARTIN: So you've been telling us that the use of the Alien Enemies Act has attracted many lawsuits. So what is this latest decision?

BUSTILLO: An appeals panel in the 5th Circuit has issued a preliminary injunction which stops the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act as the reason for deporting people. The decision comes out of what is generally considered the most conservative circuit. And in their decision, two judges, appointed by Presidents George W. Bush and Joe Biden, took issue with the use of the wartime power and lack of relief if someone is removed by mistake. One judge, a Trump appointee, issued a dissent opinion.

Lee Gelernt, who argued the case for the ACLU, told NPR that the use of the wartime power to regulate immigration was, quote, rightfully ""shut down."" The administration will have the option of appealing to a wider appeals court. This is expected - that this issue will then make its way all the way up to the Supreme Court.

MARTIN: And the Supreme Court has already issued a few emergency decisions related to the Alien Enemies Act. How is it different?

BUSTILLO: The court has yet to directly address the larger question of whether President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act at all was legal. So far, they've weighed in on ancillary issues, mostly to do with how much notice people are given before their removal. For example, in March, the court ruled that those being deported through the act needed reasonable time to argue against their removals. Then, in May, the Supreme Court issued an order overnight to stop the deportation out of a facility in North Texas. That's a detention facility. Lawyers on behalf of Venezuelans held at that detention facility moved to quickly stop their clients' deportations when they learned that they had only received hours' notice that they were about to be removed using the Alien Enemies Act.

Generally, challenges to the use of the Alien Enemies Act has been playing out at individual courts across the country. District judges in Texas, Colorado and New York have ruled against the administration's use of the act, questioning Tren de Aragua's alleged ties to Venezuelan government and noting that the U.S. is not at war.

MARTIN: OK. So what you're telling us is that there have been a number of setbacks to Trump's use of the law. This is just the latest. Have you observed a throughline to what judges are objecting to?

BUSTILLO: A few things stick out across the various decisions. Judges and justices have often pointed to two main issues. First, the lack of time and notice given to those removed under the act, and second, the absence of remedies in the face of mistakes. In this latest decision, for example, the panel was united in saying that the government is actually providing sufficient notice - about seven days - to those that it wants to remove with the act. There have been challenges over individuals only receiving hours' notice, leading to immigration lawyers arguing that there simply is not enough time for someone to contest their removal.

But one element that the government seems to continuously struggle to refute is the lack of remedies if there are errors. The panel in this case, like others, have raised concerns with the government's responses on how they would navigate mistakes. They also note that the government cites nothing to indicate commitment to not remove a person who is challenging their detention. It remains to be seen what the government argues in court so it can continue to use the law to deport Venezuelans from the country.

MARTIN: That's NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thank you.

BUSTILLO: Thank you.

MARTIN: A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told NPR that, quote, ""this ruling will not be the final say on this matter,"" unquote. The statement went on to say, quote, ""we are confident on our position, and we have the law, the facts and common sense on our side.""

We won this battle against one state mask ban – but we must keep fighting against any other local or state ban in New York.","The Trump administration is waging an all-out war on free speech, the rule of law, immigrant rights, public health, and even taking over American cities. There is no shortage of work to be done by our state and local leaders to defend against these attacks. Yet instead of fighting for our rights, Governor Hochul and several lawmakers spent weeks of their precious time during this year’s legislative session advocating for a mask ban, a policy that plays directly into Trump’s hands.

Everyday New Yorkers, public health experts, and advocacy groups – including Jews for Mask Rights, Jews for Racial & Economic Justice, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action and the NYCLU – successfully defeated Hochul’s push for an all-out mask ban. But the Governor and other anti-mask politicians forced through a provision that creates a new charge for instances when a person “conceals their identity” while committing certain crimes. This means that wearing a face covering alone is not a crime, which is an important victory.

While it’s true that we beat back the originally proposed mask ban, the fight is far from finished.

Mask Bans Proliferate

Local mask bans have already been enacted in Nassau County on Long Island and in Ballston Spa near Albany. And while a complete mask ban did not pass this legislative session, anti-mask advocates have made it clear they’re not content with the narrow restriction that was enacted. They want a full mask ban. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has even floated the idea of a ban that punishes offenders with significant jail time.

Contrary to proponents’ promises, a mask ban will not curb crime or combat antisemitism. It is a performative move that ignores the root causes of crime. Politicians can promote true public safety by addressing people’s most basic needs like housing, health care, and education. And using Jewish safety as a pretext for banning masks actually perpetuates harmful antisemitic tropes about Jews having outsized power over government. It also disregards the root causes of antisemitic hate, and tramples on free speech rights of Jewish people.

A Mask Ban for Thee but Not for ICE

While everyday people face ongoing threats to their right to wear a face covering, local and federal officials are pushing for special rules for law enforcement. Todd Lyons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s director, is fighting to allow ICE agents to conceal their identities for privacy reasons. Here in New York, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman – who fought relentlessly to ban everyday people from wearing masks – is pushing to allow police officers to wear a mask whenever they please. In this scenario, a masked police officer would have legal ground to arrest someone else for wearing a mask.

For those keeping score at home: Mask ban proponents think average New Yorkers must be easily identifiable at all times. But law enforcement agents – who have a long history of abuse and are supposed to work for and be accountable to the public – must be allowed to operate in secret and hide their identities.

Another Tool for Discrimination

Any mask ban, even the limited provision that was passed, is dangerous and puts New Yorkers at greater risk of police abuse, criminalization, and surveillance. We know Black New Yorkers are disproportionately surveilled, arrested, charged, and convicted of crimes, and they are the ones most likely to be negatively impacted by mask restrictions.

More broadly, any mask ban – even one with carveouts for health and religious use – creates a stigma around mask-wearing. A ban will inevitably be selectively enforced and weaponized against New Yorkers of color, Muslim New Yorkers, trans New Yorkers, and those who are disabled – all of whom are already disproportionately targeted, surveilled, and abused by police.

A Public Health Disaster

The push for a mask ban is even more alarming as we face a federal administration fervently committed to defunding our health care infrastructure and spreading misinformation about public health risks, from COVID to the largest measles outbreak in decades.

More than five years on, COVID remains a serious public health threat. Masks also offer protections against other health risks, like a new bird flu outbreak amongst humans and dangerous air quality levels due to wildfire smoke. Banning face masks undermines public health and pushes people with disabilities and those who are immunocompromised further into the margins. This isn’t a hypothetical problem. After a mask ban passed in North Carolina, a cancer patient reported being harassed for masking.

Muzzling Protests

New York’s attempts to restrict mask-wearing are not new – they’re part of our long history of suppressing residents’ First Amendment rights. The State first criminalized masks in 1845 to crack down on rent protests in the Hudson Valley. Law enforcement later used mask bans to criminalize anti-war protestors in the 1960s, people wearing Guy Fawkes masks during Occupy Wall Street in 2011, and more. In 2020, New York rightly repealed its existing mask ban in response to the COVID pandemic.

Anyone questioning why people might want to anonymously protest by wearing a mask should look at the case of Mahmoud Khalil. Mr. Khalil is a lawful permanent resident and recent graduate student at Columbia University who was arrested by the Trump administration solely in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian human rights. He is one of hundreds of other students whom Trump wants to deport for the same reason. And, he was easy to target precisely because he did not mask at protests.

Other Columbia students who publicly advocated for Palestinian rights had their names and faces broadcast on a doxxing truck parked outside the university’s gates. As a result, a prestigious law firm rescinded job offers it had made to two of these students. Across the country, staff and students – including Mr. Khalil – discovered that their names, locations and activities had been publicized on an anonymously run website. The Department of Homeland Security has admitted to consulting this website when targeting international students for deportation.

The administration could decide to expand the parameters of who they catch in this dragnet. Close presidential advisers are openly musing about charging anyone who doesn’t agree with certain Trump policies with providing material support for terrorism. Given this climate, it’s easy to see why a broad range of New Yorkers would want to shield their identity while they exercise their right to protest.

Any mask restriction is likely to be used to selectively criminalize, doxx, surveil, and silence pro-Palestine protestors, immigrant rights advocates, those protesting police brutality, and others speaking out on issues deemed unpopular by police and some politicians. New Yorkers have grown familiar with seeing droves of officers with cameras, police drones, and helicopters monitoring and capturing images of protestors.

Those who choose to wear a mask at protests and in daily life have good reason to do so – to protect themselves from surveillance in an increasingly digital world.

We won this battle against one state mask ban – but we must keep fighting against any other local or state ban in New York. Our leaders should focus on delivering real benefits to New Yorkers and fighting back against the Trump administration. Instead, they worked to make it easier for Trump and other fascist forces to increase discriminatory policing and surveillance, crack down on dissent, and undermine public health.",https://www.nyclu.org/uploads/2025/09/web25-womancovidmasksubway-1200x630-1.png,N,,2025-09-03 17:57:59.340408

ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

In a Tuesday decision a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration’s deployment of Marines and National Guard units to Southern California, where they assisted with immigration and other arrests, was illegal.

In May, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, told Fox News that the administration was “looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day and President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher.”

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it would give more financial incentives to state and local police to cooperate with ICE, including reimbursement for salary and benefits for officers trained in the 287(g) program to assist ICE in making arrests, and “performance awards” for “successful location of illegal aliens.”

“By joining forces with ICE, you’re not just gaining access to these unprecedented reimbursement opportunities — you’re becoming part of a national effort to ensure the safety of every American family,” ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan said in a statement.

Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., decried ""out of control"" violence in the nation’s capital city and revealed that she was assaulted by a gang of youths in the streets of Washington, D.C., before the Trump administration’s takeover.

Speaking with reporters outside the Capitol building during a Republican Study Committee (RSC) press conference on Tuesday, Fedorchak, who is the sole member of the House of Representatives from North Dakota, agreed with her fellow Republicans that congressional action is needed to help keep D.C. safe.

She said she herself was attacked in broad daylight in D.C.’s Navy Yard neighborhood, which is located just a few minutes’ drive from the Capitol and is a popular neighborhood for members of Congress and staffers. The neighborhood is also home to the Nationals' baseball stadium.

""D.C. is a beautiful city. It's an amazing city, and it's the best capital in the world. But it isn't safe. We all know this,"" said Fedorchak. ""Crime in our nation's capital is out of control. If D.C. were a state, it would have the highest homicide rate in the country.""

""In fact, I felt this myself recently in a small way,"" she continued. ""I was walking down the street in July and near my apartment in Navy Yard, not very far from home, and I felt something hard hit me in the in the back of my head. It was broad daylight. I was very startled. I was on the phone at the time, and just as that happened, a pack of juveniles came rushing by on their bikes and I turned to look around and see what had happened. And a large, hard plastic object had been thrown directly at my head.""

""Now that was a small, minor incident. I wasn't harmed, but the young people who did it, did it with reckless abandon and with zero fear of consequences,"" she said. ""They gathered in a circle not far from me after that and sat there and laughed.""

Fedorchak said this assault is just another example of ""how crime is out of control in this city, and there aren't any consequences.""

In August, President Donald Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to place the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal control in response to rampant violent crime in the city. One of the reasons cited by the president was the epidemic of violent youth gangs terrorizing residents in the streets of D.C. In early August, a former DOGE staffer named Edward Coristine was violently assaulted by a group of D.C. youths and left bloodied in the street. Trump called the perpetrators ""thugs"" and vowed to exert his powers to federalize D.C.

Trump Praises Democratic Dc Mayor For Working With His Administration On Crime Crackdown

Fedorchak praised Trump’s crackdown in D.C. and agreed with other Republicans present that more action is needed from Congress to help the president restore order to the city.

""America is the greatest country in the world. There's no reason why our capital should have a violent crime rate higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world,"" she said.

""Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have falsely claimed that D.C. crime stats are at a 30-year low. But let's remember that crime is not just about statistics. It's about people.""

She pointed to the recent killing of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in northwest D.C. in June.

""It's about the mother who sent her child here to intern in one of our offices this summer, never to see him again. It's about all the families who suffer from crime in this very city. It's about the Metropolitan Police Union, who agrees that they are stretched too thin and don't have the resources to take care of crime in this city, and to provide a safe environment. It's about staffers, interns, families and visitors who live with the daily reality of coming to a city that isn't safe.""

Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan., whose office Tarpinian-Jachym was interning with when he was killed, also weighed in during the press conference, calling the murder ""a senseless crime.""

""To this day, it's not been solved by the Washington, D.C., police … That's why I applaud President Trump and the work that he's doing in terms of making sure that we do have a safe capital,"" he said.

Trump Declares Dc A 'Crime Free Zone' Amid His Federal Crackdown

""Yesterday, I was able to walk around the Navy Yard with my daughter, and it was great to see the National Guard out there patrolling around,"" he said. ""It was a safe environment for people to hang out. It was nice. There was a family there having a birthday party for one of their children.""

During the press conference, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., announced that Congress would be asserting greater control over D.C. to ensure the city remains safe for residents and visitors.

""In 1973, Congress granted D.C. limited home rule authority through the District of Columbia Self-Government Reorganization Act, also called the Home Rule Act. In the Home Rule Act, Congress reserves the right at any time to exercise its constitutional authority as the legislature for the district, which includes the right to review and block local legislation before it takes effect. It has now become necessary for Congress to exercise such authority,"" she said.

""Why? Because the D.C. city council is seeking to exercise its authority not for the best interests of its citizens or the broader community, but for political purposes,"" she continued. ""For years now, the D.C. city council has not only prioritized left-wing policies and programs but intentionally sought to hide their activities from Congress. It is a new day in D.C., however, and Congress intends to once again assert its authority to ensure that Washington, D.C., rightfully reflects and represents this great nation on the national and international stage.""

RSC Chair August Pfluger, R-Texas, stated, ""Now, Congress must take the next step and use our Article One powers.""

Sen. Marsha Blackburn Criticizes Democrats Who Make ‘Villains Out Of Law Enforcement’

""We cannot and will not allow D.C. to fall into a hellscape again when the local government fails,"" he added. ""It's our constitutional duty to act. Congress has a clear constitutional authority over D.C., and we will use it without hesitation to continue making D.C. safe and great again.""

In a separate press conference taking place elsewhere at the Capitol at the same time, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also commented on Trump’s D.C. crackdown. He downplayed the crackdown’s success, claiming that ""every single area of criminal activity"" was ""on the way down prior to the arrival of the National Guard.""

Jeffries suggested the crackdown was ""probably the result of Donald Trump trying to figure out a way to change the topic, given his deep unpopularity.""

As the Trump administration continues to pledge to target the worst of the worst criminals in its immigration crackdown, many others are getting caught up in that crackdown.

Last month, 28-year-old community organizer Catalina ""Xochitl"" Santiago was detained by Customs and Border Protection. Despite living legally in the U.S. for years under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, she remains in ICE detention in Texas today.

I spoke with her wife, Desiree Miller, a few days ago.

Desiree Miller, welcome to the ""News Hour."" Thank you for joining us.

Desiree Miller, Wife of Catalina ""Xochitl"" Santiago: Hi. Thank you for having me.

Desiree Miller:

Yes, thank you for that question.

I'm able to speak to her every day. So, we usually talk every morning. And, obviously, there's some really concerning things that she's told me about the conditions inside of the detention.

I think some of the main ones are that people don't receive the medical attention that they need. In particular, there are some pregnant women who don't get medical attention. And a lot of the times, when people ask for medical attention, they're just given water. The water smells weird in there. They have been given food multiple times that it's either expired or makes people sick.

There's a lot of talk about whether or not the conditions are humane or not, but I think that there's no way to make that situation humane when you have ripped someone away from their family.

All of these things that they do to make it seem as if it's humane, letting people talk to their families, having video calls and having these — quote, unquote — ""mental health checkups,"" I think that no mental health checkup is going to make up for the amount of trauma that has been inflicted by being ripped away from their families and trying and having my wife and other people — trying to deport them without cause.

Desiree Miller:

It's a really difficult experience.

I think that knowing also that a lot of times the conditions that she's in, that she's not able to sleep well because they have the lights on all night and the guards are very loud and walk very loudly throughout the whole night, so that they're not able to sleep, it's really hard for me to be out here trying to go about my day, because I still have to take care of her stuff and I still have to work while I'm also trying to just live with this fact that she's in their suffering.

Desiree Miller:

On that day, August 3, she sent me a video of that officer questioning her, the one that is now all over social media, and told me that they had taken her DACA card and were refusing to give it back.

So, after that, I was obviously very concerned. I was texting her and calling her, and I didn't get any response after that. So, for several hours, I didn't know where she was, if something had happened to her, if everything was fine and she was just on the plane, until around 8:30.

One of our friends here received a call from her, and she let our friend know where she was being detained. And that's how we found out where she was at.

Amna Nawaz:

We should underscore here, she's 28 years old. She has valid DACA status, right? She's renewed that several times over the years, which does require verification and background checks and the like.

We did ask DHS about her case. They gave us a statement in which they called her a criminal illegal alien and they also said this in part — quote — ""Her criminal history includes charges for trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia. She will remain in ICE custody pending her removal proceedings.""

So, Desiree, I just want to get your response to that. And, also, is it your understanding that these charges that they reference in the statement, that is the basis for her arrest and potential deportation?

Desiree Miller:

So, DHS in that statement and since then has blatantly lied to try and justify the fact that they are detaining her unlawfully. Her legal team has confirmed multiple times that she has not been convicted of any crime that would cause her to lose her DACA status, nor are there any pending criminal charges against her.

She to this day holds a valid work permit that allows her to work and travel within the United States legally. So, DHS and I don't have any legal basis for why they detained her, why they are holding her or why they are trying to initiate deportation proceedings.

And I think it should be very concerning to everyone that ICE is knowingly holding someone who has protection from deportation under DACA and is claiming that their DACA status doesn't matter.

Amna Nawaz:

You know, the administration, as you have probably seen regularly, puts out information about who they're taking into immigration custody, who they're working to deport. Violent criminals are usually who they highlight in those messages.

And there are absolutely violent convicted criminals among those they're working to deport. That they continuously say that they are working and targeting the worst of the worst, what does that mean to you? What's your reaction to that?

Desiree Miller:

There's a lot. There's a lot of — a lot going on inside me to hear that.

Xochitl is really an example of how they are using this language of calling people criminals, illegal aliens as a way to distract from what the reality is of what they're doing, which is that these are people who they are taking and detaining and trying to deport their people's wives, brothers, sisters, mothers, grandparents.

I think Xochitl is really an example of that, in that she has dedicated her entire life to improving her community in so many different ways, to — to protect people who have immigrated to this country. And now she works in our community.

Desiree Miller:

I'm definitely not an illegal expert. I'm just Xochitl's spouse, who's obviously trying to understand all of this that is national policy unfolding within our daily lives.

I think that we are fully anticipating her to come home to her family, to her community, where she belongs. I think it's horrible that my wife has been used as an example, but I hope that it helps bring light to the reality of what is happening and the dangers that we are facing in this administration.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/Detained-1024x680.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 18:58:23.972638

The workshop was hosted on Zoom by two women living in a state with an abortion ban, tailored for attendees who also live in ​“red” states that restrict abortion to varying degrees, and covering the medical basics about how to self-manage a medication abortion. The majority of the training, however, focused on how participants could pass the lessons along — educating other people about those medical basics, the practical realities of what to expect during a first-trimester medication abortion, how to recognize the signs of problems and, importantly, how to do all this while remaining within the law.

The last part required some role-playing for participants to practice staying within the boundaries of ​“sharing information” without crossing over into anything that could potentially be prosecuted as giving medical advice. At the end, at least a dozen people in states with abortion bans were ready to share information about how to self-manage a medication abortion and to offer emotional as well as informational support to someone through the process.

In addition to everything else this workshop represented, it was also an example of solidarity-based action. We learned a practice, based in the assumption of shared fate, that our own bodily autonomy cannot be separated from the autonomy of others and therefore we need to work together to protect basic self-determination. The ideas of shared fate and shared responsibility lie at the core of solidarity, and present a fundamental challenge to fascism’s emphasis on enemies, on scapegoating the vulnerable for society’s ills and convincing followers that they will be safe from the violence inflicted on others.

In the United States, the word ​“solidarity” has long been associated with labor organizing, but more generally it refers to unity and a sense of common destiny, as expressed in the slogan of a union founded by socialists, the IWW, ​“an injury to one is an injury to all.” In its early use within labor organizing, solidarity was about shared struggle among industrial workers, but more recently it has been used to recognize interconnection across difference.

The ideas of shared fate and shared responsibility lie at the core of solidarity, and present a fundamental challenge to fascism’s emphasis on enemies, scapegoating the vulnerable and convincing followers they will be safe from the violence inflicted on others.

For example, in 2011, Occupy Wall Street invoked cross-class solidarity among the 99% in opposition to policies that favor the wealthiest 1% of society. Both the first and second waves of Black Lives Matter organizing — in 2013 after the murder of Trayvon Martin and again in 2020 in response to the murder of George Floyd — called for interracial solidarity to challenge racist brutality. The Palestine Solidarity movement, as its name suggests, expands the call to the international level, uniting activists across borders and continents to support the human rights of a globally marginalized population.

Loosely speaking, actions based in solidarity involve standing with others in the face of oppression, understanding it as a threat to everyone regardless of who is the immediate target, and sharing resources or practical assistance with those most affected. Examples include union strike funds that pool resources to get through an extended work stoppage, the mutual aid groups that emerged during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, or, less personally, boycotts and divestment. The public health strategy of calling for everyone to stay home before vaccines were available for COVID-19 also reflected a solidarity-based understanding of society, which helps explain why it became a focal point for right-wing outrage.

Solidarity-based abortion activism takes multiple forms, all of which involve active support for someone who is seeking an abortion in ways that fully respect their autonomy. In the 21st century, abortion funds are probably the most visible and longstanding form of solidarity-based abortion work in the United States, offering diverse forms of support that can include driving someone significant distances or providing childcare or a couch to sleep on, as well as financial assistance with hotels, other travel expenses and the abortion itself. The model used by abortion funds draws more on the principles of mutual aid than charity, centering horizontal relationships and mutual respect, locating the work in the realm of solidarity more than service.

Feminist networks that support and enable self-managed medication abortions are another form of solidarity-based abortion activism that has long existed across the Global South, and one which has been increasingly important in the United States since the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision. While it’s difficult to measure something that takes place outside of institutional systems, self-managed medication abortion appears to have increased significantly since Dobbs, especially among those facing significant barriers to care and even more so if telehealth is included. People who self-managed an abortion in the six months following Dobbs were more likely to report getting pills through community networks — including grassroots collectives, abortion providers working outside formal medical systems and people trained through Zoom workshops like the one I joined — than through telehealth or online vendors. That in itself provides statistical evidence of the importance of solidarity-based abortion activism.

These actions directly undermine the dynamics of fascism, including the manifestation we know as the Trump administration, in multiple ways. The scapegoating and dehumanization exemplified by the Trump administration’s relentless legal and social assaults on immigrants, are essential elements of fascist authoritarianism, as is enforcement of traditional binary gender structures. Attacking the rights of women and LGBTQ+ people has been central to the MAGA agenda, as can be seen in abortion bans, restrictions on access to care and legal recognition for transgender people and the policy plans in Project 2025 that guide the Trump administration’s destruction of public health, social services, and civil rights. When routine abortions or care for transgender youth become criminal events — as they now have in almost half the country — and masked agents raid workplaces and seize people at immigration courts, then the act of standing together becomes a profound affirmation of shared humanity.

Solidarity-based actions undermine each of those essential elements of fascism, not least by enabling self-determination for those who have been classified as unworthy or dangerous. The criminalization and scapegoating of marginalized populations and people in marginalized situations require isolation, dehumanization and fear in order to function; when autonomy and self-determination are regained through collective action, this intrinsically challenges the power and authority of fascist systems.

The criminalization of human beings and ordinary life situations — abortions, medical care, court hearings — transforms neighbors and coworkers into strangers and potential threats to society. These forms of repression locate ordinary people as guilty — ​“the worst of the worst” in Trump’s words — and as enemies who deserve to be abused rather than ordinary people who deserve respect.

Solidarity-based actions destabilize those processes through affirming connection and shared fate across difference in the face of assault from the state. Holding that ​“a threat to one is a threat to all” directly contradicts the divisions, fear and scapegoating at the heart of Trump and other fascist regimes.

When routine abortions or care for transgender youth become criminal events—as they now have in almost half the country—and masked agents raid workplaces and seize people at immigration courts, then the act of standing together becomes a profound affirmation of shared humanity.

The power of solidarity-based activism can be seen in the measures taken to repress and prevent it. States have criminalized practical support for people who need abortions or for trans youth, even trying to prosecute parents who support their trans children as child abusers. When a wave of ICE raids in Los Angeles was met this June with sustained community resistance, the Trump administration responded by mobilizing the National Guard and Marines to ​“protect” ICE agents. The relentless repression of Students for Justice in Palestine — including by the Trump administration, which used crackdowns on student protesters as a tool for attacking universities — highlights the powerful challenge that international solidarity with Palestine poses to a politics built on casting entire populations as threats.

The underlying power of solidarity comes precisely from centering interconnection over division, cooperation over competition and a commitment to our common humanity over fear. Movements built on solidarity envision social systems anchored in the core understanding that we have a shared fate, that our ability to thrive is interdependent.

This is why it has the power to fundamentally disrupt systems based in fear, isolation and scapegoating, and rooted in models of competition and scarcity. The far Right and the 1% understand that solidarity is a fundamental threat to their regime and way of life; it’s time for the rest of us to recognize the same — and mobilize our shared power.",https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/in-these-times/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/GettyImages-2226525613.jpg?mtime=1756831317,N,,2025-09-03 15:57:48.232615

In short, the administration envisions dramatically less development spending in the near future.","Official word came Friday that the administration would pursue a pocket rescission of $4.9 billion in international assistance funding. The move sets the stage for a larger fight over Congress’s constitutional power of the purse. Here’s a quick rundown on why and what the rescissions mean for US development policy.

What’s a pocket rescission?

Under the process outlined in the Budget and Impoundment Control Act, to legally cancel previously appropriated funds, the White House submits a proposal to Capitol Hill, starting a 45-day clock. During the 45-day window, Congress must act affirmatively, passing legislation to codify the rescissions—though such measures receive expedited consideration and require only simple majority votes in both chambers. If Congress fails to act within 45 days, the administration is required to spend the appropriated funds as originally intended. The administration’s current approach is considered a “pocket rescission” because the funding it’s asking Congress to cancel is set to expire at the end of September—within the 45-day window. By freezing that funding now, the administration all but ensures the money won’t be spent regardless of whether Congress acts, since the funds will expire before the review period ends. The Government Accountability Office has declared pocket rescissions illegal, but the director of the Office of Management and Budget has made no secret of his desire to challenge impoundment restrictions. And recent revisions to OMB guidance appear to assert expansive executive authority to reclaim previously appropriated funding.

The administration’s action appears highly likely to trigger litigation—and is sure to complicate the FY26 appropriations process in the meantime.

What does this mean for foreign aid?

It’s worth putting these additional cuts into context. Since January, the administration has taken a host of actions to constrain the US role in advancing global development, from dismantling USAID and other small agencies to terminating thousands of awards supporting development and humanitarian programming. But because of Congress’s constitutionally strong hand in the budget and appropriations process, permanently cancelling funding is a taller order. Still, the administration has sought to curb spending in several ways.

The administration’s FY26 budget request revealed plans to scale back foreign assistance dramatically. But even predating the release of the president’s budget, the administration opted to designate emergency funding in the FY2025 appropriations measure only selectively—drawing bipartisan criticism from top Senate appropriators—effectively signaling it would not spend $2.5 billion appropriated by Congress for international assistance. Next, of course, came the high-profile rescissions package submitted in late May, which included more than $8 billion in foreign aid cuts. Congress narrowly approved the bulk of the proposed rescissions, and it was signed into law in late July. The dynamics over multiple fiscal years are important because a lot of foreign aid funding takes a while to get out the door, owing to a raft of requirements from congressional sign-off and agency procurement rules. So very often, federal departments and agencies are in the position of spending down funding from the prior fiscal year.

The proposed rescissions unveiled late last week target largely older funding from a limited set of accounts, with Development Assistance—the bilateral economic assistance funding previously managed by USAID—comprising the largest share.

While we focus here on Development Assistance, other accounts would also see significant haircuts, including another $1.5 billion appropriated in FY25 funding for Contributions to International Organizations, which supports US commitments to several UN agencies, and much of the recent funding appropriated for democracy promotion activities, and hundreds of millions of dollars across accounts to fund assessed and voluntary contributions to international peacekeeping activities.

What is Development Assistance, and what happens next?

Historically, Development Assistance (DA) represented one of USAID’s most flexible accounts, thanks to its broad mandate—though it has regularly been subject to a host of congressional spending directives. Among the development priorities consistently funded through DA have been investments in education, agricultural development, and energy access. And while administration officials have called attention to specific projects they considered wasteful or fundamentally unaligned with administration goals, those awards have already been cancelled—along with life-saving programming.

Congressional spending bills dictate the terms of the availability of provided funding. DA funding is most often provided for a two-year window, but for various reasons, funds can remain in play for longer.

As our colleague Charles Kenny pointed out in a post published last Thursday, there had been many lingering questions about whether the Department of State has the interest or capacity to continue foreign aid delivery at the scale suggested by available funding. To better understand the implications for DA funding as a whole, we’ve done our best to piece things together based on data published by OMB (which was last updated in July) and both rescission proposals.

In short, the administration envisions dramatically less development spending in the near future. A looming question is whether the White House will see a challenge to that vision from Capitol Hill. House appropriators recently advanced a development and diplomacy spending bill that sought cuts that, while quite deep, were not nearly as aggressive as the administration proposed. Likewise, lawmakers don’t seem ready to throw in the towel when it comes to development programming as a whole—specifying a desire to see continued investment in agriculture, education, and even women’s economic empowerment abroad. Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee has signaled plans to move ahead with its own bill markup in the coming weeks.

While the fate of ongoing spending debates remains uncertain, the administration’s continued willingness to circumvent the standard appropriations processes signals the potential for a broader shift in how development policy is executed, regardless of Congress’s intent.",https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/pocket-rescission-blog-collinson-estes.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 18:57:50.359660

Speaking with reporters outside the Capitol building during a Republican Study Committee (RSC) press conference on Tuesday, Fedorchak, who is the sole member of the House of Representatives from North Dakota, agreed with her fellow Republicans that congressional action is needed to help keep D.C. safe.

She said she herself was attacked in broad daylight in D.C.’s Navy Yard neighborhood, which is located just a few minutes’ drive from the Capitol and is a popular neighborhood for members of Congress and staffers. The neighborhood is also home to the Nationals' baseball stadium.

""D.C. is a beautiful city. It's an amazing city, and it's the best capital in the world. But it isn't safe. We all know this,"" said Fedorchak. ""Crime in our nation's capital is out of control. If D.C. were a state, it would have the highest homicide rate in the country.""

""In fact, I felt this myself recently in a small way,"" she continued. ""I was walking down the street in July and near my apartment in Navy Yard, not very far from home, and I felt something hard hit me in the in the back of my head. It was broad daylight. I was very startled. I was on the phone at the time, and just as that happened, a pack of juveniles came rushing by on their bikes and I turned to look around and see what had happened. And a large, hard plastic object had been thrown directly at my head.""

""Now that was a small, minor incident. I wasn't harmed, but the young people who did it, did it with reckless abandon and with zero fear of consequences,"" she said. ""They gathered in a circle not far from me after that and sat there and laughed.""

Fedorchak said this assault is just another example of ""how crime is out of control in this city, and there aren't any consequences.""

In August, President Donald Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to place the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal control in response to rampant violent crime in the city. One of the reasons cited by the president was the epidemic of violent youth gangs terrorizing residents in the streets of D.C. In early August, a former DOGE staffer named Edward Coristine was violently assaulted by a group of D.C. youths and left bloodied in the street. Trump called the perpetrators ""thugs"" and vowed to exert his powers to federalize D.C.

TRUMP PRAISES DEMOCRATIC DC MAYOR FOR WORKING WITH HIS ADMINISTRATION ON CRIME CRACKDOWN

Fedorchak praised Trump’s crackdown in D.C. and agreed with other Republicans present that more action is needed from Congress to help the president restore order to the city.

""America is the greatest country in the world. There's no reason why our capital should have a violent crime rate higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world,"" she said.

""Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have falsely claimed that D.C. crime stats are at a 30-year low. But let's remember that crime is not just about statistics. It's about people.""

She pointed to the recent killing of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in northwest D.C. in June.

""It's about the mother who sent her child here to intern in one of our offices this summer, never to see him again. It's about all the families who suffer from crime in this very city. It's about the Metropolitan Police Union, who agrees that they are stretched too thin and don't have the resources to take care of crime in this city, and to provide a safe environment. It's about staffers, interns, families and visitors who live with the daily reality of coming to a city that isn't safe.""

Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan., whose office Tarpinian-Jachym was interning with when he was killed, also weighed in during the press conference, calling the murder ""a senseless crime.""

""To this day, it's not been solved by the Washington, D.C., police … That's why I applaud President Trump and the work that he's doing in terms of making sure that we do have a safe capital,"" he said.

TRUMP DECLARES DC A 'CRIME FREE ZONE' AMID HIS FEDERAL CRACKDOWN

""Yesterday, I was able to walk around the Navy Yard with my daughter, and it was great to see the National Guard out there patrolling around,"" he said. ""It was a safe environment for people to hang out. It was nice. There was a family there having a birthday party for one of their children.""

During the press conference, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., announced that Congress would be asserting greater control over D.C. to ensure the city remains safe for residents and visitors.

""In 1973, Congress granted D.C. limited home rule authority through the District of Columbia Self-Government Reorganization Act, also called the Home Rule Act. In the Home Rule Act, Congress reserves the right at any time to exercise its constitutional authority as the legislature for the district, which includes the right to review and block local legislation before it takes effect. It has now become necessary for Congress to exercise such authority,"" she said.

""Why? Because the D.C. city council is seeking to exercise its authority not for the best interests of its citizens or the broader community, but for political purposes,"" she continued. ""For years now, the D.C. city council has not only prioritized left-wing policies and programs but intentionally sought to hide their activities from Congress. It is a new day in D.C., however, and Congress intends to once again assert its authority to ensure that Washington, D.C., rightfully reflects and represents this great nation on the national and international stage.""

RSC Chair August Pfluger, R-Texas, stated, ""Now, Congress must take the next step and use our Article One powers.""

Noem: “Actions like this one, targeting DACA holders who are lawfully in the United States, and who have committed no crime, help explain why a majority of the American public disapproves of the Trump Administration’s track record on immigration”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) led 38 Senate Democrats in pressing U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem on the Trump Administration’s wrongful targeting of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in its cruel mass deportation scheme.

The Senators cited a troubling statement from DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in which she said, “Illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportation.” The Senators made clear that McLaughlin’s statement is contradicted by public DHS guidance.

“DACA was created to provide protections from immigration enforcement for certain noncitizens brought to the United States as children, also known as Dreamers, who undergo strict background checks and meet specific educational or work requirements,” wrote the Senators. “In contrast to Ms. McLaughlin’s puzzling statement, public DHS guidance makes clear that DACA holders are ‘not considered to be unlawfully present’ in the United States and that ‘[a]n individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.’”

“We urge you to correct Assistant Secretary McLaughlin’s statement to accurately reflect DACA and ensure that DHS recognizes and abides by the protections of DACA moving forward,” continued the Senators. “Recent enforcement actions against DACA recipients not only appear to violate the Fifth Circuit stay, but also disrupt families, harm communities, and inflict unnecessary social, emotional, and economic costs.”

The Senators contrasted McLaughlin’s statement and the Administration’s actions regarding DACA with the overwhelming public support for Dreamers. They noted President Trump’s previously stated support for protections for Dreamers, and emphasized that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals kept in place protections for current DACA holders and limited to Texas a nationwide injunction on new DACA approvals.

In June, 41 Senators, including Senator Padilla, sent a letter to the Acting Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), urging the agency to resume processing new DACA applications, in line with the Fifth Circuit ruling. Instead, DHS has pushed DACA holders to “self-deport.” The Administration also recently detained a deaf and non-verbal DACA holder with no criminal history, wasting taxpayer dollars and undermining the Trump Administration’s pledge to target the “worst of the worst” violent criminals.

In addition to Padilla, Durbin, and Kelly, the letter was also signed by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and U.S. Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

Senator Padilla previously took to the Senate floor to defend DACA recipients from DHS’ baseless statement and slam the Trump Administration’s push for DACA recipients to “self-deport.” He emphasized that these long-term residents — who were brought to the country as children — have been working, studying, and living legally in the United States since 2012 and are vital members of American communities.

Senator Padilla is a leading voice in Congress for providing long-term undocumented immigrants, including Dreamers, with a pathway to permanent legal residence. In July, Padilla hosted a press conference in Los Angeles alongside immigration advocates, impacted families, and community leaders to announce legislation to expand a pathway to lawful permanent residency for millions of long-term U.S. residents. As Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and mass deportation assaults intensified in Los Angeles, Padilla marked the 13th anniversary of the DACA policy by urging Congress to take immediate action to deliver permanent protections for millions of families, parents, and individuals who are increasingly at risk amid President Trump’s mass deportation agenda. He also delivered remarks on the Senate floor ahead of the anniversary, pushing for permanent protections for Dreamers rather than the indiscriminate ICE raids stoking fear in Los Angeles communities.

Full text of the letter to Secretary Noem is available here and below:

Dear Secretary Noem:

In a recent statement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said: “Illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportation.” In fact, DACA was created to provide protections from immigration enforcement for certain noncitizens brought to the United States as children, also known as Dreamers, who undergo strict background checks and meet specific educational or work requirements. In contrast to Ms. McLaughlin’s puzzling statement, public DHS guidance makes clear that DACA holders are “not considered to be unlawfully present” in the United States and that “[a]n individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.”

Americans overwhelmingly support providing Dreamers a path to citizenship, and in December 2024, then-President-elect Trump stated that he supported protections for Dreamers to remain in the United States. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals kept in place a stay that protects current DACA holders and limited a nationwide injunction on new DACA approvals to the state of Texas. In June, 41 Senators sent United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) a letter requesting that USCIS begin processing new DACA applications, consistent with these decisions.

Instead of doing so, DHS has issued a statement urging DACA holders—who know no home but the United States—to “self-deport.” It was also disturbing to see DHS recently waste taxpayer dollars on the prolonged detention of a deaf and non-verbal DACA holder with no criminal history, contrary to your claims that the Trump Administration is arresting the “worst of the worst.”

Actions like this one, targeting DACA holders who are lawfully in the United States, and who have committed no crime, help explain why a majority of the American public disapproves of the Trump Administration’s track record on immigration.

Please respond to the following questions no later than September 17, 2025:

1. How many active DACA recipients have been detained or deported by DHS since January 2025? Provide a complete record for each DACA recipient, including locations, dates, and case outcomes.

2. On what legal authority does DHS rely to detain or remove individuals with current DACA protections?

3. How is DHS verifying the DACA or legal status of individuals at the time of detention, prior to initiating removal proceedings or deportation?

4. In the instances where DHS ascertains it has erroneously detained or deported an individual, especially if they have a form of legal protection such as DACA, what actions is the Department taking to remedy these situations?

5. What actions are DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) taking to address any errors regarding current DACA recipients and ensure they do not continue to take place as part of the current Trump administration’s immigration enforcement activities?

6. Has DHS shifted its policy regarding these young people despite President Trump declaring his support for protecting Dreamers and DACA recipients?

We urge you to correct Assistant Secretary McLaughlin’s statement to accurately reflect DACA and ensure that DHS recognizes and abides by the protections of DACA moving forward. Recent enforcement actions against DACA recipients not only appear to violate the Fifth Circuit stay, but also disrupt families, harm communities, and inflict unnecessary social, emotional, and economic costs.

Sincerely,

###",https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/cropped-Padilla_Favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-03 14:56:50.097347

“Trump’s Pentagon is drafting plans for a military invasion of Chicago,” Hayes wrote in Organizing My Thoughts.","This week, the Trump administration plans to flood Chicago with federal officers to carry out its anti-immigrant agenda, according to news reports.

“The operation is expected to kick off in Chicago by this Friday and could involve agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and potentially be backed by guard forces in a peacekeeping role, according to multiple sources familiar with the planning,” CNN reported on Tuesday.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) said on Sunday that no one from the Trump administration had contacted him or anyone in his office about the alleged plans.

“So, it’s clear that in secret they’re planning this — well, it’s an invasion with U.S. troops, if they in fact do that,” Pritzker said, per CNN.

Last week, CBS News reported that federal officers will use tactics in Chicago that are similar to those used in Los Angeles, which “included armored vehicles, tactical gear and weaponry.”

In June, the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant raids in Los Angeles prompted mass demonstrations across the city. Despite California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s opposition, Trump sent in thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines to crush the protests. Today, a federal judge ruled that Trump’s deployment of troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the president from using the military to carry out domestic law enforcement activities.

Separately, the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to send federal officers into Chicago and other cities under the pretense of fighting crime, just as it did last month in Washington, D.C. In order to justify his authoritarian tactics, Trump has misrepresented the prevalence of violent crime in D.C. and Chicago, both of which have reported record-low crime rates.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) cooperated with the Trump administration as it deployed federal officers and troops in her city, earning praise from the president and ire from her constituents. Unlike Bowser, Illinois’s elected officials have fought back. In a September 1 post on Truth Social, Trump condemned the opposition from Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D), and others, claiming that D.C. is now a “CRIME FREE ZONE.”

“Wouldn’t it be nice to say that about Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and even the Crime Drenched City of Baltimore???” he continued. “It can happen, and it can happen FAST! Work with us!!!”

On August 30, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order “to protect the Constitutional rights of Chicagoans amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government into Chicago,” the mayor’s office said in a press release, noting that violent crime had decreased in the city.

“With this executive order, we send a resounding message to the federal government: we do not need nor want an unconstitutional and illegal military occupation of our city,” Johnson said in a statement. “We do not want military checkpoints or armored vehicles on our streets and we do not want to see families ripped apart.”

City residents have also been preparing for a possible military occupation. Kelly Hayes, co-host of Truthout’s podcast “Movement Memos,” recently reported on a gathering of dozens of activists in Chicago who met to discuss how best to protect their communities.

“Trump’s Pentagon is drafting plans for a military invasion of Chicago,” Hayes wrote in Organizing My Thoughts. “The people most at risk — unhoused people, trans folks, Black and brown people, disabled people, and immigrants — need more than our fear and indignation. They need robust networks of care and defense in every corner of our beloved city.”

Riverton leaders announced Friday that the Riverton Police Department had entered into a formal accord with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to jointly pursue immigrants in the country illegally. The department joins several other sheriff's offices across Utah and the Utah Department of Corrections in entering into what federal authorities refer to as 287(g) agreements.

Like representatives from other agencies entering into 287(g) accords, Riverton authorities touted the agreement as a way to assure public safety and better fight crime.

""It allows federal immigration authorities and our local law enforcement team to work side-by-side to locate and remove criminal offenders who threaten public safety. By putting federal resources to work here in Riverton, we can better protect our residents, uphold the rule of law and keep our neighborhoods safe from criminal activity,"" reads a joint statement issued Friday by Mayor Trent Staggs and Police Chief Shane Taylor.

No one from Riverton was available on Tuesday to respond to follow-up questions from KSL.com regarding the arrangement.

An ACLU of Utah rep, however, said Tuesday that the rising number of such accords is worrisome to the organization, in part because they could deter some people, particularly immigrants, from seeking help from law enforcement authorities. The link between local law enforcement and immigration officials could spur worries among some immigrants that interacting with police officers or sheriff's deputies could put them on the radar screen of federal immigration agents.

""The 287(g) agreements let the federal government turn local law enforcement into immigration agents, leading to potential discrimination and civil rights violations,"" said Aaron Welcher, spokesman for the Utah civil rights organization. ""This isn't public safety. It makes people afraid to call for help, report crimes or cooperate with law enforcement.""

The growing number of local law enforcement agencies entering into formal agreements with immigration officials has been a point of increasing concern for Utah ACLU officials. Late last month, the organization launched a petition drive to drum up opposition to them. ""These agreements turn local officers into Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, fueling deportations, racial profiling and fear in immigrant communities,"" reads the petition.

Welcher said he's heard particular concern from immigrant advocacy groups in Utah about the impact of the increased cooperation on those experiencing domestic violence. Some facing domestic abuse, he said, ""are afraid to call for help because it could lead to them being detained or deported.""

Utah County leaders' decision last July to formalize a 287(g) agreement between the Utah County Sheriff's Office and ICE sparked intense backlash from some. However, with fighting immigration a priority of the administration of President Donald Trump, other accords involving the sheriff's offices in Cache, Washington and Weber counties, among others, have sparked little to no public clamoring.

As described by proponents, 287(g) agreements facilitate communication with immigration authorities, enabling local law enforcement to determine whether suspects they are dealing with are in the country illegally or face deportation. Local law enforcement officials receive training in accessing federal immigration records and working with federal authorities, aiding with efforts at jails and in the field to identify immigrants in the country illegally.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau's five-year American Community Survey estimates for 2023, 2,314 of Riverton's 44,944 residents were foreign-born. Of those 2,314, 1,049 were naturalized citizens and 1,265 were of some other unspecified migratory status. The 1,265 — 2.8% of Riverton's population — can include immigrants in the country illegally, legal permanent residents, people here on student visas, asylum-seekers and others.",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3108/310841/31084104.jpeg?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2025-09-03 15:57:52.039582

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday confirmed its deportation operations would ramp up in Chicago and other major U.S. cities in the coming weeks. When the new fiscal year kicks in October 1, Immigration Customs and Enforcement can begin tapping billions in new funds from President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. With the agency seeking to hire 10,000 new agents, Americans can expect more violent raids snatching their neighbors off the streets.

The epicenter of America’s anti-immigrant campaign has been Los Angeles and its surrounding cities, where thousands have been arrested since June. Almost every day this summer, federal agents from ICE and U.S. Border Patrol have stalked Home Depot parking lots, car washes, and immigrant communities across Southern California, detaining people based on ethnicity or language.

But as the Trump administration’s war on immigrants expands, so does the resistance against it.

“It’s important that they break LA,” said Ron Gochez, a high school history teacher and leading member of the LA-based grassroots group Unión Del Barrio. “If they break LA, they can break any community in this country.”

Gochez and Unión Del Barrio are a part of the Community Self-Defense Coalition, a network of dozens of grassroots groups. The network conducts daily street patrols to warn their neighbors of possible ICE activity.

Filmmaker Brandon Tauszik embedded with Gochez and other members of Unión Del Barrio throughout the summer for The Intercept. In the documentary film “A City Fights Back: How LA Defends Itself Against ICE,” activists show a multifaceted strategy of opposition. They drive the streets in search of federal agents, monitor highway off-ramps to flag suspicious cars entering their communities, organize protests, and recruit and train new members willing to combat ICE.

For Gochez, a high school teacher and a father, the stakes are increasingly personal.

On August 8, federal agents snatched up high school student Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, 18, while he was walking his dog in Van Nuys, days before he was set to begin his senior year at Reseda Charter High School. He remains in ICE detention at a privately owned facility 80 miles away in Adelanto, California. Days later, agents detained at gunpoint Nathan Mejia, 15, outside of Arleta High School before releasing him later that day.

Both Mejia and Guerrero-Cruz are students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, where Gochez teaches. In the film, he reflects on how his fight is intertwined with that of the next generation.

“It’s a constant reminder why we struggle and why we do what we do,” he says, while playing with his son. “One day when we’re no longer here and he’ll be here, and maybe his children, they’ll have a better life than what we had and what our parents had — so we’re fighting for the next seven generations, and he’s next up.”

Asked by reporters in the Oval Office about sending National Guard troops to the nation’s third-largest city, Trump said, “We’re going in.""

“I have an obligation,” the president said. ”This isn’t a political thing.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other local leaders gave an update after Trump spoke, scoffing at the notion of sending military troops and federal agents into Chicago and reiterating that federal intervention was not required or wanted.

Trump has already sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles and Washington, where he’s also federalized the police force. He has said he plans similar moves in other Democrat-run cities even as a federal judge on Tuesday deemed the California deployment illegal.

But when exactly could federal troops, including the National Guard and Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) deploy in Chicago? Here's what we know right now.

ICE in Chicago, Illinois

The state received its first contact about federal intervention on Saturday when the head of the Illinois State Police got a call from Gregory Bovino, chief of the Border Patrol’s El Centro, California, sector, Pritzker said during Tuesday's update.

The comments come just hours after Pritzker confirmed to NBC Chicago’s Mary Ann Ahern that ICE agents will be conducting enhanced immigration enforcement operations in the city in coming days.

""In the coming days, we expect to see what has played out in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., to happen here in Chicago,"" Pritzker said ""First, Donald Trump is positioning armed federal agents and staging military vehicles on federal property such as the Great Lakes Naval Base. It is likely those agents will be with ICE, Customs and Border Patrol, the Department of Homeland Security and other similarly situated federal agencies. Many of these individuals are being relocated from Los Angeles for deployment in Chicago. We believe that staging that has already begun started yesterday and continues into today.""

The governor warned that ""unidentifiable agents in unmarked vehicles with masks are planning to raid Latino communities and say they're targeting violent criminals,"" while noting that timing of such a deployment could be intentional.

""We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,"" Pritzker said. ""It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades. Let's be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here.""

""[They said] they will begin operations here sometime in the coming week,"" Pritzker said in an exclusive interview with NBC Chicago earlier Tuesday. ""That - literally after two weeks of all this talk about troops on the ground - that's the first time we've heard from the federal government on this.""

A report from The New York Times said Homeland Security officials requested to use Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago for their operations, which would include space for 250 department personnel plus a “Tactical Operations Center” and an “Incident Command Post,” as well as bathrooms, laundry, parking for 140 vehicles and storage space for medical supplies and weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas.

National Guard in Chicago, Illinois

While the deployment of the National Guard still has not been made official, Pritzker said he received reports that the Trump administration ""has already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment in Illinois,"" though sources in the Texas governor's office told NBC Chicago that is not accurate.

While no official announcement has been made, the Trump administration has reportedly been planning to send National Guard members to Chicago in similar fashion to the way they were deployed to Washington, D.C. in recent weeks, according to the National Guard and other outlets.

Speaking in the Oval Office Tuesday, Trump said the decision to send in federal assets was not “a political thing,” but promised that intervention would soon occur in Chicago.

“We’re going in,” he said. “I didn’t say when, but we’re going in.”

A spokesperson for the Illinois National Guard also confirmed Tuesday ""we don't have an order for a mission in Chicago.""

Trump cited statistics on shootings in Chicago over the Labor Day weekend during his remarks, with eight people killed and 50 wounded in 37 different shooting incidents, according to Chicago police data.

The president claimed Chicago is less safe than Afghanistan, and described Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker as a “terrible governor,"" saying his refusal to ask the administration for help is making the city’s residents less safe.

""If the governor of Illinois would call me up, I would love to do it,” he said. “Now, we're going to do it anyway. We have a right to do it.”

Pritzker responded by saying, ""I refuse to play a reality game show with Donald Trump again.""

""When did we become a country where it's OK for the US president to insist on national television that a state should call him to beg for anything, especially something we don't want? Have we truly lost all sense of sanity in this nation that we treat this as normal?"" Pritzker said.

Is it legal?

Pritzker and other Illinois officials have argued the Trump administration does not have the right to send National Guard members to Chicago for law enforcement operations, with pledges to fight any such actions in court.

In California this week, a judge ruled that the Trump administration had violated the Posse Comitatus Act when it sent the National Guard into Los Angeles during June protests and unrest in the city. District Judge Charles Breyer cited the 19th century law, which nearly fully prohibits the use of military assets in a law enforcement capacity, and said the administration’s actions ran afoul of the law.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said Trump's latest comments on Chicago were not enough confirmation to begin legal proceedings before operations begin, however.

""'We're going in' is not enough,"" Raoul said.

Pritzker urged residents to keep protests against potential deployments ""peaceful.""

""We know, before anything has happened here, that the Trump plan is to use any excuse to deploy armed military personnel to Chicago. If someone flings a sandwich at an ICE agent, Trump will try and go on TV and declare an emergency in Chicago,"" Pritzker said. ""I'm imploring everyone, if and when that happens, do not take the bait.""

Crime in Chicago

Johnson said violence in the city stems from guns on the streets that are trafficked to Illinois from neighboring states, including Republican-led Indiana.

“Chicago will continue to have a violence problem as long as red states continue to have a gun problem,” Johnson said.

Echoing a trend in other major U.S. cities, Chicago’s violent crime has dropped significantly overall, though it remains a persistent issue in parts of the city.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/pritzker-9-2-25.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-09-03 14:57:06.497797

The memo is among several steps the Trump administration has taken involving children who came to the U.S. alone.
Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.
“It seems like it’s designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,” she said.
“It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”","President Trump’s administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by the Associated Press.

Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration’s struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors — usually a parent or guardian — are properly vetted.

The memo is among several steps the Trump administration has taken involving children who came to the U.S. alone. Over the Labor Day weekend it attempted to remove Guatemalan children who were living in shelters or with foster care families.

The July 9 memo regarding sponsors said they must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says “federal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.”

Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a “built-in opportunity” to arrest parents — something she said has already happened.

Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child younger than 12 who had shown up for an identification check. “As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,” Miller Flowers said.

Desai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don’t already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates “clearly and proactively” with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said that parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won’t influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.

“The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,” it said in a statement.

However, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.

“We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,” she said.

Trump administration points to Biden

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under the Biden administration.

A federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden administration’s struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.

Another recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.

The agency said that it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say that they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don’t understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.

“If we don’t understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?” said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.

Jennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.

“It seems like it’s designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,” she said.

String of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process

The July changes are among the steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.

The administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home to which children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.

About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.

Shaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.

“The agency’s mission has been conflated and entangled,” she added. “It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/afab062/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4463x2343+0+316/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41%2F09%2F244d5063499b80bc2ab8bed59025%2F1e26f07da1cf4f909f336cf2b1b55be0.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 14:57:02.259889

Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.","This story was originally published by Stateline and is republished here by permission.

Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.

Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.

Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.

Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.

The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.

“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”

Team was assigned to respond to Bear Gulch Fire near Olympic National Park

Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch Fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.

One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.

“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”

“I felt beyond betrayed. What they did was messed up.”

Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.

Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.

After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.

After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.

“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”

Time card discrepancies for firefighting crews may have lead to immigration status checks

In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.

Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.

Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.

“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”

After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.

The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.

Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.

A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.

Federal officials did not warn state agency about its investigation

The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.

“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.

Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.

The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.

Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.

One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.

The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.

“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”

Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.

“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.

On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.

“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”

“To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire.”

Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.

“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”

Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch Fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.

“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”

In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

Omar Salazar was visiting his longtime girlfriend in Lubbock when he was stopped by a police officer for a traffic violation, his attorney Jacob Monty told KERA News. After Salazar provided the officer with his ID, an immigration official arrived and arrested Salazar on site.

As of Tuesday afternoon, he was being detained at the Blue Bonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, located approximately 200 miles west of Dallas.

""Imagine this, Omar ate breakfast in Lubbock, never expecting that he'd be facing the fight of his life Friday afternoon,"" Monty said. “Friday morning, he was just a normal resident of Texas enjoying the beginning of the long holiday weekend, and now he's fighting to stay in the country that he loves.”

Salazar came to the U.S. from Mexico with his family in 2008, but never gained legal status. Described as a leader by colleagues and friends, Salazar was valedictorian of his graduating class at Trini Garza Early College and is a graduate of Southern Methodist University, where he was a Hunt Scholar. He works in the AI industry.

Salazar has no criminal history and is not a flight risk, Monty said.

“This is a case that shows that in the administration's effort to go after the bad guys that no one's shedding a tear for,” he said. “The sweep is so broad that it's included people like Omar Salazar, who's an SMU grad who recently completed a certificate at UT on AI,” Monty said.

President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to increase deportations, prioritizing people with violent criminal histories, but many of those who have been detained under his push have not been convicted of high-level crimes, an Associated Press analysis found.

Salazar’s first hearing is scheduled for October. Under a new immigration policy issued by the Department of Homeland Security in July, Salazar would potentially not be eligible for bond and would have to fight his deportation while in custody.

“That's kind of what led to this new wave of mandatory detention for a lot of people who previously would have been released on bond because they're not a danger to the community, because they are not a flight risk, because they haven't committed a crime,"" said Veronica Franco, one of the attorneys representing Salazar.

KERA reached out to ICE and has not received a response.

Monty said Salazar remains optimistic and is ""hopeful that common sense prevails.”

His attorney is representing him pro bono, but friends have organized a Free Omar Salazar Go Fund Me account to help cover other legal costs. So far, they have raised more than $40,000.

“The bonds he has created with leaders and neighbors alike are a testament to his character, and we are hopeful that those same leaders will raise their voices for him now, more than ever, and that you will join us,” wrote Luis Rodriguez, co-organizer of the Go Fund Me account.

Karma was critical of the impact of the changes, which she said would have a devastating impact on those affected, who had been led to believe they had a safe future in this country. “This idea of not being able to renew a visa is on a par with deportation because you are effectively saying someone cannot stay in the UK and this destroys lives,” she said.

She called for a change in the government’s approach to this visa route, suggesting one compromise could be a return to the “resident labour market test”, whereby sponsoring organisations had to show they could not recruit someone already in the UK. She was also very critical of changes meaning certain workers are now excluded from bringing family members:

Employers and organisations should have to show they have tried to recruit in the UK and then only bring people in if this has not been possible. It shouldn’t matter what the job is – if it’s needed we should be sponsoring it.

“The authority to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists from the United States rests solely with the President.

It also sent the case back to a lower court for further proceedings.

The dissenting judge was Andrew Oldham, a Trump appointee who said the president should not be second-guessed. ""Time and time and time again, the Supreme Court has instructed that the President’s declaration of an invasion, insurrection, or incursion is conclusive. Final,"" he wrote.

Jackson praised Oldham's ""careful review of this authority.""

Democrats confront limited options to block GOP’s spreading redistricting efforts

and

Missouri lawmakers are kicking off a special session on redistricting today, the latest effort by Republicans to create friendlier congressional districts for their party ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Democrats, like others in GOP-led states pursuing new maps mid-decade, are loudly opposing the move. But there’s little they can do to stop it.

Unlike in Texas, where Democrats were able to band together to grind the state House to a halt and delay redistricting attempts, Missouri Democrats lack the numbers needed to mount a similar quorum break. While two-thirds of the Texas Legislature must be in session to conduct business, Missouri’s quorum requirement is a simple majority of members. And Missouri Republicans have about a two-thirds majority in both legislative chambers.

Pfizer says Trump’s call for transparency is ‘welcomed’

After Trump demanded Monday that pharmaceutical companies release data pertaining to the success rates of their Covid “drugs,” Pfizer said today that it welcomed the president's call for transparency.

Pfizer was the only company Trump called out by name. Trump claimed that he had seen “extraordinary” information “from Pfizer, and others” that has never been released to the public.

During Trump’s first term, Pfizer had the first authorized Covid vaccine in the U.S. and developed Paxlovid, an antiviral medication used to treat mild to moderate Covid.

In its statement, Pfizer shared a link to its website, which shows press releases on published studies and safety and efficacy data on the Covid vaccine. It also noted that, to date, information on its Covid shot has appeared in more than 600 peer-reviewed journals. The company said it will post additional information and studies by the end of the month.

Vaccines must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which requires companies to submit data for review. During the pandemic, Pfizer’s data on the Covid vaccine was reviewed by both the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which included public advisory committee meetings, before the shots were released to the public.

In the statement, the drugmaker said that “in the coming days,” it will share new data regarding its latest updated Covid vaccine, which it says the FDA approved after a “meticulous review by experienced medical and clinical experts.”

“President Trump’s call for transparency is welcomed, and we remain deeply committed to that principle,” the company said. “Transparency has always been a cornerstone of trust, and we are dedicated to continuing to provide clear, factual data to the public.”

Trump says his case on tariffs will be 'one of the most important' to go before the Supreme Court

Trump said in his Oval Office remarks this afternoon that the case challenging his tariffs will be ""one of the most important cases I’ve ever seen go before the Supreme Court of the U.S.""

""Tariffs are vital to our country, and just so you know, other countries use them on us, but I just used them a lot better,"" Trump said. ""We’re in a much better position. We have trillions of dollars coming into our country. If we didn’t have tariffs, we would be a very poor nation, and we would be taken advantage of by every other nation in the world, friend and foe.""

He continued, ""We have a very, very big case in the Supreme Court,"" and predicted he will have ""a big victory.""

Trump said yesterday that he will ask the Supreme Court to rule quickly in the case challenging his tariffs. A federal appeals court said late last week that Trump misused his authority by imposing the tariffs unilaterally, but the judge left them in effect as the case makes its way through the courts.

More than 90 arrested in D.C. overnight as part of Trump crackdown

and

Ninety-two people were arrested in Washington, D.C., overnight as a result of Trump's crime crackdown in the city, including two people who were wanted for homicide, a White House official said.

Further details on the operation were not provided, but the official said one person was arrested on a warrant in Ward 7 for homicide, and that the suspect had previously been convicted of two murders and sentenced to 36 years in prison. Another person was arrested on a warrant for first-degree murder, first-degree assault, the use of a firearm in a violent crime and second-degree assault, while a third was arrested on a warrant for attempted first-degree murder.

Among the 92 were also 40 undocumented immigrants, including some with prior criminal histories for attempted first-degree murder, burglary, assault and attempted second-degree murder. The official did not disclose how many of those arrested had criminal records or the status of their cases.

In all, there have 1,761 arrests since the operation was started Aug. 7, the official said.

Second big-name Republican jumps into the race to replace Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner filed to run for governor of Florida today, making him the second big-name Republican to jump into the race to replace term-limited Ron DeSantis.

“Many called it the two most conservative years in Florida history,” Renner said of his time as speaker from 2022 to 2024 in an interview yesterday. “I led a chamber of great men and women ... that made Florida what it is today.”

Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds is seen as the front-runner. Not only has he been endorsed by Trump and has been on the campaign trail for months, but he has also already socked away $25 million in campaign funds. Donalds announced his bid for governor in March.

Putin ready to meet Zelenskyy, if he comes to Moscow

Russian President Vladimir Putin said today that he was ready to hold talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy if the Ukrainian president came to Moscow, while casting doubt on whether such talks would be useful.

Zelenskyy has pressed to meet Putin, a summit backed by Trump, to discuss the terms of a possible deal that could bring an end to the war. But a summit in the capital of a country that has invaded his and sought to kill him would be a nonstarter for Zelenskyy.

At the end of his trip to Beijing, Putin said he had “never ruled out” the possibility of a meeting. “But is there any point? Let’s see,” he added.

The Russian leader said that such a meeting had to be well-prepared in advance. He made the remarks after Trump said he was “very disappointed” in him for Russia's continued attacks on Ukraine.

It’ll take us two weeks, easier than D.C.,"" Trump said, likely referring to the deployment of the National Guard to try to help quell crime as he has done in the nation's capital and Los Angeles.

Trump has previously floated sending troops to Chicago and Baltimore.

Trump says 'you'll see things happen' if U.S. is unhappy with Putin

Trump suggested in his remarks in the Oval Office that his administration could take action against Russia if Vladimir Putin doesn't continue to cooperate in negotiations over ending the war in Ukraine.

Trump said he didn't have a message for Putin.

""Putin knows where I stand, and he'll make a decision one way or the other,"" he said. ""Whatever his decision is, we'll either be happy about it, or unhappy, and if we're unhappy about it, you'll see things happen.""

Trump calls Epstein accusers' news conference 'a Democrat hoax'

Trump, during a bilateral meeting with the president of Poland in the Oval Office, said that calls to release more files related to Jeffrey Epstein are ""a Democrat hoax that never ends.""

Responding to a question about the news conference featuring Epstein accusers that was happening just across town, the president added: “From what I understand, thousands of pages of documents have been given.

Marjorie Taylor Greene says she is willing to read names of perpetrators if she's given a list

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene emphasized to reporters at the Capitol that women were scared to name people who abused them because they were afraid of retaliation, including lawsuits.

""It's a scary thing to name names, but I will tell you, I'm not afraid to name names,"" she said. ""And so if they want to give me a list, I will walk in that Capitol on the House floor, and I'll say every damn name that abused these women.""

Epstein accuser says he bragged about relationship with Trump

Chauntae Davies, one of the Epstein accusers present at Khanna and Massie's press conference this morning, said that Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, often bragged about their close relationship with Trump.

""Jeffrey and Ghislaine were always very boastful about their friends, their famous or powerful friends,"" Davies told reporters. ""And his biggest brag forever was that he was very good friends with Donald Trump.""

She added, ""[Epstein] had an 8-by-10 framed picture of [Trump] on his desk with the two of them, like, they were very close.""

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the woman's remarks.

Sky Roberts, the brother of Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year, pleaded with lawmakers to support Khanna and Massie's bill.

“Let’s be clear, this is not a political issue. This is not about left or right. This is about humanity,"" Roberts told reporters outside the Capitol.

“Our plea to you, whether you’re a dad, a mom, a brother, or a sister — look your young ones in the face. Look them in the eye and tell them you didn’t stand against the very people who raped, molested and preyed upon children and young women,"" Roberts added, becoming emotional as he directed his comments to lawmakers who have not yet come out in support of Massie and Khanna's proposal.

“The survivors of this horrific abuse are watching. The American people are watching and history is watching. Which side will you be on?"" Roberts said at the conclusion of his remarks.

Previously unidentified victim wants Epstein files released to help her remember what happened

One of Epstein's victims, Marina Lacerda, 37, told reporters that today is her first time speaking publicly about what happened to her when she was a teenager in New York City.

Lacerda said she dropped out of high school while she was forced to massage grown men at Epstein's Manhattan mansion.

""There are many pieces of my story that I can't remember no matter how hard I try,"" Lacerda told reporters. ""The constant state of wonder causes me so much fear and so much confusion. My therapist says that my brain is just trying to protect itself, but it's so hard to begin to heal knowing that there are people out there who know more about my abuse than I do.""

""The worst part is that the government is still in possession right now of the documents and information ... that could help me remember and get over all of this,"" she said, adding later, ""But I don’t have any of it, and I know the same is true for many of these women.""

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene calls out the White House

Epstein accusers rally on Capitol Hill

Women accusing Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell of sex trafficking rallied at Capitol Hill ahead of the news conference, calling for the release of all files related to the Epstein investigation, a commitment “to the truth” without political bias, and a promise by Trump not to pardon Maxwell.

Supporters held up signs that read “Trust the victims, not the felon,” referring to Maxwell and “Stand Up for Survivors.”

“The justice system was not designed to serve the powerful, it was meant to protect the people — and it’s time it started doing just that,” said Sky Roberts, the brother of prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.

Theresa Helm, who alleges she was 22 in 2002 when Maxwell groomed her and she was sexually abused by Epstein, said Maxwell belongs in prison.

“Ghislaine Maxwell, you are the system and now you are part of another system, one that you’ve earned through your very own choices and actions — a prison system where you deserve to live in your 20-year sentence,” Helm told the crowd.

The accusers at the rally said that if Congress wasn’t willing to release all of the investigative documents pertaining to Epstein, they would compile their own list through survivors to hold those in Epstein’s orbit accountable.

“We are the keys,” said Haley Robson, who alleges she was trafficked by Epstein starting when she was 16. “We know the games. We know the players.”

Rep. Ro Khanna: 'We’re here not as partisans, we’re here as patriots'

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., emphasized in his opening remarks that the push for transparency over the Epstein case is bipartisan.

""We're here not as partisans, we're here as patriots,"" Khanna said. ""We begin the work of bringing this country together. Progressives, independents, moderates, and yes, MAGA supporters, to demand truth and justice.""

Khanna said the lawmakers only need two more signatures from colleagues in order to move to the next steps for forcing a vote on the release of more files related to Epstein.

White House slams support from lawmakers for Massie's Epstein files petition as 'a very hostile act'

and

The White House is blasting any support from members of Congress for an effort by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., to force a floor vote to require the Trump administration to release more Jeffrey Epstein files.

A White House official said helping Massie and Democrats ""with their attention-seeking, while the DOJ is fully supporting a more comprehensive file release effort from the Oversight Committee, would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration.""

The petition, which needs 218 signatures to force the floor vote in the House, has already earned the backing of three other House Republicans: Reps. Nancy Mace, of South Carolina; Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia; and Lauren Boebert, of Colorado.

Massie responded to the White House in a post on X this morning, ""They’re threatening anyone who helps bring true transparency and justice for the survivors. This is a tacit admission the Oversight Committee data release is woefully incomplete.""

House to vote on censuring and removing Democratic lawmaker from committee

and

The House is scheduled to vote today on a resolution that would censure Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., and remove her from the House Homeland Security Committee over her confrontation with law enforcement at an immigration detention center in New Jersey in May.

Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., introduced the measure as a privileged matter last night, a fast-track process that forces a vote within two legislative days. The resolution is currently on the agenda for the House today, but it is unclear whether a vote will take in early afternoon or later tonight.

The last member censured by the House was Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, in March after he interrupted Trump’s address to Congress.

The House has voted to strip several members of committee assignments in recent years. When Democrats were in the majority in 2021 they voted to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., from committees. In 2023, Republicans voted to oust Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from the Foreign Affairs Committee.

A federal appeals court blocked the Trump administration yesterday from using an 18th century wartime law to remove people alleged to be Venezuelan gang members from the United States.

A panel of the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to block Trump’s deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, ruling the administration’s claim that members of Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang are part of a warlike invasion is not true.

Trump accuses Xi of conspiring against the U.S. with Putin and Kim at China military parade

Trump sent his warmest regards to the leaders of China, Russia, and North Korea today.

The pleasantries, though, came with a twist — in the very same breath, he accused Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un of conspiring against the United States as the trio gathered at a massive military parade in Beijing.

Though the grand display of missiles and marching troops may have been capped by the release of 80,000 doves into the skies of the Chinese capital, the American president suggested he saw something altogether more sinister behind the spectacle.

“May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”

Democrat Scott Colom launches long shot Mississippi Senate run

Democrat Scott Colom, a district attorney, launched a campaign for Senate in Mississippi today, arguing that he could put the deep-red state in play next year and suggesting that GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith” puts D.C. politics above what’s best for us.”

Colom told NBC News in an interview yesterday ahead of his launch that Hyde-Smith’s vote for Trump’s sweeping tax cut and spending law, known as the “big beautiful bill,” was the “final betrayal.” Colom said that tax cuts for ultra-wealthy Americans would not benefit most Mississippians, and cuts to Medicaid could threaten health care for tens of thousands of residents.

The race is an uphill climb and not one of the main campaigns in the spotlight for Democrats, who need to net four seats in 2026 to take control of the Senate. Trump won Mississippi by 23 points last year, and Hyde-Smith won her first full term in 2020 by 10 points. Attorney Ty Pinkins, who ran for Senate unsuccessfully last year as a Democrat, is challenging Hyde-Smith as an independent.

But The New York Times reported in May that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had discussed Colom’s potential Senate bid as a potential opportunity for his party. Colom acknowledged that he has spoken with Schumer and other Democrats like Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., but said he speaks most frequently with Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.

”I’m focused on Mississippi,” Colom said. “I’m not focused on D.C. politics. I don’t care what Mitch McConnell thinks. I’m not going to D.C. based on what Chuck Schumer thinks. I’m more concerned about what the people in my community think.”

Colom ousted a longtime incumbent district attorney back in 2015 with backing from a super PAC funded by Democratic donor George Soros, who has become involved in local prosecutor races around the country in recent years. Colom has some history with Hyde-Smith: She blocked Colom’s nomination for a federal judgeship during the Biden administration. Colom said at the time that he ""never requested these funds from Mr. Soros.""

Asked if the episode factored into his decision to challenge the senator, Colom said he has personally forgiven Hyde-Smith, but said he remains “frustrated with how she votes.”

Hyde-Smith said at the time that she opposed Colom’s nomination in part because of his past support from Soros and out of concern that he would oppose legislation “to protect female athletes.” Colom said that issue did not come up in their meeting about the judgeship. Noting he coaches his young daughters’ soccer team, Colom said, “I don’t support biological boys playing in girls’ sports. I never have.”

“I talk to a bunch of people in Mississippi all the time. I talk to grand juries, I talk to people at the grocery store. Nobody has ever brought that issue up to me,” Colom said.

“All they talk about is grocery prices still out of control. What about getting that lower? Why don’t we have a senator fighting for consistent tariff policy? When are we ever going to get a raise in the minimum wage? ... What are we going to do for our teachers and cops? What’s this I’m hearing about a hospital might be closing?” Colom added. “Those are the issues I hear about. So those are the reasons I want to go to United States Senate, because I want to fight for the issue that people are telling me concern them.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250903-Donald-Trump-Karol-Nawrocki-se-1222p-e44959.jpg",N,,2025-09-03 13:57:55.063976

Federal officials allege the practice violates federal law and discriminates against U.S. citizens living in other states, according to a complaint filed against the Illinois governor, attorney general and public university boards of trustees in the Southern District of Illinois.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April targeting state laws that allegedly favor undocumented residents over American citizens. It cited in-state tuition as a benefit that advantages students lacking legal status over out-of-state American citizens.

Illinois is the fourth state to be targeted by the Trump administration over long-standing state laws providing reduced tuition to students who reside in their states but lack legal immigration status. The Illinois General Assembly passed legislation in 2003 granting eligibility to undocumented students who have attended high school in the state for three years. The state also allows students who lack legal status to apply for state-funded scholarships.

More than 20 states provide in-state tuition to undocumented students, according to the Higher Ed Immigration Portal. Advocacy groups like the Presidents’ Alliance for Immigration and Higher Education argue that doing so is consistent with federal law and helps states maintain an educated and trained workforce.

Illinois is home to more than 500,000 immigrants without legal status, nearly 27,000 of whom are pursuing higher education. If they were to lose in-state financial aid benefits, those attending the state’s public colleges and universities could be forced to pay twice as much to pursue their degrees.

Dugan is accused of trying to help an undocumented immigrant escape federal agents outside her courtroom.

A federal judge denied a motion to dismiss the case, which argued Dugan had judicial immunity.

Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan will be tried Dec. 15 on federal criminal charges accusing her of obstructing immigration agents trying to arrest an undocumented Mexican migrant outside her courtroom earlier this year.

U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman set the trial date in the high-profile, high-stakes case at a hearing in the federal courthouse on Sept. 3. The trial is expected to last a week.

Jury selection was scheduled for Dec. 11-12.

Adelman set the trial date after Dugan's attorneys announced in court that they would not appeal his decision to reject their motion to dismiss the case at this time, but preserved their right to appeal later. Last week's decision by Adelman, one of the most liberal federal judges, was a blow to the defense, but it is difficult to win such a motion even before the facts have been established in a case. Adelman was appointed to the bench by Democratic President Bill Clinton.

Dugan's high-profile arrest and indictment put her case at the center of the growing dispute between President Donald Trump and the judiciary. Critics have accused Trump of trying to intimidate judges around the country, citing his administration's decision to defy or ""slow walk"" compliance with multiple court orders and Trump's calls to impeach one federal judge.

In the three months before trial, Adelman is expected to decide pretrial motions filed by either prosecutors and defense attorneys.

The two sides have already begun arguing about the questions that potential jurors will be asked. Given the intense publicity over the case, jury selection could be challenging.

The trial had been originally scheduled for late July, but Adelman pushed back the date indefinitely because he decided it was impractical, especially with the defense's motion to dismiss.

Dugan was not at the Sept. 3 hearing. She has been excused from attending court hearings after she entered a not guilty plea earlier this year.

On May 13, Dugan was indicted on charges she obstructed a federal agency and tried to help undocumented immigrant Eduardo Flores-Ruiz escape federal agents at the Milwaukee County Courthouse on April 18.

Flores-Ruiz, 31, was arrested following a short chase outside the courthouse. Federal officials say Flores-Ruiz illegally re-entered the United States from Mexico after being deported.

A week later, FBI agents arrested Dugan at the courthouse, thrusting her to the forefront of a clash between the judiciary and the Trump administration amid its crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

Dugan pleaded not guilty to the charges, a felony and a misdemeanor. If convicted, the veteran judge faces up to six years in prison. However, first-time nonviolent offenders typically get shorter sentences or probation.

Dugan, 66, has been suspended with pay by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. She makes nearly $175,000 a year.

Dugan's attorneys argued that she was being prosecuted for actions that are ""official acts,"" for which she has immunity as a judge. They also argued the case was an example of federal overreach.

Federal prosecutors said Dugan's arguments on these two issues were flawed and unsupported by legal precedent. To dismiss the case, prosecutors said, would suggest that ""judges are 'above the law,' and uniquely entitled to interfere with federal law enforcement.""

“As the Italian authorities chose not to proceed with this solution, Paragon terminated its contracts in Italy.”","The Trump administration appears to have unfrozen a stalled $2 million Biden-era contract with Paragon Solutions (US) Inc., a spyware company founded in Israel whose products have been accused of facilitating the surveillance of journalists and activists.

On Saturday, a public procurement database showed that a stop work order on the September 2024 deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been lifted, technology journalist Jack Poulson reported on his All-Source Intelligence Substack.

The deal does not specify what ICE will be getting as part of the deal, beyond describing an agreement for a “fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.”

An individual who answered a phone number listed for Paragon on the contract declined to comment.

The Independent has contacted ICE for comment.

The initial deal was paused in October to review whether it complied with a March 2023 Biden administration executive order limiting the use of commercial spyware that could pose counterintelligence risks to the U.S. or that might be improperly used by a foreign government, WIRED reported.

Critics warned of potential risks from the U.S. engaging with Paragon, whose Graphite program can quietly invade the mobile phone of its target and extract its contents, primarily through accessing cloud backup data.

“Invasive, secret hacking power is corrupting,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which has probed the foreign use of Paragon products, told The Guardian. “That’s why there’s a growing pile of spyware scandals in democracies, including with Paragon’s Graphite.”

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has previously used Graphite against drug traffickers outside the U.S., The New York Times reported in 2022.

Paragon was founded by Ehud Schneorson, a former commander of Israel’s cyber-spying Unit 8200. In late 2024, AE Industrial Partners, a Florida-based investment group, acquired the company for $500 million, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.

Paragon bills itself as an ethical cyber firm that only sells to the U.S. and other allied countries.

WhatsApp said in early 2025 it had disrupted a hacking campaign targeting about 90 people linked to Paragon, and an Italian journalist and several pro-immigration activists said they were among the victims. Analysis by the Citizen Lab think tank suggests two other journalists were targeted.

Paragon said in June it terminated contracts in Italy after claiming the Italian government refused its help in investigating whether its products were improperly used in the attack.

“The company offered both the Italian government and parliament a way to determine whether its system had been used against the journalist in violation of Italian law and the contractual terms,” Paragon said in a statement at the time. “As the Italian authorities chose not to proceed with this solution, Paragon terminated its contracts in Italy.”",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/07/16/22/10/Federal-Agents-Detain-Immigrants-Outside-Connecticut-Courthouse-qachhcus.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-09-03 14:57:13.762395

But I want to emphasize that, you know, beyond the National Guard, this is in many ways also about immigration.","AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

We look now at a slew of legal developments with the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities and his broader immigration crackdown. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, the brother of the retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, ruled Trump broke the law when he deployed the National Guard to L.A. to quell protests against immigration raids. Breyer expressed concern [that] the deployments are, quote, “creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” unquote.

Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges.

And in more immigration news, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a two-to-one ruling that blocks President Trump from using the 18th-century wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans accused of being gang members, because, quote, “We find no invasion or predatory incursion had occurred.” The 5th Circuit is considered to be one of the most conservative appeals courts in the United States. The case is expected to head to the Supreme Court.

For more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we’re joined by Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.

Aaron, welcome back to Democracy Now! Let’s start with that last overnight court decision. If you can talk about this very conservative court ruling against Trump using the Alien Enemies Act, the AEA, and then just go through these latest decisions in the last two days?

AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK: Yeah, well, first, starting with the Alien Enemies Act, we saw the 5th Circuit, in a two-one decision, rule that the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority, which is what everyone has been saying so far. The judges’ panel’s rule, it was a two-one decision. They joined over a dozen other federal judges to rule that this law, adopted in 1798 during the quasi-war with France, and that has only ever previously been invoked during declared wars, is in fact a wartime authority and not something that can be used to deport Venezuelan alleged gang members without any due process whatsoever. So this is yet another blow for the Trump administration in their efforts to use the Alien Enemies Act. And though we know that this case will eventually make it to the Supreme Court, at the Supreme Court, as well, the Trump administration is zero for two in their efforts to use the law without any due process.

Beyond that, of course, we had Judge Breyer’s decision in California finding that the President violated the Posse Comitatus Act when the military was used for domestic law enforcement, things like riot control or crowd control in Los Angeles.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And for those who are not aware, what is the Posse Comitatus Act?

AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK: The Posse Comitatus Act is a 150-year-old law, adopted after the Civil War, that says extremely clearly that the U.S. military may not be used for domestic law enforcement unless explicitly authorized to do so by Congress. And here, Congress has never authorized the military to be used for basic law enforcement tasks like crowd control.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Also, if you could comment on the federal judge’s decision over the weekend stopping the Trump administration from illegally deporting as many as 700 Guatemalan children in the middle of the night back to Guatemala?

AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK: Yeah, that’s another case that looks very suspiciously similar to the kinds of things the Trump administration did in the Alien Enemies Act case. They adopted a very out-there, bizarre legal interpretation that had never been for — been put forward, and then tried to execute mass removals in the middle of the night, or very early in the morning, before a judge could stop them. In this case, a judge acted at 2 a.m. to put forward an order to block the Trump administration, and continued forward that order and her actions throughout the day, so they did, in fact, prevent the planes from taking off.

But at its heart, this resulted from — this was a result of the Trump administration’s bizarre claim that the Office of Refugee Resettlement has an authority to effectively run its own shadow repatriation system and has the ability to send children home outside of the normal constraints of immigration law, which include things like the right to seek asylum. So, those flights have been blocked. This case will now continue forward in the courts. But unlike what happened with the Alien Enemies Act and the deportations to El Salvador, the planes did not manage to take off and deplane their passengers.

AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges. The head of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Ben Johnson, warned the decision will gut due process and undermine the immigration court. He said to the Associated Press, “It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement.” Talk about the meaning of Army lawyers becoming immigration judges.

AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK: Yeah, Ben Johnson is right here. The reality is that immigration law is extraordinarily complex, and it’s often been described as second in complexity only to the tax system. And immigration court has often been described as death penalty cases in traffic court procedures. So, what we have here are 600 lawyers, who may very well be good lawyers and conscientious, but have absolutely no experience in immigration law whatsoever, and they’re being assigned to take cases that could lead to someone’s death if they’re decided wrong. While undoubtedly they could eventually become experts in immigration law with months and months of training, these deployments are supposed to last only 179 days. So, you have people who have been or are going to be ordered to take on these incredibly weighty, difficult, complex cases, without any of the relevant experience they need, which is only going to strain the immigration court system. And indeed, the purpose of this is clear. Corey Lewandowski, who is a senior adviser to Secretary Noem, and, of course, a longtime member of Trump world, said on X yesterday that the goal of this is to increase deportations. And I think that really gives away the game.

AMY GOODMAN: So much for being with us —

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, I wanted to —

AMY GOODMAN: Oh, go ahead, Juan.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: No, no, I just wanted to ask him about the pending invasion of Chicago by both federal agents and the military, especially this idea that Trump has of bringing National Guard troops from, essentially, Republican states to occupy largely minority cities in Democratic states.

AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK: Yeah, I think, as Governor Pritzker has stated, this is particularly disturbing. You know, when you look at the statistics, Chicago is not even in the top 20 most violent cities, which is not to say, of course, that there are not issues with gun violence, but not ones that would justify deploying the National Guard.

But I want to emphasize that, you know, beyond the National Guard, this is in many ways also about immigration. Here in Washington, D.C., the National Guard has mostly been standing around the Mall or doing tasks like spreading mulch and picking up trash. But what’s actually been happening, most significantly, is the invasion of the city by federal law enforcement officers to carry out immigration enforcement. You have ICE and the Metropolitan Police Department setting up checkpoints in major thoroughfares in the city. You have a major increase in ICE raids across the city and people being afraid to take their children to school. So, while a lot of the attention in Chicago is going to be on the National Guard deployment, keep an eye out for what ICE is doing, because this could be yet another Los Angeles, where we see huge increase in immigration enforcement throughout the city and immigrant communities forced to shrink back in fear.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/story/93/78793/full_hd/SEG2_Trump.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 13:58:00.694420

Just days into his presidency, Trump moved to bypass Congress by signing 10 executive orders expanding military involvement in immigration enforcement.
Trump overstepped congressional war powers by labeling the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) a foreign, wartime enemy.
Now, in a disturbing expansion of immigration enforcement, Trump has proposed detaining up to 30,000 migrants at Guantánamo.","On Aug. 11, 2025, US President Donald Trump invoked emergency powers to deploy 800 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital, signaling another alarming escalation of the use of military force during his second term. The military is now being used in ways once unimaginable for immigration enforcement — stationing troops in US cities, detaining migrants in military prisons, and invoking wartime powers to expel them.

From day one, Trump has framed migration as a national security threat, vowing to launch “the largest deportation program of criminals” in US history. What has followed is a calculated effort to expand military power into domestic immigration policy and blur the lines between enforcement and war.

Just days into his presidency, Trump moved to bypass Congress by signing 10 executive orders expanding military involvement in immigration enforcement.

Among the most consequential was the order “Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States.” This reclassified the movement of migrants at the border as a “national emergency” and authorized the Department of Defense to deploy troops to the border. Another order, “Clarifying the Military’s Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the United States,” assigned servicemembers with the mission of “repelling the invasion and sealing the United States’ southern border from unlawful entry.”

As a result, nearly 10,000 active-duty troops are stationed along the southern border, supporting detention, removal, and enforcement operations. These executive orders marked the administration’s first step in recasting immigration not as a humanitarian or legal issue, but as a national security crisis demanding a war-like response. With the signing of the reconciliation package in July, Congress has given the administration $170 billion to carry out a dangerous campaign that fails to respond to modern migration challenges.

In March, Trump unlawfully invoked the outdated Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to exile approximately 250 Venezuelans to El Salvador without a semblance of due process. Federal courts have since ruled that removal, even under the AEA, must comply with constitutional protections. The AEA had never been used outside of wartime. The last instance was during World War II, when the US government shamefully justified the internment of Japanese, Italian, and German nationals.

Trump overstepped congressional war powers by labeling the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) a foreign, wartime enemy. The US is not at war with this group, yet the president used the AEA in an outrageous powergrab to apprehend and remove any Venezuelan noncitizens 14 years of age or older deemed members of TdA. This represents an unprecedented abuse of executive authority.

“The threat of war powers continues to escalate.”

For four months, 252 men exiled to El Salvador were imprisoned in CECOT, a facility notorious for its grim and widespread human rights offenses. Now released and repatriated in Venezuela, the men have shared harrowing accounts of beatings, torture, and sexual abuse inside CECOT. They were held with limited access to legal counsel and deprived of sunlight and time outdoors. Many of the men detained had no criminal record in the US or in Venezuela, and in most cases, the US government failed to provide sufficient evidence of any TdA affiliation.

Trump’s misuse of the AEA signals a sharp turn, marked by an alarming misuse of war powers and a disregard for due process — a constitutional right afforded to anyone on US soil, regardless of immigration status.

The threat of war powers continues to escalate. On June 7, 2025, Trump became the first president since 1970 to federalize the National Guard, deploying nearly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to respond to protests following immigration raids. The event renewed concerns over the possible invocation of the Insurrection Act to deploy the military for interior policing.

For more than 23 years, Guantánamo Bay has symbolized torture and indefinite detention. It has drawn condemnation from human rights experts and members of Congress, many of whom have called for its closure. Opened in January 2002 to hold alleged terrorists, the facility continues to serve as a moral stain on the US and a global symbol of unchecked executive power.

Now, in a disturbing expansion of immigration enforcement, Trump has proposed detaining up to 30,000 migrants at Guantánamo. More than 500 have already been held at the site, costing taxpayers over $40 million, in addition to transportation costs of $21 million or more than $26,000 per flight hour. Even more alarming, reports indicate that some migrants have been detained not just at the Migrant Operations Center, but by military personnel at Camp 6 — a facility built for high-level terrorism suspects. This is unlawful, as only members of the Taliban, al-Qaeda, or their “associated forces” are permitted to be held in military detention at Guantánamo.

Using a wartime prison to hold migrants marks a dangerous convergence of military power and civilian immigration policy. It erodes civil liberties and continues to set a chilling precedent for future enforcement. All the while, the Trump administration continues to conflate immigration management with warfare, endangering both citizens and noncitizens. Violent immigration policies — family separation, abusive detention, and military-involved removals — sow fear and insecurity. As the Quaker Statement on Migration affirms, “Migration injustice values the perceived security of some over shared security: a militarised approach to security threatens security for all of us.” America will not thrive waging war on itself. Congress must modernize the outdated system with humane asylum processes, a citizenship pathway, and just, orderly border policies.",https://inkstickmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/alejandro-cartagena-fnEQLMhXkWI-unsplash-1920x1280.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 12:58:01.462024

The state Court of Appeals held that providing surveillance footage did not in itself compromise security and that footage could be released with limited redactions of student identities.","State officials said they have not inspected the private immigrant detention center in Tacoma since last year amid legal pushback, but a recent federal court opinion could reinforce state-level oversight of health and safety conditions for detainees.

The Department of Labor & Industries reported it last inspected working conditions at the Northwest Immigration Processing Center in summer 2024 and found no violations. GEO Group, the private company operating the detention center, has challenged the state’s authority to conduct inspections and since barred entry to L&I as well as Department of Health inspectors.

“Despite hundreds of complaints and our ongoing efforts, NWIPC continues to deny entry to DOH staff,” DOH spokesperson Kara Kostanich wrote in a statement. “Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all people in Washington, including those in detention, who are among the most vulnerable in our state.”

GEO Group has contested a 2023 Washington state law that authorized new oversight of the private detention center, arguing the law unfairly discriminated against the company as the only such center in the state. Legislators amended that law earlier this year to include other facilities and impose specific penalties on health and safety violations.

The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion on Aug. 19, overturning a lower court ruling that barred state officials from conducting inspections, and clarifying that the state has authority to regulate many types of civil detention facilities such as mental health institutions.

“The key issue in this case is whether the entities to which we should compare the NWIPC are state prisons or civil detention facilities,” the opinion states. “[We] conclude that the appropriate comparators are civil detention facilities.”

The case will now go back to U.S. District Court in Seattle for further proceedings.

The Department of Health had filed a separate lawsuit last year, seeking a court order to allow inspectors into the detention center to observe detainee quarters. L&I spokesman Matt Ross told Cascade PBS that the agency has maintained it has ongoing authority to conduct its workplace safety checks, but confirmed it had not inspected the center since last year.

“We already had authority under state law and the state constitution to inspect conditions for workers,” he wrote in an email, “and were already conducting routine inspections into workplace safety and health at the site.”

GEO Group recently dropped a lawsuit to block L&I from releasing records from its 2024 inspection after a Cascade PBS reporter requested those materials under the Public Records Act. The company sought an injunction against L&I in January, arguing that disclosing the inspection photos and reports to the media could undermine security at the facility. Cascade PBS was named as a defendant in the action solely in its capacity as a requestor under the Public Records Act. GEO did not seek legal or equitable relief against Cascade PBS.

In attachments to its filed complaint, GEO Group included a live hyperlink to more than 200 L&I inspection photos. Most of the photos depicted items related to workplace safety regulations such as fire extinguishers, stairways, cleaning chemical labels or personal protective equipment. Some photos included shackles, gas masks or tactical gear.

L&I later provided Cascade PBS with heavily redacted copies of those photos. Cascade PBS then asked L&I to conduct an administrative review of those redactions and officials provided a second set of similarly redacted photos, citing a security exemption raised by GEO Group.

Many redactions blacked out doorways, windows or the locations of security cameras. L&I contended the redacted photos contained “specific and unique vulnerability assessments or specific and unique emergency and escape response plans at a city, county, or state adult or juvenile correctional facility, or secure facility for persons civilly confined.”

“In this case we removed the location of security cameras, video surveillance images, and types of weapons and restraints,” an L&I records officer wrote to Cascade PBS.

GEO Group ended its case against L&I and Cascade PBS in June, filing a voluntary request for dismissal before any substantive proceedings or rulings occurred in the case.

An attorney affiliated with the Washington Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit organization advocating for government transparency, told Cascade PBS that exemptions that allow public agencies to redact information should be applied narrowly. The attorney pointed to Does v. King County, a 2015 case in which officials tried to block the release of surveillance footage of a shooting on Seattle Pacific University’s campus.

The state Court of Appeals held that providing surveillance footage did not in itself compromise security and that footage could be released with limited redactions of student identities.

GEO Group did not respond to requests for comment on the latest federal court decision. The company is expected to file a response to the opinion by Sept. 16.

State representative Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo, who sponsored both inspection bills, lauded the recent court decision, calling it an act of “justice” and a step toward holding the NWIPC accountable for its numerous alleged human rights abuses.

“We certainly should not be letting a private facility come in and profit off the backs of our most vulnerable people,” she said. “And that’s what’s been happening — with no accountability — very little from the federal government, if any, and none from the state. They’ve been able to do whatever it is that they want, but they’re doing it in our state, and I think that’s the difference.”

The panel of appellate judges held that multiple sections of the state’s inspection law did not conflict with the “intergovernmental immunity doctrine,” which protects federal agencies from state regulation or discrimination. The judges ruled that requiring DOH to adopt rules that ensure safe and sanitary conditions to people in immigration detention and enforcing civil penalties for violations of such conditions did not rise to that level.

“[T]he panel held that it would not decide at this point whether Washington regulates the conditions of confinement at the NWIPC differently from the way it regulates the conditions of confinement in other civil detention facilities,” the panel wrote. “Because the district court incorrectly concluded that the appropriate comparator was Washington’s prisons, the panel remanded to allow the district court to make the comparison with other civil detention facilities.”

The judges concluded that allowing GEO to compare its operations to prison would “ignore the critical fact that inmates in Washington’s prisons have been convicted of crimes, and that the conditions of their confinement are part of a penal regime.”

“By contrast,” the opinion states, “none of the detainees held in the NWIPC has been convicted of — or even charged with — a crime.”

Before the DOH could implement its own rules, the panel found that the already-existing contractual requirements that were implemented on the NWIPC by the state were “almost identical” to the requirements imposed under Washington law on the types of civil detention facilities.

Ortiz-Self said the decision would help Washington achieve parity with California — which, since 2017, has empowered state investigators to inspect the state’s network of immigration detention centers.

“We want it for all facilities — public or private — because we feel a sense of accountability as the state that is housing these facilities,” she said. “And in the California determination, they said, ‘Yes, as a state, states do have a right to inspect and have standards for private facilities.’”

Kostanich with DOH said the agency is still determining its next steps in the case.

“We are optimistic the federal courts will clarify DOH’s authority,” she wrote, “allowing us to conduct investigations that promote transparency and protect the health and well-being of everyone inside the facility.”",https://www.cascadepbs.org/content/images/2025/09/msb-1243873modcolor.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 13:58:20.031930

The new phenomenon, referred to as ""reverse flow"" migration, has mainly impacted migrants fleeing the economic and political turmoil in Venezuela and who had been moving north through Central America toward the U.S.

Since 2017, around 8 million people have fled the political crisis in Venezuela.

The report, published by the governments of Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica with the support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had plummeted by 97% this year.

Trump's Dhs Touts Massive Number Of Illegal Immigrants Deported As Dems Lash Out At Ice

""It’s time to go back — the American dream wasn’t like this,"" one migrant said, per the report.

Read On The Fox News App

The report links the reversal to President Donald Trump's border policies, with 46% of migrants citing policy changes and 49% saying they could not enter the U.S. Another 34% ran out of resources and 17% feared detention or deportation.

Migration through the treacherous Darién Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023 when more than half a million migrants crossed.

The report also blames U.S. financial reductions for drying up humanitarian aid. As a result, NGOs and U.N. agencies that were filling protection gaps in places like the Darién Gap and along return routes had to shut down or scale back operations.

Additionally, tougher transit restrictions in Panama mean the traditional pipeline toward the U.S. is nearly shut.

That flow slowed somewhat in 2024 but dried up almost completely early this year as President Trump fulfilled his campaign promise of shutting the border.

Southwest border apprehensions hit a monthly record low in July, with only 4,399 apprehensions, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. For the third month in a row, there were zero releases. This is the new all-time record low, beating the prior record low of 6,070 in June.

Biden repeatedly had single days when apprehensions ranged from 8,000 to 10,000 migrants, with his highest single month being December 2023, when 249,785 Border Patrol apprehensions were recorded.

Tom Homan Puts Sanctuary Cities 'On Notice' As Trump Administration Cracks Down On Immigration

The migrants who had hoped to reach the U.S. now find themselves in a difficult situation and some face violence, abuse and exploitation, the report states.

Roughly 50% of those interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia said they intended to go back to Venezuela, with around a quarter of those interviewed planning to go to neighboring Colombia, previously the epicenter of the mass migration from Venezuela. Others said they didn’t know where they were going.

Some migrants will continue moving south within Latin America, but the report warns they face unsafe boat journeys, dependence on smugglers and criminal groups that prey on returnees. Others remain stranded in places like Palenque, Miramar, Necoclí, Bahía Solano and Medellín, sleeping in parks or abandoned buildings without access to food, shelter or medical care.

Humanitarian monitors said many are turning to survival strategies such as informal work, begging or even transactional sex.

""We don’t know whether to stay in Colombia or go to Chile. I worry a lot about my children; they’re tired of moving so much,"" one migrant said.

""Imagine, I’m back in the same place I left many years ago chasing a dream,"" another said. ""Now I don’t know what to do.""

Scott Campbell, the U.N. human rights representative in Colombia, said the returnees are among the most vulnerable people on the continent and urged governments not to abandon the migrants.

""Most of these people are already victims of human rights abuses,"" Campbell said. ""We urge authorities to aid people in this reverse migration to prevent them from being exploited or falling into trafficking networks run by illegal armed groups.""

The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors — usually a parent or guardian — are properly vetted.

Federal officials allege the practice violates federal law and discriminates against U.S. citizens living in other states, according to a complaint filed against the Illinois governor, attorney general and public university boards of trustees in the Southern District of Illinois.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April targeting state laws that allegedly favor undocumented residents over American citizens. It cited in-state tuition as a benefit that advantages students lacking legal status over out-of-state American citizens.

Illinois is the fourth state to be targeted by the Trump administration over long-standing state laws providing reduced tuition to students who reside in their states but lack legal immigration status. The Illinois General Assembly passed legislation in 2003 granting eligibility to undocumented students who have attended high school in the state for three years. The state also allows students who lack legal status to apply for state-funded scholarships.

More than 20 states provide in-state tuition to undocumented students, according to the Higher Ed Immigration Portal. Advocacy groups like the Presidents’ Alliance for Immigration and Higher Education argue that doing so is consistent with federal law and helps states maintain an educated and trained workforce.

Illinois is home to more than 500,000 immigrants without legal status, nearly 27,000 of whom are pursuing higher education. If they were to lose in-state financial aid benefits, those attending the state’s public colleges and universities could be forced to pay twice as much to pursue their degrees.

Tabletop exercises are discussions in which participants work through scenarios to test emergency response plans, per KOIN 6 News. The Portland Police Bureau said it was not involved in what happened outside the ICE facility on Labor Day night, per the outlet.

In July, Portland’s progressive-leaning city council said it was exploring ways to expel ICE from the detention facility that has become a flashpoint for violent clashes between agents and radical agitators.

Chaotic scenes have been unfolding outside the facility since June, including in one incident where a large group of anti-ICE protesters tried to block law enforcement vehicles from entering and exiting the facility, forcing agents to deploy rubber bullets, tear gas and flash bangs to disperse the crowd.

Footage that emerged from overnight Monday purportedly showed demonstrators burning a flag before law enforcement fired munitions to disperse the crowd.

Video then showed police clearing out the area, with the protesters yelling through loudspeakers, ""You are sad excuses for human beings!"" and ""You guys are violent, cowardly pigs!""

At least two protesters were seen wielding riot shields to protect against the munitions being fired at them. It is unclear if any arrests were made during the incident.

The Hajnówka Five have been prosecuted after giving humanitarian aid to refugees in a forest in Poland who had crossed from the Belarus border in 2022. They face up to five years in prison if convicted.

I’ve been following their trial and others like it for some years, as the Polish authorities target activists who give food, water, and legal advice to people coming from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Ethiopia, and other places and who seek refuge in Poland.

In May, I was in this same court when two women activists were acquitted after helping a man seeking asylum in the forest. Today, two doors away from the Hajnówka Five, another activist known as Bartek had his first trial hearing. He is charged with“influencing the official duties of the Border Guard” after trying to ensure the Border Guards fulfilled their legal obligation in October 2024 by accepting an application for international protection from a young Somali man, whom Bartek was authorized to represent. If convicted, he faces up to three years in prison.

Poland is an increasingly dangerous place for refugees and those who help them. The Polish government has suspended the right to asylum for those coming via Belarus, with a few exceptions.

But there was a lot of support for Bartek and the Hajnówka Five outside and inside the court today. A hundred or so people gathered near the steps at the entrance, providing free coffee, blueberries, and music.

Inside the cavernous Room IV, the benches were filled with more supporters and about a dozen TV crews. This trial is big news in Poland and is seen as a test of the country’s values.

The accused sit along one side of the room, the prosecution and defense lawyers (nine in all) sit opposite them, and at one end, Judge Adam Konrad Rodakowski sits up on the dais alone, with Poland’s national symbol ­— a huge golden eagle — embedded in the wall above his head.

Virtually everything else in the court is green — the marble slabs lining the walls, the smooth pillars, the tinted glass, the floor tiles, and the benches.

Mariusz is one of the Hajnówka Five. I first met him when we drove into Ukraine together in the weeks following Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. He had just passed his driving test a few days before, and frankly, he probably shouldn’t have. Speeding from Poland into Ukraine with Mariusz in a car full of flak jackets for medics and baby food was a hair-raising trip, even for a bald man.

“Guess what,” he laughed when we met this morning. “My job now is as a driver. I’m better than I was.”

A week after that trip, he and the others were arrested after they gave water, food, and clothing to a desperate Iraqi couple, their seven children, and an elderly Egyptian man who was with them. Mariusz and three others gave the group a ride to the nearest town when they were stopped by border guards.

They are accused of providing “illegal assistance” to refugees, “making it easier for them to stay in the Republic of Poland” by “providing food and clothing to them while they were hiding in the woods, giving them shelter and rest, and transporting them into Poland on March 22, 2022.”

In January this year, I submitted evidence to the court in support of Mariusz, confirming his acts as humanitarian.

Mariusz and the others spoke in court today, outlining their reasons for providing aid.

This trial is about these five cases, but it is really about what Poland stands for and whether it wants to be a country that targets and outlaws such acts of kindness.

There is a widespread belief that there will be further cases brought, with human rights activists citing the large numbers of people questioned by police in recent months. “Maybe all activists are in danger, because who knows who has said what to the police,” one woman active in helping refugees told me.

The Hajnówka Five should find out their fate on Monday, and Bartek will receive his verdict later this month.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2280-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 12:58:09.317687

Hans-Jurgen Papier said “uncontrolled and unconditional immigration” was damaging public faith in conventional politics and that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) had gone too far in its definition of the right to asylum.

Mr Papier, who was once the most senior judge in Germany, is a constitutional expert. His comments mark a radical shift in public mood towards immigration, from the days of Angela Merkel’s open-door policy to the rise of the far-Right.

Speaking to The Times, Mr Papier likened asylum rulings from national courts and the ECHR in Strasbourg as appearing to “settle like mildew over the states’ political power to take action”.

“The prospect that those in positions of political responsibility in Europe could change this system and adapt it to the fundamental changes in our social, political and cultural conditions seems ever more difficult and ever more hopeless to many people,” he said.

He added the situation was “generally destroying the European citizen’s trust in the capacity of their democratic institutions to act, and so at the end of the day endangering the existence of western democracies”.

Germany has hardened its stance on migration amid widespread discontent over its growth.

When she famously told the German public that the country could cope with migration, Ms Merkel was bucking the trend in Europe which was resisting pressure to allow in migrants from places such as Syria.

However, when more than 600 women were sexually assaulted by migrants in the Cologne New Year sex attacks at the start of 2016, Mrs Merkel found herself politically isolated.

Islamist terror attacks

A year of Islamist terror attacks followed, culminating when a rejected Tunisian asylum-seeker drove a lorry into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12. Even Mrs Merkel’s most diehard supporters began to fear she had got it catastrophically wrong.

Years on and her liberal politics have been dispensed with by Germany’s current leader.

Friedrich Merz, the chancellor, said last month he will abolish a rule that automatically assigns a lawyer to asylum seekers awaiting deportation, even if they have lost their final appeal.

Allies of Mr Merz told The Telegraph that the rule, introduced by a previous government, had mired German courts in red tape and was being used to prolong deportation cases.

According to recent German government statistics, the number of asylum applications filed in Germany between January and July 2025 stood at around 70,000, a decrease of 50 per cent compared to the same time period of last year.

The reduction in numbers has been linked to tougher German government rhetoric on migration, passport checks at all land borders and, more broadly, the passage of time – with far fewer people fleeing Ukraine, Afghanistan and Syria.

Nevertheless, governments across the EU are under intense pressure from the populist Right to toughen up migration policy, with some hoping to set up offshore processing centres which would be similar to the UK’s failed Rwanda deportation scheme.

The scale of the surge of the far-Right was evident in August when for the first time in modern history, far-Right and populist parties were topping the polls in Germany, France and Britain.

The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now the most popular among voters, leading the polls on 26 per cent and putting the Christian Democrats in second place at 24 per cent.

The military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys — both military and civilians — to the Justice Department “as soon as practicable,” and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week, according to the Aug. 27 memo.

The effort comes as the Trump administration more regularly turns to the military as it cracks down on illegal immigration through ramped-up arrests and deportations. Its growing role in the push includes troops patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, National Guard members being sent into U.S. cities to support immigration enforcement efforts, housing people awaiting deportation on military bases and using military aircraft to carry out deportations.

The administration's focus on illegal immigration has added strain to the immigration courts, which were already dealing with a massive backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has ballooned in recent years. An organization for immigration lawyers called the new directive a “destructive” move meant to undermine the courts.

Numerous immigration judges have been fired

At the same time, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired or left voluntarily after taking deferred resignations offered by the Trump administration, their union says. In the most recent round of terminations, the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers said in July that at least 17 immigration judges had been fired “without cause” in courts across the country.

That has left about 600 immigration judges, union figures show, meaning the Pentagon move would double their ranks.

The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, requested the assistance from the Defense Department, according to the memo sent by the Pentagon’s executive secretary to his DOJ counterpart. The military lawyers' duties as immigration judges will initially last no more than 179 days but can be renewed, it said.

A DOJ spokesperson referred questions about the plan to the Defense Department, where officials directed questions to the White House.

A White House official said Tuesday that the administration is looking at a variety of options to help resolve the significant backlog of immigration cases, including hiring additional immigration judges. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the matter should be “a priority that everyone — including those waiting for adjudication — can rally around.”

The head of the American Immigration Lawyers Association decried bringing in temporary judges who lack expertise in immigration law, saying “it makes as much as sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement.”

“Expecting fair decisions from judges unfamiliar with the law is absurd. This reckless move guts due process and further undermines the integrity of our immigration court system,” said Ben Johnson, the organization’s executive director.

Pentagon says the step may require mobilizing reserve officers

The memo stressed that the additional attorneys are contingent on availability and that mobilizing reserve officers may be necessary. Plus, the document said DOJ would be responsible for ensuring that anyone sent from the Pentagon does not violate the federal prohibition on using the military as domestic law enforcement, known as the Posse Comitatus Act.

The administration faced a setback on its efforts to use troops in unique ways to combat illegal immigration and crime, with a court ruling Tuesday that it “willfully” violated federal law by sending National Guard troops to Los Angeles in early June.

It is not immediately clear what impact shifting that number of military attorneys would have on the armed forces' justice system. The attorneys, called judge advocates, have a range of duties much like civilian lawyers, from carrying out prosecutions, acting as a defense attorney or offering legal advice.

Pentagon officials did immediately offer details on where any of the 600 attorneys will be drawn from and whether they will come from active duty or the reserves.

The training that goes into being an immigration judge

Until she was abruptly fired in July, former supervising judge Jennifer Peyton administered the intensive training that all judges in Chicago undergo before working in some of the busiest immigration courts in the country. After the weekslong training, new judges are paired with an experienced mentor and have a two-year probationary period.

Peyton doubted that military attorneys would be able to master the complexities of immigration law without that rigorous process. She also said it wasn’t clear how they would handle the hundreds, or sometimes thousands, of cases on just a Chicago immigration judge’s docket each year.

“Six months is barely enough time to start to figure out the firehose of information and training,” she said.

Peyton also was concerned that Trump’s move didn’t supply more administrative workers, including translators, whom judges rely on to make decisions. The stakes, she said, were life or death for people who would come before the new judges.

“None of it makes sense unless you were intentionally trying to weaken the immigration courts,” Peyton said.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Two senior Defense Department homeland and cybersecurity officials have “moved on” from their positions, a U.S. defense official told the Hill yesterday. The official did not specify when Ashley Manning, the principal deputy assistant secretary for cyber policy, and Jonathan Owen, the acting deputy assistant secretary for homeland defense integration and defense support to civil authorities, have left their posts. The Pentagon’s tech innovation chief, Doug Beck, resigned last week. Filip Timotija reports.

Trump yesterday announced he plans to relocate the U.S. Space Command to Alabama from Colorado, in part due to his grudge against Colorado, a state he has never won. The Space Command coordinates space-related operations for all branches of the armed forces.

Julia Simon reports for NPR.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-VA) yesterday said that a scheduled National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency oversight meeting has been cancelled after far-right activist Laura Loomer launched public attacks on him and the agency’s director, Vice Adm. Trey Whitworth. The planned Friday meeting was scheduled weeks ago and was unpublicized and classified, Warner added. In a social media post, Loomer took credit for the cancellation and demanded that Whitworth be fired for “insubordination.” Dan De Luce reports for NBC News.

The House Oversight Committee yesterday released more than 33,000 pages of records connected to the Justice Department’s investigation of the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Many of the documents published by the Committee were already public, and it was not immediately clear whether the release included any material that had not already been made public. Michael Gold reports for the New York Times.

The federal government is “going in” to Chicago and will deploy the National Guard there, Trump reiterated yesterday, without specifying the planned date of any such deployment. Nicole Markus and Shia Kapos report for POLITICO.

Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (E) yesterday issued an executive order directing city law enforcement officials to indefinitely coordinate with federal law enforcement “to the maximum extent allowable by law within the District.” Emily Davies, Natalie Allison, and Meagan Flynn report for the Washington Post.

The National Guard troops deployed to Washington, D.C., are expected to have their military orders extended through December in order to ensure continuity of benefits for service members and their families, according to a senior official. The planned extension does not necessarily signal that the D.C. deployment will last until then. Haley Britzky reports for CNN.

A D.C. grand jury has refused to indict a woman accused of threatening Trump on social media, according to a motion filed by the woman’s attorneys on Monday. The grand jury’s refusal is at least the sixth instance in which prosecutors failed to secure an indictment during Trump’s federal policing effort in Washington. Ryan J. Reilly reports for NBC News.

TECH NEWS

In a closely-watched antitrust trial, a federal judge yesterday rejected the Justice Department’s request to break up Google by forcing it to spin off its Chrome browser and Android products, instead ordering the tech giant to share some of its search data with competitors and prohibiting it from making deals that make its products the default tool on mobile devices. Google said it is reviewing the decision. Nate Robson reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal appeals court yesterday reinstated Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to the Federal Trade Commission, with the majority of the court finding that Trump fired her without cause rather than on the statutory grounds of “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Slaughter said she plans to resume work at her FTC office starting today. Cecilia Kang reports for the New York Times.

Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles violated federal law, a federal judge ruled yesterday, finding that the deployment overseen by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement without explicit permission from Congress. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

In a 2-1 decision, a federal appeals court in Texas yesterday ruled that Trump has failed to show that alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang his administration sought to summarily deport using the Alien Enemies Act mounted an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” against the United States. For this reason, Trump did not have the authority to invoke the Act to carry out the deportations, the majority of the court ruled. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

The potential harm caused by the Environmental Protection Agency’s rescission of unspent funding from the $20 billion “Green Bank” program to organizations that were meant to receive the funding is not irreparable, a federal appeals court ruled yesterday in a 2-1 decision.

What are the plans for ICE’s downtown office space?","It's been more than seven months since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s plans to move its Milwaukee offices sparked criticism from local elected officials and immigrants' rights advocates.

Now, renovations are moving forward at ICE’s new building on Milwaukee's northwest side, and the federal government has signed a year-long lease extension at its current downtown Milwaukee office.

Here’s what to know about the move:

Where are ICE’s current Milwaukee offices?

ICE has been based at 310 E. Knapp Street in downtown Milwaukee since 2001. The Milwaukee School of Engineering has owned the building since 2023 and leases it to ICE.

ICE’s lease was set to expire in April, but the school recently granted a one-year lease extension, according to MSOE spokeswoman JoEllen Burdue. The lease extension was first reported by Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service.

Burdue said the government has the option to extend the lease further to 2028.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, was also housed in the building until October 2024, when it moved to another downtown location at 310 W. Wisconsin Ave.

Both agencies are under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. USCIS handles visas and naturalization, while ICE deals with immigration enforcement.

What is ICE’s downtown Milwaukee building used for?

At the Knapp Street office, immigrants facing deportation meet with ICE staff for check-in appointments, and immigrant detainees are processed to be transported to other facilities. It is not organized to hold people overnight.

Detention data from the Vera Institute of Justice, which collected daily immigration detainee totals from federal open records requests, shows that the Knapp Street office is holding more detainees during the day on average than it did during the Biden administration.

During the first two months of the fiscal year — October and November 2024 — the Knapp Street office held an average of 0.3 people a day. That is to say, it held zero people most days.

In the last two months of available data — early April to early June — it held an average of about 2 people.

Four times in early summer, its detainee count hit double-digits. One day in early June, it held 22 people. Three days later, it held 17. None stayed overnight.

What are the plans for ICE’s downtown office space?

Since MSOE purchased the property in 2023, ICE has been planning to move into a business park on Milwaukee’s northwest side and MSOE had been intending to remodel the building into classrooms to house its Civil and Architectural Engineering and Construction Management department.

Those classrooms will now be located in the new Robert D. Kern Engineering Innovation Center, which is under construction.

The addition of the innovation center means that ""we don’t have immediate plans for the building at 310 E. Knapp St.,"" Burdue said in an email.

Where does ICE intend to move?

ICE is moving into a business park at 11925 West Lake Park Drive, on Milwaukee’s far northwest side.

The timeline for opening was not clear. City records over the last few months show standard building permits have been filed as renovations continue at that site.

Will ICE operate out of both buildings?

It’s unclear.

Burdue, the MSOE spokesperson, said ICE requested a one-year extension for the current downtown office space, as opposed to a long-term lease contract.

Milwaukee Ald. Robert Bauman, whose district includes the Knapp Street building, said he was told that ICE extended its lease, but he did not know why, and he has received no updates on the move since a February zoning committee meeting.

Representatives for both ICE and the General Services Administration, which handles federal real estate properties, referred a reporter to the other agency for comment. ICE did not answer follow-up questions about whether the agency planned to operate out of both buildings.

Representatives for the developer of the new offices, Illinois-based WD Schorsch, which owns properties leased to federal government agencies, did not respond to a request for comment.

What will the new ICE building be used for?

According to ICE’s 2023 development proposal, the site will be used to process detainees before they are transported to holding facilities elsewhere. It will also process people who are not detained but need to go to check-in appointments for their deportation cases.

The facility will have an 8-foot-tall privacy fence and a sally port, which is a secure entryway like those used in jails.

Despite early characterizations of the site as a “detention facility,” records from the city's zoning committee indicate it will be a processing center where immigrants are not held overnight and are soon taken elsewhere.

Employees would not commonly work on-site after 5 p.m. The offices would occupy about 17,000 square feet of the 32,000-square foot building, according to the proposal.

Where does ICE hold detainees overnight in Wisconsin?

Dodge County Jail is ICE’s only detention facility in Wisconsin. Unlike ICE’s downtown office, it holds detainees overnight.

The jail's daily headcount has remained steady since the fall, with about 105 to 106 immigration detainees a day.

The Waukesha County Jail holds certain inmates overnight for ICE as part of an agreement with the agency. Its ICE detainee population has increased in recent months, from a daily average of 0.2 inmates in the fall to 3.2 inmates in early summer.

Other local jails in Wisconsin also occasionally hold people for ICE.

To support the Trump administration’s nationwide immigration enforcement efforts, Congress approved $170 billion in additional funding to turbocharge immigration and border enforcement through 2029.

ICE is looking to rapidly expand its detention capacity as part of that effort.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/presto/2023/03/02/PMJS/abf80a7d-cdf6-4695-a9ff-0edc87002361-Knapp.jpg?crop=1279,720,x0,y64&width=1279&height=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-03 11:56:53.191006

Plus, despite the recruitment campaign, beefing up the already overstretched federal law enforcement force “is not going to happen quickly.","Across New York City, Los Angeles has been on the mind in a far darker way than the usual friendly rivalry between the nation’s two largest cities. Since June, Trump and his anti-immigration architect Stephen Miller have used LA as both testing ground and showcase for their shock-and-awe immigration and speech crackdown, sending teams of heavily armed and masked agents to raid workplaces and homes and then deploying federal agents and the National Guard to tamp down resulting protests.

This strategy has not been a success. Troops themselves have reportedly questioned their deployment and the administration has faced multiple lawsuits and some court losses amid cratering public support for its immigration actions – but it has produced some of the higher arrest numbers that Miller demanded, and the administration seems committed to continuing course. As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement begins receiving appropriations in excess of most of the world’s military budgets and goes on a hiring blitz, other jurisdictions have reason to worry about a franchising of the LA model. New York City is an obvious and prime candidate, with some inside Homeland Security already pointing to pressure to ramp up arrests.

A source familiar with internal discussions inside ICE’s New York City field office said agents are under pressure to increase arrests, with teams of federal agents otherwise assigned to tasks like financial and drug crimes being pulled into immigration enforcement. This has not yet translated to hyper-aggressive operations in New York City like the raids in LA, but within the agency the groundwork is being laid to be able to launch that type of campaign as soon as an order comes down.

That mounting concern has run up against relative silence from Mayor Eric Adams and his administration, who have largely reaffirmed they will “follow the law,” but stayed away from many specifics about whether and how they’re planning for the eventuality of an LA-style federal response here, alarming some advocates. New York City has faced enforcement, but it’s so far been largely confined to arrests at the immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza. “We do still continue to reach out and ask questions, often to hear kind of vague responses,” said New York City Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Committee on Immigration.

West Coast nightmare

In LA, teams of heavily armed and often masked agents have for months set up checkpoints and raided worksites and areas where undocumented immigrants are thought to congregate, including Home Depots, which White House Deputy Chief of Staff Miller infamously implored field agents to to focus on instead of just targeting criminals. The constant presence and apparently random nature of the operations has caused people to pull back from aspects of public life. Parents aren’t dropping off kids at school and once-bustling public areas sit empty.

Multiple federal judges have found that the sweeps are indiscriminate and unconstitutionally profiled people based on factors like race and location, an argument bolstered by the fact that multiple U.S. citizens have been detained in the raids. An analysis of ICE data showed that an average of 88 people were being detained per day in a three-week period before a temporary restraining order came down. In addition to suspected immigration violators, federal agents arrested over 160 protesters, some who’d engaged in violence, but most of whom were not charged with any violent offense. The crackdown has had and probably will have huge deleterious impacts on the city’s economy.

In Los Angeles, parents aren’t dropping off kids at school and once-bustling public areas sit empty.

This approach has now spread to Washington, D.C., where Trump recently took over the local police force and began deploying federal officers and soldiers, who’ve reportedly engaged in hundreds of indiscriminate stops, checkpoints and arrests. Unlike the LA deployments, the rationale there has expanded beyond immigration to general criminal enforcement, adding another layer to the possible pretexts for potentially bringing roving federal patrols and troops to New York City. Immigrant-heavy neighborhoods in the capital are reportedly deserted as residents fear the indiscriminate enforcement, which has often involved a mix of federal agents at the exits to metro stations asking people for identification.

That approach could be easily ported over to New York City, with hundreds of subway stations that act as congregation points for people of all walks of life. Trump has now explicitly pledged to deploy troops in other cities, starting apparently with Chicago. A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that Trump’s use of the military in this manner was an illegal attempt to create “a national police force with the President as its chief,” blocking for now additional deployments in California, though the administration seems poised to move ahead with plans elsewhere. Federal law enforcement entities like ICE and the Border Patrol with their own military-style units, though, are free to keep operating.

Trump immigration coordinator and attack dog Tom Homan came to New York City in July to promise that the agency would “flood the zone.” (ICE acknowledged but did not respond to detailed questions about its planning for New York City.)

Mayor Adams was asked about these remarks and whether he’d had any conversations with Trump about it in an unrelated press conference the next day and answered mostly in terms of why such an operation would be unnecessary. “New York is moving in the right direction in public safety. (If) the federal government wants to assist us in really navigating some of the laws around easy accessibility to automatic weapons… I'm not part of the group that says we don't want to work in coordination with the federal government, but we don't need anyone to come in and take over our law enforcement apparatus,” the mayor said. That framing struck many as incomplete, if only because D.C. – experiencing record-low levels of crime – did not need this intervention either.

This leaves Adams in an awkward position. The former cop with the law-and-order calling card seems inclined to help fellow law enforcement, yet has watched ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol trigger disorder where they’ve focused their efforts. Public stats show that most arrestees have no criminal record. At the same time Adams, as an incumbent, is the underdog in a mayoral race in which front-runner Zohran Mamdani has gone the complete opposite direction, pledging (perhaps unrealistically) to halt ICE operations in New York City altogether.

So far, the relationship between the city and federal administrations has been something like an uneasy truce with occasional skirmishes. Adams has met multiple times with Homan, once declaring that he and the Trump official had the “same goal.” The Justice Department in February moved to drop pending federal charges against him in exchange for cooperation on immigration enforcement, though he denies the existence of any deal. In April, his administration moved to allow a new ICE office on Rikers Island, a policy since blocked as a result of a City Council lawsuit.

These overtures don’t mean all smooth sailing. Adams was named personally in a long-shot federal lawsuit filed by Trump’s Justice Department late last month seeking to overturn New York City’s sanctuary provisions. City Hall has sued the federal government over the sudden withdrawal of $80 million from the city’s coffers, and filed several legal briefs opposing ICE arrests of New York City students.

The NYPD’s options

Many sanctuary rules are not up to Adams but embedded in city law. In March, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch was reportedly forced to step in and block an operation that Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry had planned with Homan, which would have entailed NYPD directly assisting hundreds of ICE personnel in raids on two of the city’s makeshift migrant shelters. Tisch reportedly stopped the raids on the grounds that such cooperation was illegal.

“My impression is that Jessica Tisch has a more normal, traditional attitude toward constitutional law,” mused Daniel Feldman, a professor at John Jay and former Assembly member who’s an expert in administrative law and enforcement. “If, for any reason, she's under pressure to mobilize the NYPD, perhaps in lieu of federal troops, I would assume what they would do is pretty much what the National Guard folks did in LA, which is, yeah, they were there, but didn't really do anything. They just stood there.” Still, even in LA which has its own sanctuary laws, some advocates contended that local law enforcement were de facto assisting ICE under the mission of preserving public order – not slapping the cuffs on immigrants but enabling federal raids by keeping onlookers at bay.

“If and when they decide they're going to send more people here to do an LA-style enforcement action, I think what we're going to see is communities standing up and fighting for their neighbors,” said Murad Awawdeh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. Awawdeh expressed frustrations over what he described as a relatively muted administration response to their urging for public reassurances.

“In New York City, we have very comprehensive non-collusion laws on the books. We want to make sure that the City of New York knows that it is not the job of the NYPD to collude with immigration enforcement,” said Awawdeh. “What we would be urging this administration to be doing is ensuring that as New Yorkers are being attacked, that they do what's in their power to defend them.”

How to protect

What would it look like for the city to not just decline to help ICE but actively constrain it and provide help to its targets? Avilés said requiring agents to show their faces is a start. “We see (ICE agents) don't like to follow the law. It doesn't have anything to do with safety. So then the question becomes, can we get these agents to unmask themselves?” said Avilés. In addition to identification, there are pushes to have the city ensure that agents actually have warrants and stay out of sensitive locations, such as schools.

How city law enforcement could or could not intervene would be up to debate and possibly litigation. “The (federal) government can't command the police to help, they can demand that the police not obstruct, or demand that any state not obstruct. Obviously, the line between failure to cooperate and obstruction is one that gets fought over,” said Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and current law professor at Columbia who’s written about interactions between federal and local law enforcement. “To the extent that warrants are legally required, I can imagine a jurisdiction enforcing that constitutional framework. But beyond that, no, federal officers get to do what is legally appropriate to carry out federal law, and can't be barred from doing so by a state or local government.”

Feldman, the John Jay professor, said it might be feasible for the city to not interfere with immigration operations but engage in other constitutional functions. “Where I think the NYPD can legitimately, practically speaking, operate is protecting protesters. As we know, there have been physical conflicts between ICE and some protesters,” he said. “Planning how to prevent that from happening, and assuring safety and exercise of civil liberties at the same time, that should be the focus of their attention at this point.”

Even if those plans are being developed, Feldman doesn’t necessarily agree with the advocates that the city should be talking about them. “Frankly, if I was the (NYPD) commissioner, I wouldn't reveal my plans either. Why? I mean, there's potentially such a fraught, if not adversarial, position with the federal government, why do you want to tell them in advance what your strategy is, to empower them to figure out a counter-strategy?”

If I were in the police department, one, I would not think that I can devise a detailed playbook given the number of uncertainties. And two, to the extent that there’s any playbook, I sure as hell wouldn't tell anyone.

Daniel Richman law professor at Columbia and former federal prosecutor

Richman agrees. “If I were in the Police Department, one, I would keep my principles in mind but not think that I can devise a detailed playbook given the number of uncertainties; and two, to the extent that there’s any playbook, I sure as hell wouldn't tell anyone,” he said. He pointed out that despite the signals that Trump and Homan might ramp up operations in New York City, there are still a lot of uncertainties about how they might do that – whether workplace raids or checkpoints or more of the courthouse arrests. Plus, despite the recruitment campaign, beefing up the already overstretched federal law enforcement force “is not going to happen quickly. The city obviously has to prepare for that surge, but they have quite a lot of time to do that.”

Whatever the reason, City Hall is treading carefully with what they say. Often-chatty Adams officials did not respond to questions I sent.

In a statement, City Hall spokeswoman Kayla Mamelak wrote that “New York City continues to be a place where sensitive locations – like our schools and churches – are safe and free of non-local law enforcement. The Adams administration has also ensured that, at this time of heightened anxiety, New York City provides the largest immigrant legal services and support network in the nation,” pointing to the city’s new Office to Facilitate Pro Bono Legal Services and funding for know your rights efforts and legal representation. She did not address on the record questions about the NYPD’s directives around contending with the possibility of, for example, ICE workplace raids and roving patrols.

While waiting for the city to roll out something more concrete, advocates are focusing more on the ground level. “Communities, institutions, rapid response network, mutual aid groups, and organizations across the city and the state are actually creating their own plans of how they're going to respond to what's happening,” said Awawdeh, though he declined to get into specifics on the record.

Our client lived through the horrors of the Iraq wars. In Australia he has faced homelessness and destitution, and indefinite separation from his wife and children. He is now in his 60s and has health conditions that threaten his life.

This is who the Albanese Government believes should be exiled to Nauru for the rest of his life.

The High Court’s decision means our client’s protection visa will not be reinstated, but this does not determine his future. He still has further legal processes underway – including a case with the United Nations Human Rights Committee who ordered the Albanese Government not to deport him while the human rights implications are investigated.

Our client, like every person, has the right to live in safety and dignity – regardless of visa status.

But he is one of hundreds of migrants and refugees the Albanese Government is attempting to deport to Nauru.

Last week, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke quietly signed a $400-million deal with Nauru to allow for the mass deportation of people released from indefinite immigration detention.

And this week the Albanese Government is rushing laws through Parliament that would strip people of fundamental rights and protections during the deportation process.

The new laws would allow the government to carry out mass deportations without ever having to consider the consequences. It would not be necessary to ask whether a person might die in Nauru without proper medical care, or if they would be permanently separated from their families.

The Albanese Government is trying to ram these laws through Parliament right now – with only a rushed, two-hour parliamentary inquiry tonight to consider this legislation and its devastating and lifelong consequences for people facing permanent exile.

Only Home Affairs officials will be allowed to give evidence, while people facing deportation and the organisations working with them have been shut out.

The men from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba have criminal convictions, but had all served their sentences and been released in the US, their lawyers said. The US deported them to the small southern African country without warning in July, claiming they were “depraved monsters”.

The US has sent migrants to several third countries, as Donald Trump’s administration ramps up deportations. Eight men were sent to South Sudan in July, Rwanda accepted seven migrants last week and Uganda has agreed to take in asylum seekers. The US also deported 252 Venezuelans, first sending them to a notorious prison in El Salvador for four months.

The lawyers said they have been unable to have private conversations with their clients, who are allowed one short video call a week in the presence of prison staff. A local lawyer representing the five men has been prevented from visiting them in the maximum security Matsapha correctional centre.

The Emaswati lawyer filed a case demanding access to the men, but a hearing scheduled for Monday was postponed when the judge did not show up, said Alma David, who is representing the Yemeni and Cuban men.

When the men, who had all been in the US since they were children, were first deported, US assistant homeland security secretary Tricia McLaughlin claimed they were “so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.”

In response, Jamaica’s foreign minister, Kamina Smith, said: “The government has not refused the return of any of our nationals to Jamaica,” and would work to return any deportees to the country. She later said that diplomats visited Orville Etoria in prison in Eswatini on 21 August and found him “in good spirits”.

Etoria, 62, came to the US legally in 1976, aged 12, said his lawyer Mia Unger, of the Legal Aid Society. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 1997. He obtained an undergraduate degree in prison, was released on parole in 2021 and was working in a men’s shelter and studying for a master’s degree in divinity when he was deported.

He had been reporting to Immigration and Customs Enforcement as required and obtained a Jamaican passport earlier this year at their request. His relatives told Unger he had first been put on a plane to Jamaica and then removed, she said, adding that his being sent to Eswatini “makes no sense”.

Relatives of the four other men did not want their identities disclosed, their lawyers said. The Yemeni man, who served 22 years in prison for murder and was released in 2020, had been living in Michigan and is 70, his lawyer Alma David said.

The Cuban man, who served nine years for murder, is in his mid-50s and had been working for a plumbing company in Florida. He was released from prison after serving a separate sentence for grand theft auto in 2012, David said.

She spoke to both men while all five deportees were with guards and the prison chief, who said that only the US embassy in Eswatini could grant access to the men. “Since when does the US embassy have jurisdiction over Eswatini’s national prisons?” she said.

Tin Thanh Nguyen, representing the Vietnamese and Laotian deportees, said the men were aged 34 and 45 and released in 2015 and 2023 respectively. The Laotian man’s relatives reported he was starting to show signs of depression.

“The United States is outsourcing their detention … to purge the United States of immigrants and refugees and to make a spectacle of deportations,” Nguyen said.

Last month, a group of Eswatini NGOs challenged the country’s acceptance of the deportees on constitutional grounds, arguing that parliament had not been consulted and that the men’s human rights were being violated.

An Eswatini government spokesperson said they would not be responding while court cases were under way.

“Weeks ago, I arranged an on-site meeting this coming Friday at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s headquarters in Springfield, Va., to connect with the nonpartisan career intelligence professionals who serve our country every day. These are Virginians – my constituents – and I have held more than a dozen similar private listening sessions with NGA and other intelligence agencies in Virginia under both Democratic and Republican presidents, including during President Trump’s first term. Engagements such as these are a core part of my responsibility to provide oversight and support to our intelligence community and hear from Americans who live in Virginia, and they have never been questioned or politicized, until now.

“Over the weekend, conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer discovered the unpublicized, classified visit and launched a campaign of baseless attacks against both me and NGA Director Vice Admiral Trey Whitworth for hosting what has always been considered a routine oversight meeting. In response to Loomer’s criticism, political appointees canceled the visit, just the latest example of an administration seemingly desperate to please Loomer, a figure with a long history of extreme and outlandish fringe views, including 9/11 denialism, anti-Muslim harassment campaigns, and associations with white supremacists.

“This nakedly political decision undermines the dedicated, nonpartisan staff at NGA and threatens the principle of civilian oversight that protects our national security. Members of Congress routinely conduct meetings and on-site engagements with federal employees in their states and districts; blocking and setting arbitrary conditions on these sessions sets a dangerous precedent, calling into question whether oversight is now allowed only when it pleases the far-right fringe. This should concern Republicans as well as Democrats: if routine oversight can be obstructed for political reasons, no member of Congress is immune.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday that it would pay state and local law-enforcement officers' salaries and benefits in places where governments join a program to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

The offer, which begins October 1, would also provide up to 25% of an officer's salary in overtime costs and bonuses to agencies based on performance, DHS said.

President Donald Trump's administration aims to deport record numbers of immigrants in the U.S. illegally and has intensified enforcement across the country.

The Republican-led Congress in July passed a spending package that gave U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement $75 billion over a little more than four years, a funding surge that ICE plans to use to ramp up operations.

The Trump administration has worked to expand so-called 287(g) immigration-enforcement partnerships with state and local law enforcement, and their number has risen from 135 to 958 since Trump took office in January, DHS said.

Immigrant advocates say the agreements sow mistrust of law enforcement in immigrant communities and could lead to racial profiling.

The partnerships fall under a program called the Task Force Model that was terminated under former President Barack Obama but restarted in Trump's second term. It allows state and local law enforcement to make immigration arrests while performing their policing duties.

In a June fact sheet, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights called it ""the most dangerous and invasive"" form of the Task Force Model. A Justice Department investigation in 2012 found that North Carolina sheriffs illegally stopped and detained Latino drivers under the program.

Nayna Gupta, policy director of the pro-immigration American Immigration Council, said tasking local police with immigration work means they spend less time on ""actual public safety threats in our own communities and immigrants become scared to report actual crimes.""

Yadira Córdoba’s arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Aug. 20 in San Antonio has rattled Nicaragua’s exile community.

Córdoba, a Nicaraguan mother demanding justice for the murder of her 15-year-old son during a May 30, 2018 march in Nicaragua, was arrested during a routine immigration court appointment on August 20. She has been in the United States seeking asylum since 2023.

The U.S Department of Homeland Security could not immediately be reached for comment.

Córdoba is scheduled to have an expedited removal hearing on September 22. The American Immigration Council describes this process to be one by which noncitizens can be removed from the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge.

Undocumented immigrants placed in expedited removal proceedings are entitled to access the asylum system if they express fear of persecution, torture, or of returning to their home country.

The process can be flawed for a number of reasons, including a lack of judicial review and a backlog of asylum applications.

Córdoba faces the real risk of being deported to Nicaragua, where she has been targeted for persecution by the Ortega-Murillo regime.

Human rights organizations warn that her life is in danger if she is returned to Nicaragua.

Following the death of Córdoba’s 15-year-old son, Orlando, she became one of the most prominent voices demanding justice for victims of state repression.

She has since then been a high-profile figure in Nicaragua’s pro-democracy movement and is a member of the Mothers of April, a group that has become a symbol of resistance, demanding accountability and an end to the authoritarian regime in Nicaragua.

“The Mothers of April is made up of women whose children were killed. These are not politicians. They are schoolteachers, nurses, housewives—ordinary people who became activists because of unbearable loss. Their demand is simple: truth, justice, and guarantees of non-repetition,” said Félix Maradiaga, an opposition activist, former presidential candidate, and now professor at the University of Virginia and Johns Hopkins University.

Maradiaga added that “Yadira Córdoba is a name very well known in Nicaragua. She always spoke from a nonpartisan and nonpolitical perspective around the issues of justice, human rights, and democracy.” After her son’s assassination, she became a relentless spokesperson for the Mothers of April.

Córdoba’s activism came at a cost. She faced threats and persecution, forcing her into exile in Costa Rica in 2019. But even there she was not safe. “Let’s remember there have been assassination attempts against Nicaraguan activists there, and even killings. She did what any of us would do—flee to save her life,” said Maradiaga.

There have been documented assassination attempts and killings of Nicaraguan exiles in Costa Rica as part of a pattern of transnational repression orchestrated by the Nicaraguan government. Recent prominent cases include the killing of activist Roberto Samcam in 2025, the killing of Jaime Luis Ortega in 2024, and attacks against Joao Maldonado in 2023, though Costa Rica's president has denied Nicaraguan operatives are active in the country.

In 2023, Córdoba resettled in the United States, where she sought protection under U.S. asylum law. Her detention this month stunned Maradiaga and other exiles. “This was a shock to many of us,” he said. Yadira is an internationally recognized case. Her testimony has been recorded by the European Union, by the Organization of American States, by the United Nations, even raised before the U.N. Security Council. The U.S. government itself, during the first Trump administration, issued statements condemning the assassination of her son.

“That one of the most well-documented cases of extrajudicial killing could now result in deportation—it is absolutely outrageous.”

According to Pablo Cuevas, who’s part of Córdoba’s legal team, the issue is rooted in a technicality. “She entered undocumented and did not have a credible fear interview upon entry. That was later corrected, but ICE is treating it as a violation rather than a technicality”, explained Cordova.

The risk Córdoba faces if deported is severe. “Her life would be at risk,” Maradiaga said. “The regime does not need intelligence reports to know who Yadira is. She has spoken at international forums. If she is returned, she would not only be persecuted but could be disappeared.”

The Sandinista regime has built an extensive surveillance apparatus known as SORM, a Russian-designed system that compiles data into a centralized database. Anyone interrogated by authorities is entered into this system, which can pull information from social media, police records, and even neighborhood informants aligned with the Sandinista Party. Something as minor as a traffic ticket or a Facebook post from years ago can trigger inclusion. Local party members feed names into community lists, which are then passed up to regional representatives, ultimately creating a nationwide registry of citizens under scrutiny. For Nicaraguans who return after migrating—whether deported or coming back voluntarily—the consequences vary.

Maradiaga pointed out that “economic migrants are often forced to sign documents pledging not to criticize the regime. But political cases are different. Those deported activists simply disappear. Their families are too afraid to speak. That’s the kind of police state we are facing.”

He drew a sharp contrast between the U.S. government’s public support for Nicaragua’s pro-democracy movement and the flaws of its asylum system. “Asylum should be hard, and it should be rigorous. But the problem is inconsistency. Some cases without strong documentation are approved, while cases like Yadira’s—with extraordinary proof—are denied. That is what confuses and frightens people.”

Maradiaga himself continues to live in limbo in the U.S. after being released and banished from Nicaragua along with 221 other political prisoners in February 2023. “Neither my wife’s asylum case nor mine has been approved after seven years, despite recognition from U.S. authorities. We have chosen to stay in the asylum system as an act of solidarity with fellow Nicaraguans, to experience its flaws from within, and to speak with legitimacy.”

For Maradiaga, Córdoba’s story is more than an individual case. “When you see humble women—mothers who never imagined becoming political actors—stand up to the dictatorship, you see the real Nicaragua,” said Maradiaga. Yadira’s story is not only about her son Orlando. It is about a movement of mothers who refuse to be silenced.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31e29df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+144/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F93%2Fa4%2F93621b374a64ab4c82938d1c8891%2F64954120-0a2b-49f5-b3c3-2c38fe92a0ec.JPG,N,,2025-09-03 01:57:16.350706

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday filed a joint motion to dismiss an appeal filed by the federal government in 2023 after a district judge sided with the state.

The joint motion cited changes in immigration policies after President Donald Trump replaced former President Joe Biden in January.

“President Trump has since taken office and directed the Department of Homeland Security to reexamine certain immigration policies from the previous administration,” the motion filed at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said.

The motion came after lawyers from the state and federal governments asked the Atlanta-based appeals court in June to put the appeal on hold while they tried to resolve it.

Moody filed a lawsuit in September 2021 as she and Gov. Ron DeSantis made a high-profile issue of criticizing the Biden administration’s handling of immigration issues. The lawsuit involved “parole” policies, which related to undocumented immigrants being released from detention after crossing the country’s southwest border.

U.S. District Judge T. Kent Wetherell issued two rulings in 2023 that said policies, known as “Parole Plus Alternatives to Detention” and “Parole with Conditions,” violated federal law. But the Biden administration appealed the rulings.

Before attorneys asked in June to put the case on hold, the appeals court had directed the two sides to file additional briefs and pointed to an executive order that Trump issued after taking office Jan. 20. The executive order said the Department of Homeland Security should “terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States.”

“Given the change in presidential administration and immigration policies, we must determine whether this case has become moot. … A case becomes moot when events after its commencement ‘create a situation in which the court can no longer give the plaintiff meaningful relief,”” the appeals court said in calling for the additional briefs, partially quoting a legal precedent.

The state argued in the case that the Biden administration violated laws through “catch-and-release” policies. The state contended that undocumented immigrants moved to Florida and created costs for such things as the education, health-care and prison systems.

The appeals court, however, questioned whether Florida had legal standing to challenge the immigration policies. That came after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Texas and Louisiana did not have standing to challenge certain immigration policies.

DeSantis in January appointed Moody to the U.S. Senate to replace Marco Rubio, who became U.S. secretary of state. DeSantis subsequently appointed Uthmeier, his former chief of staff, to serve as attorney general.

The DeSantis administration has taken a series of steps designed to help Trump’s efforts to deport people in the country illegally. Those steps included opening a controversial detention center in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”",https://media.nbcmiami.com/2023/10/GettyImages-1415662791.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-09-03 01:57:32.862052

“The termination of any of the current countries that receive Temporary Protected Status directly affects our immigrant communities in San Francisco,” said District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder, who introduced a non-binding resolution urging the California federal delegation to urge Congress to establish a permanent pathway for Temporary Protected Status holders.

The Trump Administration’s order has been upheld by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and on Sept. 8, the immigrants will lose their protected status – this includes their ability to remain in the United States or to work here legally.

By Fielder’s side at the steps of City Hall were Supervisors Myrna Melgar, Chyanne Chen, Shamann Walton, and Bilal Mahmood. The resolution itself which passed with a unanimous vote on Tuesday afternoon at the Board of Supervisor meeting.

“As your city attorney, I can share with you that our office is doing everything we can to stand with our immigrants because we know how far our country has fallen from the promise of the Statue of Liberty,” said City Attorney David Chiu, whose office filed amicus briefs on July 29 highlighting the “deep integration into American society” of the city’s immigrant population, and warning that ending their status would “cause irreparable harm” to communities.

“We have to stand together,” Chiu said to the 30 or so people who attended the rally.

Created by the U.S. Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, “Temporary Protected Status” protects nationals from countries undergoing civil wars or environmental disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, drought and epidemics from deportation.

A Temporary Protected Status designation has to be renewed every six, 12 or 18 months, depending on the arrangement.

Kimberly, a city worker attending the rally, said that this had been true for her mother, Janeth. She arrived in Los Angeles at age 23, after being displaced from Honduras by Hurricane Mitch.

Violence, disease, and infrastructural damage caused by the hurricane made returning to Honduras dangerous enough that the U.S. kept renewing TPS status for Hondurans.

Like many other TPS holders, the only way for her mother to stay in the United States was to renew her TPS status every two years, Kimberly said. Progressing from TPS status to a green card or citizenship is difficult, and her mother wasn’t able to obtain either.

“The only thing that they give you with TPS is work authorization and deportation protection and to be legally present here,” Kimberly said. “So it literally is just for labor.” Her mother spent the last two decades working as a nurse at Kaiser.

But Sept. 8, 2025 will be her last day. Her mother is not willingly retiring, Kimberly said. Her employment is terminated because of the Aug. 20 court ruling that allowed the Trump administration to proceed with terminating TPS status for several countries, including Honduras.

NPR reported that the decision will impact some 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans, whose TPS designations are set to expire on Sept. 8, as well as some 7,000 people from Nepal whose designations will expire on Aug. 5. Once their designations expire, these immigrants will face deportation.

Kimberly said that her mother has been working seven days straight ahead of her layoff on Sept. 8. “She needs all the money that she can get because she has a mortgage,” Kimberly said.

Her mother has no idea if she can get her money from her retirement account or her pension in any way if she’s in Honduras. She doesn’t know if she will have a chance to be called into work on Monday, Sept. 8. She doesn’t have any family in Honduras anymore.

“Mentally, she’s not okay,” Kimberly said. “Physically, she’s still showing up.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2215-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 02:56:28.339808

The military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys – both military and civilians – to the justice department “as soon as practicable” and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week, according to the memo, dated 27 August.

The effort comes as Donald Trump’s presidential administration cracks down on immigration across the country, ramping up arrests and deportations. Immigration courts are also already dealing with a huge backlog of roughly 3.5m cases that has ballooned in recent years.

However, numerous immigration judges have been fired or left voluntarily after taking deferred resignations offered by the administration, according to their union.

The move is being done at the request of the justice department, and the memo noted that the details will initially last no more than 179 days but can be renewable.

When asked about the move, a justice department spokesperson referred questions about the plan to the defense department. Pentagon officials directed questions to the White House.

A White House official said on Tuesday that the administration was looking at a variety of options to help resolve the significant backlog of immigration cases, including hiring additional immigration judges.

""They're simply celebrating their heritage, they shouldn't be interrupted in this way,"" Pritzker said.

The news conference came just moments after President Donald Trump told reporters ""we're going in"" when asked about a slew of circulating rumors that the White House has plans to send troops to Chicago to address crime.

""Rumors have been swirling about what the White House has planned, and sifting fact from fiction has been increasingly difficult because Donald Trump's administration is not working in coordination with the city of Chicago, Cook County or the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said.

While no official announcement has been made, the Trump administration has reportedly been planning to send National Guard members to Chicago in a similar manner to how they were deployed to Washington, D.C. in recent weeks, according to the National Guard and other outlets.

Pritzker confirmed to NBC Chicago’s Mary Ann Ahern just hours before the press conference that ICE agents will be conducting enhanced immigration enforcement operations in the city in coming days.

""[They said] they will begin operations here sometime in the coming week,"" Pritzker said in the exclusive interview. ""That - literally after two weeks of all this talk about troops on the ground - that's the first time we've heard from the federal government on this.""

Pritzker also said during the press conference that he believes staging for federal enforcement in Chicago has ""already begun.""

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson spoke alongside Pritzker during the news conference Tuesday.

Trump is ""worried about the wrong border,"" Johnson said. ""We don't have an immigration crisis in Chicago, we have a gun crisis.""

""Violence in Chicago is not because we have too many immigrants, it's because we have too many guns,"" Johnson said.

In anticipation of increased enforcement efforts, Johnson last week signed an executive order, declaring Chicago police will not collaborate with military on police patrols or civil immigration enforcement.

The following can be attributed to Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University:

“Reports that ICE has renewed its contract with spyware vendor Paragon compounds the civil liberties concerns surrounding the rapid and dramatic expansion of ICE’s budget and authority.

In the media release, Finlay warned that the changes contemplated via the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (2025 Measures No. 1) Bill 2025 could:

Undermine human rights

Breach Australia’s international legal obligations

Deprive those removed of a meaningful opportunity to respond to decisions with major impacts on their lives, health, safety, and families

“These amendments strip away one of the most basic legal protections of a fair society: the right to be heard,” Finlay said in the media release.

Finlay added that the bill would validate relevant visa decisions retrospectively. According to Finlay, this change could entail retrospective criminal liability, significant concerns regarding the rule of law, and the need for careful scrutiny.

Finlay encouraged Parliament to examine the bill to ensure it would not undermine Australia’s human rights obligations.

“Fairness should never be optional,” Finlay said.

Finlay also urged Parliament to consider the contemplated changes in their broader context,

“Rather than a patchwork of reactive responses, we need to ensure principled migration and asylum policies that maintain the integrity of Australia’s migration system while also upholding our human rights obligations,” Finlay said.

Context of changes

In its media release, the AHRC noted that the planned amendments were part of the government’s response to recent High Court rulings, including NZYQ v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs (2023), 280 CLR 137; [2023] HCA 37.

NZYQ determined that indefinite immigration detention – where there was no real prospect of a detainee’s removal from Australia becoming practicable within the reasonably foreseeable future – was unconstitutional.

NZYQ resulted in the release from immigration detention of hundreds of detainees whom the relevant authorities could not deport to their country of origin, as well as legislative changes permitting the government to pay third countries to accept non-citizens under third country reception arrangements.

According to the bill’s explanatory memoranda on Parliament’s website, the proposed changes would provide that the rules of natural justice would be inapplicable to third country reception arrangements.

In a 2-1 decision, the District of Columbia circuit court of appeals allowed a lower court decision in favor of Slaughter to take effect, rejecting the Trump administration’s request to delay the ruling during its appeal.

The court said that FTC commissioners may not be fired by a president without cause, saying that the law on this point has been clear for nearly a century.

“The government is not likely to succeed on appeal because any ruling in its favor from this court would have to defy binding, on-point, and repeatedly preserved supreme court precedent,” two judges wrote in the majority opinion.

A third judge, Trump appointee Neomi Rao, dissented, saying that federal courts likely have no authority “to order the reinstatement of an officer removed by the president”.

Slaughter said on Tuesday that she was heartened by the ruling and that Trump is “not above the law”.

“I’m very eager to get back first thing tomorrow to the work I was entrusted to do on behalf of the American people,” Slaughter said in an emailed statement.

The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The FTC enforces consumer protection and antitrust laws.

Trump had appointed Slaughter to her first term on the FTC in 2018. Joe Biden designated her as the FTC’s acting chair in January 2021, and Biden appointed her to a second term in 2023, which is to end in September 2029.

A federal judge ruled in July that the Trump administration’s attempt to remove Slaughter did not comply with removal protections in federal law.

Under the FTC’s bipartisan structure, no more than three of the five commissioners can come from the same party. Congress placed restrictions on the hiring and firing of commissioners in an effort to insulate the agency from partisan politics.

Trump fired the two Democratic commissioners on the FTC in March, in a major test for the independence of regulatory agencies.

The dispute over Trump’s firing of Slaughter and fellow commissioner Alvaro Bedoya will likely end up before the supreme court, which ruled 90 years ago that FTC commissioners may be dismissed only for good cause, such as neglecting their duties. Bedoya formally resigned in June to take another job and is not part of the case.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9595704e6540623da8f5f0c2d852cb65fd9546fe/120_0_3634_2907/master/3634.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbb4b51f4dcbd8f78ff122f7e03bd78f",N,,2025-09-03 01:57:36.961900

Migrants bus south through Mexico and other Central American nations until they arrive in the center of Panama.","MEXICO CITY (AP) — More than 14,000 mainly Venezuelan migrants who hoped to reach the United States have reversed course and turned south since U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown began, according to a report published Friday by the governments of Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica.

The phenomenon, known as “reverse flow” migration, is largely made up of Venezuelan migrants who fled their country only to encounter U.S. immigration policy no longer open to asylum-seekers.

Migration through the treacherous Darien Gap on the border between Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023, when more than half a million migrants crossed. That flow slowed somewhat in 2024, but dried up almost completely early this year.

Friday's report, published with the support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had dropped 97% this year.

Migrants traveling south interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia by those countries' ombudsmen offices were almost all Venezuelans (97%), and about half of them said they planned to return to Venezuela, according to the report. Nearly all said they were returning because they could no longer legally enter the U.S.

Since 2017, around 8 million people have fled Venezuela. For years, those migrants flocked to other South American nations, including Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and others.

That changed in 2021, when hundreds of thousands of people set out for the U.S., braving the Darien Gap along the way.

A U.S. government smartphone app became the main way for asylum-seekers to enter the U.S. under the Biden administration. Thousands of migrants became stranded in Mexico when Trump ended the use of the app on his first day in office.

Now, those migrants who were still trying to reach the U.S. have reversed course, traveling back to South America. Around a quarter of those interviewed planned to go to neighboring Colombia, previously the epicenter of the mass migration from Venezuela. Others said they didn’t know where they were going.

Colombia and other South American nations spent years pleading for aid from the international community to cope with the brunt of Venezuela's migratory crisis, before many of those same migrants began moving toward the United States.

“Most of these people are already victims of human rights abuses,"" Scott Campbell, a U.N. human rights representative in Colombia, said in a statement. “We urge authorities to aid people in this reverse migration to prevent them from being exploited or falling into trafficking networks run by illegal armed groups.”

The shift marks a radical reversal in one of the biggest mass migrations in the world.

Migrants bus south through Mexico and other Central American nations until they arrive in the center of Panama. From there, migrants pay between $260 and $280 to ride on precarious boats packed with people back to Colombia.

They take two different routes. Most island hop north of Panama through the Caribbean Sea, landing in the small town of Necocli, Colombia, where many started their journeys through the Darien.

Others travel south by sea along a jungled swath of Panama and Colombia through the Pacific Ocean, where they are dropped off in remote towns or the Colombian city of Buenaventura. The region is one of the most violent in Colombia, and the lack of state presence is filled by warring armed groups.",https://epsilon.creativecirclecdn.com/christianindex/original/20250902-080352-c60-AP25240816520264.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 23:56:33.518705

WASHINGTON – U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem today terminated multiple Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees for consuming pornographic content during work hours while on government issued devices. During the investigation into FEMA employees’ conduct, DHS discovered that almost half of FEMA’s employees regularly log into social media platforms while performing their taxpayer funded duties.

“Today, I am announcing that multiple disgraced FEMA employees were fired for using their government devices to consume sexually explicit content while on the job. These individuals had access to critical information and intelligence and were entrusted to safeguard Americans from emergencies—and instead they were consuming pornography. In at least one case the pornography consumed was racially charged and involved bestiality,”said Secretary Noem. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are cleaning house at FEMA to make this dysfunctional agency work for the American people the way that it was intended. For decades some of these bureaucrats engaged in every act imaginable instead of safeguarding the American people from natural disasters. That ends now.”

On July 12, 2025, The DHS’s Insider Threat Operations Center (ITOC) identified that one employee typed explicit and sexually charged phrases into a chatbot website from his government devices for the purpose of having the comments read back to him in an accent.

On August 1, 2025, another individual, a government contracted employee also stationed at the command center was identified by the ITOC as accessing Reddit.com 578 times over a 30-day period. It was revealed that he was engaged in extensive interactions with individuals online, viewing explicit sexual content while on his work devices. He accessed content that included graphic photographs and videos. On several occasions, he used his government computer to chat online with members presenting explicit content.

DHS actively investigates the misuse of devices throughout the agency to ensure that employees are not abusing federal devices or sharing classified or sensitive information.

A recent report from Hatewatch, the extremism watchdog run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, shows how the agency and top Trump administration officials have ramped up their promotion of white nationalist or anti-immigrant social media posts since June, when the agency reposted anti-immigrant propaganda that originated from an avowedly racist social media account.

MSNBC has noted the agency’s propaganda in the past, including their use of cruel memes that vilify nonwhite immigrants and of American artworks to promote themes of ethnic cleansing.

The Hatewatch report takes a comprehensive look at these incidents since June, citing an apparent increase in racist propaganda as part of what the watchdog calls “an escalating trend in American immigration enforcement toward overt use of white nationalist and anti-immigrant myths to recruit personnel and justify departmental operations.”

The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to MSNBC’s request for comment on Hatewatch’s claims. When asked last month by NBC’s Los Angeles affiliate about the campaign, the DHS called its digital strategy “bold and effective.”

Here’s one example Hatewatch flagged:

In one recruitment poster, published on Aug. 11, a white Uncle Sam caricature in the style of a Norman Rockwell painting stands at a crossroads of directional signs that include such phrases as “INVASION,” “CULTURAL DECLINE,” “HOMELAND” and “LAW & ORDER.” The poster includes the caption “Which way, American man?” — which appears to be a nod to the influential white nationalist text Which Way Western Man? by William Gayley Simpson. Published by an imprint associated with the neo-Nazi National Alliance, the book is a reflection and critique of society from Simpson’s travels. While critical of some aspects of society, it largely frames Western civilization as superior and veers into sexist and antisemitic commentary.

To some online observers, like author and conspiracy theory expert Mike Rothschild, this apparent nod to an unabashed bigot was hardly subtle:

The report notes that multiple Trump administration figures in senior leadership roles have ties to racist organizations or have been known to espouse white nationalist themes. That includes border czar Tom Homan, who collaborated with anti-Muslim hate group The United West on his “Defend the Border” project, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, whose white nationalist views first came under scrutiny during Trump’s first term.

The report also refers to multiple posts from DHS that promote the idea of forging friendships or strengthening familial bonds over the targeting of immigrants. And it notes that the agency’s social media strategy has been celebrated by known white supremacists like activist Jared Taylor, who called the posts a “remarkable change” during an episode of his podcast in August.

WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a public comment opposing the Department of Labor’s (DOL) proposed rule, “Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Domestic Service,” which would eliminate hard-won wage and hour protections for millions of the nation’s paid caregivers, who are disproportionately Black and Brown women and are among the poorest workers in the labor force.

The proposal would change the definition of in-home “companionship” services under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the federal law whose protections include a minimum hourly wage and overtime pay for work performed beyond 8 hours in a single day, or 40 hours in a single week. Under the proposed new definition, millions of home care workers would no longer be entitled to those protections. Additionally, while agencies and other third-party employers of home care workers currently are required to comply with the FLSA, DOL proposes to excuse those employers from the statute’s requirements. These actions would undo DOL’s 2013 regulations, which extended FLSA protections to home care workers after decades of exclusion.

“Even though they currently are entitled to receive the minimum wage and overtime, home care workers are among the most vulnerable in our nation’s labor force, facing wage theft and unsafe working conditions, and living in poverty,” said Gillian Thomas, senior counsel in the ACLU Women's Rights Project. “The Department of Labor ’s proposed rule change would strip away the meager economic security that FLSA coverage provides to these essential workers, who take care of our elders and our loved ones with disabilities. By enabling greater exploitation by corporate home care providers, DOL will drive more workers out of a field already facing a profound labor shortage and deprive millions of families of the care they rely on.”

ACLU’s comment highlights that the exclusion of home care workers from the FLSA’s protections stems directly from the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. When Congress passed labor laws like FLSA and the Social Security Act in the 1930s, lawmakers carved out from those statutes’ coverage domestic workers as well as agricultural workers—the two fields in which formerly enslaved people and their descendants were most likely to work—in order to win southern lawmakers’ support. Although Congress eventually amended the FLSA to bring such workers within the law’s protection, DOL did not fully effectuate that intent until it issued regulations in 2013.

“Today, home care workers still are disproportionately women of color, and most of whom are women and people of color, provide essential care yet remain among the poorest and least protected in our economy. Rescinding DOL’s 2013 rules not only will make them much poorer—it will shamefully revive a legal exclusion firmly rooted in racism and misogyny,” added Thomas.

DOL’s 2013 rule recognized the realities of the modern home care industry, in which workers are well-trained professionals who are supporting families of their own, and in which third-party agencies—rather than care recipients themselves—employ care workers, reaping billions in profits. Entitlement to minimum wage and overtime pay has provided economic security for a workforce made up overwhelmingly of women, and particularly Black women and immigrant women. Such protections not only have helped lift wages for one of the nation’s lowest-paid professions, but also has ensured stable, quality care for seniors and people with disabilities.

ACLU’s comment further explains that the proposed rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act. DOL has effectively suspended the 2013 rule without proper notice and comment, and its justifications for abandoning longstanding protections are arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful.

The ACLU urges the department to preserve the 2013 rule, which corrected a historic injustice, advanced gender and racial equity, and strengthened the home care workforce.

The Trump administration has decided to get more immigration judges from an unprecedented source: the military.

On Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that the Pentagon plans to send up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to temporarily run immigration courts around the country. Some of them could receive their new assignments as early as next week.

The arrangement would help the Trump administration tackle a backlog of immigration cases. But military lawyers have little or no experience with immigration law. And some former military lawyers worry the plan isn’t even legal. It “should raise all sorts of alarms,” Daniel Maurer, a former Army attorney who also taught law at West Point, told me recently.

I spoke with Maurer in July, after President Trump first hinted that he’d be open to the idea of deploying military attorneys—known as Judge Advocate Generals, or JAGs—as immigration judges in Florida. That idea, floated by Gov. Ron DeSantis, hadn’t yet come to fruition. “There is no clear precedent for what DeSantis and the president are doing,” Mark Nevitt, a law professor at Emory University who served as a Navy JAG, told me at the time.

“This would be unlawful,” added Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles who was an Air Force JAG.

In particular, VanLandingham said, turning military lawyers into immigration judges would likely violate the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that bars US troops from participating in civilian law enforcement or “executing the laws,” unless otherwise authorized to do so by the Constitution or Congress. It’s “frightening,” VanLandingham said of the plan, because “the use of military courts to hear civilian cases is the essential component of martial law.”

“What you end up with,” Maurer added, “is military officers under federal control who are running civilian courts.”

The former JAGs gamed out several scenarios (see my previous story for more details), but they couldn’t imagine any in which it would be legal for the Pentagon to turn military attorneys into immigration judges, that is, unless Congress were to pass a law that allowed it, or Trump invoked the Insurrection Act, which gives the commander in chief power to deploy military forces within the United States to suppress rebellion or domestic violence.

And if Trump went that route, there would be no turning back, according to Raquel Aldana, a law professor at the University of California, Davis: “The reality is that, once he does, the powers can be unlimited and we are in a military state.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2Sept2025_JAGs.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-02 19:56:31.124090

Postliberal democracy, by contrast, embraces the values of liberalism but tries to insulate itself from the will of the people.
Standing between these two models is old-fashioned liberal democracy.
If the frustration of liberal democracy is that it tends to proceed in half-steps, its virtue is that it advances on more secure footing.
At that point, hopefully, the values of liberal democracy — including an appreciation of the virtues of immigrants — might begin to reassert themselves.","It’s been 10 years since Angela Merkel, as German chancellor, memorably declared “Wir schaffen das” — “We can do this” — in the face of the mass migration crisis sweeping Europe. Last week The Wall Street Journal reported, “For the first time, populist or far-right parties are leading the polls in the U.K., France and Germany.” Similar parties are already in power or in government in Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, to say nothing of the United States.

To say the West’s turn to the anti-immigrant right was the predictable result of Merkel’s calamitous decision to open Germany’s borders does not mean there aren’t still lessons to be learned from it — not least by the world’s most clueless of all major political parties today, the Democratic Party.

Starting around 20 years ago, perhaps earlier, liberal democracy gained two half-siblings: postliberal democracy and preliberal democracy.

Preliberal democracy accepts the practice of regular elections but rejects most of the core values of liberalism: free speech and moral tolerance, civil liberties and the rights of the accused, the rule of law and independence of courts, the equality of women and so on. Turkey under the long reign of Recep Tayyip Erdogan typifies this type of democracy, as did Egypt under the short reign of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi.

Postliberal democracy, by contrast, embraces the values of liberalism but tries to insulate itself from the will of the people. The European Union, with its vast architecture of transnational legislation, is one example of postliberalism; international courts, issuing rulings where they have no jurisdiction, are another; global environmental accords, like the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement (signed by the Obama administration but never ratified by Congress), are a third.

Standing between these two models is old-fashioned liberal democracy. Its task is to manage the tension, or temper the opposition, between competing imperatives: to accept majority will and protect individual right, to defend a nation’s sovereignty while maintaining a spirit of openness, to preserve its foundational principles while adapting to change. If the frustration of liberal democracy is that it tends to proceed in half-steps, its virtue is that it advances on more secure footing.

That’s the ideal that much of the West essentially abandoned in recent years. On the political left but also the center-right, postliberal policymaking largely determined the outcome of the two most basic political questions: First, who is “us”? And second, who decides for us?

Merkel never sought the approval of German voters to relax the country’s immigration laws and take in nearly a million people over the space of a year. Americans didn’t elect President Joe Biden on any promise to let in millions of migrants over the southern border. Post-Brexit Britons never thought they’d bring in an astounding 4.5 million immigrants to a country of just 69 million between 2021 and 2024 — under Tory leaders, no less.

No wonder the reaction to years of postliberal governance has been a broad turn to its preliberal opposite. Not all right-wing populist parties are the same, and there are meaningful differences between, say, the ill-disguised fascism of the Alternative for Germany and the pragmatic conservatism of Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister. But all of them have risen on the same core complaint: that postliberal governments used obscure legal mechanisms or simply ignored the law to attempt a social transformation without society’s explicit consent. In America, it’s called replacement theory.

Liberals and progressives typically dismiss replacement theory as antisemitic, racist demagoguery, and no doubt there are plenty of bigots who believe it. But maybe some measure of understanding ought to be extended to ordinary voters who merely wonder why they should be made to feel like unwelcome outsiders in parts of their own country or asked to pay a share of their taxes for the benefit of newcomers they never agreed to welcome in the first place or extend tolerance to those who don’t always show tolerance in return or be told to shut their mouths over some of the more shocking instances of migrant criminality.

What most of these voters are feeling isn’t racism. It’s indignation at having their normal and appropriate political concerns dismissed as racism. And as long as politicians and pundits of the traditional political establishment treat them as racists, the far right is going to continue to rise and flourish.

There’s something partisans of the center-right and center-left could do: Instead of discreetly murmuring that, say, Merkel or Biden got immigration policy wrong or that it was morally and economically right but politically foolish, they can grasp the point that control over borders is a sine qua non of national sovereignty, that mass migration without express legislative consent is politically intolerable, that migrants ought to be expected to accept, not reject, the values of the host country and that hosts should not be expected to adapt themselves to values at odds with a liberal society.

At that point, hopefully, the values of liberal democracy — including an appreciation of the virtues of immigrants — might begin to reassert themselves. Until then, the preliberal tide will continue to surge.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/03/multimedia/02stephens-vjtf/02stephens-vjtf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 20:56:59.273521

Private prison operator CoreCivic, which owns and manages the 2,560-bed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, confirmed to The Bee that the facility is now operational.

“We have begun receiving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees at our California City Correctional Facility (CCCF) in response to an immediate need from the federal government for safe, humane and appropriate housing and care for these individuals,” Ryan Gustin, senior director for public affairs for CoreCivic, said in a statement.

The California City Immigration Processing Center, as it is now known, is the third privately-operated ICE facility in Kern County and the seventh in California. The Geo Group private prison operator runs Mesa Verde in Bakersfield and Golden State Annex in McFarland. The reopening was first reported by Bakersfield’s Eyewitness News KBAK-CBS.

It’s unclear how the facility was able to open without a 180-day public notice as required by state law.

California City Mayor Marquette Hawkins and City Manager Christopher Lopez did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

In an interview with The Bee on Thursday, Lopez said the facility would likely be subject to SB29. The state law prohibits a city or county from approving an immigration detention center, including the reuse of existing building owned by private prison operators, unless the public agency has provided 180-day notice to the public and solicited and heard public comments on the action.

On Thursday, Lopez said he had “no information” on the negotiations between ICE and California City on a longer-term operation contract to re-open.

The privately-operated prison opened in the late 1990s by Corrections Corporation of America, which later became known as CoreCivic. In the early 2010s, ​CoreCivic​ had a contract with the federal government to house federal detainees who awaited trial or had pending immigration cases. It later became a privately operated state prison known as the California City Correctional Facility, which closed in 2024 after the state ended its for-profit prison contracts.

Gustin, of CoreCivic, said the reopening will create about 500 new jobs and generate more than $2 million in property taxes to the city.

ICE did not respond to specific questions about when the facility opened. In a statement, a spokesperson said “ICE has worked with private detention operators, local governments, and other federal partners to identify and bring online over 60 new detention facilities to include California City.”

Immigration advocates warned during public comment at a June 24 California City council meeting that the facility’s opening would lead to increased community arrests in the greater Kern County region.

According to a study by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, immigrants are more likely to be arrested and detained by ICE in counties with more detention beds. In communities with more than 850 ICE detention beds, there was a 6.4 times higher likelihood of arrest, researchers found.

California City had concerns with reopening

Immigration rights advocates have shown up to California City council meetings throughout the summer to voice opposition to the facility’s reopening. City officials have not discussed the facility’s reopening at a public meeting since June 24, according to a review of council meeting agendas.

“We’re troubled by California City turning a deaf ear to the objections voiced by community members and advocates voiced at previous meetings,” said Nora Zaragoza-Yáñez, manager of the Valley Watch Network with the nonprofit group Faith in the Valley.

Faith in the Valley estimated as of Tuesday afternoon that there are already 300 detainees at the California City facility that are being quietly transferred from Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde. The group alleged in a social media post Tuesday afternoon the facility opened “without a valid permit.”

Lopez said Thursday CoreCivic had submitted a site plan review — a necessary step to receive a business license. The facility already had a conditional use permit in place, he said. A Sept 2 planning commission agenda confirms the site plan review was pending.

In a July 29 letter to CoreCivic, Lopez told the private prison operator that the facility “posed a serious and imminent threat to the health and safety of the community of California City.” The city listed four concerns related to insufficient emergency communications, increased demand for police and fire services, as well as paramedics and ambulances for medical emergencies.

The letter also listed concerns with a fire inspection and basic radio test that found the building wasn’t up to code.

Gustin of CoreCivic said the company’s leadership team had an “open line of communication” with California City officials. He said CoreCivic had addressed the concerns raised in the July 29 letter.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser on Thursday dropped the lawsuit he filed against Investigator Alexander Zwinck over the incident because of the deputy’s resignation, according to court records. Weiser agreed to dismiss the case because the law no longer applies to Zwinck after his resignation, according to a motion filed last week.

A larger investigation into whether other state law enforcement officers in the region collaborated with federal officials in a Signal group chat for the purposes of federal immigration enforcement will continue, said Lawrence Pacheco, spokesman for the attorney general’s office.

“Because the laws he is accused of violating apply only to state and local employees, the attorney general’s office is dismissing the lawsuit against Mr. Zwinck but retaining the right to re-file the case if Mr. Zwinck becomes a state or local employee in the future,” Weiser said in a statement.

Weiser alleged in the lawsuit that Zwinck knowingly assisted in federal immigration enforcement by sharing information about 19-year-old Caroline Dias Goncalves in the Signal group chat during a June 5 traffic stop on Interstate 70 near Loma.

Colorado law prohibits local law enforcement officers from carrying out civil immigration enforcement and largely blocks local police agencies from working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The deputy purposely stalled Dias Goncalves so federal immigration officers could get into position to arrest her, and passed on details about the make and model of her car, her license plate, and her direction and timing of travel to the federal officers, knowing it would be used for immigration enforcement, Weiser said.

Zwinck pulled Dias Goncalves over because she was following a semitrailer too closely. At about 1:40 p.m., he shared a picture of her driver’s license in the Signal group chat so that federal agents could run her information through a number of databases that are only accessible to them, Weiser alleged in the lawsuit.

Zwinck questioned Dias Goncalves about her accent and where she was from — she said she was born in Brazil. He shared his location with the federal agents, who responded that they were en route. He kept Dias Goncalves for about 15 minutes, then let her go with a warning at about 1:55 p.m.

The federal agents then arrested her on immigration grounds. Dias Goncalves, who attends the University of Utah, came to the U.S. from Brazil with her family when she was 7 and overstayed a tourist visa. She has a pending asylum application, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

State officials said they have not inspected the private immigrant detention center in Tacoma since last year amid legal pushback, but a recent federal court opinion could reinforce state-level oversight of health and safety conditions for detainees.

The Department of Labor & Industries reported it last inspected working conditions at the Northwest Immigration Processing Center in summer 2024 and found no violations. GEO Group, the private company operating the detention center, has challenged the state’s authority to conduct inspections and since barred entry to L&I as well as Department of Health inspectors.

“Despite hundreds of complaints and our ongoing efforts, NWIPC continues to deny entry to DOH staff,” DOH spokesperson Kara Kostanich wrote in a statement. “Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all people in Washington, including those in detention, who are among the most vulnerable in our state.”

GEO Group has contested a 2023 Washington state law that authorized new oversight of the private detention center, arguing the law unfairly discriminated against the company as the only such center in the state. Legislators amended that law earlier this year to include other facilities and impose specific penalties on health and safety violations.

The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion on Aug. 19, overturning a lower court ruling that barred state officials from conducting inspections, and clarifying that the state has authority to regulate many types of civil detention facilities such as mental health institutions.

“The key issue in this case is whether the entities to which we should compare the NWIPC are state prisons or civil detention facilities,” the opinion states. “[We] conclude that the appropriate comparators are civil detention facilities.”

The case will now go back to U.S. District Court in Seattle for further proceedings.

The Department of Health had filed a separate lawsuit last year, seeking a court order to allow inspectors into the detention center to observe detainee quarters. L&I spokesman Matt Ross told Cascade PBS that the agency has maintained it has ongoing authority to conduct its workplace safety checks, but confirmed it had not inspected the center since last year.

“We already had authority under state law and the state constitution to inspect conditions for workers,” he wrote in an email, “and were already conducting routine inspections into workplace safety and health at the site.”

GEO Group recently dropped a lawsuit to block L&I from releasing records from its 2024 inspection after a Cascade PBS reporter requested those materials under the Public Records Act. The company sought an injunction against L&I in January, arguing that disclosing the inspection photos and reports to the media could undermine security at the facility. Cascade PBS was named as a defendant in the action solely in its capacity as a requestor under the Public Records Act. GEO did not seek legal or equitable relief against Cascade PBS.

In attachments to its filed complaint, GEO Group included a live hyperlink to more than 200 L&I inspection photos. Most of the photos depicted items related to workplace safety regulations such as fire extinguishers, stairways, cleaning chemical labels or personal protective equipment. Some photos included shackles, gas masks or tactical gear.

L&I later provided Cascade PBS with heavily redacted copies of those photos. Cascade PBS then asked L&I to conduct an administrative review of those redactions and officials provided a second set of similarly redacted photos, citing a security exemption raised by GEO Group.

Many redactions blacked out doorways, windows or the locations of security cameras. L&I contended the redacted photos contained “specific and unique vulnerability assessments or specific and unique emergency and escape response plans at a city, county, or state adult or juvenile correctional facility, or secure facility for persons civilly confined.”

“In this case we removed the location of security cameras, video surveillance images, and types of weapons and restraints,” an L&I records officer wrote to Cascade PBS.

GEO Group ended its case against L&I and Cascade PBS in June, filing a voluntary request for dismissal before any substantive proceedings or rulings occurred in the case.

An attorney affiliated with the Washington Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit organization advocating for government transparency, told Cascade PBS that exemptions that allow public agencies to redact information should be applied narrowly. The attorney pointed to Does v. King County, a 2015 case in which officials tried to block the release of surveillance footage of a shooting on Seattle Pacific University’s campus.

The state Court of Appeals held that providing surveillance footage did not in itself compromise security and that footage could be released with limited redactions of student identities.

GEO Group did not respond to requests for comment on the latest federal court decision. The company is expected to file a response to the opinion by Sept. 16.

State representative Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo, who sponsored both inspection bills, lauded the recent court decision, calling it an act of “justice” and a step toward holding the NWIPC accountable for its numerous alleged human rights abuses.

“We certainly should not be letting a private facility come in and profit off the backs of our most vulnerable people,” she said. “And that’s what’s been happening — with no accountability — very little from the federal government, if any, and none from the state. They’ve been able to do whatever it is that they want, but they’re doing it in our state, and I think that’s the difference.”

The panel of appellate judges held that multiple sections of the state’s inspection law did not conflict with the “intergovernmental immunity doctrine,” which protects federal agencies from state regulation or discrimination. The judges ruled that requiring DOH to adopt rules that ensure safe and sanitary conditions to people in immigration detention and enforcing civil penalties for violations of such conditions did not rise to that level.

“[T]he panel held that it would not decide at this point whether Washington regulates the conditions of confinement at the NWIPC differently from the way it regulates the conditions of confinement in other civil detention facilities,” the panel wrote. “Because the district court incorrectly concluded that the appropriate comparator was Washington’s prisons, the panel remanded to allow the district court to make the comparison with other civil detention facilities.”

The judges concluded that allowing GEO to compare its operations to prison would “ignore the critical fact that inmates in Washington’s prisons have been convicted of crimes, and that the conditions of their confinement are part of a penal regime.”

“By contrast,” the opinion states, “none of the detainees held in the NWIPC has been convicted of — or even charged with — a crime.”

Before the DOH could implement its own rules, the panel found that the already-existing contractual requirements that were implemented on the NWIPC by the state were “almost identical” to the requirements imposed under Washington law on the types of civil detention facilities.

Ortiz-Self said the decision would help Washington achieve parity with California — which, since 2017, has empowered state investigators to inspect the state’s network of immigration detention centers.

“We want it for all facilities — public or private — because we feel a sense of accountability as the state that is housing these facilities,” she said. “And in the California determination, they said, ‘Yes, as a state, states do have a right to inspect and have standards for private facilities.’”

Kostanich with DOH said the agency is still determining its next steps in the case.

“We are optimistic the federal courts will clarify DOH’s authority,” she wrote, “allowing us to conduct investigations that promote transparency and protect the health and well-being of everyone inside the facility.”

Why it matters: The offer comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement has fallen far short of President Trump's ambitious deportation goals, prompting a push to hire more agents quickly.

The funding will come through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, per DHS.

State of play: Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows ICE to delegate authority to local police to enforce some immigration laws

Homeland Security would offer local police tools and training to enforce immigration laws while performing routine police duties.

Starting Oct. 1, ICE will fully reimburse participating agencies for the annual salary and benefits of each eligible trained officer, including overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer's annual salary.

Law enforcement agencies will also be eligible for quarterly monetary performance awards based on the successful location of undocumented immigrants provided by ICE.

By the numbers: As of Tuesday, state and local police from 40 states have participated, with 8,501 trained task force officers and over 2,000 officers in training, Homeland Security said.

287(g) partnerships have increased 609% under Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — from 135 agreements to 958.

The plan calls for sending groups of 150 attorneys, both military and civilian, with the first round expected to be identified by next week and deployed ""as soon as practicable,"" according to the memo.

Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed the move to Newsweek.

""At the request of the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense is identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as Temporary Immigration Judges,"" Parnell said in a statement. ""These DOD attorneys will augment existing resources to help further combat a backlog of cases by presiding over immigration hearings.""

Why It Matters

The DOJ oversees the immigration court system, where judges determine whether immigrants are eligible to remain in the United States or not. The system has been facing a backlog for some time, reaching an all-time high in July as some judges left and recruitment slowed under the Trump administration.

What To Know

There are about 600 immigration judges across the country, within the DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), down from a high of over 700 in the last few months of the Biden administration.

The current White House fired multiple immigration judges, some allegedly without obvious cause, despite the president's focus on immigration law and enforcement.

According to the memo seen by the AP, the deployment of Defense Department judges to the EOIR will initially last no more than 179 days.

It was not immediately clear what impact the judge could have on the DOJ's backlog of cases, which stood at 3.7 million when figures were last published in June.

Last week, the EOIR issued a memo granting itself the authority to appoint any government attorney as a temporary immigration judge, stating that this would allow it to select judges from a ""larger pool of well-qualified candidates.""

The change in policy marks a shift from the current expectation that immigration judges have a decade of experience behind them before taking to the bench.

What People Are Saying

Charles Kuck, founding partner at Kuck Baxter immigration law firm in Atlanta, told Newsweek: ""Just what the Immigration Court needs—more lawyers with no experience in a wildly complicated field with defendants' lives on the line on each decision. This is not a joke. It's a travesty.

""Without a doubt, the immigration court system is broken. But this is not the way to fix it. Politicizing judges is the worst possible outcome for the immigrants in deportation proceedings.""

Lisa Koop, national director of legal services at the National Immigrant Justice Center, told Newsweek: ""While immigration court backlogs and dysfunction are not unique to this administration, the immigration judge 'shortage' is a problem of the Trump administration's own making, a result of the firing of dozens of qualified judges since January.

""Asking military attorneys with limited or no immigration experience to decipher the U.S. immigration code and administer justice is misguided; it is clearly intended to lead to speedy deportations in lieu of due process and just outcomes. In reality, this move will lead to years of tangled litigation and mishandled immigration cases. The victims will be immigrants seeking their fair day in court who are being set up to always lose, regardless of their clear eligibility for protections created by Congress and recognized by every single administration except this one.""

Sean Parnell, in his statement to Newsweek: ""The Department remains committed to continuing our support for our interagency partners, bringing the skill and dedication of America's service members and civil servants to deliver justice, restore order, and protect the American people. Beyond this, we don't have any additional details to provide at this time.""

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, on X: ""The Trump admin plans to double the number of immigration judges, ordering hundreds of military lawyers to serve as immigration judges, despite flimsy legal authority to do so. Notably, immigration law is infamously complex, and judges normally require months of training.""

What Happens Next

A White House official told the AP that the administration is working on a variety of options to tackle the backlog of immigration cases.

This is exactly the argument that Trump and the GOP are using to deny due process to migrants being deported in the US.

Sooknanan’s order applies to all roughly 2,000 Guatemalan unaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.","WASHINGTON — A pair of federal court rulings over the Labor Day weekend invalidated aggressive actions the Trump administration had taken on immigration enforcement.

Judge Sparkle Sooknanan ordered an unknown number of planes carrying unaccompanied Guatemalan children temporarily halted on Sunday, two days after Judge Jia Cobb struck down a policy used to bypass judicial review in quick removals of migrants far from the southern border. Both judges are of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

The rulings are part of an ongoing clash between President Donald Trump and the federal judiciary over the administration’s immigration crackdown. Judges have raised concerns that immigrants’ due process rights are being violated.

On Sunday, Sooknanan voiced concern for unaccompanied children’s due process rights, and temporarily halted planes carrying the minors from taking off.

The administration had planned to deport 10 children to their home country of Guatemala.

The case resembled one earlier this year in which a judge ordered planes carrying Venezuelan men removed under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 grounded. Despite the order, multiple planes landed in El Salvador where more than 200 Venezuelans were sent to a notorious mega-prison.

The 10 children, nationals of Guatemala, on the planes ranged in age from 10 to 17 and crossed the southern border alone. Attorneys in court filings stressed that the children had immigration cases pending before a judge and that the children expressed fear of returning to Guatemala.

‘Everyone would be at risk’

The order followed Cobb’s order Friday granting a request from immigration rights groups to halt the implementation of a new policy that expanded expedited removal.

The administration has expanded the use of expedited removal, which allows for the quick removal of migrants, as a pillar of its aim to carry out mass deportations of people without permanent legal status.

For decades, administrations have applied expedited removal to immigrants apprehended at the southern border who cannot prove they have been in the United States for more than two years. If they cannot produce that proof, they are subject to a fast-track deportation without appearing before an immigration judge.

The Trump administration in January expanded expedited removal to apply nationwide, rather than only within 100 miles of the southern border.

In Cobb’s Friday opinion, she wrote that the administration likely violated the rights of immigrants and approached a universal violation of the constitutional right to due process. Former President Joe Biden appointed Cobb in 2021.

“In defending this skimpy process, the Government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment, but instead must accept whatever grace Congress affords them,” she wrote. “Were that right, not only noncitizens, but everyone would be at risk.”

Flights of Guatemalan minors grounded

In a flurry of action Sunday, Sooknanan temporarily halted the deportation of the children for 14 days while the case continues after an emergency request from the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.

Attorneys from NILC argued that if the children were returned, they could face violence and the administration's move to deport them violated immigration procedures for unaccompanied minors.

“Defendants are imminently planning to illegally transfer Plaintiffs to Immigration and Customs Enforcement … custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or even torture, against their best interests,” the attorneys wrote in their emergency filing.

The 10 children on the planes were taken off and put back into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, according to a status update filed Monday by NILC lawyers.

The Trump administration has identified up to 600 Guatemalan children to be removed under a pilot program created through an agreement with Guatemala, according to the court filings.

Sooknanan’s order applies to all roughly 2,000 Guatemalan unaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Biden also appointed Sooknanan.

Carlos Ramíro Martínez, Guatemala’s minister of foreign affairs, told the New York Times in an interview that the initiative began when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala in July. He added there is an agreement for Guatemala to accept more than 600 children.

DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

The State Department’s 2024 report on Guatemala details human rights concerns such as violence, and advises against traveling to the country.

The case involving the unaccompanied children was reassigned to judge Timothy James Kelly, whom Trump appointed in 2017.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-09/prettyman.jpg?h=9ce42887&itok=cjwvBeJ6,N,,2025-09-02 17:57:27.950892

The move comes after the Justice Department last week made changes to who could qualify as a temporary immigration judge – effectively lowering the requirements and removing the need to have prior immigration experience.

Immigration judges are the only ones who can revoke someone's green card or issue a final order of removal for people who have been in the country for more than two years and are in the process of being deported.

The military lawyers will receive some two weeks of training to serve as temporary immigration judges, according to the U.S. official.

As part of its aggressive immigration policy, the Trump administration has moved fast to increase the rate of arrests of undocumented immigration, and scale up detention space and deportations. But the rapid pace of arrests has contributed to the millions of cases backlogged at the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which houses immigration courts.

At the same time, in the last nine months, EOIR has lost over 100 judges to firings and voluntary resignations, down from about 700 judges at the start of the year.

The Homeland Security Department, which oversees immigration law enforcement, has launched a nationwide recruitment campaign for deportation officers, investigators and attorneys, spurred by an influx of more funds from Congress.

The funding and additional personnel are aimed at alleviating the growing case backlog, which is nearly 4 million cases. Hiring and training permanent judges can take more than a year.

LOS ANGELES — Mayor Karen Bass today issued the following statement in response to a federal court ruling finding that the Trump Administration’s deployment of National Guard members and Marines in Los Angeles was illegal.

“Today, the federal court ruled in favor of the people of Los Angeles,” said Mayor Karen Bass. “The White House tried to invade the second largest city in the country. That was illegal. Los Angeles will not buckle and we will not break. We will not be divided and we will not be defeated.""

Though the Trump Administration is likely to appeal, the ruling clearly states that the administration broke federal law: “Congress spoke clearly in 1878 when it passed the Posse Comitatus Act, prohibiting the use of the U.S. military to execute domestic law. Nearly 140 years later, Defendants—President Trump, Secretary of Defense Hegseth, and the Department of Defense—deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, ostensibly to quell a rebellion and ensure that federal immigration law was enforced. There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence. Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law. Nevertheless, at Defendants’ orders and contrary to Congress’s explicit instruction, federal troops executed the laws… In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act.”

Read the full ruling here.

Mayor Bass has been fighting to defend L.A. families since the Trump Administration first began its reckless immigration raids and federalized the National Guard in Los Angeles this summer. In July, she announced that the City joined a lawsuit to put a stop to the unconstitutional raids. Federal judges have ruled that it is unlawful to racially profile and target specific workplaces.

A “national police force”

In early June, Trump ordered the California National Guard to respond to immigration-related protests in Los Angeles, first with a force of nearly 5,000 troops, a number larger than the total deployed to Afghanistan in the first three months after Sept. 11, 2001.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) quickly sued over the deployment, and the resulting case of Newsom v. Trump has been determining what legal limits will exist, if any, over the use of the military on civilian streets in the United States.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta described the ruling as an affirmation that “President Trump is not King, and the power of the executive is not boundless.”

“For more than two months, the President has engaged in political theater, using National Guard troops and Marines as pawns to further his anti-immigrant agenda,” Bonta wrote in a statement. “In doing so, he trampled on one of the very basic foundations of our democracy: That our military be apolitical and the activities of troops on U.S. soil be extremely limited to ensure civil liberties and protect against military overreach.”

In the wake of the litigation, the Pentagon has withdrawn all but 300 troops, and this order does not force the remainder to leave. Instead, Judge Breyer’s narrow ruling orders the remainder to follow the nearly 150-year-old law.

“The injunction applies only to Defendants’ use of the National Guard in California, not nationally,” Breyer wrote. “Defendants are not required to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops currently stationed in Los Angeles, nor are they barred from using troops consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act.”

Despite the limited scope, Breyer acknowledged that Trump’s designs are far larger.

“President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country—including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California—thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” the ruling states.

The Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit tied Breyer’s hands from offering more sweeping relief. With limited exceptions, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. CASA all but abolished nationwide injunctions earlier this year. The Ninth Circuit found Trump likely had the power to issue his order to deploy the troops, subject to the constraints of the Posse Comitatus Act.

“All the way from the top”

During a three-day trial earlier this summer, Trump’s Justice Department floated a novel legal theory supposedly allowing the military to engage in crowd control, traffic control, riot control and security patrols on civilian streets: a so-called “constitutional exception” to the Posse Comitatus Act, which the judge rejected.

“In fact, these violations were part of a top-down, systemic effort by Defendants to use military troops to execute various sectors of federal law (the drug laws and the immigration laws at least) across hundreds of miles and over the course of several months—and counting,” the ruling said. “The instructions to train Task Force 51 on the purported constitutional exception and thereby excuse unlawful military conduct came ‘all the way from the top’ of the Department of Defense.”

Judge Breyer had been quoting the testimony of Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, the top commander of Task Force 51, behind the Los Angeles troop deployment.

Trial evidence showed that the task force knew that the Posse Comitatus Act prohibited these uses of the military, but the bullet points in red text were supposedly “constitutional exceptions” dictated from above the general.

“That instruction was incorrect,” Breyer wrote. “There is no exception to the Posse Comitatus Act for such conduct, and neither President Trump’s June 7 memorandum nor Secretary Hegseth’s June 23 memorandum changed that.”

The judge paused his ruling until Sept. 12 to make way for an inevitable appeal.

Although Trump routinely discusses using the military for civilian law enforcement, his Justice Department did not even claim the power to do so in court. Their legal defenses at trial involved denying Posse Comitatus Act violations and arguing that it could not be enforced through a civil injunction. If the ruling stands, it could serve as a blueprint for similar rulings across the country for other cities that Trump has placed in his crosshairs.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VxrT!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F172583175%2Fca5f680a-f6a0-4de8-a6b3-81a617b69ae5%2Ftranscoded-1756830728.png",N,,2025-09-02 18:57:02.636860

“It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”","McALLEN, Texas (AP) — President Donald Trump’s administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by The Associated Press.

Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration’s struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors — usually a parent or guardian — are properly vetted.

The memo is among several steps the Trump administration has taken involving children who came to the U.S. alone. Over the Labor Day weekend it attempted to remove Guatemalan children who were living in shelters or with foster care families.

The July 9 memo regarding sponsors said they must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says “federal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.”

Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a “built-in opportunity” to arrest parents — something she said has already happened.

WATCH: Court blocks deportation flights of unaccompanied minors to Guatemala

Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child under the age of 12 who had shown up for an identification check. “As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,” Miller Flowers said.

Desai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don’t already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates “clearly and proactively” with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won’t influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.

“The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,” it said in a statement.

However, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.

“We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,” she said.

Trump administration points to Biden

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under President Joe Biden’s administration.

A federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden’s administration struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.

Another recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.

The agency said it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don’t understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.

“If we don’t understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?” said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.

Jennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.

“It seems like it’s designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,” she said.

String of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process

The July changes are among the steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.

The administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home where children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.

About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.

Shaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.

“The agency’s mission has been conflated and entangled,” she added. “It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/2025-09-01T165108Z_1065688202_RC23JGADLTHU_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MIGRATION-GUATEMALA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 15:57:06.432554

The Department of Homeland Security received funding for permanent processing centers in 2022 and began building the first one in 2024 without complete cost information.

We recommended addressing these issues, and more.

What GAO Found

Between 2019 and 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)—a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)—experienced a significant increase in the number of individuals apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol along the southwest border. To address this issue, CBP used temporary soft-sided facilities—steel-framed tent-like structures—to provide additional capacity for processing and holding people in its custody.

Because they are temporary, the number of facilities can change due to trends in the number of people apprehended. In September 2024, CBP had seven soft-sided facilities with different capacities—from 983 to 2,500. In March 2025, CBP ceased operating these facilities due to a significant drop in apprehensions.

Aerial and Interior Views of Soft-Sided Facilities Used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection

CBP obligated over $4 billion total from 2019 through 2024 for soft-sided facilities and related services. But CBP engaged in limited acquisition planning to inform its investments in these facilities. For example, CBP did not take steps to accurately determine the number of contractor staff it needed to operate those facilities. As a result, some locations had either too few or too many staff. While CBP is not currently operating soft-sides facilities, it is likely to do so in the future if there are future surges in apprehensions, according to officials. Thus, CBP has an opportunity to identify and document lessons learned to better inform future investment decisions for these facilities.

In fiscal year 2022, Congress appropriated $330 million to DHS to develop and construct Joint Processing Centers. DHS plans to build and operate up to five of these facilities along the southwest border, which GAO estimates could cost roughly $7 billion. While DHS engaged in some initial planning to acquire Joint Processing Centers, officials did not complete key acquisition planning and oversight steps that leading practices suggest are key to inform large-dollar investments. For example, DHS began construction on the Laredo, Texas Joint Processing Center in October 2024 without reliable and complete operations and cost information. Further, it has not fully documented requirements and criteria for determining its Joint Processing Center locations. Documenting its process for identifying future Joint Processing Center locations and completing a life-cycle cost estimate would ensure that DHS is managing billions of dollars of mission critical services efficiently and effectively.

Why GAO Did This Study

CBP relied on contracts to operate and maintain soft-sided facilities (SSF). These facilities provide support and services when additional processing and holding capacity is needed for individuals apprehended along the southwest border. DHS also received funding to construct Joint Processing Centers (JPC)—permanent facilities that DHS expects will be more cost-effective than SSFs in the future.

GAO was asked to review CBP's and DHS's use and oversight of SSFs and JPCs. This report examines, among other things, (1) how CBP used contracts to support its SSF needs, and (2) the extent to which CBP and DHS engaged in planning efforts for SSF and JPC related acquisitions.

GAO analyzed contracting data on SSF contract obligations for fiscal years 2019-2024, and reviewed DHS budget plans, acquisition policies, and cost estimates for SSFs and JPCs. GAO also visited four selected SSF locations in Yuma and Tucson, AZ, El Paso, TX, and San Diego, CA based in part on apprehension and cost data; reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of eight of 69 contracts for SSFs and JPC construction contract documents; and interviewed DHS and CBP officials.",https://www.gao.gov/assets/extracts/e94ce2448bb9f2574dc201ee4e10de8b/rId17_image5.png,N,,2025-09-02 17:57:36.184169

The lawsuit follows the recent introduction of LRB 4042, a bill by Wisconsin State Representative Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee), which seeks to achieve similar protections through legislation. However, with Republicans controlling the state legislature, the bill has little chance of advancing.

“Wisconsinites deserve to know who is policing their communities,” said Kirk Bangstad, founder of the Minocqua Brewing Company. “When ICE agents hide their identities, it creates an environment ripe for abuse—both by ICE officers themselves and by impersonators who use the cover of anonymity to assault, rob, and terrorize women.”

For months, the Super PAC urged Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul to bring this lawsuit, providing both legal arguments and a draft of the complaint. After Kaul declined to act, the organization filed suit directly.

“This is the Attorney General’s job, not ours,” Bangstad continued. “But when elected officials refuse to protect Wisconsinites, we have no choice but to step in. ICE’s current practices violate the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution, and it’s time the courts hold them accountable.”

Bangstad warned that without oversight, ICE’s unchecked actions could extend beyond harassment of citizens and immigrants.

“If ICE agents are allowed to intimidate without accountability today, they’ll be doing the same to voters tomorrow,” Bangstad said. “We must act now to protect both our communities and our democracy.”

To be blunt, Trump’s interference with ongoing disaster recovery and relief efforts is dangerous.","The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown efforts have begun interfering directly with frontline responders of recent disasters – raising substantial fears about what could happen when more serious disasters strike.

On August 27, the Seattle Times reported that two firefighter crews deployed to fight the Bear Gulch fire on the Olympic Peninsula were held by Border Patrol agents, and two firefighters were eventually arrested after being accused of living in the country illegally. As the Times reported in what must be the most incredible understatement of the year, “It is unusual for federal border agents to make arrests during the fighting of an active fire, especially in a remote area.” The move is baffling, as it is pretty well known that nationwide, recruiting and retaining wildland firefighters has been an ongoing challenge. This issue, highlighted by the Government Accountability Office, stems from factors such as low wages, poor work/life balance, mental health challenges, and a lack of workforce diversity. The situation is so dire that California uses incarcerated labor. The recent arrests are likely to exacerbate the problem significantly. The administration is now prioritizing statistics, like the number of undocumented immigrants caught in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) sweeps, over the country’s ability to combat destructive fires. And doing that in the middle of an active fire is deadly for everyone involved.

The White House is taking other steps that clearly prioritizing immigration detention over disaster relief. The Washington Post reported on the same day of the ICE raid in Washington state that new Department of Homeland Security contracts for aid organizations responding to disasters require these organizations to act as agents of ICE. The latest Fiscal Year 2025 DHS Standard Terms and Conditions for grants, cooperative agreements, fixed-amount awards, and financial assistance now includes a “Communication and Cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration Officials” section. Within that section, recipients are required to share information, assist in immigration operations (including temporarily detaining people), provide access to information on disaster survivors, and maintain confidentiality around ICE operations. To be clear, this means that if an organization such as the Red Cross receives federal funding to set up a temporary shelter for evacuees, they are required to identify undocumented immigrants, detain them, and let ICE know.

There are so many logistical and ethical issues with this that it’s hard to know even where to start. Aid organizations are not equipped to meet these requirements, particularly for detaining someone. Their core mission revolves around saving lives, not enforcing immigration law. Aid organizations, many of which are faith-based, have expressed concerns that the requirements “violate First Amendment freedoms, undermine religious neutrality, and force institutions to betray core values.” Another problem is that these requirements will deter survivors from seeking aid or services from any organization that receives DHS funding. This can be a death sentence for survivors of a disaster.

These are just two examples out of many in which the administration’s decisions at FEMA are creating a scenario in which all the worst possible things can and will go wrong simultaneously. It is a fear that is not going unnoticed inside the government. Last week, 182 current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees addressed a letter to Trump’s FEMA Review Council and Congress stating recent decisions at the agency were putting the US at risk of another Hurricane Katrina-level disaster. Not surprisingly, the next day, about two dozen employees who had signed the letter were placed on leave. This reflects a pattern within the administration of replacing experienced and knowledgeable personnel who may disagree with policies with individuals who prioritize praising the president during meetings.

To be blunt, Trump’s interference with ongoing disaster recovery and relief efforts is dangerous. And as this pattern of politically motivated interference continues, the nation faces an escalating risk of failures in disaster response and an erosion of trust in the institutions that are supposed to keep people safe. With disasters increasing every year, lives are hanging in the balance. The US can’t afford political theater over doing what’s best for communities.",https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETH_Trump_Immagration_Policy.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 17:57:07.083331

The military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys — both military and civilians — to the Justice Department “as soon as practicable” and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week, according to the memo, dated Aug. 27.

The effort comes as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration across the country, ramping up arrests and deportations. Immigration courts also already are dealing with a massive backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has ballooned in recent years.

A White House official said Tuesday that the administration is looking at a variety of options to help resolve the significant backlog of immigration cases, including hiring additional immigration judges. The official said the matter should be “a priority that everyone — including those waiting for adjudication — can rally around.”

What Happens Next The White House is encouraging more departments to sign up for the 287(g) program.","The Department of Homeland Security launched a new program on Tuesday to reimburse state and local law enforcement agencies that assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in targeting the ""worst of the worst"" criminal unauthorized immigrants.

The payments, set to begin on October 1, 2025, will be made to local law enforcement officers and departments that participate in the 287(g) program, which enables them to assist in enforcing federal immigration law.

Why It Matters

The Trump administration has sought to expand its immigration enforcement operations through partnerships with local police and sheriff's departments, as well as state troopers, arguing that they are often best placed to seek out alleged illegal immigrants in their communities.

Critics have warned that the moves break down trust between the police and immigrant communities, while some within law enforcement have cautioned against turning officers away from investigating crimes in favor of doing what has often been seen as the federal government's job.

What To Know

Starting October 1, participating agencies will receive full coverage for the salary and benefits of trained 287(g) officers, including up to 25 percent in overtime. Law enforcement agencies will also be eligible for quarterly performance bonuses ranging from $500 to $1,000 per officer, based on effectiveness.

If an officer has a 90-100 percent success rate in locating alleged illegal immigrants, a department could receive $1,000. An 80-89 percent success rate would result in a $750 payment, while a 70-79 percent success rate would qualify for a $500 payment per officer.

What Is the 287(g) Program?

The 287(g) program enables state and local law enforcement agencies to collaborate with ICE to assist in identifying and detaining individuals suspected of being in the country illegally.

The expansion of 287(g) partnerships, funded by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, has surged 609 percent, jumping from 135 to nearly 960 agreements across 40 states. DHS and ICE officials urged more agencies to join the program, framing it as a national effort to enhance public safety.

The DHS said on Tuesday that over 8,501 officers have been trained under the program, with more than 2,000 currently in training to carry out immigration enforcement.

What Is the Immigration and Nationality Act?

The 287(g) program's name originates from the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that grants it authority.

The legislation has governed U.S. immigration policy for decades, first enacted in the 1950s and largely unchanged since. It covers how the federal government regulates immigration levels and grants what are known as immigration benefits, including visas, green cards, and citizenship.

Multiple attempts have been made by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress over the following decades to update policies, sometimes through amendments to the INA. Others have looked to pass more sweeping changes, which would effectively replace the act.

What People Are Saying

David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told Newsweek: ""This is an unprecedented use of ICE resources, but it comes from Congress's unprecedented appropriations for ICE in the recent budget reconciliation bill.

""In the past, ICE has compensated 287(g) counties for some costs related to detention, under a separate program, not compensation for the 287(g) officers' time or other costs.

""This policy incentivizes taking state and local police off the streets and protecting communities from violent crimes and victimization. It is a dangerous diversion of state and local resources.""

ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan, in a press release: ""ICE is not only supercharging our hiring, we are also multiplying partnerships with state and local law enforcement to remove the worst of the worst including murderers, gang members, rapists, terrorists, and pedophiles from our country. Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, ICE launched a new reimbursement program for state and local law enforcement who partner with DHS to make America safe again.""

What Happens Next

The White House is encouraging more departments to sign up for the 287(g) program.

Federal immigration officials are making arrests from within Tennessee jails at a much higher rate than other states. A new report ranks Tennessee second only to Texas in the number of people ICE picks up from jail.

The data suggests more ICE agents in the state are relying on local police to carry out President Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations.

The report, published by the Prison Policy Initiative, put Tennessee in the top five for ICE arrests per capita. That ranking is much higher for arrests that happen inside jails.

“What the data suggests is happening in Tennessee overall is that police are arresting people, either explicitly so that ICE can pick them up, or for other offenses … and then holding them until ICE comes and takes them away,” PPI spokesperson Wanda Bertram said.

Those kinds of arrests have been especially high in Knox County, where the number of people held for ICE jumped from 6 in January to nearly 50 in April.

Bertram said that non-citizens are more likely to face jail time for minor offenses, like driving without a license.

“There are a number of ways that immigrants can be sucked into the jail system for things that I’m sure the Trump administration would like to paint as serious crimes, but are actually very minor offenses,” Bertram said.

ICE did not respond to WPLN’s requests for comment, but in a visit to Nashville in July, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem promised more federal agents would be coming to Tennessee, and to Nashville specifically.

Pritzker confirmed federal immigration agents will be coming to Chicago soon, citing a phone call he received from the federal government.
In an exclusive interview with NBC Chicago, Pritzker said after weeks of hearing no communication from the Trump administration, his team received a phone call, but not from the president himself.
""We don't know if the National Guard is coming or not coming.
Pritzker noted that Trump could also call the National Guard from another state, where the governor might be more sympathetic to his cause.
I'm going to have to call in National Guard,'"" Pritzker said.","Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker confirmed federal immigration agents will be coming to Chicago soon, citing a phone call he received from the federal government.

In an exclusive interview with NBC Chicago, Pritzker said after weeks of hearing no communication from the Trump administration, his team received a phone call, but not from the president himself. The phone call, made to Illinois State Police, came from Gregory Bovino, the border patrol sector chief for the El Centro, Texas sector. Bovino oversaw the immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles earlier this summer.

""[They said] they will begin operations here sometime in the coming week,"" Pritzker told NBC Chicago's Mary Ann Ahern. ""That - literally after two weeks of all this talk about troops on the ground - that's the first time we've heard from the federal government on this.""

""Did they give you a number?"" Ahern asked.

""They did not,"" Pritzker said.

A report from The New York Times said Homeland Security officials requested to use Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago for their operations, which would include space for 250 department personnel plus a “Tactical Operations Center” and an “Incident Command Post,” as well as bathrooms, laundry, parking for 140 vehicles and storage space for medical supplies and weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas.

That appears to be separate from President Donald Trump's repeated threats to send in National Guard troops to help solve what he says is Chicago's crime problem. Questions remain about whether troops will come to Illinois, even to the state's leader.

""We don't know if the National Guard is coming or not coming. We know ICE is coming. And ICE has the responsibility to enforce immigration laws. They shouldn't do it the way they were doing it in Los Angeles. But they have that responsibility, and they should do it in the proper way, not the way Tom Homan is having them do it, or Kristi Noem,"" Pritzker said.

Trump made comments about Chicago on his social media platform Truth Social twice Tuesday morning. First, he cited the high crime numbers in the city over Labor Day weekend, writing: ""Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far. Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn’t know it yet. I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, and soon.""

The president then wrote, ""CHICAGO IS THE MURDER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD!""

Pritzker rebuked the president's claims.

""Donald Trump obviously has Chicago on his mind seemingly every day now. And they are clearly going to send ICE officials and officers to the neighborhoods,"" Pritzker said. ""I hope that they if they come here, that they will not act as they did in Los Angeles, which is provocative. But unfortunately, the guy who is leading that effort here in Chicago is the same one that led the effort in Los Angeles. So, I'm not optimistic.""

Pritzker was hoping to travel to Japan for a trade mission at the end of the week, but with the threat of ICE agents and potentially the National Guard coming to Chicago, he said he may have to postpone the trip.

""You've been already told that?"" Ahern asked.

""Yes,"" Pritzker confirmed.

Pritzker said crime has gone down in Chicago, and if the president wants to bring them down further, he can stop defunding crime prevention, and also help the state hire more FBI and ATF agents.

""Can the National Guard in Illinois be called when you haven't called them?"" Ahern asked Pritzker.

""They can be. They can be federalized, but the purposes only can be, according to the law, for them to be sent overseas to protect us, which our National Guard does all the time, or if there's an emergency. Truly an emergency on the ground, an insurrection on the ground,"" he said.

Pritzker noted that Trump could also call the National Guard from another state, where the governor might be more sympathetic to his cause. However, Pritzker said, that would also be illegal, and the court system seems to be in agreement with Pritzker's assessment. On Tuesday morning, a federal judge said Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles was illegal.

Posse Comitatus is an act that was passed in the 1878 that, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, bars federal troops from participating in civilian law enforcement except when expressly authorized by law.

""The president is ignoring that law, and then he's making up reasons why it's OK that he could send troops. So, I'm very deeply concerned that he's going to have ICE come here and cause the same mayhem that they caused in Los Angeles so that he can say, 'Oh, look, there's mayhem on the ground. I'm going to have to call in National Guard,'"" Pritzker said.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-11.42.38 AM.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-09-02 14:58:02.407630

In addition, HHS said that children in custody of ORR have access to legal counsel and that while in ORR, children can reach out to their attorney of record at any time.","(NewsNation) — The Office of Refugee Resettlement has changed its policy on how sponsors or family members for children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unaccompanied by an adult guardian or parent verify their identification, which some groups fear places them at risk with federal immigration enforcement officers and agents.

Until recently, family members and sponsors were permitted to provide identification electronically. But under the policy change, those adults must now show up in person for interviews, where they could be interviewed by immigration enforcement officers, The Associated Press reported.

An ORR spokesperson told NewsNation on Tuesday that agency staff members require that sponsors provide a valid ID in person at the time of a child being released into their custody.

The office, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, is responsible for taking custody of children who enter the United States without a parent or guardian. NewsNation previously reported that more than 13,000 migrant children who arrived at the southern border without supervision have been located, an HHS spokesperson confirmed.

Under the Biden administration, 320,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General has previously said. In March, a report issued by the office said that ICE has been unable to effectively monitor more than 600,000 unaccompanied children who crossed the southern border since 2019.

While the Office of Refugee Resettlement is not a law enforcement or immigration enforcement agency, it is directed by the Homeland Security Act of 2022 to provide care for these children and placement with a fully vetted family member or sponsor.

The HHS spokesperson said that as part of the communication process between the office and sponsors, sponsors are “clearly and proactively” informed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations or other law enforcement may be present at the time that the identification verification takes place.

The policy does not require sponsors to participate in HSI interviews as a condition of release for the child. The spokesperson said that this dismisses the notion that declining to be interviewed has a bearing on whether that person can sponsor a child. The agency defers to DHS on any immigration enforcement actions that take place during those interviews.

“The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the purported sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,” the ORR spokesperson said in a statement provided to NewsNation.

A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a NewsNation request for comment on Tuesday.

In addition, HHS said that children in custody of ORR have access to legal counsel and that while in ORR, children can reach out to their attorney of record at any time.

However, these allowances for children in ORR custody do not calm the fears of immigration rights groups, which believe that the family members or sponsors could be walking into a “built-in opportunity” to be arrested by federal immigration enforcement, Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, told the AP.

“We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,” she said.

As of last October, more than 43,000 unaccompanied children who were served with court orders did not show up for scheduled court dates. In addition, 31,000 of those who were released to sponsors had release forms that did not include addresses, had missing apartment numbers or were undeliverable, the inspector general’s office said in its report.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/unaccompanied_minors_border_immigration_03132021_AP22011017341029.png?w=1280,N,,2025-09-02 14:57:47.961247

Trump federalized members of the California National Guard and sent them to the second-largest U.S. city over the objections of Democratic Gov.
All were pulled back by the end of July except about 250 National Guard troops.
Breyer also noted the Trump administration’s possible plans to call National Guard troops into other U.S. cities.","President Donald Trump‘s administration violated federal law by sending National Guard troops to Southern California during immigration enforcement operations and accompanying protests, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco did not require the several hundred remaining troops to be withdrawn and set his order to go into effect Sept. 12.

The order comes after California sued, saying the troops sent to Los Angeles over the summer were violating a law that prohibits military enforcement of domestic laws. Lawyers for Trump’s Republican administration have argued the Posse Comitatus Act doesn’t apply because the troops were protecting federal officers, not enforcing laws. They say the troops were mobilized under an authority that allows the president to deploy them.

The judge’s decision comes as Trump has discussed National Guard deployments in Democratic-led cities like Chicago, Baltimore and New York. He has already deployed the guard as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover in Washington, where he has direct legal control.

Trump federalized members of the California National Guard and sent them to the second-largest U.S. city over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and city leaders. Trump did so under a law that allows the president to call the guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.”

Trump has pushed the bounds of typical military activity on domestic soil, including through the creation of militarized zones along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Newsom posted on X, in an all-caps reflection of the president’s own social media style, “DONALD TRUMP LOSES AGAIN. The courts agree — his militarization of our streets and use of the military against US citizens is ILLEGAL.”

The White House and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Breyer’s scathing ruling accused the Trump administration of “willfully” violating the law, saying it used troops for functions that were barred by their own training materials, refused to “meaningfully coordinate with state and local officials” and “‘coached'” federal law enforcement agencies on the language to use when requesting assistance.

“These actions demonstrate that Defendants knew that they were ordering troops to execute domestic law beyond their usual authority,” he wrote. “The evidence at trial established that Defendants systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles.”

Roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines were deployed to Los Angeles in early June to deal with protests, over the objections of state and local officials. All were pulled back by the end of July except about 250 National Guard troops. The judge noted that the remaining troops got improper training on what they can and cannot do under the law.

Breyer also noted the Trump administration’s possible plans to call National Guard troops into other U.S. cities.

In Los Angeles, National Guard members joined an operation at MacArthur Park in downtown Los Angeles intended as a show of force against people in the U.S. illegally and those protesting the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. They also accompanied federal immigration officers on raids at two state-licensed marijuana nurseries in Ventura County, Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman testified.

Sherman, who initially commanded the troops deployed to Los Angeles, testified during the second day of the trial that he raised concerns the deployment could violate the Posse Comitatus Act.

He said soldiers were trained on the law and given materials that included a list of activities prohibited by the act, including doing security patrols and conducting traffic control, crowd control and riot control.

Sherman said that while the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits troops from carrying out those actions, he was told by his superiors that there was a “constitutional exception” that permitted such activities when the troops are protecting federal property or personnel.",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Newsom-Trump.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1,N,,2025-09-02 15:57:10.642325

The report also blames U.S. financial reductions for drying up humanitarian aid. As a result, NGOs and U.N. agencies that were filling protection gaps in places like the Darién Gap and along return routes had to shut down or scale back operations.

Additionally, tougher transit restrictions in Panama mean the traditional pipeline toward the U.S. is nearly shut.

That flow slowed somewhat in 2024 but dried up almost completely early this year as President Trump fulfilled his campaign promise of shutting the border.

Southwest border apprehensions hit a monthly record low in July, with only 4,399 apprehensions, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. For the third month in a row, there were zero releases. This is the new all-time record low, beating the prior record low of 6,070 in June.

Biden repeatedly had single days when apprehensions ranged from 8,000 to 10,000 migrants, with his highest single month being December 2023, when 249,785 Border Patrol apprehensions were recorded.

The migrants who had hoped to reach the U.S. now find themselves in a difficult situation and some face violence, abuse and exploitation, the report states.

Roughly 50% of those interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia said they intended to go back to Venezuela, with around a quarter of those interviewed planning to go to neighboring Colombia, previously the epicenter of the mass migration from Venezuela. Others said they didn’t know where they were going.

Some migrants will continue moving south within Latin America, but the report warns they face unsafe boat journeys, dependence on smugglers and criminal groups that prey on returnees. Others remain stranded in places like Palenque, Miramar, Necoclí, Bahía Solano and Medellín, sleeping in parks or abandoned buildings without access to food, shelter or medical care.

Humanitarian monitors said many are turning to survival strategies such as informal work, begging or even transactional sex.

""We don’t know whether to stay in Colombia or go to Chile. I worry a lot about my children; they’re tired of moving so much,"" one migrant said.

""Imagine, I’m back in the same place I left many years ago chasing a dream,"" another said. ""Now I don’t know what to do.""

Scott Campbell, the U.N. human rights representative in Colombia, said the returnees are among the most vulnerable people on the continent and urged governments not to abandon the migrants.

""Most of these people are already victims of human rights abuses,"" Campbell said. ""We urge authorities to aid people in this reverse migration to prevent them from being exploited or falling into trafficking networks run by illegal armed groups.""",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/migrants-turn-back.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 13:56:44.002702

Sharereh Moghadam was taken into custody after attending an in-person immigration meeting, which she thought was a step closer to citizenship, according to Aghdassi. Instead, she was transferred to a detention center in Phoenix.

“She had green card and passed exam for citizenship and was waiting for the ceremony,” said Aghdassi. “She is not a bank robber or thief or criminal.”

Aghdassi says Sharareh was born in Iran and entered the country legally with her documents in order. He believes a recent trip to Iran is the reason behind her detention.

ICE has since rejected Aghdassi’s claims that Moghaddam had no criminal history.

“Reports that Sharareh Moghaddam has no criminal history are completely FALSE and are only being used to try garner support for a thief. Sharareh Moghaddam is neither a citizen nor a national of the United States. She is an Iranian native and citizen with a documented criminal history dating back to 2015. Moghaddam entered the United States at an unknown time and location in 2014 and obtained lawful status in 2016. Despite being granted the opportunity to remain in the country, between August 2015 and May 9, 2019, Moghaddam was convicted of two separate theft offenses, demonstrating a clear disregard for U.S. laws and rendering her subject to removal under U.S. immigration law,” wrote an ICE spokesperson in a statement to NBC4.

The Iranian couple runs a balloon shop along Laurel Canyon, which has gained the community’s support over the last few weeks. Customers have begun signing a petition requesting that lawmakers step in before Moghadam’s next hearing.

In the meantime, Aghdassi says he is clinging to hope that one day he will be reunited with his wife.

“Years ago, for us, the dream was the U.S. is a land of opportunity and freedom, and it was, but right now you can see everything changed. You don’t feel secure anymore,” said Aghdassi.

The recent immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California are part of President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to carry out a mass deportation plan.

Through Aug. 31, nearly 60,930 migrants had been taken into ICE detention since the start of Trump’s second term, according to NBC News, which used ICE data both public and internal as well as data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. About 29% of those in detention had criminal convictions; 25.6% had pending criminal charges; 45% were listed as “other immigration violator;” and 11.6% were fast-tracked for deportation.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250902-Sharereh-Moghadam-Hooshang-Aghdassi-se-1158a-5db1c4.jpg",N,,2025-09-02 13:56:47.987775

Internal emails obtained by Prism show that the faculty union began pressing the administration in June for guidance on how faculty should respond if ICE enters classrooms in the coming school year.
The climate of uncertainty, Cepero López noted, is compounded by Florida’s broader restrictions on curriculum and diversity initiatives.
As Miami’s public research university, FIU has long recruited students and faculty from across Latin America and the Caribbean.
For FIU faculty, it’s a breach of the university’s own stated mission of openness and inclusion, and highlights the stakes of the university’s entanglement in immigration enforcement.","Florida International University (FIU) is under fire from one of its own faculty members after news reports detailed that the school provided equipment to the Everglades immigration detention facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” The disclosure intensified existing anger over FIU’s police partnership with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and ongoing labor disputes, fueling demands for transparency, higher pay, and accountability from administrators.

After Prism and NBC6 reported that FIU supplied an emergency operations trailer to the construction site at “Alligator Alcatraz,” university President Jeanette Nuñez confirmed in a recent NBC6 interview that the university did so at the state’s request, clarifying that the equipment is owned by the state’s Department of Emergency Management, the lead agency overseeing construction and operations of the facility.

“It is a state asset, let’s be clear,” Nuñez told anchor Jackie Nespral. “When the Department of Emergency Management requests a state asset, we have to provide it. We don’t opine, we don’t object. People want to make more out of it than what it was.”

The president was not asked about the implications for the workers who had to carry out the task. Those workers expressed concern when given the order, according to an FIU staff member who previously spoke to Prism on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. FIU has not responded to Prism’s request for comment.

Faculty leaders say Nuñez’s explanation does little to ease concerns that the university—long touted as a haven for immigrant students—is complicit in immigration enforcement.

“FIUPD is ICE,” said Tania Cepero López, the president of the United Faculty of Florida (UFF-FIU) union, referring to the FIU Police Department. “The faculty are amazing, the students are wonderful, smart, and dedicated, and they deserve the best education in the world.”

FIU and ICE relationship deepens fears on campus

The equipment controversy comes on top of outrage over FIU’s finalized 287(g) agreement, which deputizes campus police as ICE agents. Nuñez defended the decision in the NBC6 interview, arguing that the agreement gives FIU more control.

“If ICE wants to come on campus, regardless of the agreement, they will come,” she said. “So they do have access to come into our campus. The police chief took the position, and I supported him, that he wanted to be in control [of] the situation from the get-go.”

Faculty remain unconvinced. Internal emails obtained by Prism show that the faculty union began pressing the administration in June for guidance on how faculty should respond if ICE enters classrooms in the coming school year. Only on Aug. 22 did the university provide a formal response: ICE can access public areas and enter classrooms with a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances, and faculty should not obstruct ICE and notify FIUPD. The memo confirmed that FIUPD officers will inform faculty when acting as ICE agents, but stated that the university has “no plans to provide notifications” of ICE operations.

“The main priority right now is compliance, so that there’s no retaliation, so that we don’t lose funding, so that we don’t lose any more grants, so that we don’t lose courses in the curriculum,” Cepero López said of her impression of FIU administration’s motives. “There’s a lot of interference and a lot of oversight happening that, to me, is unprecedented.”

Cepero López added that the partnership with ICE is chilling both teaching and learning on campus. Faculty members, she said, are increasingly worried that under the new agreement, their syllabi, reading lists, and classroom discussions could become targets of political or police scrutiny.

The sense of fear is especially acute among international and undocumented students, according to Cepero López, many of whom have asked whether their classroom attendance could put them at risk if ICE officers entered a lecture hall or classroom. She said professors have reported receiving anxious questions from students regarding protocol around ICE and FIU police. Teachers themselves have been asking what they should do if an agent arrives during class and whether to continue teaching, ask for a warrant, or protect their students. Some students even fear returning to campus due to their immigration status, Cepero López said? .

The climate of uncertainty, Cepero López noted, is compounded by Florida’s broader restrictions on curriculum and diversity initiatives.

“Faculty are wondering, what’s the next thing that we’re going to be forced to do? What’s the next compliance item that we’re going to be forced to spend two hours working on instead of working on our research, instead of working on our lesson plans, instead of working on replying to student emails?” she said. “The morale is as low as I’ve ever seen it.”

Faculty say FIU’s collaboration with ICE undermines the very values that have defined the institution since its founding: diversity, inclusion, and international engagement. As Miami’s public research university, FIU has long recruited students and faculty from across Latin America and the Caribbean. Now, professors warn that that reputation is at risk.

Town hall invitation denied

In an attempt to provide a space for administration to answer the community’s concerns, on Aug. 18, UFF-FIU formally invited FIU’s top leadership, including Núñez, Police Chief Alexander Casas, Provost Elizabeth Béjar, Board of Trustees Chair Carlos Duart, and General Counsel Ryan Kelley, to attend a community town hall. The union asked them to choose from three dates in September to discuss the ICE agreement, Duart’s business contracts tied to the detention camp, and FIU’s provision of state-owned assets.

“Our faculty, students, and community deserve a clear explanation of these institutional actions that affect our learning spaces and safety,” the union wrote in a letter.

Four days later, the administration declined. In a letter sent by Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs Barbara Manzano, the chief negotiator in ongoing contract negotiations between the university and the union, FIU leaders said attendance was “unnecessary.” Instead, they pointed to prior appearances at a Faculty Senate meeting in April, a town hall in May, and Núñez’s TV interviews.

“Please feel free to use this response at the forum, in lieu of our attendance,” Manzano wrote.

Faculty say the event, scheduled for Sept. 9, will proceed without FIU leadership.

“I told them we’re going to do the town hall with or without you,” Cepero López said.

Bargaining battle adds to tensions

The disputes over ICE and FIU’s relationship are unfolding alongside contentious contract negotiations. Some faculty members say that FIU has refused to honor raises previously negotiated in a three-year contract, citing legislative funding shortfalls. Instead, administrators have offered one-time bonuses tied to performance evaluations, a substitute that faculty call both inadequate and demoralizing.

“We’re at that point where we are tired of being asked to do more with less, and we’re just not going to continue to do that anymore,” Cepero López said. “Good working conditions for faculty equal good working conditions for students equal good learning conditions for students.”

The rejected raises would have provided a 2% increase across the board and an additional 1.5% merit raise. The raises wouldn’t have kept pace with inflation and Miami’s skyrocketing housing market, Cepero López said, but they were still seen as a baseline commitment.

“FIU has a strong tradition of faculty and administration collaborating, and that’s what made FIU rise so quickly,” Cepero López said. “And for so long, we’ve done a lot with a lot less than other universities.”

Instead, FIU proposed bonuses as low as $1,500 for faculty whose performance reviews were “satisfactory” and $3,000 for those rated “outstanding.” Unlike raises, bonuses do not contribute to base pay, meaning that salaries remain stagnant year to year.

During the most recent bargaining session on Aug. 29, the administration presented a new counteroffer: a recurring raise of 1% to base salary or $1,000 (whichever is greater) for nine-month faculty, with the equivalent applied to 12-month faculty, alongside a tiered one-time merit bonus of $1,000 to $2,000 based on performance evaluations. To fund the recurring increase, FIU said it shifted $2.2 million in expenses for postdoctoral hires from recurring to nonrecurring dollars.

Faculty union leaders acknowledged the adjustment but noted that FIU remains the only preeminent public university in Florida that initially offered no recurring salary increase this year. Other universities, including the University of West Florida, which offered 4% merit-based raises for the second year in a row, have made more competitive offers. The union will reconvene with administrators in the coming week ahead of a ratification vote on Sept. 16 and 17.

The issue cuts to the heart of recruitment and retention. Faculty warn that without competitive salaries, FIU risks losing talent to other universities including those outside the state. Several faculty members noted that the administration has simultaneously expanded spending on compliance measures and visiting instructors? to cover ballooning freshman classes, while telling full-time faculty that there isn’t enough recurring money to honor their contracts.

Litigation looms over “Alligator Alcatraz”

While FIU faces growing unrest on campus, the detention center itself is under legal fire. On Aug. 21, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams issued a preliminary injunction halting construction, barring the admission of new detainees, and requiring operations to wind down within 60 days.

The lawsuit, brought by Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, argues that the facility violated the National Environmental Policy Act by proceeding without an environmental impact study. Litigation will continue even as the camp closes.

“This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, said in a press release. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government—and there are consequences for ignoring them.”

For the Miccosukee, whose homes and sacred grounds sit nearby, it was also a violation of sovereignty.

“Justice for us is people’s sovereign rights being respected on all levels,” said William “Popeye” Osceola, the secretary of the Miccosukee Tribe. “It reminds us that as much as the system is geared against us, there are still mechanisms we can engage with to fight for what we know is right, including our rights to this land. But it’s also a sovereignty issue.”

Osceola said the state and federal governments circumvented processes that the tribe has worked decades, if not centuries, to help establish. Those processes, he said, don’t just protect and benefit the tribe, but also other fellow citizens, including all Floridians, South Floridians, and any Americans visiting Big Cypress or the Everglades.

“Those who want this to happen are betting on people getting complaisant,” he said. “It’s no time to be complaisant.”

The university’s handling of these controversies mirrors a broader pattern critics say has defined the detention camp itself: decisions imposed from above without meaningful input from those most affected. For Miccosukee tribal members, who were excluded from consultation as construction encroached on their ancestral lands, that exclusion was a violation of sovereignty. For FIU faculty, it’s a breach of the university’s own stated mission of openness and inclusion, and highlights the stakes of the university’s entanglement in immigration enforcement.

“I don’t understand why they can’t communicate to us why this is happening and we have to hear from Jackie Nespral interviewing our president,” Cepero López said. “That’s not what accountability looks like.”

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the military from performing civilian law enforcement duties. In a 52-page opinion, he also ruled that the administration exceeded the limits of presidential authority under the Constitution by federalizing the California National Guard without proper justification.

California had argued that the deployment undermined state sovereignty and breached the 10th Amendment, which reserves certain powers to the states. Breyer agreed, noting that local agencies such as the Los Angeles Police Department and the Sheriff’s Department maintained order during the demonstrations, despite incidents of violence and property damage. He concluded there was no evidence of a “rebellion” that would allow the president to invoke emergency powers.

According to evidence presented in court, guard members and Marines supported federal immigration raids by creating perimeters, directing traffic, and securing sites. They were also present during operations at marijuana farms and accompanied federal agents during enforcement actions across Southern California. Breyer wrote that these activities were indistinguishable from policing and went beyond the protection of federal property.

The ruling grants California’s request for an injunction, preventing the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Defense from directing guard members in the state to carry out arrests, searches, or riot control unless Congress provides a valid exception.

Associated Press

WASHINGTON — Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday said that the Trump administration will soon expand immigration operations in Chicago, confirming plans for a stepped up presence of federal agents in the nation’s third-largest city.

Noem’s comments come after the DHS last week requested limited logistical support from officials at the Naval Station Great Lakes to support the agency’s anticipated operations. The military installation is about 35 miles north of Chicago.

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago... but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem said during an appearance CBS News’ ”Face the Nation.”

Noem declined to provide further details about the planned surge of federal officers. It comes after the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Trump spoke out against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a social media posting Saturday, warning him that he must straighten out Chicago’s crime problems quickly “or we’re coming.” The Republican president has also been critical of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.

Johnson and Pritzker have pushed back against the expected federal mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.

Johnson has already signed an order barring the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal government immigration enforcement efforts.

Pritzker in an interview aired Sunday on “Face the Nation” charged that Trump’s expected plans to mobilize federal forces in the city may be part of a plan to “stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.”

Noem said it was a Trump “prerogative” whether to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as he did in Los Angeles in June in the midst of immigration protests in the California city.

The judge said that the Trump administration intentionally initiated the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to establish a military presence there and enforce federal law.
He called that conduct a ""serious violation"" of federal law prohibiting the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.","Washington — A federal court in California ruled Tuesday that the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed members of the National Guard and active-duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles earlier this summer in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations.

In a 52-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the president and his administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 1878 law that prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Breyer blocked the Trump administration from deploying or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops in the state, for civilian law enforcement.

His decision restricts the use of service members to engage in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures and traffic and crowd control. The injunction applies only to the Trump administration's use of the National Guard in California, not nationally, and it does not require the Defense Department to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops who remain in Los Angeles. Breyer noted that the administration is not prohibited from using troops consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, and wrote that they can continue to protect federal property in a manner allowed under the law.

The judge froze his injunction until noon on Sept. 12, likely to allow the Trump administration time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

Breyer's ruling came after he held a three-day trial in the case brought by California Gov. Gavin Newsom in June. Newsom, a Democrat, sued in response to Mr. Trump's decision to deploy members of California's National Guard to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement operations taking place in the area. The president invoked a law known as Title 10 to send the California National Guard to Los Angeles to protect federal property and personnel.

The judge granted temporary relief to California officials in June that required the Trump administration not to deploy the California National Guard in Los Angeles and return control to Newsom. But a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit found it likely that Mr. Trump lawfully federalized the California National Guard under a different law, Title 10.

Those earlier proceedings did not involve the Posse Comitatus Act. Breyer, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, held the trial on the merits of Newsom's arguments that the president violated that 147-year-old law last month.

The judge's ruling

The judge wrote in his ruling that the evidence put forth at the trial established that the Trump administration ""systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles. In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act,"" Breyer wrote.

While the Pentagon withdrew roughly the 700 U.S. Marines who had been sent to Los Angeles, Breyer noted that there are still 300 National Guard members stationed there nearly three months after they were first mobilized.

""Moreover, President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country — including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California — thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,"" Breyer wrote.

The judge said that the Trump administration intentionally initiated the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to establish a military presence there and enforce federal law. He called that conduct a ""serious violation"" of federal law prohibiting the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.

""In fact, these violations were part of a top-down, systemic effort by Defendants to use military troops to execute various sectors of federal law (the drug laws and the immigration laws at least) across hundreds of miles and over the course of several months — and counting,"" Breyer wrote.

Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the president's constitutional powers allow him to override the restrictions in the Posse Comitatus Act.

""Under this 'constitutional exception,' as Defendants call it, the President has inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions, so any actions that can be construed as such 'protection' are lawful in spite of the Posse Comitatus Act,"" he wrote. ""This assertion is not grounded in the history of the Act, Supreme Court jurisprudence on executive authority, or common sense.""

The judge said that Congress was clear about what constitutes an exception to the law, precluding the president from exercising all but his express authority under the Constitution. He also accused the Trump administration of attempting to usurp Congress' authority.

""That Defendants characterize this as an 'exception' to the statute is mere wordplay; it does not change the fact that they seek to override Congress's legitimate exercise of its own authority,"" Breyer wrote.

Attorneys for California had sought an injunction that blocked National Guard forces from participating in and protecting federal agents during immigration enforcement operations, and Breyer agreed to grant their request. The Trump administration had argued that Title 10 is an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act and therefore didn't apply to National Guard troops who were called into federal service.

The judge wrote that while there is ""no question that federal personnel should be able to perform their jobs without fearing for their safety,"" the Trump administration cannot ""use this as a hook to send military troops alongside federal agents wherever they go.""

Since the 9th Circuit allowed the Trump administration to keep the National Guard in California, the president has moved to deploy troops to Washington, D.C. Mr. Trump has also teased sending the National Guard to other major cities throughout the country in what he casts as a looming crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.

As of Monday, there are over 2,200 National Guard members in Washington, D.C., with over half of those troops sent by Republican governors throughout the country.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/14/bccca27d-6fe1-474d-a73c-eb4198b08568/thumbnail/1200x630/5ea0811ce4ad88c8da722d3a0777540a/ap25225816352215.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 12:56:59.567316

On behalf of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, I am writing to you regarding the 60th session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva.

The HRC plays an essential role in the prevention of mass atrocity crimes by responding to situations where populations are at risk of, or are experiencing, genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity or ethnic cleansing. During its 44th session in July 2020 the HRC adopted Resolution 44/14 on the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), recognizing the important contribution of the UN human rights system in addressing situations where there is a risk of atrocity crimes being committed. This is in line with the Council’s prevention mandate, enshrined in UN General Assembly Resolution 60/251, which stipulates that it shall “contribute, through dialogue and cooperation, towards the prevention of human rights violations and respond promptly to human rights emergencies.”

We strongly urge you, as a current member of the HRC, to uphold this shared commitment to prevent atrocity crimes. The Global Centre respectfully encourages you to consider the following recommendations as you engage in the 60th regular session:

Afghanistan

Since the Taliban de facto authorities assumed control of Afghanistan in August 2021, they have imposed deeply repressive policies, denying women, girls and LGBTQIA+ persons their fundamental rights. These measures constitute extreme gender-based discrimination and blatantly violate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). In August 2024 the Taliban codified over 100 edicts through so-called “vice and virtue” laws, aiming to eradicate women and girls from public life by mandating full face coverings, prohibiting them from speaking or being heard in public and severely restricting their freedom of movement, expression, employment, political participation and access to education and healthcare. Others are targeted for expressions of sexuality or gender identity deemed inconsistent with Taliban policy. These policies are intended to subject women and girls to total domination and amount to the crime against humanity of gender persecution.

In June 2025 the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan released a report detailing how the de facto authorities are dismantling and transforming the country’s judicial and legal architecture to create a justice system that not only enforces their repressive ideology but is also central to their system of gender-based discrimination and exclusion.

Former government officials, journalists, human rights defenders and minority communities continue to face widespread and systematic abuses, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and torture. Meanwhile, coordinated attacks on ethnic and religious groups by the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan likely amount to crimes against humanity. Amid immigration crackdowns in the United States, Pakistan and Iran, Afghan nationals, including refugees, migrants and those awaiting resettlement, face mounting risks of forced repatriation and shrinking options for protection under Taliban rule.

The Global Centre respectfully urges your delegation to utilize the upcoming Enhanced Interactive Dialogue on Afghanistan, currently scheduled for 8 September, to emphasize the urgent need for justice and accountability for likely atrocity crimes. We encourage member states to condemn ongoing CEDAW violations, reaffirm the responsibility of states to uphold its provisions and to support codifying gender apartheid as a crime against humanity.

Delegations should also stress the protection of women’s rights and that women human rights defenders and civil society must be meaningfully included in all political processes to help shape Afghanistan’s future. Any credible political settlement must be rooted in human rights, particularly the rights of women and girls.

Burundi

Burundi has endured a protracted political crisis since late President Pierre Nkurunziza’s announcement that he would seek a third presidential term in 2015. In its first report in 2017, the UN Commission of Inquiry (CoI) on Burundi concluded that potential crimes against humanity had been committed since April 2015, including extrajudicial killings and summary executions, disappearances, sexual violence, arbitrary detention and torture. The CoI continued to release annual reports in subsequent years, reiterating concerns about serious violations that may constitute crimes against humanity. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Burundi, as well as numerous civil society organizations, have further documented systematic human rights violations and abuses.

A decade since the crisis first escalated, no perpetrators have been held accountable, including within the ruling party Conseil national pour la défense de la démocratie-Forces de défense de la démocratie (CNDD-FDD) and its youth wing, the Imbonerakure. During the HRC’s 59th session in June 2025, Special Rapporteur Fortuné Gaetan Zongo warned that “impunity remains the norm [and is] a major obstacle to reconciliation, [and that] justice is being used against opponents, journalists and human rights defenders.”

Ongoing monitoring and reporting on Burundi’s protracted crisis are critical amid the ongoing electoral cycle, including presidential elections currently scheduled for 2027. The June 2025 legislative and communal elections were marred by widespread irregularities, with the ruling CNDD-FDD winning 96.5 percent of votes amid intimidation, harassment and threats by party officials and the Imbonerakure, while key opposition figures were barred from running. This follows similar patterns to previous voting cycles, during which repression dramatically intensified.

Following the May 2020 presidential election, the CoI released a detailed assessment using the UN Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes. It warned that all risk factors for crimes against humanity remain present in Burundi, including the CNDD-FDD’s system of governance, the appointment of sanctioned individuals to senior government positions, the continued operations of the Imbonerakure and the refusal to release all detained human rights defenders. Five years on, these risk factors remain in place and in recent months there has been a marked increase in hate speech and inflammatory rhetoric, including at the highest political level. A joint NGO letter released on 20 August warned that some of the risk factors outlined in the UN Framework of Analysis, “including Risk Factor 8 (“triggering factors or events that may seriously exacerbate existing conditions, such as elections and pivotal activities related to elections”), point to more, not fewer, concerns than one year ago, before the electoral cycle opened and the ruling party closed avenues for peaceful transition through competitive, free and fair elections.”

International scrutiny remains vital to prevent the recurrence of crimes against humanity in Burundi. The Global Centre therefore respectfully urges you to adopt a resolution to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and request the Special Rapporteur to present an oral update during the HRC’s 62nd session, as well as a comprehensive report to the HRC during its 63rd session and to the UN General Assembly during its 81st session.

Central African Republic

Civilians in the Central African Republic (CAR) continue to be at risk of atrocities due to ongoing instability by myriad armed groups and abuses by government and allied forces. The Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC), a loose alliance of predatory armed groups with a history of perpetrating atrocities, and its dissident factions have continued to perpetrate attacks. During counteroffensives, the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) and allied mercenaries have disproportionately targeted ethnic and religious minorities.

Inter-communal tensions have also heightened due to increased targeting along ethnic lines by armed groups, notably the Azande Ani Kpi Gbe (AAKG) in southeast CAR. A report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and peacekeeping mission (MINUSCA) documents likely war crimes, primarily targeting Muslim communities and Sudanese refugees in the southeast. The report utilizes the UN’s Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes, warning that there are significant risks of recurrence, including the tolerance of hate speech on ethnic and religious grounds, a lack of state presence, unclear chain of command and a prevailing climate of impunity. Recent fighting in the southeast between the AAKG, FACA and mercenaries has also resulted in serious human rights violations and abuses.

During the HRC’s 58th session, Valentine Rugwabiza, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of MINUSCA, stressed that CAR is at a “crossroads” and that extending state authority must be grounded in justice and respect for human rights. The local and presidential elections scheduled for December are critical to the consolidation of peace in CAR; however, authorities have cracked down on civic space. CAR has a history of election-related violence, including most recently during the elections in December 2020, when the CPC launched an offensive against the government. This period was marked by heightened grievances, the proliferation of hate speech and escalating violence targeting civilians.

The Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in CAR, who works closely with MINUSCA and the Special Criminal Court, is essential for supporting accountability and transitional justice mechanisms and providing critical capacity-building to strengthen institutions on human rights promotion and protection. The Global Centre respectfully encourages you to adopt a resolution to renew the mandate of the Independent Expert and support the inclusion of R2P language in the resolution by “recalling that the authorities of the Central African Republic have the primary responsibility to protect all populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.” We also encourage your delegation to request continued monitoring and reporting of human rights trends – using the Framework of Analysis – to alert the international community of appropriate prevention and protection strategies.

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea

In its landmark 2014 report, the HRC-mandated CoI on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) established responsibility at the highest level of government for ongoing crimes against humanity, as well as other continued systematic and widespread human rights violations, including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions, sexual violence, persecution, forcible transfer, enforced disappearance and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. The DPRK’s extensive forced labor system and ongoing human rights violations have enabled its support for Russia’s war in Ukraine. Notably, the DPRK has reportedly deployed 11,000 troops to bolster Russia’s military efforts.

On the 10th anniversary of the CoI report, the HRC adopted a resolution mandating the High Commissioner to submit a comprehensive update on the human rights situation in the DPRK since 2014 and to assess the implementation of the CoI’s recommendations. As the Council considers the forthcoming report, member states should use the Enhanced Interactive Dialogue with the High Commissioner to reaffirm their commitment to the protection of the North Korean people and the prevention of crimes against humanity. States should call for a holistic UN response that bridges human rights, humanitarian and security approaches. This must include measures to confront structural drivers of violations – such as the institutionalized use of forced labor and pervasive sexual and gender-based violence – while closing enforcement gaps and enhancing transparency in global supply chains, ensuring that exploitation is neither profitable nor tolerated.

States must also uphold the principle of non-refoulement, ensure access to asylum and provide comprehensive support for refugees and escapees. Approaches to accountability must be survivor-centered, recognizing that meaningful redress extends beyond legal prosecution. Victims and survivors should be actively included in shaping justice processes, policy decisions and any future political arrangements affecting the Korean Peninsula, so that their dignity, agency and well-being are placed at the core of international responses. Sustained attention to these priorities is essential to end ongoing atrocities, prevent future violations and affirm the rights of those who have endured decades of repression.

Democratic Republic of the Congo

Since early 2025 populations in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have faced a grave escalation in widespread abuses and likely atrocity crimes, as the March 23 Movement (M23) armed group, bolstered by the Rwandan Defense Forces, intensified its offensive in North and South Kivu. The group has seized the provincial capitals and consolidated control over key territories. Clashes between M23 and the Congolese armed forces (FARDC), supported by a coalition of militias known as the Wazalendo, have killed at least 7,000 people and displaced over one million people since January. Despite recent diplomatic efforts, including the signing of a peace agreement between the DRC and Rwanda and a declaration of principles signed by the DRC and M23 to end the fighting, insecurity remains high. Meanwhile, other armed groups continue to pose a grave threat to civilians in North Kivu and neighboring Ituri province. Sexual and gender-based violence, used as a weapon of war, has reached unprecedented levels.

At the root of the enduring instability lies rampant impunity for past abuses and a thriving conflict economy, largely driven by the illicit exploitation of mineral resources. As UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif has emphasized, any lasting resolution must address these underlying causes, particularly the illegal extraction of natural wealth.

In response to the deteriorating crisis, the HRC held a special session in February at the request of the DRC government, unanimously adopting a resolution that established a Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) and CoI. These mechanisms are mandated to investigate and report on serious human rights abuses and violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) committed in North and South Kivu provinces since January 2022. They are crucial for advancing justice by identifying those responsible and supporting victims’ and survivors’ rights to truth, justice and reparations.

Given the scale and urgency of the crisis, the Global Centre respectfully urges your delegation to participate in the upcoming Enhanced Interactive Dialogue on the DRC. The Global Centre also encourages you to raise awareness about atrocity risks in eastern DRC, highlight the central role of illicit mineral exploitation in fueling violence and support the FFM through sustained political and financial commitments. We further encourage you to support the renewal of the mandate of the International Team of Experts on the DRC for one year, requesting that the Team provide technical assistance to national authorities to combat impunity and regularly report on potential atrocity crimes, alerting the HRC with timely and targeted recommendations for necessary action.

Haiti

The human rights and protection situation in Haiti has become catastrophic amid rampant and expanding gang violence across Port-au-Prince and the Centre and Artibonite departments. Gangs affiliated with the Viv Ansanm coalition are perpetrating widespread abuses, including indiscriminate killings, torture, kidnappings, forced recruitment and the burning and looting of civilian infrastructure, in a climate of total impunity. These groups are also using systematic and widespread sexual violence against women and girls, including collective rape, sexual slavery and mutilation, as a means of exerting territorial control and to terrorize and punish communities. Vigilante and so-called self-defense groups – formed to protect communities, often with tacit police support – have also increasingly perpetrated abuses and indiscriminate violence. According to the UN, between 3 October 2024 and 30 June at least 4,864 people were killed, 1,597 injured and 775 kidnapped.

The Haitian National Police lack the capacity to combat gangs and protect communities. A newly formed task force has launched operations targeting gang strongholds, but the use of drone strikes involving explosive munitions has further endangered civilians. Despite the deployment of the UN-authorized Multidimensional Security Support (MSS) mission, security has deteriorated. The MSS continues to face financial and operational constraints, hindering its ability to challenge gang control. Meanwhile, the international community, particularly the UN Security Council, has failed to mobilize a decisive response, risking further isolation of Haiti and turmoil when robust international support is critically needed.

The Global Centre respectfully urges your delegation to utilize the upcoming Interactive Dialogue with the High Commissioner and his Designated Expert on Haiti to stress that overly securitized international approaches will not result in lasting stability and may exacerbate risk factors for violence. Moreover, we encourage your delegation to highlight the critical importance of human rights monitoring and reporting for informing the international community of appropriate prevention and protection strategies, particularly as violence spreads to areas with inadequate police presence. Lastly, we encourage your delegation to insist on the need to renew the mandate of the Designated Expert in full at the 62nd session in April.

Myanmar (Burma)

Since the military coup in February 2021 and the imposition of prolonged states of emergency, populations in Myanmar (Burma) have endured escalating human rights and humanitarian crises. The conflict now affects 13 of the country’s 15 states and regions, with civilians threatened by junta attacks and clashes involving armed groups. The military has committed widespread abuses on the civilian population, including relentless airstrikes, scorched-earth operations and systematic assaults, as well as obstructed humanitarian aid, particularly in anti-military strongholds. The High Commissioner has reported atrocities, including attacks on aid workers and the burning alive, dismemberment, rape and beheading of civilians unable to escape. At least 7,035 people have been killed by junta forces, over 22,263 remain imprisoned and 19.9 million require humanitarian aid – one million more than in 2024. Anti-junta armed groups have also been implicated in abuses, including torture, extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, forced recruitment and other serious violations. Last year saw the highest civilian death toll since the coup.

Prior to the coup, in August 2017 the military launched so-called “clearance operations” in Rakhine State with the purported aim of confronting the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. During those operations, the majority of Myanmar’s Rohingya population were forced to flee, leaving over 900,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. A UN FFM determined these operations amounted to genocide. Following renewed conflict in late 2023, the military and ethnic Arakan Army (AA) have perpetrated abuses in Rakhine, including indiscriminate airstrikes, drone attacks, shelling, forced displacement, burning of homes, destruction of towns and extrajudicial killings of civilians attempting to flee. Over 400,000 people are internally displaced across Rakhine and Chin States while approximately 200,000 have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since late 2023.

The HRC established the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM) in 2018 to collect, preserve and analyze evidence of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Myanmar since 2011. During the Enhanced Interactive Dialogue on the reports of the IIMM and High Commissioner on the human rights situation of the Rohingya and other minorities in Myanmar, we encourage your delegation to raise the ongoing violations and risks facing the Rohingya. Discussions on repatriation must prioritize the protection of the Rohingya, particularly given that both the junta and AA continue to pose serious threats to vulnerable civilians. We also urge your delegation to highlight the worsening humanitarian situation in Rakhine State and in refugee camps in Bangladesh, where funding shortfalls and aid cuts threaten to reduce food rations and deny victims and survivors access to basic services.

Occupied Palestinian Territory

Since 7 October 2023, Israel has significantly escalated its policy of mass arrests and detentions under the pretext of security concerns – alongside the commission of atrocities in Gaza and the Occupied West Bank – detaining thousands of Palestinians across Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). By August 2024, nearly 10,000 Palestinians were being held in Israeli jails, roughly twice the number detained at the onset of Israel’s assault on Gaza. According to UN experts, approximately one-third of these individuals were held in administrative detention, a form of arbitrary detention in which individuals are held without charge or trial. Those who are charged and prosecuted face a near-perfect conviction rate in Israel’s military courts.

Israel’s long-standing practice of administrative detention has been wielded as a tool of repression against Palestinians since the beginning of its military occupation in 1967. This practice has entrenched patterns of detaining Palestinians based on “secret” evidence, subjecting them to indefinite detention through repeated renewals and routine violations of due process rights. Israel also remains the only country in the world to try children in military courts. As of March 2025, 119 of the 323 Palestinian children in custody were being held in administrative detention – the highest number recorded since 2017.

The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) has repeatedly asserted that Israel’s widespread and systematic arbitrary detention of Palestinians may amount to a crime against humanity. In August 2023 the UN Special Rapporteur on situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 described Israel’s arbitrary detention policy as a “key instrument of domination and oppression,” which has resulted in “an entire occupied population framed as a security threat, often presumed guilty, and punished with incarceration even when trying to exercise fundamental freedoms.”

The WGAD has adopted three opinions concerning the cases of seven individuals detained by Israeli forces since October 2023. In all cases, the WGAD concluded that their detention constituted arbitrary detention in violation of international law. The WGAD determined that the arrests and detentions were conducted on “discriminatory grounds, namely [their] national, ethnic and social origin as Palestinians.”

In September 2024 the CoI on the OPT, including East Jerusalem, and Israel, issued a report describing Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinian detainees as an “intentional policy,” involving acts that amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity. Detainees were deliberately humiliated – including through physical, psychological, sexual and reproductive violence – used as human shields and frequently denied adequate food and medical care.

On 16 September the HRC will hold an Interactive Dialogue on the report of the WGAD. The Global Centre respectfully urges your delegation to actively participate in this discussion and express concern regarding Israel’s systematic use of arbitrary detention against Palestinians. We encourage your delegation to support the renewal of the WGAD’s mandate, call for an end to Israel’s practice of arbitrary detention, including administrative detention, and urge Israel to fully and transparently cooperate with the WGAD, including by granting unfettered access to its mandate-holders.

Somalia

Populations in Somalia remain at risk of atrocity crimes amid ongoing conflict and attacks perpetrated by armed extremist groups, particularly Al-Shabaab, and the forces combating them. According to the UN Secretary-General, at least 179 civilians were killed between 23 September 2024 to 23 March 2025, representing a 34 percent increase compared to the previous reporting period. At least 49 percent were killed in attacks perpetrated by Al-Shabaab. Populations also remain vulnerable as the government works to strengthen its ability to ensure protection following the drawdown of the African Union (AU) Transitional Mission and handover of security responsibilities to Somali forces.

The Independent Expert on the human rights situation in Somalia plays a vital role in supporting the government in addressing these ongoing challenges. The Global Centre therefore respectfully urges the renewal of the Independent Expert’s mandate and the inclusion of R2P language in the resolution, reaffirming that “the Federal Government of Somalia bears the primary responsibility to protect civilians from war crimes and crimes against humanity.”

Sudan

Since April 2023 an armed confrontation between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has resulted in tens of thousands of people killed across Sudan amid heavy fighting, aerial bombardments and shelling, including in densely populated areas. Reports have emerged of armed actors perpetrating widespread sexual and gender-based violence, including rape, as well as reports of forced evictions in the capital, Khartoum, and other cities. The RSF have utilized the conflict to accelerate a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing and large-scale attacks targeting non-Arab communities in Darfur and other regions, perpetrating possible acts of genocide.

For over a year, the RSF has tightened its territorial control around El Fasher, North Darfur, blocking crucial supply routes and escalating attacks on surrounding areas. Indiscriminate airstrikes and targeted violence have killed civilians and destroyed entire communities. Since 12 April 2025 the RSF have taken over Zamzam camp, southwest of El Fasher, reportedly committing widespread abuses and forcibly displacing hundreds of thousands of residents. The RSF have also further expanded the geographic scope of its attacks on civilians in North Kordofan, where over 450 civilians have been killed near the city of Bara since 12 July. Several senior UN officials have raised alarm about the escalation, with the Office of the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide reiterating that the risk factors for genocide and related crimes remain present.

During May 2023 the HRC established an international independent FFM for Sudan. With a mandate to investigate human rights and IHL violations and preserve evidence for future legal proceedings, among other tasks, the FFM has a crucial role to play in delivering justice for affected communities. As the conflict shows no sign of abating, with both parties entrenched in their positions and unwilling to de-escalate, sustained international scrutiny and pressure are crucial to hold perpetrators accountable and support sustainable peace and humanitarian relief for all populations.

The Global Centre respectfully urges your delegation to support a full two-year extension of the FFM to enable it to carry out its work. We also urge your delegation to request regular FFM updates, including oral briefings and reports at upcoming HRC sessions, followed by enhanced interactive dialogues with key stakeholders – including the High Commissioner, AU representatives, the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, civil society and victims and survivors – and for these reports to be presented to the General Assembly at its 81st and 82nd sessions. We also urge your delegation to recommend that the General Assembly submit the FFM’s reports to the Security Council for its consideration and appropriate action, including holding perpetrators accountable through expanded ICC jurisdiction across Sudan and the consideration of targeted sanctions. Lastly, it is important to emphasize that the HRC will remain actively seized of the matter, including by assessing the developing situation and identifying appropriate responses. This is in line with a joint NGO letter released on 15 August.

Ukraine

Since the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian forces have used indiscriminate explosive weapons and committed widespread war crimes and crimes against humanity, including indiscriminate shelling, systematic torture and sexual and gender-based violence. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) has documented the widespread use of heavy artillery, unguided missiles, airstrikes and prohibited cluster munitions in populated areas. Civilian casualties have risen sharply since March 2024, due in large part to Russia’s escalating deployment of high-impact air-dropped glide bombs. These long-range weapons have caused devastating harm to civilians, striking far beyond front lines with poor precision. Schools, homes, healthcare facilities, water and sanitation infrastructure and energy systems have all been severely affected. As of June 2025, the UN has verified over 13,580 civilian deaths, while noting that the true number is likely far higher. The invasion has triggered a dire humanitarian crisis, with more than 10 million people displaced, including over 6.5 million who have fled to neighboring countries.

During the discussion following the oral update from the Independent International CoI on Ukraine, we encourage member states to highlight the devastating toll the ongoing, intractable conflict has taken on civilians and call for measures to limit Russia’s ability to continue to perpetrate atrocities. All peace efforts must be centered around safety, justice and redress for Ukraine’s civilians.

Venezuela

In the year since Venezuela’s discredited presidential elections, President Nicolás Maduro has tightened his grip on power through a systematic and intensified crackdown on dissent. State agents have systematically targeted ordinary citizens, opposition members, journalists and human rights defenders, including through mass arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions and other serious human rights violations and abuses. This wave of repression has been accompanied by hate speech and inflammatory rhetoric from high-level officials. Military personnel face heightened risks, including enforced disappearances, as part of efforts to maintain internal obedience. The 25 May parliamentary and regional elections were also marked by intensified repression, particularly targeting opposition figures and human rights defenders. With much of the opposition boycotting the vote and voter turnout low, the ruling party secured control of most governorships and retained the National Assembly.

The HRC-mandated FFM on Venezuela warned of “the accelerated reactivation of the repressive machinery that was never dismantled and is now being used to undermine the public freedoms of citizens.” On 14 May the FFM expressed grave concern over practices of enforced disappearances and the widespread lack of effective judicial protection, warning that “these acts are being committed in Venezuela as part of the crime against humanity of political persecution (…) They are part of a series of actions carried out under a coordinated plan to silence, discourage, and suppress the opposition.”

On 26 June OHCHR published a report documenting post-electoral repression and raised concern over its limited country team access to Venezuela, which significantly affects its ability to carry out its monitoring, reporting and technical assistance mandate. Days later, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk was declared persona non grata, threatening OHCHR’s country presence and work with victim and survivor communities.

Since its establishment in 2019, the FFM has repeatedly found that some violations and abuses committed since at least 2014 were part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population and are “part of a plan orchestrated at the highest levels of the government to repress dissent through crimes against humanity.”

The ongoing repression and political persecution have been enabled by the government’s deliberate dismantling of remaining institutional safeguards for civic space and the protection of civil and political rights. Since August 2024 the National Assembly has passed a series of restrictions, including legislation known as the “NGO Law,” jeopardizing the work, safety and security of organizations across the country, as well as other measures to criminalize political opposition. Attorney General Tarek William Saab regularly threatens to arrest human rights defenders engaging with UN mechanisms and authorities have increasingly used short-term enforced disappearances to instill fear and crush dissent. As of 4 August, Venezuelan human rights NGO Foro Penal documented 807 political prisoners, including 83 third-state nationals.

While Venezuela has experienced a protracted multidimensional crisis for over a decade, current tensions and patterns of repression are unprecedented and leave populations at imminent risk of crimes against humanity. The Global Centre therefore respectfully encourages you to participate in the Interactive Dialogue with the FFM, currently scheduled for 22 September, and call upon the Venezuelan government to immediately cease enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and other systematic violations and abuses of human rights. We also encourage you to demand the release of all individuals arbitrarily detained. Lastly, the Global Centre urges you to call on the Venezuelan government to immediately grant all OHCHR staff access to the country and fully cooperate with the FFM.",http://www.globalr2p.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/UN-HRC-Voting.png,N,,2025-09-02 12:57:10.911175

""I strongly object to the Office of Management and Budget’s unlawful attempt to pursue a nearly $5 billion pocket rescission,"" Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in a post to X. ""Congress alone bears the constitutional responsibility for funding our government, and any effort to claw back resources outside of the appropriations process undermines that responsibility.""

Murkowski argued that the move would ""only threaten the good bipartisan work that has been done in committee and on the floor, and risk throwing the entire process into chaos.""

Her criticism comes after Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, slammed the so-called rescissions package last week, saying that ""any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.""

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and personal lawyer for Trump, has been discharged from a New Hampshire hospital after being injured in a car crash over the weekend, his spokesman said in a statement this morning.

“Mayor Giuliani is progressing well following the motor vehicle accident that occurred Saturday evening, shortly after the mayor and I stopped to help what appeared to be a person in need of immediate assistance,"" said the spokesman, Ted Goodman.

""He has been discharged from the hospital and appreciates the love, well wishes and prayers,” he added

Giuliani’s head of security, Michael Ragusa, said Sunday that Giuliani sustained injuries including a spinal fracture after he was “struck from behind at high speed” while riding as a passenger in a vehicle on a highway in New Hampshire.

He said before the crash, Giuliani had been “flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident,” and he “immediately rendered assistance and contacted 911,” staying on scene until police arrived.

In a later statement Sunday, Ragusa offered conflicting details, alleging that in ""a surprising turn of events, it was later determined that the woman was the aggressor, while the boyfriend — found bloodied and in poor condition — was taken to the hospital for treatment.""

Trump posted on social media yesterday that he plans on awarding Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.

The president is expected to announce this afternoon that U.S. Space Command’s headquarters will move from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama, two defense officials said. Two other sources familiar with the White House’s plans confirmed the 2 p.m. Oval Office announcement today would indeed focus on U.S. Space Command.

The site of the command’s headquarters has been something of a political football, reaching back across the last two administrations, with the Colorado and Alabama congressional delegations jostling to land the site.

Last week Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey seemed to tease the decision, saying she had been in touch with the president and was “very optimistic” the move would soon be announced.

U.S. stocks and bonds fell sharply this morningy, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 1.2%, the Nasdaq falling 1.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling about 400 points.

U.S. Treasury yields also rose to highs not seen for months. The higher that the yields are, the more costly it is for the U.S. government to borrow money.

Those moves came after a panel of judges ruled Friday that most ofTrump's sweeping country-specific tariffs are illegal. However, tariffs can stay in place while the legal process plays out.

The ruling has raised concerns that the U.S. might have to refund more than $120 billion in tariff revenue collected so far this year. That amount of refunds could force the government to tap the markets to borrow more money and would mean that the tariff funds are not helping to reduce the country's debt.

More than 450 economists from private industry and academia have signed an “open letter” to Trump and Congress expressing ""our strong support for Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook and for the longstanding principle of central bank independence.”

Some of the notable signatories include Trevon Logan, an economics professor at Ohio State University who has co-written a number of papers with Cook; former Fed economists Claudia Sahm and Julia Coronado; former chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Christina Romer (under Barack Obama), Jared Bernstein (under Joe Biden) and Joseph Stiglitz (under Bill Clinton).

""Good economic policy requires credible monetary institutions,"" the letter says. ""Credible monetary institutions, in turn, require the independence of the Federal Reserve. A large body of research confirms that countries with more independent central banks achieve better economic outcomes.""

Cook is suing Trump over what she is calling his ""unprecedented and illegal"" effort to remove her from the Fed.

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., is expected to file a discharge petition this afternoon to try to force a floor vote on requiring the Department of Justice to hand over files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Massie had originally introduced the petition in July with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.; now that Congress is back from recess, they will need to gather 218 signatures to force the vote.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has rejected the effort, arguing that the DOJ is already cooperating with the House Oversight Committee.

GOP leaders have also added a bill to the list of legislation the House will consider this week that would direct the House Oversight Committee to “continue its ongoing investigation into the possible mismanagement of the Federal government’s investigation of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell.”

The bill is unnecessary from an investigative standpoint because the Oversight Committee does not need the full House to approve or direct its efforts. The legislation could be a way for the speaker to placate members of the party who would like to see members vote on something Epstein-related amid criticism from Democrats who have been pushing for the release of the files.

Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., released a statement detailing his decision not to seek re-election after decades in Congress.

""This decision has not been easy,"" he said. ""But I know in my heart it is the right one and that it is the right time to pass the torch to a new generation.""

Nadler laid out his career highlights, including legislation ""on voting rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ2+ rights, immigration and gun safety,"" he said.

Nadler told The New York Times, which first reported the news of his retirement, that ""watching the Biden thing really said something about the necessity for generational change in the party, and I think I want to respect that.""

A federal grand jury sitting in Washington declined to return an indictment against a woman whom the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia accused of threatening to take the life of the president and transmitting threats over state lines on Instagram and Facebook.

Nathalie Rose Jones of Indiana allegedly threatened Trump and called him a “terrorist” and a “Nazi” in a voluntary interview with the Secret Service. She attended a march Aug. 16 that went around the White House complex and was then arrested, although she said she had no present desire to harm Trump.

In a motion yesterday, her defense attorneys disclosed that a grand jury didn’t indict Jones.

“A grand jury has now found no probable cause to indict Ms. Jones on the charged offenses,” her federal public defenders wrote.

Friends wrote that Jones had mental health issues.

NBC News reported last week that a federal grand jury declined to indict a former Justice Department employee who was seen on camera throwing a hoagie at the chest of a federal officer deployed in the nation’s capital.

Republican Jack Ciattarelli has launched his first TV ad of the general election in New Jersey governor’s race, one of two gubernatorial contests this year. In the ad, Ciattarelli looks to head off attempts to tie him to Trump and links his Democratic opponent, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, to the state’s current Democratic governor, Phil Murphy.

“We all know it. New Jersey’s a mess, and all Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump,” Ciattarelli says in the ad in a quintessential New Jersey diner. “Come on, what does the president have to do with rising property taxes and higher electricity bills?”

“New Jersey’s a mess because out-of-touch politicians like Phil Murphy and Mikie Sherrill care more about pronouns and sanctuary cities than they do solving our problems,” Ciattarelli says. “That changes when I’m governor. I’ll lower electricity bills, cut and cap property taxes, and keep our community safe. Folks, it’s time to fix New Jersey. When I’m governor, we will.”

Sherrill is also hitting the airwaves this week, with her ad buy set to start tomorrow, according to AdImpact.

The year’s lone pair of gubernatorial elections are only two months away, providing one of the biggest tests for both parties since the 2024 presidential contest.

In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are locked in a competitive race that has been defined by affordability issues and the popularity of Trump and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.

In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger has seen success in polls by blasting Republican Winsome Earle-Sears over Trump’s massive tax cut and spending law and putting economic issues at the forefront of her message. But Earle-Sears, the state’s lieutenant governor, seems to have made up ground during the summer, with early voting kicking off in just over two weeks.

Trump pointed to crime in Chicago over the holiday weekend, claiming in a post on Truth Social that Chicago is ""the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far.""

""Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn’t know it yet,"" he said, referring to Illinois' governor. ""I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, and soon.""

Trump has previously floated sending troops to Chicago as he did in Washington, D.C. Many D.C. residents have criticized Trump's deployment of troops in the city as unnecessary and an overreach.

Since the 2025 inauguration, Democracy Forward has emerged as a critical bulwark against the harmful and unlawful actions of the federal Executive Branch. The organization has filed more than 100 legal actions and launched 110 investigations, securing multiple significant victories to stop the Trump-Vance administration’s harmful and anti-democratic policies on behalf of people, communities, unions, nonprofit organizations, veterans groups, parents, educators, houses of worship, and more. The organization is also active in protecting people and communities from abuses of power at the state and local level.

The Atlantic: The Anti-Trump Strategy That’s Actually Working

Lawsuits, lawsuits, and more lawsuits

By Michael Scherer

Days after Attorney General Pam Bondi tried to put an end to the Justice Department’s revelations about Jeffrey Epstein, captains of the legal resistance gathered by Zoom. Norm Eisen, a former attorney for Barack Obama’s White House, had convened lawyers, Democratic communications strategists, a neoconservative Trump critic, and a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. This one was big, Eisen said from his parked car in Baltimore, where he had traveled for a lawsuit to overturn President Donald Trump’s cuts to AmeriCorps. They should move quickly.

“The Trump-Epstein story is the story of the Trump administration—corruption benefiting his rich and powerful cronies at the expense of vulnerable people,” Eisen explained as I lurked on the July call with his permission.

The plan was to file a Hail Mary lawsuit to force the Department of Justice to release any documents in its possession that tie Epstein, a convicted child sex offender, to Trump. Eisen’s team had already filed the request for anything that connects the two men, under the Freedom of Information Act. The FOIA is normally a weak tool for unlocking investigative records gathered for criminal investigations, but Eisen had a legal theory: Because the DOJ had argued under pressure after Bondi’s announcement that the extraordinary public interest in the Epstein case required the unsealing of grand-jury testimony, they could argue the same thing. And that was just the beginning.

Eisen, who has pursued more than 100 legal matters against Trump since his second inauguration, explained that he wanted to try the case in the court of law and the court of public opinion. He asked for an update on an op-ed he had written raising questions about “a potential cover up” of Trump’s dealings with Epstein. He wanted a plan from Lavora Barnes, the former Michigan party chair, about how they would get elected leaders to discuss the Epstein records. He wanted a press plan to publicize the requests they had already filed, and the lawsuit they would file a few weeks later. A discussion followed about whether they should also try to intervene in the Justice Department’s effort to unseal grand-jury testimony, how many of the Epstein records they should demand to release, and how the Epstein issue fit with other arguments against Trump. “We have an extremely strong horse right now. Let’s just ride that,” said Bill Kristol, the resident neoconservative. “We want to know what’s going on with the Epstein files.”

The first seven months of Trump’s Oval Office do-over have been, with occasional exception, a tale of ruthless domination. The Democratic opposition is feeble and fumbling, the federal bureaucracy traumatized and neutered. Corporate leaders come bearing gifts, the Republican Party has been scrubbed of dissent, and the street protests are diminished in size. Even the news media, a major check on Trump’s power in his first term, have faded from their 2017 ferocity, hobbled by budget cuts, diminished ratings, and owners wary of crossing the president.

One exception has stood out: A legal resistance led by a patchwork coalition of lawyers, public-interest groups, Democratic state attorneys general, and unions has frustrated Trump’s ambitions. Hundreds of attorneys and plaintiffs have stood up to him, feeding a steady assembly line of setbacks and judicial reprimands for a president who has systematically sought to break down limits on his own power. Of the 384 cases filed through August 28 against the Trump administration, 130 have led to orders blocking at least part of the president’s efforts, and 148 cases await a ruling, according to a review by Just Security. Dozens of those rulings are the final word, with no appeal by the government, and others have been stayed on appeal, including by the Supreme Court.

“The only place we had any real traction was to start suing, because everything else was inert,” Eisen told me. “Trump v. the Rule of Law is like the fight of the century between Ali and Frazier, or the Thrilla in Manila or the Rumble in the Jungle. It’s a great heavyweight battle.”

The legal scorecard so far is more than enough to provoke routine cries of “judicial tyranny” by Trump and his advisers. “Unelected rogue judges are trying to steal years of time from a 4 year term,” reads one typical social-media complaint from Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller. “It’s the most egregious theft one can imagine.”

But Miller’s fury was, in part, misdirected. Before there can be rulings from judges, there must be plaintiffs who bring a case, investigators who collect facts and declarations about the harm caused, and lawyers who can shape it all into legal theories that make their way to judicial opinions. This backbone of the Trump resistance has as much in common with political organizing and investigative reporting as it does with legal theory.

“It should give great pause to the American public that parties are being recruited to harm the agenda the American people elected President Trump to implement,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told me in a statement.

Even those at the center of the fight against Trump view their greatest accomplishments as going beyond the temporary restraining orders or permanent injunctions they won. Without the court fights, the public would not know about many of the activities of Elon Musk’s DOGE employees in the early months of the administration. They would not have read headlines in which federal judges accuse the president’s team of perpetrating a “sham” or taking actions “shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.” Kilmar Abrego Garcia would not have become a household name. Even cases that Trump ultimately won on appeal—such as his ability to fire transgender soldiers, defund scientific research, and dismiss tens of thousands of government employees—were delayed and kept in the news by the judicial process.

In Trump immigration cases, it’s one thing in public, another in court

Since Inauguration Day, executive orders have been defanged or blocked, agency closures delayed, government-employee firings reversed. Deportation flights have been delayed, law firms have freed themselves from Trump’s retaliation, and foreign students have won the ability to continue studying at U.S. universities. Courts have forced the president to restore cut services and spending to AmeriCorps, the U.S. African Development Foundation, the CDC, and other agencies. They have upended an effort by the Office of Refugee Resettlement to make it more difficult to release unaccompanied minors from government custody and forced Trump to pay for foreign-aid bills he had hoped to stiff-arm. A federal appeals court ruled Friday that many of Trump’s tariffs were illegal, setting up a likely hearing by the Supreme Court.

“The biggest victory, I think, has been in terms of highlighting the egregious nature of what Trump is doing,” Rushab Sanghvi, the general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, told me. “It is getting the public to understand how terrible it is.”

The groundwork for these victories was laid before Trump was even reelected, in a series of summits in 2023 and 2024. Universities hosted symposiums. Organized labor held private meetings. International experts, who had been studying Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, warned that Trump would move quickly and try to overwhelm his opponents. “We needed to flood the zone with rule-of-law shock and awe,” Eisen told me after the Zoom call.

The plan that emerged was not focused on centralizing a response, but on running a barrage of coordinated efforts. Attorneys general would represent states, advocacy groups such as Public Citizen and the ACLU would focus on their areas of expertise, and the unions would gather stories from their members and identify plaintiffs who could show harm. Atop this infrastructure, new organizations took shape, bringing in tens of millions of dollars to pay for it all.

The offices of Democracy Forward, the single largest source of Trump’s legal troubles, look from the inside like those of any corporate Washington law firm. From the building’s corner windows, the group’s more than 130 staff members—about half of them attorneys—can just make out the White House a couple of blocks down the street. By their count, they have filed 100 legal actions so far this year against Trump, often with union, nonprofit, or local-government partners.

Since 2021, the group had been operating on the assumption that American democracy was backsliding, and that the outcome of the 2024 election would merely determine whether it sped up or slowed down. By early 2024, it had established working groups with other organizations to begin sketching out the “threat matrix” of a second Trump term, placing particular focus on the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which Trump distanced himself from while campaigning but has largely embraced while in office. “We knew that if the federal landscape were to regress, people would have very few levers of power left,” Skye Perryman, Democracy Forward’s president, told me. “They would be able to go to the streets and to vote, and they would be able to use litigation.”

Democracy Forward’s first filing, to gain access to the deliberations of DOGE, hit the docket of the D.C. district court within hours of Trump taking the oath of office. Eisen’s Democracy Defenders Fund, which has about two dozen attorneys, and three other legal groups filed similar suits at the same time. The decision to sue so soon was controversial. Perryman remembers some elected Democrats, among others, urging her to hold back. But she had been gaming out the moment for more than a year. She had a theory of the case and a coalition that saw the moment as she did. “Right now, it’s fight versus no fight, rather than left or center-left,” she told me.

‘I run the country and the world.’

One week later, the group faced its first crisis. The Office of Management and Budget released a memo telling federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance,” a seismic order that threatened to close hundreds of federally funded programs around the country. “Our litigators knew on the surface: This is unlawful,” Megan Uzzell, Democracy Forward’s director of external affairs, told me. But to build a case, they needed plaintiffs who had been harmed. That night, they worked the phones, signing up an array of groups that received federal funding and needed lawyers, such as the National Council of Nonprofits, the American Public Health Association, and the Main Street Alliance. “We developed that,” Uzzell said. “Our litigators stayed up all night long developing the legal framework, and we were in court by 10 o’clock the next morning.” The memo was stayed by a court that day and withdrawn by the White House the next.

A pattern developed. Attorneys drafted legal arguments for potential moves by Trump, worked the phones to find plaintiffs and dig up facts, and then rushed to court. “It is what the administration didn’t think the legal community would be able to do,” Perryman told me. “This is highly factually intense work. It’s designed that way so that the administration can go in and make a bunch of technical arguments, and we have met them every step of the way.”

Shortly after Trump’s second inauguration, a school-committee member for Easthampton, Massachusetts, received a Facebook Messenger text from an old college friend asking if she would be interested in going to court. Democracy Forward was preparing a lawsuit against Trump to challenge expected cuts to the Department of Education, and they were looking for plaintiffs.

Easthampton is a former mill town in the western part of the state, with a school district of about 1,400 kids and 118 teachers, and a working-class population that is far more politically mixed than much of the broadly liberal area. For the mayor and the school committee, going to court was not an easy decision. The superintendent and the district’s lawyer were initially skeptical. But Sam Hunter, who received the outreach, along with his school-committee colleague Laura Scott, decided to push ahead anyway.

“The conversation was, ‘You are in 1938 Berlin. Which kind of person are you?’” Scott remembered. “This is the closest you are going to get to that moment.” Democracy Forward also signed up the Somerville, Massachusetts, school district, along with a set of public-employee unions. The case eventually merged with a similar lawsuit filed by Democratic state attorneys general.

Weeks later, Hunter found himself in a Boston courtroom listening to the federal judge Myong J. Joun consider Trump’s decision to eliminate about half of the staff at the Department of Education in the name of efficiency. The president had acknowledged that he could not get rid of the department altogether—Trump’s stated goal—without an act of Congress. But his lawyers argued that he had the power to make personnel decisions in the meantime, even if that meant firing half of the employees. The question before the judge was whether the government’s claims made constitutional sense.

Joun, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, had before him a raft of details about Easthampton’s concerns. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which had been targeted for dismantling by Trump, had worked closely with the district to resolve issues of racial bias in how the schools disciplined their students. Their transportation options, class sizes, and accommodations for students with disabilities all depended on federal support.

“Do you drink coffee?” Joun asked Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton at a hearing, in late April.

“I do,” Hamilton responded for the government.

“I drink coffee every morning,” the judge continued. “I go to Dunkin’ Donuts, and when I walk in, there is a person behind the counter. There is a person making a fresh pot of coffee. If I want a sandwich, there’s a person at the sandwich station … Let’s say one morning there is no one there. I don’t think the plaintiffs are saying that Dunkin’ Donuts should hire these three employees back. I think what they’re saying is they want their cup of coffee.”

At another point in the argument, Joun dismissed the government’s claim that Trump’s order was legal because it said in the text that it would not violate the law, comparing it to a teenager coming up with a nonsensical explanation for breaking a parent’s rules.

Hunter was surprised by the lighthearted tone. It was clear to him that Joun was on the side of the schools. “Every time he made one of those jokes, I would look around and think: Are we all laughing?” Hunter told me.

Joun ruled that Trump’s cuts overstepped his authority, quoting at length from the briefs that Easthampton had filed. “The idea that Defendants’ actions are merely a ‘reorganization’ is plainly not true,” he wrote, issuing a preliminary injunction that prohibited the Department of Education from going through with its planned layoffs. Weeks later, the First Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the ruling, sending it to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“All of our lawsuits tell stories,” Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, which was a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit and 11 others, told me. “But you can’t ask the judge to do all the work. If you want to prevail, you have to put real stories and real harm in front of the judge.”

The Supreme Court’s liberals are trying to tell Americans something

The Supreme Court ultimately voided Joun’s ruling in an order that offered no reasoning. “The majority apparently deems it more important to free the Government from paying employees it had no right to fire than to avert these very real harms while the litigation continues,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent joined by the Court’s two other Democratic appointees. The Department of Education employees were dismissed. But the law remains unsettled. Joun has ordered amended complaints to be filed by October 15, setting up a winter battle that could eventually end up back at the Supreme Court.

Eisen believes that these legal struggles against Trump are just the opening minutes of a much larger battle. “He did not win that round. We did not win either,” he told me, “but we held our own, and that in itself is a victory.”

The Supreme Court, which has so far appeared more favorable to Trump than district courts, could ultimately tilt the scorecard in the president’s favor, as the justices begin to consider the substance of the legal questions presented by Trump. But the ultimate score will not be recorded on just the appellate docket or in the list of injunctions that are left to stand. Organizers are tracking Trump’s approval ratings, as well, anticipating the effect the legal efforts could have on the 2026 midterm elections. “Despite the bluster from the White House, the president has been losing public support. He is losing in court in ways that he did not anticipate,” Perryman told me. Voters have the power to provide the ultimate check.

The president is also providing more fodder for more lawsuits. The many aggressive tactics by ICE have spawned new cases, as has the deployment of federal officers and National Guardsmen to try to crack down on crime in D.C. Eisen is working on a plan for a lawsuit against Trump that challenges the financial benefits he and his family have enjoyed since taking office. The battle, in short, is just beginning.

“The demand for lawyers that are willing to defend people from the government is exponentially greater today than it was on day one,” Perryman told me. “We believe the next 200 days are going to be even more significant than the first 200 days.”

Early in Donald Trump’s second term, as the president was asserting a level of nearly autocratic power — which his predecessors certainly did not think they possessed — I published an essay called “Don’t Believe Him.”

In that essay, I argued that Trump was asserting all this power because he was actually weak. He was moving so fast because everywhere else in the government, he was likely to be stopped — in Congress and in the courts. And so it was very important not to treat what Trump was doing as fixed, as something that could not be undone. Because it was only in assuming he had that power that he would really have it. Otherwise, he was going to get mired down in the same inertia and checks and balances that had mired down all his predecessors.

For a while, that bet looked sort of right. Trump was getting stopped in the courts. They were ruling against him overwhelmingly, over and over again. These were the early months of the administration — we were still then waiting for the Supreme Court to weigh in.

But in the last few months, the Supreme Court has weighed in. And it has weighed in overwhelmingly for Donald Trump and the powers he seeks.

I guess the good news here is that maybe we’re not going to have the constitutional showdown many feared. But the bad news is that it’s because Trump is getting what he wants.

Is that because this Supreme Court is submitting to him and afraid of a showdown? Is it because this Supreme Court has wanted this kind of presidency and has in fact, been building the constitutional structure and permission for it for years?

To help me think this through, I wanted to bring back Kate Shaw to the podcast. Shaw is a former Supreme Court clerk. She’s a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and a co-host of the fantastic podcast “Strict Scrutiny.”

Note: This episode was recorded on Aug. 21, before Trump announced his intention to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and before Immigration and Customs Enforcement rearrested Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia and began processing him for deportation to Uganda.

Ezra Klein: Kate Shaw, welcome back to the show.

Kate Shaw: Thanks for having me, Ezra.

Earlier this year, shortly after Donald Trump took office, I made the case that Trump was acting like a dictator but didn’t actually have dictatorial power. In a bunch of subsequent episodes, people came on the show and said: Look, the courts are stopping him. The system is sort of working.

The Supreme Court has since weighed in a number of times. Where are we now?

I think things look worse for the rule of law and better for Trump’s dictatorial aspirations now than they did three or four months ago.

So I think it’s right that in the first couple of months of the administration, Trump was making these wildly broad assertions of executive authority and executive orders and other kinds of actions, and he was running into the kind of buzz saw of the lower courts applying settled doctrine, reading the Constitution and statutes, and saying: No, you can’t do that. That’s not how any of this works.

That is still ongoing. But beginning in about April, the Supreme Court started to get into the mix. In a series of rulings — actually 16 in a row — the Supreme Court has sided with Trump and against challenges to Trump and against lower courts that have ruled against Trump, in this wild streak of victories for Trump that have largely happened under the radar because they’re happening on the shadow docket.

Can you say what the shadow docket is?

Sure. People are most familiar with the Supreme Court’s work on what we call the merits docket. Those are cases the court decides it’s going to take. There are briefs filed, oral arguments, and then the court writes and releases written opinions, usually, like the big ones, at the end of June. That’s the merits docket.

The court also does a lot of work on what we call the shadow docket. Some of that is pretty trivial stuff — how much time people are going to get in oral arguments and things like that.

But increasingly, parties have come to the Supreme Court asking for emergency relief, usually because they’ve been ruled against by the lower courts. And the court, often in the dead of night, often without any reasoning or written opinion at all, disposes of these requests for emergency relief.

That’s this kind of streak of victories that Trump has had, ruling after ruling in favor of Trump, allowing him to do a lot of, I think, wildly damaging and destructive things, even though the only written opinion assessing the lawfulness of his conduct has come from the lower courts and has been against him.

Let’s go through a couple of these clusters of asserted powers that I think, at least a couple of months ago, felt very contested.

So the administration launches, DOGE emerges, and they begin firing federal employees en masse in ways that many of us did not think you could fire federal employees. We have these very complex civil service protections, and anybody who has ever been around these processes knows how difficult it is to hire and fire. But they begin doing mass firings, often without real cause.

This gets stopped, challenged in a bunch of lower courts. Where did the Supreme Court come in?

Largely, Trump has prevailed in these efforts. Now the court hasn’t, on the merits, actually grappled with some of these questions. The statutes that provide civil service protections are still on the books, and the Supreme Court has not in any way said those laws are unconstitutional, even though I think it’s pretty clear that Trump and many of his advisers think that’s the case.

In some of those memos or emails that you just referenced, the reason for termination that is given is literally two words: Article II — that the president’s power under Article II entitles him to fire anyone. I do think they think that.

So the court has addressed a number of cases involving these terminations, some of them high-level officials — people like one of the members of the National Labor Relations Board or the Merit Systems Protection Board. Statutes give those officials protection against being fired just because the president feels like it or wants to put somebody else in the position.

Trump, in clear facial violations of those statutes, fired those people. And actually, this case involving the N.L.R.B. and M.S.P.B. members made it to the Supreme Court on the shadow docket, and we did get a short written opinion there that basically said: These officials exercise significant executive authority, and so the president has to be able to fire them at will.

I think that reasoning is wrong, but at least it’s there. So we know the court thinks it will ultimately decide this probably next term but thinks that these heads of multimember agencies, Trump can fire anytime he wants, regardless of what statutes say.

So DOGE and Trump came in and, without going to Congress, decapitated and eviscerated a series of agencies — most famously U.S.A.I.D., the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to some degree, and the Department of Education, to a very large degree.

I remember when Barack Obama wanted to restructure the Commerce Department, and Congress wasn’t interested, so he couldn’t do it.

What has happened there?

Imagine Barack Obama deciding to just abolish by executive order the Commerce Department. Or Joe Biden saying: We’re going to get rid of ICE.

The idea that he would just by fiat fire everyone in these agencies — and that the court would allow it — is kind of preposterous. I don’t think there’s any way that the Supreme Court would have allowed a different president to proceed as this president is proceeding — which isn’t the question you asked, but I do think that that’s worth saying.

Not irrelevant to the questions I have, though.

I think you’re right that Trump has proceeded in a few different ways. Funding cuts are one tool that Trump has used. The Department of Education — first, there’s an executive order saying: Let’s do a wind down. And then there are these directives from the secretary.

And there’s a challenge that says: This is a functional elimination of an agency. Congress passed a statute creating an agency, creating components of the agency, conferring authority and imposing obligations on the officials in these parts of this agency. And only Congress can undo all of that.

The actions taken pursuant to that order were shrouded in this legal cover, like: We’re doing reorgs and trying to make the agency more efficient.

But really, the challenge was that this was a way to dismantle the agency. And that is what the lower courts found was done. This secretary didn’t have the authority to take the steps that she took by statute.

And this is one of the examples of cases in which the court ruled against the lower court, stayed the lower court injunction, but didn’t provide any reasoning. We just don’t know why.

And yet the effect is essentially to make it impossible for the Department of Education to carry out many of its statutorily conferred obligations and functions, like providing a real education for millions of children with disabilities and many other services.

There is this theory called the unitary executive theory. It has been bouncing around for a long time, and it’s sort of what you see the Trump administration asserting. And I think this is what you see the court, in a way, responding to.

What is it? And what is the case for it? If you’re talking to your law students and you’ve got to steel-man unitary executive, what’s the argument you make?

Since the beginning, there has been a debate about what kind of power the president possesses. The first sentence of Article II says: “The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America.”

So what is the executive power? What does it mean for it to be vested in a president? There’s been a debate from the very beginning.

James Madison is associated with the view that all that sentence really means is it should be vested in a president — like there’s going to be one president. Because there has been debate about plural executives. And there’s a name for the office — it’s president. But that sentence doesn’t do that much more.

And then there’s another view that “the executive power shall be vested” actually confers really expansive authority on the president. And maybe that includes some of the powers that the king possessed, especially around things like national security and foreign affairs — so really broad power.

This debate has been essentially around from the beginning. But the unitary executive as a theory of presidential power is really just traceable to the early 1980s and the Reagan Justice Department, which is where the conservative legal movement is born.

And it essentially says the president has expansive authority in a vertical sense — he has the authority to direct everybody in the executive branch, including maybe heads of independent agencies where Congress has tried to insulate those people from the president — but also horizontal power, including powers that Congress is disabled from regulating.

People have lots of different kinds of versions of the unitary executive theory, but I think that’s probably a good distillation: very broad powers, both vertical and horizontal.

Well, I also understand it as encompassing a critique that I don’t fully agree with, but I actually have some sympathy for: The idea that the administrative state — the broad executive branch — is an unaccountable fourth branch of government. And the idea that in Congress, everything is under Congress’s control. But that the public elects the president to lead the executive branch. But when you add up the regulatory language, the statutory language, the civil service protections, the fact that bureaucracies grow on their own and have their own institutional dynamics, the president, in fact, doesn’t lead the executive branch.

And so you need the unitary executive power — this ability to hire and fire, to destroy agencies, to replace whomever you want. Because who is supposed to be in charge of the executive branch, of all these agencies, if not the president? So if the president can’t fire people, then in what way is he actually in charge of it? And if he’s not in charge of it, then haven’t we broken a fundamental mechanism of democratic accountability?

Yes, and I think the response to that is that democratic accountability works in a few different ways. Congress is obviously also democratically accountable, and Congress has made a series of choices that give the president enormous authority over the administrative state — but do provide these pockets where, yes, the president does encounter some friction. Because, actually, there are certain things — financial regulatory bodies and monetary policy are key areas — that for a long time Congress has said: Maybe politics should encounter some resistance, and we should create a degree of independence and insulation in those bodies.

The president can still, of course, hire and fire the top officials in the cabinet departments and in everything that we think of as traditional executive branch agencies. But this cluster of independent agencies — where, by the way, the president does still have a lot of authority: He actually can still fire people, he just has to provide some reasons. He can’t fire them because he wants to put in a co-partisan or a lackey instead. Or maybe he can try because actually there haven’t been very many legal challenges that have tested the meaning of those “for cause” protections. They have operated instead to disincentivize presidents from trying to fire these high-level officials at those kinds of agencies.

Now, of course, we can have policy debates — and of course, you’re having those policy debates about where that friction gets really problematic and thwarts the ability to make policy happen. But the idea that it’s unconstitutional for Congress to provide some of these protections from the president, I think, is not a winning argument.

There have been a lot of cases around the deportation powers and also the lack of due process hearings, etc., around deportation. Where do those stand?

So I would say three categories. First, this group of challenges to individuals sent to CECOT, this Salvadoran prison that Abrego Garcia and a number of others were held in. The administration had something of a mixed set of outcomes in those challenges.

The Supreme Court said these challenges were brought using the wrong procedural device and in the wrong place. But the Supreme Court did confirm that due process is required, even in the context of individuals designated under the Alien Enemies Act.

Stephen Miller touted this as a victory for Trump. I think that most legal commentators viewed it as a mixed result — but a really important reaffirmation of the importance of due process.

I think that’s also true about Abrego Garcia. He also prevailed in a different lower court. The Supreme Court reviewing his case basically confirmed that the lower court didn’t exceed its authority by ordering the administration to facilitate his return. Although they parsed words and said: Lower courts can’t direct the president to effectuate, but they can require facilitation. It’s a little unclear what the difference there is — but again, a mixed outcome, I would say, for the Trump administration. And you’re right: Mr. Abrego Garcia was subsequently — despite the administration’s protest that it just couldn’t — returned to the United States.

The last of these involves the third-country removals. That’s what I’m hard-pressed to really explain. This is a group of individuals who, under a statute that does give the executive branch some authority to send people to countries that are not the country they came from — and not even a country they have some other meaningful tie to — but any other country the administration can find that will agree to take them.

And during their removal proceedings, because these are people who already had orders of removal — but not to this third country, like South Sudan — they never could have made arguments about how they shouldn’t have been sent to South Sudan. And these are folks from various places, including Southeast Asia — no connection to South Sudan, whatsoever.

The lower court carefully finds: We’re going to enjoin the administration from removing these people until there is some process afforded. You have to actually give some kind of notice and opportunity for people to object under guarantees against things like facing torture. And the Supreme Court, with not a word of reasoning, stays that lower court order and allows these third-country removals to go forward.

So the absolute, most obviously unconstitutional thing the Trump administration did upon coming back into office was eliminate birthright citizenship. It got stopped by the courts very quickly, and I think most people saw that as: You can’t walk into office and rewrite the Constitution.

There are lots of things both Democrats and Republicans might like to change in the Constitution. But there’s an amendment process. If you want to go through the amendment process, you are welcome to try.

A court immediately beats Trump back on that — and I think calls it grossly unconstitutional or something very similar. And then the Supreme Court does intervene. How so?

I was wondering what example you were going to give, and I totally agree. This is a Day 1 executive order that is flagrantly unconstitutional. The first sentence of the 14th Amendment confers citizenship on “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof”

It has never been seriously questioned that the 14th Amendment means what we have understood it to mean: People born here are citizens, full stop. The Supreme Court, in 1898 and a number of other cases, has confirmed what the text of the Constitution says pretty clearly. And yet on Day 1, he issues an executive order that flies in the face of all of that.

And you’re right, a number of lower courts quickly find the order is facially unconstitutional and enjoin it. And the administration runs to the Supreme Court, as it has in a number of these cases — but interestingly, not asking the court to review the merits of the lower court’s conclusions that the executive order is unconstitutional — but on the question of the scope of relief that these lower courts provided.

So they issued what are known as nationwide injunctions, basically saying: This executive order is unconstitutional, and the administration cannot apply it as such to anyone.

And what the administration came to the Supreme Court asking is for a ruling that those orders, these nationwide injunctions, exceed the scope of judicial authority.

This is a thing that has become very routine. Lower courts responding to actions by Republican and Democratic presidents alike in recent decades have issued these nationwide injunctions. There has been a lot of debate about whether many of them go too far —

Joe Biden’s solicitor general, at the end of Biden’s term, said: You all should look at this. Maybe we shouldn’t be doing this this way anymore.

As a policy matter, there is something democratically troubling about a policy process that results in some action, an executive order or something else that affects everybody. Presumably, the nation has participated in the choice of the person who is making that decision. And a single judge in, say, Amarillo, Texas, can grind that democratic process to a halt. There is something genuinely troubling about that.

So there’s been a serious debate, which I don’t want to downplay, about the constitutional foundations and the policy wisdom of courts’ single unelected judges having this power to grind to a halt an executive action.

Those are all important and fair debates. But I do think that it is telling that the Supreme Court was very uninterested in entertaining those arguments during the Biden administration. And yet, in the face of this executive order that is so clearly and wildly unconstitutional, this is the case in which they decided to take up the question: Do lower courts have this power?

And on the very last day of the Supreme Court term, in an opinion written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the court basically said: No, lower courts don’t have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions — it exceeds the scope of their power.

So that’s the world we live in now. Lower courts don’t have this tool — although they do have other tools.

So where does birthright citizenship stand?

Immediately, new lawsuits were filed in lower courts, challenging birthright citizenship, using a different device: class action. So get a group of people, define the people in that class here, people who would be covered by this executive order and were expecting to give birth.

Two lower courts have certified those classes and actually have ruled for them. So right now, there are lower court orders finding — again, using a different legal device — that this order is unconstitutional. And that will likely be back before the Supreme Court before too long.

I want to hold on the question of the nationwide injunction. On the one hand, it is a slightly wild remedy — and there are definitely places where it has been applied where I’ve disagreed. And on the other, if the Supreme Court works slowly — they have still, for instance, not ruled on the birthright citizenship question on its merits.

So if an administration wants to do something blatantly unconstitutional or that violates rights some other way, and the courts cannot stop it from happening nationwide, and it’s not really something you can attack in a class-action lawsuit — which is, I think, a little bit of a weird backdoor to go through — then what?

The courts are meant to be a check on an administration acting fundamentally unlawfully, but it seems like what the Roberts court decided is that they’re not going to be that check in that way.

Also, the executive can move so much faster than the courts — which has always been the thing the Trump administration has been exploiting. And it seems like the Roberts court watched this happening and said: Yes, the executive should just be able to exploit this.

There are a lot of things you can do that, once they’re done, you cannot reverse a year and a half later because the damage is done — the agency is gone, the people are gone, the harms have been committed. Having broken the egg, you can’t put the egg back together.

Right — the bell cannot be unrung. Yes, absolutely. I think the Supreme Court has, again, functionally allowed the administration to do a lot of irreversible damage through this order. This is the case that it decided, having seen what Trump was doing in his first couple of months in office, to essentially allow him to do all of that and more without the real prospect of lower courts acting as the kind of bulwark that they were in the early days of the administration.

Brett Kavanaugh writes a concurrence in which he sort of acknowledges the kind of dynamics that you’re talking about and says: If there are serious problems and something needs an emergency answer that applies nationwide, we, the Supreme Court, are in a position to step in and save that.

Oh, so they get discretion to do it.

Yes, exactly. They don’t even really explain why lower courts exceed their judicial authority if they issue these injunctions. But the Supreme Court can do it. I mean, there’s this weird passage in the opinion where Barrett says: We can speak, and everyone will listen.

And what she cites as support for that is a concession made by Trump’s solicitor general at the oral argument — like: We’ll listen to you if you tell us we can’t do something.

And it just feels just wildly debasing or something to say: We have all this power. And the thing that makes me know we have this power is that you’ve said you’ll listen to us. Not because you have to, but because you’ve decided out of discretion to tell us you will.

It’s a really strange passage, but that’s where we are.

Well, let’s say that, like me, you don’t quite buy into the idea that the Supreme Court applies politically neutral reasoning in all cases and is free from any partisan impulses or politics.

So you imagine: Well, all these new powers and new possibilities are being unlocked, and maybe the next Democratic president is going to want to use them. So maybe a Democratic version of what we’re looking at with the birthright citizenship case is: Maybe six months before an election, Democrats decide to pass a bill that regulates campaign spending in a way that would not be allowed under Citizens United or Buckley v. Valeo — the kind of strong campaign finance reform that many of us wish would pass.

And of course, maybe it won’t survive all the challenges, but — in a year when, say, Elon Musk is trying to spend $600 million to buy the election — the Supreme Court doesn’t move that fast, and Trump just showed that you get this kind of clock in which you can do anything.

So the Supreme Court, what it is saying is — it’s not saying that a Democrat can’t use that power. But the way I interpret what you just said is that a Democratic president can probably not use the muzzle velocity strategy of the Trump administration. Because the Supreme Court has reserved for itself in cases when it is aroused.

Absolutely. I’ll say a couple of things. One, the court says we can move quickly when we want to move quickly. John Roberts is proud of this.

They moved in a matter of weeks when the Colorado Supreme Court disqualified Trump from appearing on the Colorado ballot. They needed to get that decision out before Super Tuesday, and they did.

The TikTok ban they resolved in a matter of days.

They moved on Abrego Garcia fairly quickly.

Yes, they did. That’s true.

But then they can slow-walk when they want to. They slow-walked Trump’s challenge to Jack Smith’s actual indictment of Trump — even though Smith tried to fast-track that so we’d have an answer to whether he could stand trial well before the election. So I think it’s right that they can manipulate timing. Absolutely.

There’s also a substantive asymmetry — which is that it’s easier to move at muzzle velocity to break than to build.

If we’re thinking about a Democratic president, Democratic presidents like to build things. And I think it’s harder to do that by fiat without Congress. Not impossible — but it’s differently challenging than it is to break.

Although there may be some things next time that they’re going to want to break. Think about the ICE buildup and the construction of what certainly appears to me to be something becoming very close to a paramilitary force.

You could imagine the next Democratic president coming in and saying: I want this gone. This is out of control.

And it would seem under these powers that they don’t have to wait for Congress.

I agree with that. I would not rule out John Roberts and the other five trying to find a way to distinguish the Department of Education and U.S.A.I.D. from ICE.

But I think that on the law, a Democratic president would be squarely within the precedent set by the Supreme Court to do exactly what he has done, but with different agencies.

To back out for a minute: Think back to the Obama administration or Joe Biden. What power did they and their lawyers not think they had? What did they not think they could do that the Supreme Court has basically said you can do?

I mean, I think refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress. Remove heads of independent agencies protected by statute from summary firing. Fire civil servants without cause. Dismantle federal agencies. Call up the National Guard on the thinnest of pretexts. That’s a preliminary half-dozen powers.

Fundamentally, they didn’t think they had the power to disregard statutes passed by Congress and the text of the Constitution. And I don’t want to fetishize text — but also, just the practices under the Constitution.

They didn’t think they had the power to do things like treat the presidency as an office that permits its occupant to use the power of the state to reward friends and punish enemies and engage in self-dealing and enrichment. Those are not constitutional principles that are written down — they’re really about practices. And those administrations didn’t exercise those powers, but I don’t think they wanted to. I’m not sure any modern president has wanted to exercise these powers.

So that is a preliminary list, but I think it’s a long one.

Something I see in the Roberts court is an insistence on treating political actors, typically Republican political actors, with a level of generosity that requires ignoring huge amounts of things that they have said, done, written. So you end up with these two political systems: the one that is happening and the one that exists in legal filings to John Roberts.

You saw this, in a way, in Trump’s first term, as well, with the Muslim ban, where Trump and people around him had said extremely clearly what this was and why it was being done — and then they came up with a somewhat different legal rationale.

Roberts has this tendency to say: Ignore what’s in front of you, ignore what you’re being told, ignore what Trump’s appointees are saying on Fox News or in public — they say to us that there’s a national security rationale, and we have to assume that if the executive says there’s a national security rationale, there is. And this is an executive operating in good faith, attempting to carry out the laws and the Constitution as we understand them.

Question mark? [Laughs.]

Question mark, I guess. [Laughs.]

Yes, so Trump v. Hawaii — you have Trump on the campaign trail, and then doubling down once he’s inaugurated, basically saying: We’re going to institute a Muslim ban. Like, that’s what he was doing.

And yes, the court does describe some of the really virulently anti-Muslim statements that led up to the enactment of the ban. But then the court just credulously says: Well, this is basically a normal president behaving normally. He has said that there are these vetting deficiencies, and while presidents should do a better job of speaking on the most noble parts of our Constitution and our traditions, we’re not going to invalidate on the basis of these statements this proclamation issued by the president following regular order.

So you’re right — I think that the presumption of good faith and regularity is very much on display.

I will say, in the first Trump term, there were two cases in which that presumption of good faith actually didn’t carry the day. So Roberts writes an opinion, invalidating the effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. He also invalidates the effort to rescind the DACA program administratively. Both were basically because the administration either lied or didn’t really fully consider the implications of the courses of action that it was taking.

So those actually were important losses for Trump. And I’m not sure where John Roberts is right now.

This seems to me to get to the shadow docket problem. Because one thing that I read the Supreme Court doing is functionally chastising a lot of lower courts and saying: You’ve gotten ahead of yourselves. You are issuing these sweeping rulings based on these reads of what you think the Trump administration is doing or is going to do, and you are not giving the executive enough deference.

It’s very hard for me to see what this court has done and not feel like John Roberts and his Republican colleagues feel that the big threat that they’ve really had to step in to intercede on is not the executive branch overreaching but the judicial branch overreaching.

Yes.

They seem much more concerned about lower courts stopping Donald Trump from doing things that are, again, facially unconstitutional or illegal, than about Donald Trump doing things that are unconstitutional or illegal.

It has just struck me as a strange priority set.

I agree. And it’s especially hard to justify what they have communicated — and I think you’re right about what they’re communicating about the lower courts. If you’ve actually followed the proceedings in any of these cases, these are judges who really are trying very hard to accommodate and defer where appropriate to the executive branch.

Many of them are Republican-appointed judges.

Every president, including first-term President Trump, has appointed judges who have ruled against Trump in all kinds of cases — I think it’s over 100 lower court rulings against the Trump administration — appointed by presidents of both parties, essentially in district courts in every circuit in the country.

So this is not like Obama and Biden appointees trying to thwart the policy priorities of the Trump administration. That’s just not remotely a fair characterization of what the lower courts are doing. They’re just doing their jobs.

And I have to imagine that they are pretty incensed by the way that the Supreme Court seems to be treating them — again, just trying to do their best to resolve the disputes that come before them.

The administration is violating the law. It’s kind of that simple.

It just has this quality, to me, of weaponized naïveté.

Yes.

I mean, there’s a famous Federalist Paper that says: If men were angels, we wouldn’t need all this government. And I read the Supreme Court as saying repeatedly: Let’s first assume Donald Trump is an angel, and then let’s work from there.

Yes.

When we were doing episodes on this a couple of months ago, one of the big concerns was a constitutional crisis. The Supreme Court saying: You have to do X. The Trump administration saying: Make us. And then who knows where we are.

One explanation I’ve heard from some people, more positively toward John Roberts, is that he is trying to avoid that scenario. Partially, everything is on the shadow docket because we’re not really seeing him upend all this precedent.

We’re seeing him back down from a fight — and maybe in some way cowardice is the better part of valor here. Do you buy that?

I can’t rule it out as a possibility. Now what exactly he’s keeping his powder dry for, I don’t know.

The Democratic president. [Laughs.]

[Laughs.] Exactly. Maybe that’s right.

I do think that conserving institutional capital is one explanation. They are handing him this series of wins that they don’t think are big, broad wins, and they’re continuing to be heeded — Abrego Garcia did come back, individuals at CECOT were sent to Venezuela. They have not been defied. So maybe it has worked in some fashion.

But we have to also consider the possibility that John Roberts, who has always had a very expansive conception of executive power and is on board with a lot of the substantive policy priorities of the Trump administration, is actually just fine with what we are seeing emanate from the executive branch and from the White House.

I thought he cared enough, honestly, about the basic structures of our constitutional democracy that he would not want to co-sign its destruction. I’m not sure there’s that much evidence of that right now. But it’s early.

You do see these two visions of John Roberts at war with each other in legal commentary.

There’s one of Roberts as the court’s moderate institutionalist figure. Somebody whose primary concern is maintaining the court’s independence, its credibility, its strength. Somebody who seemed to want to be in the middle of the Dobbs decision and on different things has not gone all the way to the right.

Then there’s this other vision of him. In a recent piece for The Atlantic, the N.Y.U. law professor Peter Shane argued that Trump is just executing the presidency that John Roberts has built over not a series of shadow docket rulings but a series of huge rulings that he authored — rulings on immunity, rulings on the Voting Rights Act, rulings on the Muslim ban in Trump’s first term. And that John Roberts has been building the structure of this quasi-dictatorial executive for some time now, and Trump is just stepping into the office that Roberts has designed for him.

So, going backward, what are the rulings that maybe fit that pattern? And how much do you buy that idea?

There is a lot to that theory of what is driving John Roberts. I think that you’re right about the two different John Roberts. We are basically 20 years to the day almost that John Roberts was nominated to be the chief justice.

He joins the court in ’05, and in ’06 and ’07 you see some breadcrumbs. Roberts is skeptical of limits on money in elections under the First Amendment — and those breadcrumbs that Roberts dropped then come to fruition in Citizens United.

The Shelby County case, in 2013, strikes down the part of the preclearance regime of the Voting Rights Act that required the states in the former Confederacy to get the federal government to sign off before they changed anything with respect to their voting practices.

That’s a 2013 opinion that Roberts writes, but actually there are seeds of that in his earlier writings in a 2009 case, also expressing some doubts about the Voting Rights Act. And you can trace those doubts all the way back to his time as a young Reagan Justice Department staffer. He has been skeptical of the Voting Rights Act for a long time.

He authors the immunity decision that is, I think, a wildly wrong decision handing expansive immunity to ex-presidents for basically everything they do while president within their official capacities.

But that is an opinion that is very hard to square with another opinion that he wrote in this case, Trump v. Vance, where Trump was trying to get out of responding to a subpoena from the Manhattan D.A., who had actually subpoenaed financial institutions holding his records. Roberts, in that 2020 opinion, writes in pretty sweeping terms about how presidents are not kings.

So those are two different John Roberts. I can’t at all, as I sit here, square him having seen Trump in office once and deciding it’s really important for us to hold the line on presidents not being kings — and then him deciding at the outset, before Trump was even returning to office, to allow presidents to essentially function as kings, and then also announcing that federal courts can’t intervene in partisan gerrymandering, which is another Roberts opinion.

So you have to pull a lot of threads together. But I do think that expansive authority for both the Supreme Court and the president and limited authority for all other actors, agencies, lower courts and Congress is as good of a distillation of Roberts’ philosophy as I could offer 20 years in.

I want to zone in on the gerrymandering cases for a minute.

We’re having this showdown right now where Trump has pushed Texas and possibly other red states to do very aggressive partisan gerrymandering. We may see California and maybe some other blue states trying to counter it.

But this is the world John Roberts built for us: What Trump is doing is what John Roberts allowed him to do. What Texas is doing is what John Roberts allowed them to do.

Tell me a bit about that case.

Sure. So that’s Rucho v. Common Cause, a case in which the Supreme Court — after equivocating over a number of years and decades about what kinds of limits the Constitution places on the ability to engage in extreme partisan gerrymanders — said definitively: The Constitution has nothing to say about this.

And it is kind of rich having taken this very active role in striking down a lot of what Congress has done with respect to trying to regulate money in elections and a very active role in striking down part of, and maybe more to come, of the Voting Rights Act.

So the court is very active in really creating the terms in which our democracy is waged. And then when it comes to these challenges to partisan gerrymanders, there are very clear arguments that there have to be some limits in the ability of a party in power to further entrench itself in power. The question has always been: Well, what exactly are the limits that courts could announce and then enforce?

And in this Rucho case, the court says: No, there are no judicially discernible or manageable standards. Essentially, gerrymandering just needs to be resolved in the political process, which is not going to happen because by definition —

It needs to be electorally resolved now that you have distorted the elections.

Yes, totally. And the court does say maybe state courts resolving challenges to gerrymanders under state constitutions could be a solution — or independent redistricting commissions. And, of course, some states have taken that up.

But I think if federal courts are supposed to do anything, it really should be to make sure that the mechanisms of democracy work so that federal courts can get out of the way and really just let the people and their choices run the show. And the Supreme Court’s refusal to intervene here makes all that very, very difficult.

What can Trump do now? We are so early in the second term. But as these powers seem to expand — and if you’re Stephen Miller or Russ Vought sitting in the White House and you see the kind of record you’re racking up at the Supreme Court — what seems like it’s on the table in terms of executive aggression that, if I had asked you five or six months ago, you would have said is not really on the table?

I suppose they could try more seriously to remove federal judges. There are articles of impeachment that they’ve introduced against a couple of district judges who have ruled against them. Those haven’t gone anywhere.

They could try to undertake a serious effort to actually target the judiciary in a different way. I think anything is on the table in terms of the midterm elections. Future elections are probably what I would identify.

I’ve heard the scholar Kim Lane Scheppele say this a few times: The best way to understand if you’re still in a democracy is not the last election but the next one. What does the next election look like?

And so I do think the midterm elections will be really important. And honestly, I would say that six months ago, I don’t think that a third-term-seeking Trump would have been on the table. The 22nd Amendment is, if anything, even clearer than the first sentence of the 14th Amendment: He cannot run for or serve a third term.

Yet I don’t think he’s joking when he talks about doing it.

You think it’s possible?

Yes, I do.

I’ve sort of pushed it into the not-possible category.

I wouldn’t rule anything out. How the Supreme Court would get around the clear text of the 22nd Amendment, I don’t know. But I thought Section 3 of the 14th Amendment was actually pretty clear, too.

So we can have the Obama-Trump showdown that all American politics has been leading to for so long? It’s the true “Avengers: Endgame” of American politics.

Only Trump can run again, actually. [Laughs.] It’s only nonconsecutive terms.

The Republican House member who introduced legislation to try to make this possible did try to keep Obama out. [Laughs.]

I don’t love voicing this, Ezra, but I don’t think we can rule it out.

The election piece is the really dangerous piece. You look at the redistricting effort right now. That is what democratic backsliding is.

These are people who have been arrested trying to be there at ICE raids — or press conferences, in Padilla’s case.

Yes, Democratic officials — the opposition party’s elected officials being arrested. Trump having his goons target Letitia James, the attorney general of New York. And now it seems like there’s some targeting of a Democratic appointee to the Federal Reserve, Lisa Cook, based on some mortgage issue that they’re claiming needs to be looked into. Adam Schiff, as well.

That’s targeting the political opposition for the substance of their views. I don’t think they will announce that they’re targeting critics because they have criticized. I think they will manufacture some justification — mortgage fraud or whatever. But I think that is something we absolutely have to view as within the realm of the possible.

Whatever John Roberts wants in his self-conception, I think it’s fair to say he doesn’t imagine himself to be the handmaiden of the death of American democracy.

So what is your steel-man version of Roberts? What would he say listening to this podcast about how we’re just hysterical liberals?

He was forged in the cauldron of the early conservative legal movement in the 1980s and the Reagan Justice Department. And they all thought the Warren Court had gone too far, that it had made up rights the Constitution doesn’t confer — and that his court is offering a necessary corrective with respect to how we understand the Constitution, and that it’s also reallocating power.

I think he does think that the right reading of the Constitution is one that gives the president really expansive authority.

I think it’s a pretty ahistorical and incorrect reading of the nature of the presidency and how it was designed as an office. But I do think that he holds the view that the president possesses enormous power and it is up to the court to properly protect the exercise of that power against whatever threats might exist — whether those are lower courts or independent agencies, or even Congress. Again, I think that’s wrong, but I do think that those are genuinely held views.

It is possible that he understands that Trump will make increasingly aggressive assertions of power and maybe the court will be able to stop him and be heeded if it has built up enough institutional capital with the right people in the early days of the Trump administration. I don’t really think that the evidence supports that thesis as much as it does others, but I can’t rule it out.

I also think people are scared of crossing Donald Trump. I don’t know that John Roberts is, but I also don’t know that’s not at all a factor — that people don’t want to be the target of his ire on social media and elsewhere, and that staying in his good graces is something that John Roberts thinks is in his own interest — but also long-term in the institutional interest of the Supreme Court.

How much do you understand what is happening here as simple partisanship?

There are six members of the Supreme Court who are, to a greater or lesser degree, highly oriented toward Donald Trump. You have Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, who, if they could be out there in a MAGA hat, functionally would be. Roberts, like a lot of Republicans, probably has mixed feelings but has moved closer to Trump rather than farther over the years.

How much is all this talking about statute and unitary executive theory just politics by a slightly more complex set of textual argumentation?

The answer is probably different if you’re asking about Alito or Thomas, for whom I think this really is just partisanship.

I think with the others, it is more mixed. They are genuinely committed to a substantive division of both the presidency and the nation that aligns reasonably well with Trump’s.

I don’t assume they have a lot of personal affection for Donald Trump. I actually think for Roberts, he probably doesn’t — although I don’t know that.

But I have long resisted — and I’m finding it harder to resist — really reductive, partisan explanations for their conduct — in particular, all they have done to shore up his presidency in the dark of night, where they are not going to be held accountable by the public for doing it.

I think there is a lot of additional evidence that they really just are partisan justices in support of Donald Trump.

It gets to a broader question that I’ve been struggling with for many years, in many ways, going back before Trump. But it feels like it is getting worse and worse and more and more serious — which is that we just don’t seem to be in a functioning constitutional system.

You go back to the framing of all this, and there’s an expectation that these branches will check each other — that Congress will jealously guard its prerogatives, the executive and the courts. But what you end up having is a Republican court that seems to not want to guard against executive overreach. You have a Republican Congress that has become completely quiescent. And even when it is not a Republican Congress — this is true when it’s a Democrat in power too because of the filibuster and other things — Congress in general is not able to act as a full branch.

We’ve known for many decades that we have an expanding amount of executive power, but we just seem to have been pushed into breakdown. Congress is fine with it because it’s Republicans who are cowed by Trump. And now you have John Roberts basically saying it’s not the court’s job to step in to stop an out-of-control executive.

I don’t know what to call that except a breakdown. I’m curious if you think that’s either too alarmist or wrong on the facts somehow.

No, I don’t. I think that constitutional breakdown, constitutional collapse — I don’t think that it’s irreparable. I don’t think we are beyond some point of no return. But I don’t think our constitutional order is functioning properly at the moment, and I think the Supreme Court bears a lot of responsibility.

What would it look like to try to fix any of this?

There is a divide among legal scholars between reforming the Supreme Court or just radically disempowering the Supreme Court, and I have sympathy for both positions. But I actually think that any kind of court reform has to be paired with meaningful democratic reform. Court reform itself won’t actually get us very far.

So things like eliminating the filibuster, D.C. statehood, maybe expanding the size of the House, actually meaningful voting rights legislation that will do things like end gerrymandering and restore much of what the court has already dismantled — and may be further poised to dismantle — of the Voting Rights Act.

I think that all those things are important. And I also think really limiting the powers of the president — some by statute and maybe some by constitutional amendment — because so much of the presidency has been governed by norms and not hard law.

Big democracy reform, of which court reform is a part, would have to be at the top of the agenda for any future Democratic president.

The fundamental deformity of our entire system is it doesn’t take parties seriously. This is a problem in a lot of the Supreme Court rulings. They say there is a remedy, and that remedy is called impeachment.

And it’s true that impeachment exists. But it’s also true that we functionally know impeachment is now impossible. And that has been true for some time.

If you wanted to do anything, I think you’d have to come to the view that parties are part of the constitutional system. They’re part of our political system. They’re fundamental institutions. And maybe they need to be balanced — Buttigieg talked about this at one point. You can imagine a court that just balanced parties, and so it would have that credibility.

But in this world, you have a system that was never designed for parties, that we know is deformed by parties, and we’re just going to wait until one party or the other truly breaks it.

[Laughs.] It’s a crazy risk we’re running.

I think it is absolutely right that there are a number of really profound flaws in our constitutional design, and one of them is just the failure of the framers to account for the virtually simultaneous rise of parties with the ratification of the Constitution.

The rise of parties happens almost immediately, and nothing in the document accounts for it — nor have any of our amendment efforts since then done anything to meaningfully reflect that reality back.

The co-partisanship across the executive branch and the legislative branch overtaking institutional self-interest obviously very much predates Trump. But the current fever pitch has everything to do with Trump.

And I do think the question is: Is this the new normal or not?

Always our final question: What are three books you’d recommend to the audience?

Since we were talking about whether these justices are really just partisans in robes, I have to recommend my podcast co-host Leah Litman’s book “Lawless,” which is a very accessible and pretty scathing indictment of the Roberts court — and a full-throated defense of the thesis that the Republican justices, as she calls them, are just partisans in robes. So I recommend that one.

I was on vacation recently and read Gary Shteyngart‘s new novel, “Vera, or Faith,” which is a fun near-future dystopia but has a constitutional amendment story line.

You must have been thrilled.

I really was. I was not expecting it. It’s dark but really, really smart. So I recommend that.

And on the topic of constitutional amendments, I’m reading a galley of Jill Lepore’s — the brilliant Harvard historian. Her new book, “We the People,” is about constitutional amendment.

If we think that the lack of anticipation of parties in the Constitution is one real design flaw, another one is that Article V, the way you amend the Constitution, is just way, way too hard.

That’s related to polarization, obviously. But it’s very hard to amend the Constitution today because of supermajorities in both houses, supermajority ratification in the states. But having lost the habit of constitutional amendment in muscle memory is just enormously problematic, and an unamendable document is not one we can continue to be governed by.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/02/opinion/02eks-shaw-image/02eks-shaw-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 13:57:18.164145

ET: This article was updated with remarks from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.","Judge Charles Breyer ruled Tuesday that President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles over the summer is illegal and ""violated"" a nearly 150-year-old federal law.

Newsweek reached out to the White House and the U.S. Department of Defense via email for comment.

Why It Matters

The ruling comes as contention builds nationally around the conversation of crime, illegal immigration and the federal government's willingness to deploy and use the National Guard in places including Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., with cities like Chicago also being threatened.

California Governor Gavin Newsom is deploying state police officers to places like San Francisco, which Trump previously mentioned as a possible future deployment area for federal troops.

Up to 1,700 National Guard troops could soon be deployed in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming to aid with ICE efforts, Fox News reported last week, citing documents and unnamed Pentagon officials.

The Trump administration reportedly stated that such efforts have no relation to the ongoing crime crackdown in the nation's capital.

What To Know

Breyer's ruling on Tuesday in the Northern District of California, granting an injunction, cites Congress's passage of the Posse Comitatus Act in 1878, which prohibits the use of the U.S. military to execute domestic law. In June, the judge oversaw a three-day trial in a case brought about by Newsom challenging Trump's use of Title 10 to deploy troops to Los Angeles.

""Nearly 140 years later, Defendants—President Trump, Secretary of Defense [Pete] Hegseth, and the Department of Defense—deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, ostensibly to quell a rebellion and ensure that federal immigration law was enforced,"" Breyer wrote.

""There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence. Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.""

Breyer also wrote in the 52-page ruling that nearly three months after National Guard troops were first deployed to Los Angeles, 300 National Guard members remain stationed there.

""Moreover, President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country—including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California—thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,"" he said.

Last week, Newsom announced that he dispatched California Highway Patrol ""crime suppression teams"" to multiple major regions, including Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, the Inland Empire and the Central Valley, as his administration contrasted the state-led deployments with Trump's unilateral use of federal forces in U.S. cities.

Who Is Judge Charles Breyer?

Breyer, 83, is a senior U.S. district judge for the Northern District of California. From 2018 to 2022, he served as chairman of the United States Sentencing Commission.

Breyer was an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force from August 1973 to November 1974, prior to entering private practice in San Francisco from 1974 to 1997. He briefly served as chief assistant district attorney of the City and County of San Francisco in 1979.

On July 24, 1997, President Bill Clinton nominated Breyer for a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on November 8, 1997.

Appeals Could Reach U.S. Supreme Court

Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek that the ruling was somewhat unexpected, considering that a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit had previously overruled Breyer and said that Trump lawfully federalized the California National Guard under a different statute, Title 10, rather than the 10 U.S.C. § 12406 statute.

""[Breyer's] trying to pigeonhole it through a different statute,"" Rahmani said. ""Historically, presidents have a lot of leeway when it comes to law enforcement; the executive branch [does] in general. In this particular case, Trump relied on a different statute...I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up in the Supreme Court. It's a pretty important issue.""

Trump's ambitions to deploy troops to other states could still take place while any appeals for a stay could be filed by the Department of Justice, Rahmani added.

""You can very well have judges that have completely different rulings in different states, in which case you'd have these circuit splits and the Supreme Court would have to weigh in,"" he said.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump, Tuesday on Truth Social: ""At least 54 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, 8 people were killed...Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, & soon. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

California Governor Gavin Newsom, Tuesday on X: ""The ruling is clear: Trump is breaking the law by trying to create a national police force with himself as its chief.""

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass on X: ""I applaud the court for today's important ruling. The White House tried to invade the second largest city in the country. That's illegal. Los Angeles will not buckle and we will not break. We will not be divided and we will not be defeated.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said before signing an executive order on Saturday: ""We may see militarized immigration enforcement. We may also see National Guard troops. We may even see active duty military and armed vehicles in our streets. We have not called for this. Our people have not asked for this, but nevertheless, we find ourselves having to respond to this.""

What Happens Next

Breyer froze the injunction until noon on September 12, which could provide the Trump administration with time to challenge the ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration's struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors - usually a parent or guardian - are properly vetted.

The memo said sponsors must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says ""federal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.""

Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a ""built-in opportunity"" to arrest parents - something she said has already happened.

Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child under the age of 12 who had shown up for an identification check. ""As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,"" Miller Flowers said.

Desai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don't already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates ""clearly and proactively"" with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won't influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.

""The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,"" it said in a statement.

However, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.

""We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,"" she said.

Trump administration points to Biden

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under President Joe Biden's administration.

A federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden's administration struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.

Another recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.

The agency said it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don't understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.

""If we don't understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?"" said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.

Jennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.

""It seems like it's designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,"" she said.

String of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process

The July changes are among a series of steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.

The administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home where children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.

About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.

Shaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.

""The agency's mission has been conflated and entangled,"" she added. ""It seems ORR's mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they're not an immigration enforcement entity.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15837093_012525-wls-ice-file-clean-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-02 12:00:09.774071

The pair on Monday both addressed a Politico report on Friday saying the Trump administration is preparing ""an immigration enforcement blitz"" in Boston in the coming weeks. The report cited unnamed current and former administration sources, and NBC News has yet to confirm it.

But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked about the report on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, and did not deny she was planning an expansion to other cities, including Boston.

""I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now and so we haven't taken anything off the table,"" she said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not responded to requests for comment from NBC10 Boston.

Asked about the report Monday, at the city's first Labor Day Parade, Wu elaborated on a statement she released about earlier in the weekend.

“Groceries are becoming more expensive, housing is harder to build, and all of this connected to a federal administration that is targeting the very people who built our country and our cities,"" the mayor said.

Healey said the president should be sending funding, not troops: ""I think it's disrespectful to local and state law enforcement, who work hard every day. And what we need from the Trump administration is funding for cops, funding for community policing, funding for law enforcement.""

Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, has previously vowed to “flood the zone in Boston” with federal immigration enforcement.

Tensions between Wu and the Trump administration came to a head earlier this month when the Justice Department sent letters to Boston and other sanctuary jurisdictions demanding they end the immigration protections. They threatened to cut off federal funding and prosecute officials if the cities didn’t comply.

In response, Wu held a press conference with local leaders where she called on Trump to ""stop attacking our cities.""

""We will not back down,"" she said. ""This is not the first time I've made it clear that our residents expect us to take care of our city. We know how to take care of our neighbors here in Boston without the interference, coersion, intimidation, bullying or threats from the federal government.""

Two federal law enforcement officials told NBC News earlier this week that multiple federal agencies, including ICE and Border Patrol, will soon ""surge manpower"" to Chicago to increase arrests of undocumented immigrants, and that similar operations were planned in other so-called “sanctuary cities.”

Healey has called the use of national guards to supplement immigration enforcement ""political theater"" that ""does nothing to improve public safety,"" On Thursday, she joined the nation's other Democratic governors in a statement calling for an end to the president's attempts to deploy states' national guards.

""Every American deserves to feel safe in their neighborhood and community. But instead of actually addressing crime, President Trump cut federal funding for law enforcement that states rely on and continues to politicize our military by trying to undermine the executive authority of Governors as Commanders in Chief of their state’s National Guard,"" the 19 governors wrote.

They called deploying the National Guard without its governor's consent ""an alarming abuse of power"" and ""chaotic federal interference.""",https://media.nbcboston.com/2024/03/boston-sunrise-generic.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C624px%2C5976px%2C3362px&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-09-02 12:57:50.897060

But this isn’t a story from modern-day America, a situation constantly held up as a horrific example of government overreach at the cost of the most vulnerable in society. This is our Australian government.

This isn’t an aberration, or a response to extraordinary circumstances. This is a pattern.

Last year, the Labor government introduced three brutal migration bills which struck fear into the heart of the community and tarnished Australia’s reputation on human rights on the global stage.

Now that fig leaf has been stripped away, leaving only the shocking reality of a disregard for human rights, human safety and human dignity.

The government was quick to condemn this weekend’s marches, to call for calm and unity, and to bolster its perceived image as an administration for all Australians. But again, this offered only a brief respite from its own inhumane choices.

Actions speak far louder than words, and this government’s actions are telling us all we need to know.

They are telling us that this will not end with a certain cohort of people. There is no line in the sand, no depths to which this government will not sink. This is not hyperbole. This is proven reality.

They are telling us that the safety of those who have fled unimaginable danger in the search of a new home, a new community, a new start can no longer rely on the cornerstones of fairness, justice and equity.

They are telling us that, while they spin lines about multiculturalism and cohesion, with these laws they are willing to bend a knee to the worst of the toxic and hate-filled tendencies this country can possibly demonstrate.

They are telling us that the bedrock of our country – that our laws and rules apply equally, no matter where you were born – has collapsed beneath us.

We must not watch in shock and sadness. We must fight for human rights. Not just for those in the firing line of these policies. But for the Australia we wish to see.

An Australia where people like me can arrive as an unaccompanied minor, orphaned by war and having grown up in a Ugandan refugee camp, and rise to contribute to my adopted home.

Where the neighbours, church, teachers and community members who supported and welcomed me and many others are treated as the example, not the exception.

Where a fair go applies to all.

It is clear that a vote for such values does not deliver them. We must stand up for human rights, and make clear enough is enough. Together, we can turn the tide towards a true compassionate nation.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74956100833fd78f656145c96bcb7a320150d38f/78_0_5078_4063/master/5078.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4244dfb68208a64427db4cedea748950",N,,2025-09-02 10:56:30.252972

Conversely, Senator Cory Booker and New York lawmakers propose the VISIBLE Act, requiring ICE agents to remove masks and wear clear identification.","The digital battlefield in America’s immigration enforcement landscape is escalating. In mid‑2025, Netherlands‑based activist Dominick Skinner launched ICE List to publish names, social media links, and photos of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

Skinner called it an “accountability project.” In a few short months, the platform has swelled from about 50 profiles to over 200 ICE personnel exposed. Thousands of tips pour in daily, often from anonymous sources or insiders, fueling rapid expansion.

Skinner isn’t alone. Inspired individuals and networks across the country have embraced grassroots tools. Sherman Austin, a California engineer, raised nearly $25,000 for Stop ICE Raids Alerts, which turns user-submitted photos or videos into instant text updates. “Ice agents appear to be staying at a Four Points Sheraton in Rancho Cucamonga,” read one.

The messages sparked immediate calls to “make noise,” or “no sleep for ICE.” Meanwhile, Boston’s LUCE Immigrant Justice Network fields tips on Nextdoor and dispatches volunteers to assist undocumented individuals or document enforcement activity.

Federal authorities have taken notice. Attorney General Pam Bondi warned the creator of ICEBlock, an app that maps sightings of ICE agents, to “watch out,” alleging it broadcasts law enforcement locations to criminals. In retaliation, website hosting for ICE List was dropped by Bluehost after two weeks. Skinner relaunches his site every time it goes offline.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s deportation machinery is surging. TRAC data shows that as of July 27, ICE held nearly 57,000 people in detention. A striking 71 percent of them had no criminal conviction. The use of ankle monitors, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C., is rising, part of a broader shift toward tighter surveillance.

At the same time, ICE’s own use of AI is ramping up. A new $30 million deal with Palantir is supposed to deliver prototype software called ImmigrationOS this month, intended to help ICE identify, track, and deport individuals. The system continues through 2027, raising deep concerns about due process and surveillance reach.

According to Amnesty International, through Palantir’s ImmigrationOS and Babel Street’s Babel X, ICE is deploying AI to monitor migrants, especially under programs like “Catch and Revoke,” which revokes visas based on social media and other data cues.

Such tools synthesize data from government and private sources to assign threat assessments and sentiment scores, particularly targeting international students and marginalized communities.

As both sides saturate the digital and real-world environments with surveillance tools and countermeasures, activists have now turned AI against ICE agents themselves.

Skinner’s ICE List project uses machine learning to reconstruct masked faces in footage if 35 percent or more of a face is visible, and volunteers cross-check resulting synthetic images via reverse image search tools like PimEyes to identify agents.

Of these AI-enabled identifications, Skinner acknowledges roughly 60 percent are incorrect, but believes “public accountability” overshadow concerns over errors or risk.

ICE officials claim masking is essential for agent safety, citing threats from transnational gangs and mounting assaults. Agents have taken to wearing masks and adopting countersurveillance tactics after learning that their identities may be exposed during raids.

One Boston‑based official said protesters yelled warnings to immigrants and even slashed a tire during a courthouse arrest, forcing agents to abandon a pending operation.

The neuroscience of technology and anonymity is fueling legislation. Senator Marsha Blackburn introduced the Protecting Law Enforcement from Doxxing Act which aims to criminalize publishing a federal officer’s name with intent to obstruct enforcement.

Conversely, Senator Cory Booker and New York lawmakers propose the VISIBLE Act, requiring ICE agents to remove masks and wear clear identification. Critics of masking legislation argue it may compromise investigations, especially against undercover operations or transnational crime threats.

Ultimately, this digital clash pits two forces: ICE’s increasing reliance on AI-driven surveillance for enforcement, including Palantir’s data integration and Babel X’s sentiment scanning, and activists wielding the same tools to identify agents, map operations, and broadcast their presence.

On one hand, the government’s deportation strategy has grown to unprecedented levels. In July alone, deportation flights reached a record high of 1,214, many cloaked with dummy call signs or hidden tail numbers. Activists compensating by setting up tarmac cameras and open-source tracking represent a broader pushback against opaque federal actions.

On the other hand, while agencies train and equip under secrecy, activists frame exposure and transparency as the only recourse for oppressed populations. The ICE List, Stop ICE Alerts, ICEBlock, ICE Tea Watch, and related campaigns present themselves as defenders of human rights; ICE decries them as hazards to officer safety and effective law enforcement.

Courts and Congress have yet to catch up, offering only partial protections or modest bills.

The broader question now is not just about ethics or legality, but about the future of surveillance and resistance. If both sides can be tracked, mapped, and unmasked, what does accountability look like? While ICE increases its grip using AI platforms like ImmigrationOS, activists turn that same tech into a tool for citizen oversight.

Merivale was contacted for comment after the complaint was lodged but did not respond by deadline.
It comes after the Herald spoke with seven people who accused Merivale of refusing them entry to the eatery on August 3 unless they took off their keffiyehs.
The Herald observed multiple groups being turned back by security while wearing keffiyehs during a 20-minute window on the CCTV footage.
“This complaint is a critical step in challenging discriminatory practices and ensuring that businesses are held accountable for their actions,” she said.","A national community legal service has filed a complaint to the Australian Human Rights Commission against Merivale on behalf of six people who allege to have been turned away at a Middle Eastern restaurant for wearing Palestinian headscarves after the Harbour Bridge protest.

On Friday, the Racial Justice Centre filed a complaint under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) to the commission representing six Palestinian complainants who it claims were discriminated against at Merivale restaurant Jimmy’s Falafel.

The complaint alleges that Merivale’s Jimmy’s Falafel – which describes itself as “a little piece of the Middle East in Sydney’s CBD” – engaged in “indirect racial discrimination and racial vilification by enforcing a policy that required the complainants to remove their keffiyehs, traditional Palestinian scarves, as a condition of entry”.

Merivale was contacted for comment after the complaint was lodged but did not respond by deadline.

It comes after the Herald spoke with seven people who accused Merivale of refusing them entry to the eatery on August 3 unless they took off their keffiyehs. Merivale initially denied the allegations but later said a management decision to ban people carrying or displaying flags and placards inside the venue was imposed for a 20-minute window.

The ban was said to have taken effect between 3.55pm and 4.15pm for the safety of Merivale employees after “many instances of rogue members of the public walking past the Ivy venues on George Street yelling obscenities and violent rhetoric into our venues”.

Police estimated at least 90,000 pro-Palestine protesters walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on August 3. Organisers say they estimated up to 300,000 people took part.

Merivale footage without audio, seen by the Herald, showed two people yelling towards the restaurant from the footpath, with another person raising two middle fingers. According to Merivale, passers-by shouted “death to the IDF”, “death to all Zionist pigs” and “f---ing Zionist pigs and scum” towards Jimmy’s.

Merivale said its staff understood its decision to include “political items of clothing” in the ban and they asked people wanting to dine in to “remove those items [or] place them in their bags before entering”.

The Herald observed multiple groups being turned back by security while wearing keffiyehs during a 20-minute window on the CCTV footage.

Keffiyeh designs differ among Middle Eastern nations. The Palestinian version is typically worn to show solidarity with Gazans.

The complaint alleged that the six people “left the restaurant feeling shocked, humiliated and distressed”. They are seeking “an apology, financial compensation and anti-racism training for Merivale staff”.

The lead complainant of the claim, who requested to remain anonymous, told the Herald she wanted to hold Merivale accountable for what she alleges is its discriminatory policy.

“Initially I was confused because this restaurant serves falafels and other dishes that are traditional to my Palestinian heritage … I was singled out and treated as a security threat because of my cultural garment,” she said.

“I was forced to choose between publicly expressing my cultural identity and accessing a public space. This incident has exacerbated my ongoing grief at witnessing my extended family be subjected to the most extreme forms of racial discrimination in Palestine.”

Racial Justice Centre executive director Sarah Ibrahim said she hopes this claim sends the message that all forms of racism have no place in society.

Asylum and immigration – briefing note

Posted by: Home Office news team, Posted on: - Categories: Fact sheet

This briefing note was issued following the Home Secretary's Oral Statement on 1 September to aid reporting.

UK-France Treaty

On 5 August, the UK-France Returns Agreement came into immediate effect following the signing of the treaty by the UK and French Interior Ministers.

This treaty enables the return of small boat arrivals from the UK to France, with an equal number of individuals eligible to come to the UK through a new legal route.

This is a pilot scheme which has the potential to undermine the business model of criminal gangs, while doing our bit to support genuine refugees. The more we prove the concept at the outset, the better we will be able to develop and grow it.

Returns to France are expected later this month.

International Cooperation

Thanks to agreements between Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau during their February visit to northern France, crucial new action is being taken to strengthen enforcement against small boats:

The deployment of over 70 Compagnie de Marche specialist officers has been extended and will continue to mobilise to increase patrols along the French coast.

Earlier this year, the UK and France agreed to reinforce the dual-powered intelligence unit stationed in Dunkirk to investigate and prosecute criminal gangs, enabling more effective investigations and faster convictions of people-smugglers.

For the first time, new maritime arrangements will enable French authorities to intercept small boats in shallow waters off the French coast, preventing them from continuing their dangerous journey across the Channel. We expect to be starting in coming weeks.

The government has also signed new agreements with Western Balkans countries and Germany to strengthen laws and intelligence sharing against people smuggling and signed various returns agreements with countries such as Iraq.

We have signed an Anti-Smuggling Action Plan with other G7 nations, hosted over 40 countries from across the world at the Border Security Summit on Organised Immigration Crime in London and launched a new international communications campaign to debunk people smugglers’ lies.

We are intensifying our collaboration with our European partners, including through the Calais Group of Interior Ministers, by exploring innovative measures to dismantle the business models of the criminal smuggling gangs and robustly deter these illegal journeys.

The number of Vietnamese nationals arriving by small boat in January to June 2025 was less than half the number in the equivalent period of 2024. This is a testament to our close international relationship with Vietnam, which is enhancing intelligence sharing between law enforcement to disrupt criminal networks along the route. This, alongside our international deterrent campaign, is debunking lies and myths peddled by vile people smugglers.

Secured agreement from Germany that it will change its laws making it a criminal offence to facilitate the smuggling of migrants to the UK and giving German prosecutors more tools to tackle the supply and storage of small boat equipment in warehouses.

Returns & Enforcement

We have returned over 35,000 people with no right to be in the UK— including a 28% increase in returns of failed asylum seekers.

Increased illegal working visits by 48% and arrests by 42%, with employers facing fines of up to £60,000 per illegal worker.

Agreed a new partnership with Uber Eats, and Deliveroo, maximising information sharing opportunities to tackle illegal working abuse in the food delivery sector.

Introduced new legislation to deport foreign criminals earlier and expanded the ‘Deport now, Appeal later’ scheme.

Detention capacity is being expanded with 1,000 new beds at Campsfield and Haslar sites, with the first beds going live by the end of the year enabling increased removals.

National Crime Agency

Along with the Border Security Command, the NCA are delivering rapid, intense and targeted multi-agency enforcement action to target UK-based OIC criminals. This includes an Immigration Enforcement led intensification operation to tackle illegal working within the gig economy.

This summer, we announced a £100 million uplift in funding for border security, with 300 more personnel in the NCA focused on targeting crime gang members, using new state-of-the-art technology and equipment for the detection and disruption of trafficking gangs.

The number of engines seized in Europe prior to facilitating illegal entry to the UK from July 2024 to 24 July 2025 is 71.

The number of boats seized since July 2024 until 24 July 2025 is 116. During the financial year 2024/25, the NCA was involved in more than 190 arrests (both in the UK and overseas) for OIC-related offences and 347 disruptions of immigration crime networks - their highest level on record and a 40 per cent increase on the previous twelve months.

We have increased the pace of social media post takedowns, with more than 8,000 being removed in 2024, a 40% increase on the previous year.

Legislation

We have introduced the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, giving law enforcement counter-terror-style powers to disrupt smuggling gangs.

This includes stronger powers to seize and search mobile phones and new offences against gangs conspiring to plan crossings and selling or handling small boat parts for use in the Channel.

The Bill criminalises the creation of online material promoting illegal immigration activity, including small boat crossings.

And foreign nationals who commit sex offences will be excluded from asylum protections under the Refugee Convention in the UK.

Asylum System Reforms

The asylum system we inherited was not fit for purpose, with appeals in the system for over a year on average.

We are overhauling asylum appeals with the most significant reforms in decades, to bring an end to these unacceptable delays and restore public confidence.

We have surged the number of initial decisions made, which is now sustained at 31,000 decisions per quarter up from an average of 10,000 per quarter last year.

The government is reforming asylum support and accommodation, reducing reliance on hotels and increasing use of alternative sites. Measures include;

The new Failure to Travel sanction, ensuring penalties for those who refuse to move to their designated dispersal accommodation.

From today, the government with reintroduce the normal 28-day Move On period for all single adults in receipt of a positive asylum decision.

To address appeal backlogs, a new independent appeals body will be established with statutory powers to prioritise cases from those in asylum accommodation and foreign national offenders.

In the immediate term, we are maximising capacity in the First Tier Tribunal by increasing sitting days and requiring appeal decisions within weeks not years, so we can clear the backlog, speed up returns, and cut costs.

The new legal requirement for a 24-week timeframe for asylum appeals by those receiving asylum accommodation support and appeals by foreign offenders will reduce these delays, and the new independent appeals body will eradicate them completely.

The system for family migration has become overly complex, developing increasingly around court decisions and case law, including court interpretations of Article 8 of the Human Rights Act.

An overly high proportion of family-related immigration cases are now decided on the basis that they are “exceptional” to the normal rules, rather than being in line with the rules set down by Parliament, and that undermines control and confidence.

That is why we are reviewing the application of Article 8 in the immigration and asylum system - and we will bring forward new reforms to family rules so that it is Parliament, rather than ad hoc court decisions, that determines the way that the right to family life is applied. The Home Secretary has also asked for a number of specific cases to be examined in relation to Article 3.

Asylum Accommodation

The Government inherited an asylum system under exceptional strain with tens of thousands stuck in a backlog, claims not being processed and disastrous contracts that were wasting millions in taxpayer money.

The Home Office is exploring a variety of short-, medium- and longer-term options, in collaboration with other government departments - supporting the commitment to end the use of hotels whilst delivering a more sustainable, flexible system.

Decisions on potential options such as former student accommodation and government-owned properties will be made on a site-by-site basis, and we will continue to work closely with local authorities and in compliance with all rules and regulations.

From over 400 asylum hotels open in summer 2023, costing almost £9 million a day, there are now less than 210, and we want them all closed for good by the end of this Parliament.

The number of asylum seekers in hotels fell by almost 6,000 in the first three months of 2025 – down 15% from December.

The cost of hotels was £5.77m per day in 2024/25, down from £8.3m per day in 2023/24.

We are clear this is not a good use of public money, and we remain fully committed to ending the use of hotels as asylum accommodation completely and as soon as possible.

By restoring grip on the system and speeding up decision making, we will end the use of hotels and are forecast to save the taxpayer £1 billion per year by 2028-29 compared with 2025-26.

Refugee Family Reunion

Existing applications already in the system will continue to be processed in the normal way. The pause does not affect refugees' existing rights or those who have already been granted reunion visas.

In May 2025, the Government set out its plans to reform the framework for family migration in the Immigration White Paper. This included setting out a new family policy on refugees seeking to bring family members to the UK.

6 years ago, refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average close to 18 months after they were granted protection. However, those applications now come in on average within a month, with some councils finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion.

Denmark and Switzerland don’t allow those granted humanitarian status to apply to bring their family over for two years after protection has been granted.

The Home Secretary has announced the temporary suspension of refugee family reunion, while work to reform the route in the long term is undertaken.

Refugees will be able to make applications under the normal Family Migration route.

We remain committed to supporting refugee families while managing the impact on local communities and services. We are working with local authorities who face unprecedented demand for temporary accommodation.

(LWI) - The city of Ríohacha, on Colombia’s north-eastern tip, is the venue for the 15th Global Forum on Migration and Development, which is focusing on the theme of ‘Regular Migration, Labor Mobility and Human Rights: Pillars of Development and the Wellbeing of Societies’. The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) is present at the Forum, working with two civil society networks to ensure that the rights and dignity of migrants and displaced people are seen and heard by politicians and decision-makers.

The idea for the Forum was first proposed, almost two decades ago, by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan. Since then, it has become an important platform for dialogue and sharing of best practices on migration, fostering inter-governmental cooperation and building partnerships between stakeholders including non-governmental organizations, businesses, civic leaders, academics and youth movements.

“At a time of rising criminalization of migrants, with restrictive and often inhumane laws, the Forum offers a vital opportunity to advocate for more humane policies and demand accountability for human rights violations,” says LWF’s Senior Advocacy Advisor Fabián Wilches, who is in Ríohacha for the 2 to 4 September meeting. “As civil society, we expect commitments from our governments to respect and protect the dignity and rights of migrants and others on the move,” he adds.

LWF plays an important role as one of the few faith-based organizations present at the Forum this year, Wilches notes. “As such, we bring the voices of our member churches offering invaluable support to migrants, returnees and local host populations,” he says. Among those is the Symbols of Hope initiative supporting migrants and refugees in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, while in Latin America, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Colombia (IELCO) works with migrants and host communities in cities across the country, including Bogotá, Villavicencio, Yopal, Paz de Ariporo and Turbo.

A place of hope, dignity and solidarity

“IELCO’s migrant ministry was founded in February 2019, when a church in Bogotá, with support from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), began accompanying families arriving in the capital, offering them a hot meal, a listening ear and some cash,” explains the ministry coordinator, Johana Morales Quiroga. “This simple but deeply meaningful gesture paved the way for us to develop a broader mission. Thanks to the support of LWF and others, including the ELCA, the AMMPARO network and ACT Alliance, we have been able to strengthen this service and to continue being a place of hope, dignity and solidarity for the migrant populations,” she says.

Today, the main focus of IELCO’s work is to provide comprehensive support to migrants and refugees in Colombia. This includes psychosocial and spiritual support, advice on case management, food and hygiene supplies, tutoring for children and technical skills training for adults. It also offers awareness-raising processes for churches and faith-based organizations on migration from a humanitarian and biblical-theological perspective.

“The goal is to share the gospel of Jesus Christi and to be a prophetic voice for the most vulnerable,” Morales continues. “Our aim is to strengthen local integration processes and to build capacity, especially in mixed groups of migrants and host communities. We also cooperate with LWF’s World Service program in Colombia and Venezuela on a joint project called Churches and Emergencies, which seeks to train churches in humanitarian aid and how to deal with different emergency situations.”

Staff at IELCO’s migrant ministry have many stories to tell of migrants who have been supported and successfully integrated into their new lives in Colombia. A mother, who arrived in Bogotá with her daughter suffering from a congenital disease, was provided with comprehensive support, including assistance in how to regularize their immigration process and obtain the necessary medical treatment. The mother was also offered training to develop a small business venture in order to improve their standard of living.

In northern Colombia, a family that had fled from Venezuela after facing political persecution requested support to move to a safer location. The migrant ministry was able to provide a safe route, as well as protection measures and follow-up to ensure that they arrived at their new destination. “It is so important for us that the Global Forum is being held in Ríohacha,“ concludes Morales, “because it recognizes the role of the local organizations in hosting migrants, highlighting the challenges and valuing solutions that are worked out at the local level.”",https://lutheranworld.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/Colobia-global-forum-migration.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 10:56:53.787247

Congressional representatives and senators, principally Democrats, have criticized the Trump administration’s approval of advanced semiconductor exports to China, citing national security and legal issues as issued in three separate letters across the aisle and in both chambers.

On August 22, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) introduced the No Advanced Chips for the CCP Act of 2025, requiring dual approval from the Executive Branch and Congress for AI chip exports, with limited humanitarian and diplomatic exceptions. In light of the AI race, the bill’s progress will be closely watched to see whether Congress attempts to affect US policy on advanced AI semiconductor exports.

On August 25, the FTC filed a lawsuit against Air AI Technologies, alleging that the company made deceptive claims about its conversational AI platform, causing significant financial losses for small business customers. The case highlights the Commission’s continued focus on holding AI companies accountable for marketing claims, despite the suggestion in the Trump AI plan that the FTC “pump the brakes” on AI enforcement.

Some Congressional Representatives and Senators push back against proposed AI chip sales to China

On August 25, House Select Committee on the CCP Chairman John Moolenaar (R-MI) sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “urging the Trump administration to take a harsher line on export controls to restrict the sale of advanced semiconductors to Beijing.” His letter reflects growing unease within President Trump’s own party in light of his recent decision to permit sales of advanced chips from two US manufacturers to China in exchange for the US government receiving a 15% revenue share. Rep. Moolenaar has instead promoted a “rolling technical threshold (RTT)” framework, which would cap US chip exports to only slightly outperform China’s domestic capabilities and limit Beijing’s aggregate AI computing power to 10% of US levels, an approach he argues is critical to sustaining long-term US leadership in AI.

Meanwhile, Senior Democrats in both chambers sent letters to the administration “expressing concern over the Administration’s reported approval of export licenses for advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in exchange for a cut of corporate revenue.”

House Select Committee on the CCP Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) criticized the administration for “flagrantly violating” existing export restrictions and warned that monetizing security-sensitive licenses risks undermining US credibility with allies in his letter to the administration.

“By requiring companies…to pay a percentage of their sales revenue to obtain export licenses, your Administration is flagrantly violating this clear legal prohibition,” Representative Krishnamoorthi wrote. “Allowing these exports at a profit sends a dangerous signal not only to the PRC but also to our allies, who rely on US leadership and integrity in advanced technology controls.”

A separate letter from six Senate Democrats similarly pressed the administration to reverse course, emphasizing that national security and military readiness are dependent “upon American innovators inventing and producing the best technology in the world.”

These concerns have prompted the introduction of legislation. On August 22, Rep. Krishnamoorthi introduced the No Advanced Chips for the CCP Act of 2025, co-led by Reps. Ami Bera (D-CA) and Jill Tokuda (D-HI). The “legislation [aims] to prevent advanced artificial intelligence semiconductors from reaching the People’s Republic of China (PRC) unless both the Executive Branch and Congress explicitly approve the transaction.” The bill would bar advanced AI semiconductor exports to China absent dual approval: first by the Secretary of Commerce (in consultation with other security agencies), and second through a joint resolution of Congress, with narrow exceptions for humanitarian, diplomatic, and repair-related purposes. It also would establish national security review factors, would mandate detailed reporting to Congress, and includes a three-year sunset provision to allow for reassessment as technology and threats evolve. The bill is now before the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

FTC Sues Air AI for Alleged Deceptive Marketing Practices

On August 25, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought a lawsuit against Air AI Technologies, alleging the company engaged in deceptive marketing practices tied to its “conversational AI” platform. The case, filed in the District Court of Arizona, centers on allegations that Air AI misled small business owners and entrepreneurs with exaggerated claims about the tool’s capabilities and financial benefits.

As part of the suit, the FTC requested a temporary restraining order to immediately halt Air AI’s marketing activities. According to the complaint, the company’s customers, “many of whom are small business owners, lost as much as $250,000 and are often left in debt” due to Air AI’s alleged misrepresentations.

FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Christopher Mufarrige underscored the stakes, noting that “companies that market AI-related tools with false promises of unrealistic investment returns and guaranteed refunds harm hardworking small business owners and undermine legitimate businesses’ adoption of AI.” The Commission voted 3-0 approving the filing of the complaint and continues to signal the FTC’s role in shaping the early regulatory environment for AI, emphasizing accountability for AI companies’ proclaimed capabilities. This action suggests that the FTC is not shutting down shop regarding AI related matters, despite the suggestion in the Trump AI Plan that the FTC should not shackle the development of AI or its expansion in the marketplace.

The complaint details several alleged misrepresentations by Air AI. The company and its executives, the FTC claims, promoted their flagship tool as “conversational AI,” asserting that it could function as a replacement for human customer service agents while also generating significant profits when paired with their other lines of business. The Commission contends, however, that customers did not achieve the promised financial outcomes, nor did they receive refunds despite assurances of recouped money from Air AI. The FTC further alleges that Air AI made unsubstantiated claims about “substantial earnings,” misrepresented the tool’s capabilities, and failed to provide mandatory disclosure documents and earnings claim statements.

Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.
It said parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won't influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.
""It seems like it's designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,"" she said.
""It seems ORR's mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they're not an immigration enforcement entity.""","McALLEN, Texas — President Donald Trump's administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by The Associated Press.

Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration's struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors — usually a parent or guardian — are properly vetted.

The memo said sponsors must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says ""federal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.""

Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a ""built-in opportunity"" to arrest parents — something she said has already happened.

Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child under the age of 12 who had shown up for an identification check. ""As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,"" Miller Flowers said.

Desai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don't already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates ""clearly and proactively"" with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won't influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.

""The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,"" it said in a statement.

However, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.

""We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,"" she said.

Trump administration points to Biden

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under President Joe Biden's administration.

A federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden's administration struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.

Another recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.

The agency said it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don't understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.

""If we don't understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?"" said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.

Jennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.

""It seems like it's designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,"" she said.

String of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process

The July changes are among a series of steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.

The administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home where children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.

About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.

Shaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.

""The agency's mission has been conflated and entangled,"" she added. ""It seems ORR's mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they're not an immigration enforcement entity.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250902-migrant-children-mn-0855-ab4b4a.jpg",N,,2025-09-02 10:56:57.408311

President Donald Trump has also repeatedly threatened to deploy National Guard troops to curb violence in Chicago.

Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump posted on social media, ""I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, and soon.""

Trump is scheduled on Tuesday afternoon at 1 p.m. to make an announcement from the Oval Office, according to the White House.

In a letter to the president, Illinois congressional leaders reiterated that there's no emergency that warrants military officials in Chicago.

The letter states in part, ""The deployment of the U.S. military into American cities is not about safety or security. It is about control...We demand you suspend any plans for the deployment of military personnel to Chicago and cease your unlawful power grabs and Executive Branch overreach.""

Over the weekend, Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order that reaffirms Chicago's sanctuary status and urges federal agents not to wear masks.

Later Tuesday afternoon Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Governor JB Pritzker will have a press conference about federal deployments.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17719209_090225-wls-ice-surge-nunez5a-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-02 09:57:01.009245

Advocates who sued said the children they represent have said they fear going home, and that the government, by operating in the dead of night and by bypassing immigration courts, is not following laws designed to protect migrant children.

Here’s a look at where things stand now:

The legal proceedings across the country

There are at least three legal cases going on around the country: Arizona, Washington, D.C., and Illinois. Representatives for unaccompanied migrant children are trying to stop the government from removing Guatemalan children who don’t have final orders of removal from the country. Those children are living in a network of shelters or foster care arrangements overseen by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services.

In Illinois, lawyers representing four minor children, who were identified only by their initials, said they had received notice on August 29 that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement intended to take the children from the shelters where they were being held under U.S. government care sometime on August 30 or September 1 and remove them from the U.S.

A judge blocked them from being taken out of the country at least until Wednesday afternoon. A hearing in the case is set for Wednesday morning.

In Arizona, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, which provides legal services for unaccompanied migrant children, filed a lawsuit on behalf of 53 children from Guatemala. The children were between the ages of three and 17 and living in shelters in the Phoenix and Tucson areas that care for unaccompanied migrant children. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Marquez on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from removing those children for at least two weeks. She said some children may have been in the process of being removed at the time, and ordered the government to return them to the U.S. immediately.

In Washington, D.C., Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan ordered a 14-day temporary restraining order preventing the government from removing Guatemalan children in Office of Refugee Resettlement custody and sending them back to Guatemala.

What is Guatemala saying about this?

In July, the head of Guatemala’s immigration service said the government was looking to repatriate 341 unaccompanied minors who were being held in U.S. facilities.

During a news conference on Monday, Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo shed more light on the issue during his weekly news conference.

Arévalo said the country’s foreign affairs minister and ambassador to the United States toured detention facilities for minors and adults in the United States in March and were “very concerned,” especially about minors who were going to turn 18. The government decided it had to act in the best interest of the children to prevent them from being moved to adult detention centers. He said Guatemala told the U.S. that the government was willing to receive “all unaccompanied minors, who wanted to return to Guatemala voluntarily.”

Arévalo explained that his administration began working to identify the minors, their families and make arrangements for those willing to return, those who wanted to wait out their legal process in the U.S. and those who judges allowed to remain in the U.S. with a relative.

Guatemala is capable of receiving about 150 minors per week, he said. “It depends on our capacity to identify relatives for facilitate a safe return,” he said. The goal is that none of the children end up being institutionalized.

The president did not answer when asked if the number to be sent on Sunday surprised Guatemala’s government, or whether he thought the U.S. government carried out due process before putting the minors on planes.

He said his administration has told the U.S. government that once a judge decides an unaccompanied Guatemalan child cannot remain in the U.S., Guatemala will take them and reintegrate them.

“We have been in coordination with the United States about this, but the decision of the sending, the number that they are going to send and the rhythm at which they are going to send is a U.S. government decision,” Arévalo said.

How many children could be sent home?

One of the biggest questions outstanding is how many Guatemalan children will be sent back to Guatemala.

The head of Guatemala’s immigration service put the number at 341 in July. Then on Friday, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote a letter to the Office of Refugee Resettlement saying that, according to whistleblower accounts, the office was intending to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children.

Also on Friday, Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said the exact number was in flux, but said they were currently discussing a little over 600.

The U.S. government indicated in a status report filed Sunday in the Washington, D.C., case that 76 children had been on planes to go to Guatemala and that those children were being returned to Office of Refugee Resettlement custody after the judge’s ruling.

There were believed to be two planes in Harlingen, Texas, and possibly another one in El Paso on Sunday, said the National Immigration Law Center. That is the group that filed a lawsuit Sunday in Washington, D.C., to stop the removals.

But it’s not clear if there were other children who had been removed from shelters and were en route to the planes before the judge entered the temporary restraining order.

Migrant kids have special protections

Migrant children traveling alone are usually entrusted to U.S. government care, and there are various legal protections designed to protect them once they’re in the U.S. and navigating the immigration system.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 is one of the key pieces of legislation designed to protect unaccompanied migrant children. With some limited exceptions, it generally requires that children be placed in the “least restrictive setting possible,” which generally means that they can be released to a sponsor such as a relative in the U.S. while their immigration proceedings play out.

The children can apply for a specially protected status if they can’t return to their home country because of abuse or neglect and they can also apply for asylum.

In court filings, advocates for Guatemalan children noted that only an immigration judge can decide whether an unaccompanied minor can voluntarily depart the U.S.

“It seems like it’s designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,” she said.
“It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”","McALLEN, Texas (AP) — President Donald Trump’s administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by The Associated Press.

Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration’s struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors — usually a parent or guardian — are properly vetted.

The memo said sponsors must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says “federal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.”

Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a “built-in opportunity” to arrest parents — something she said has already happened.

Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child under the age of 12 who had shown up for an identification check. “As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,” Miller Flowers said.

Desai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don’t already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates “clearly and proactively” with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won’t influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.

“The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,” it said in a statement.

However, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.

“We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,” she said.

Trump administration points to Biden

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under President Joe Biden’s administration.

A federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden’s administration struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.

Another recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.

The agency said it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don’t understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.

“If we don’t understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?” said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.

Jennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.

“It seems like it’s designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,” she said.

String of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process

The July changes are among a series of steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.

The administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home where children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.

About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.

Shaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.

“The agency’s mission has been conflated and entangled,” she added. “It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/1930c44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5475x3080+0+285/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fce%2Fc5%2F4c348f561da4e8cbed2f870dc241%2F11dcaf94d64d4eb4963f25a475c8832e,N,,2025-09-02 08:56:28.820289

She is also anxious. Attention from U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement could upend her life more than 23 years after she illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border as a teenager.

“The worry is they’ll pull you over when you’re driving and ask for your papers,” said Lidia, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only her first name be used because of her fears of deportation. “We need to work. We need to feed our families and pay our rent.”

As parades and other events celebrating the contributions of workers in the U.S. are held Monday for the Labor Day holiday, experts say President Donald Trump’s stepped-up immigration policies are impacting the nation’s labor force.

More than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.

The loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.

“It’s unclear how much of the decline we’ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,” Kramer said. “However, we don’t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn’t real.”

Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on “dangerous criminals,” but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.

Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.

“The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that’s where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,” she said. “That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.”

‘Crops did go to waste’

Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won’t be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.

Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.

“In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,” she said.

In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).

Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.

Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.

“People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,” Tate said.

Lidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.

“I don’t know if I’ll be able to bring my kids,” said Lidia. “I’m also very concerned I’d have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.”

From construction to health care

Construction sites in and around McAllen also “are completely dead,” Rodriguez said.

“We have a large labor force that is undocumented,” she said. “We’ve seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.”

The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.

“Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist. “But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn’t disrupting labor supplies.”

Kramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.

The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local’s president.

“What’s going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?” De La Cruz said. “What happens when immigrants aren’t in the field to pick our crops? Who’s going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?”",https://hot-town-images.s3.amazonaws.com/kwtv/production/2025/September/1/12-million-immigrants-gone-from-us-labor-force-under-trump.1756736225545.webp,N,,2025-09-02 12:00:04.946026

President Abbas is expected to address the Assembly in Geneva, where he will call for international protection, recognition of Palestinian sovereignty, and accountability for war crimes.","The United Nations General Assembly will convene its September session in Geneva instead of New York, following the United States’ refusal to grant entry visas to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and dozens of senior officials.

The relocation marks a rare institutional challenge to the host nation and reflects mounting global frustration over Washington’s obstruction of Palestinian participation amid Israel’s ongoing war on Gaza.

The U.S. State Department justified the visa denial on grounds of “national security,” accusing the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization of “undermining peace efforts” through legal appeals to the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.

These appeals include formal charges of genocide and apartheid against Israel, claims the U.S. argues breach diplomatic norms and politicize international legal forums.

The decision affects approximately 80 Palestinian officials, although the Palestinian Mission to the UN in New York will continue operating under a limited waiver.

The move has drawn sharp criticism from legal experts and international diplomats, who say it violates the 1947 UN Headquarters Agreement, which obligates the host country to facilitate access for all accredited delegations.

In 1988, the UN relocated its session to Geneva after the U.S. denied a visa to Yasser Arafat, then head of the PLO. The current relocation is similarly aimed at ensuring full Palestinian participation, particularly in a scheduled September 22 segment dedicated to Palestinian rights.

European leaders have condemned the U.S. decision. Spain’s Prime Minister described the move as “unjust,” while France reaffirmed that UN platforms must remain accessible to all recognized delegations.

The Geneva session also coincides with growing momentum among several countries, including France, the United Kingdom, and Canada, to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, adding diplomatic weight to the proceedings.

Palestinian officials have denounced the U.S. action as a deliberate attempt to silence their voice at a time when Gaza faces mass displacement, starvation, and what UN experts have described as genocidal violence.

President Abbas is expected to address the Assembly in Geneva, where he will call for international protection, recognition of Palestinian sovereignty, and accountability for war crimes.

The Geneva session is expected to amplify calls for action under the “Uniting for Peace” resolution, which empowers the General Assembly to recommend collective measures when the Security Council is unable to act due to political obstruction or lack of consensus.

Advocacy groups are urging the UN to consider deploying international protection forces to Gaza and to suspend Israel’s privileges within the UN system until humanitarian access is restored.

Beyond its logistical implications, the relocation signals a deeper shift in global diplomacy, where procedural justice and international law are being reasserted against political obstruction.

The Geneva gathering is expected to draw high-level delegations, legal experts, and civil society leaders, all converging to confront the worsening crisis and to chart a path forward for Palestinian self-determination.",https://imemc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/United-Nations-Palac-e1756802880267.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 10:57:01.536679

There, the trial court had also denied the plaintiff's motion for continuance and request for an additional 90 days to complete discovery.","The short answer: It depends! Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.530 explicitly states that on a motion for rehearing of ""matters heard without a jury, including summary judgments, the court may open the judgement if one has been entered, take additional testimony, and enter a new judgment."" Though the rule does not prohibit the making of new arguments in a motion for rehearing, whether such arguments are considered preserved for purposes of appeal is another matter. For those not versed in appellate speak, ""unpreserved"" means the appellate court will not consider the argument on appeal.

Florida's Sixth District Court of Appeal recently weighed in on this issue and held that a new argument presented to the trial court for the first time in a motion for rehearing (under Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.530) is unpreserved for purposes of the appeal, provided the trial court summarily denies the motion. Melrose Ventures, LLC v. Uptempo Mktg. Corp., No. 6D2023-3824, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 (Fla. 6th DCA 2025). In so holding, Florida's newest appellate court joined the Second, Third, and Fourth Districts ""who have already found that, as a general rule, new and different arguments untimely raised for the first time in motions for rehearing which were denied are unpreserved."" Id. at *4-5.

The Sixth District noted that the Third District had previously made the opposite holding in Bailey v. Treasure, 462 So. 2d 537, 539 (Fla. 3d DCA 1985) but because Bailey did not ""appear to be the currently prevailing law of the Third District,"" it did not certify conflict with Bailey. Melrose Ventures, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 at *5, n.4. But see Walden v. Chase Manhattan Bank, U.S.A., N.A., 872 So. 2d 432, 433 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004) (noting that a summary judgment ""is not final until a motion for rehearing is considered"" and reversing summary judgment based in part on ""supplement affidavits filed with the motion for rehearing"").

The Sixth District certified conflict with two opinions of the Fifth District which held that a party can preserve a new argument by raising it for the first time on rehearing. Id. at *7 (certifying conflict with Kawsar v. Alhamdi Grp., LLC, 369 So. 3d 1227, 1230 (Fla. 5th DCA 2023) and Elser v. Law Offs. Of James M. Russ, P.A., 679 So. 2d 309 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996)).

In Elser, the Fifth District reasoned that an ""order granting a motion for summary judgment is not final until the motion for rehearing is considered and disposed. 679 So. 2d at 312. ""Until then, a trial judge is free to consider any legal error or matter overlooked related to the entry of the summary judgment. Indeed, that is the very purpose of a motion for rehearing."" Id. The Fifth District considered and reversed the trial court based on an argument that the appellant had raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing.

The Sixth District, of course, is not bound by the decisions of its sister courts and made clear shortly after its creation that it intended to write on a clean slate. See CED Cap. Holdings 2000 EB, LLC v. CTCW-Berkshire Club, LLC, 363 So. 3d 192, 195 (Fla. 6th DCA 2023). As such, the Sixth District declined to follow Elser and was instead persuaded by the concurring opinion in the later Fifth District case of Kawsar. There, Judge Eisnaugle wrote that he agreed that the panel was bound by Elser, but that in his view Elser was wrongly decided. 369 So. 3d at 1229 (Eisnaugle, J., concurring). ""Agreeing with his well-reasoned analysis,"" the Sixth District expressly adopted the view that ""to preserve an argument, a party must make a timely, contemporaneous objection at the time of the alleged error."" Melrose Ventures, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 at *5-6 (cleaned up).

The Sixth District's opinion notes, however, that its reasoning regarding preservation ""does not apply when a trial court grants a motion for rehearing and then rejects a new argument on its merits."" Id. at *5 n.3. ""In such a case, the trial court has exercised its discretion to grant rehearing and consider the newly raised argument."" Id. (citing Crocker v. Crocker, 370 So. 3d 363, 365 (Fla. 5th DCA 2023)). It also does not apply to issues that could not have been raised before rehearing, such as when an error appears for the first time on the face of the order. Id. And, indeed, Rule 1.530 mandates that the failure of a trial court to make required findings of fact in the final judgment must be raised in a motion for rehearing for a party to preserve such a challenge on appeal.

Of course, a trial court has broad discretion to consider and address arguments that are raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing. A trial court may decide to do so, for example, to prevent what it would consider an injustice to a party resulting from an error or omission by one of the lawyers. And, indeed, appellate courts have held in some cases that a trial court abused its discretion by not considering an issue raised for the first time on rehearing. Those cases, however, typically involve ""extraordinary"" or ""exigent"" circumstances. See Dalrymple v. Franzese, 944 So. 2d 1240 (Fla. 4th DCA 2006). In Dalrymple, for example, the appellate court held that the trial court abused its discretion in not considering the affidavit of an expert witness that was attached to a motion for rehearing where, because of Hurricane Wilma and its aftermath, the expert was unable to meet with the investigating officer and complete his investigation and affidavit before the summary judgment hearing. Id. at 1242-43. There, the trial court had also denied the plaintiff's motion for continuance and request for an additional 90 days to complete discovery.

In sum, the district in which the trial court sits will determine whether an argument raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing will be considered preserved for purposes of the appeal. As the First District does not appear to have yet decided the issue, counsel are free to argue that whichever side best serves their client in a particular case. Counsel in the Sixth, Fourth, Third or Second District who think the trial court abused its discretion in not considering an ""untimely"" argument should make that argument to the appellate court, though the standard of review presents an uphill battle. See Melrose Ventures, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 at *4 (noting that appellants ""made no attempt"" to show the Sixth District that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for rehearing).

Of course, the Florida Supreme Court could take up the issue and settle the conflict. The Fifth District could also decide, en banc, to recede from Elser if a later case presents an appropriate opportunity to do so. See BAM Trading Servs., Inc. v. State, 395 So. 3d 687, 694 (Fla. 1st DCA 2024) (Bilbrey, J., concurring) (""When faced with erroneous precedent, barring a decision from a higher court or a legislative change, we are required to consider the matter en banc before we can recede from it.""). Meanwhile, the particular district in which appellate litigants find themselves will likely be determinative of whether the arguments of their trial counsel made for the first time in a motion for rehearing will be considered on appeal.

Remember that motions for rehearing directed to final orders must be filed within 15 days of the filing of the order. See Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.530(b). However, motions for reconsideration, which are directed to non-final orders, are based on the trial court's inherent authority to reconsider any of its rulings prior to entry of the final judgment and, thus, may be filed at any point prior to entry of final judgment. See Seigler v. Bell, 148 So. 3d 473, 478-79 (Fla. 5th DCA 2014).

More than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center.
About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.
My whole life has been in the United States.” FROM CONSTRUCTION TO HEALTH CARE Construction sites in and around McAllen also “are completely dead,” Rodriguez said.
An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local’s president.","She is also anxious. Attention from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could upend her life more than 23 years after she illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border as a teenager.

“The worry is they’ll pull you over when you’re driving and ask for your papers,” said Lidia, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only her first name be used because of her fears of deportation. “We need to work. We need to feed our families and pay our rent.”

As parades and other events celebrating the contributions of workers in the U.S. were held on September 1 for the Labor Day holiday, experts said Donald Trump’s stepped-up immigration policies were having a detrimental impact on the nation’s labor force.

More than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.

The loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.

“It’s unclear how much of the decline we’ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,” Kramer said. “However, we don’t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn’t real.”

Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on “dangerous criminals,” but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.

Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.

“The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that’s where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,” she said. “That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.”

“CROPS DID GO TO WASTE”

Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won’t be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.

Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.

“In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,” she said.

In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).

Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.

Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.

“People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,” Tate said.

Lidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.

“I don’t know if I’ll be able to bring my kids,” said Lidia. “I’m also very concerned I’d have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.”

FROM CONSTRUCTION TO HEALTH CARE

Construction sites in and around McAllen also “are completely dead,” Rodriguez said.

“We have a large labor force that is undocumented,” she said. “We’ve seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.”

The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.

“Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist. “But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn’t disrupting labor supplies.”

Kramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.

The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector, and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local’s president.

“What’s going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?” De La Cruz said. “What happens when immigrants aren’t in the field to pick our crops? Who’s going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?” ___ An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

Union officials have said the loss of bargaining rights for federal employees inevitably hurts the members of the public the agencies serve.
If the administration prevails, it could mark the beginning of a broader erosion of collective bargaining rights, some analysts said.
But what Mr. Reagan did in 1981 looks moderate compared to what Mr. Trump is doing, Mr. McCartin added.
In 1979, for example, President Jimmy Carter ordered employees in the Treasury Department’s office of intelligence support to be excluded from union rights.","More than 445,000 federal employees saw their union protections disappear in August, as agencies moved to comply with an executive order President Trump signed earlier this year that called for ignoring collective bargaining contracts with nearly one million workers.

The termination of protections followed an Aug. 1 appeals court ruling on legal challenges to Mr. Trump’s directive. The order, signed in late March, directed 22 agencies to ignore contracts for employees in specific unions. Last Thursday, Mr. Trump signed a second executive order stripping union rights from thousands of other employees at six additional agencies.

Mr. Trump said that the affected workers had roles that touched on national security, and that provisions in their labor contracts could interfere with his policies being carried out. He cited, for example, the role that Department of Veterans Affairs employees play in providing care for wounded troops in wartime.

Federal labor unions targeted in the executive orders have repeatedly sued the Trump administration, and in some cases forced the administration to temporarily pause the president’s efforts to shrink the federal work force and reshape the government. The American Federation of Government Employees has filed more than a dozen lawsuits related to the federal work force. The White House has likened this to a declaration of “war.”

So far, nine agencies have terminated union contracts that covered more than 445,000 federal workers from the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency, General Services Administration, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture and Veterans Affairs, and parts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services.

“This is literally the largest act of union busting in American history,” said Mike Podhorzer, a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. “There’s not another time when that many people lost their union.”

The attack on public sector labor unions is part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to assert more control of the federal work force and make it easier to fire civil servants. The president has also crippled several independent boards that adjudicate employment disputes, interfering with a critical resource employees have to challenge their terminations.

Mr. Podhorzer and some labor historians predicted that Mr. Trump would strip bargaining rights from even more of the federal work force, and that the trend would eventually reach private sector unions.

At the V.A., where 395,000 employees lost their union rights, people who planned to take 16 weeks of parental leave, as negotiated in their union contracts, will only have a guarantee of 12 weeks, the minimum required by law. About 1,500 food service workers across the country will no longer get meal allowances, like free lunches. And employees working long shifts are no longer guaranteed a rest period that was negotiated for safety reasons.

Union officials have said the loss of bargaining rights for federal employees inevitably hurts the members of the public the agencies serve.

Inspectors at the Agriculture Department’s food safety and inspection division no longer have a formal process to raise safety concerns about products without facing retaliation, said Paula Soldner, the chair of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which is part of the American Federation of Government Employees.

“Inspectors are very reluctant to bring things to a supervisor’s attention in fear for their jobs,” she said. That could mean unsafe consumer products end up being sold to the public, she added.

At the V.A., employees regularly speak up about caregiving issues and appointment backlogs, said Naveed A. Shah, the political director at Common Defense, a veterans advocacy group.

“They could have addressed those challenges with management in the past and known that they have the support of the union to ensure that they aren’t going to be retaliated against or fired for bringing up those type of issues,” Mr. Shah said. “And now they don’t have that.”

That has already happened in the few weeks that nurses have been working without contracts, said Irma Westmoreland, a nurse at a veterans medical center in Atlanta and the chair of National Nurses United’s V.A. division.

This year, patient care problems related to staffing shortages have been on the rise because of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the federal work force, Ms. Westmoreland said. Nurses continue to document concerns, but agency managers have not been as responsive because they no longer have to be.

Union representatives can continue to help members with work-related disputes, Ms. Westmoreland said, but they have to take vacation time to do it.

The legal battle over Mr. Trump’s orders has continued, in some cases holding up the termination of more union contracts.

If the administration prevails, it could mark the beginning of a broader erosion of collective bargaining rights, some analysts said.

“What this does is signal to private sector employers that they can go to war with the unions” and not face legal consequences, said Erik Loomis, a labor historian at the University of Rhode Island.

Joseph A. McCartin, a labor history professor at Georgetown University, pointed to the impact of President Ronald Reagan’s firing of air traffic controllers in 1981.

“It demonstrated to private sector employers the leverage that could be had by taking an aggressive approach to unions, to collective bargaining,” he said. But what Mr. Reagan did in 1981 looks moderate compared to what Mr. Trump is doing, Mr. McCartin added.

“It is an action that’s almost incomparable in terms of what a president can do to undermine unions,” Mr. McCartin said.

And a recent decision in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, if upheld, would further hurt private sector unions by allowing the president to fire board members of the National Labor Relations Board, which was created to oversee and enforce federal labor law.

During his first term, Mr. Trump had a more moderate position on labor unions, Mr. Loomis said, and his labor secretaries operated within the standards of collective bargaining.

This time is different.

To strip collective bargaining rights from nearly half of the federal work force, Mr. Trump leaned on a provision in a 1978 law that gives the president the authority to exclude certain agencies or divisions from collective bargaining rights if there is “primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or national security work.”

Mr. Loomis said that identifying national security as the primary function in some of the agencies targeted was spurious at best. But as a result, Mr. Trump’s directive applies far more broadly than previous orders.

In 1979, for example, President Jimmy Carter ordered employees in the Treasury Department’s office of intelligence support to be excluded from union rights. Mr. Trump’s order calls for the entire Treasury Department to be stripped of collective bargaining rights, with the exception of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

“We represent janitorial staff,” said Lee Blackmon, the director of the federal division of the National Association of Government Employees. “What is it that they do that impacts national security?”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/29/multimedia/00dc-unions-01-gzlp/00dc-unions-01-gzlp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 06:57:03.675997

Topline:

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a proposed $10 million program to provide rental assistance to tenants affected by January’s destructive fires, as well as recent Trump administration immigration enforcement efforts.

Who should apply: If the plan is approved by the board, the county’s Department of Consumer and Business Affairs would have 60 days to set up a new Emergency Rent Relief Program. It would prioritize a few groups of people:

Renters who lost income because of the fires

Displaced families who have run out of rent support from insurance plans or FEMA

Small landlords struggling to pay for post-fire building repairs

Households that have lost income because of federal immigration raids

The context: Shortly after the fires, L.A. County leaders approved eviction protections that allowed tenants to delay paying rent if they qualified under the county’s rules and gave their landlords sufficient notice.
