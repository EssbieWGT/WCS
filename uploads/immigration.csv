California is rapidly turning its education system, from K-12 schools to colleges, into a benefit for illegal aliens. A slew of recent state laws limit cooperation with federal immigration officials undermining enforcement, placing foreign nationals above American students, and increasing taxpayer costs.

Senate Bill (SB) 580, signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, forces schools, libraries, courthouses, health facilities, and shelters to develop and implement policies that actively restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This law violates 8 U.S. Code § 1373 by prohibiting these institutions from sharing immigration status information with federal officials. Beyond the legal concerns, SB 580 adds layers of bureaucracy and compliance costs that California taxpayers will ultimately bear.

In addition to SB 580, an additional four bills were recently enacted that establish new protections to prioritize illegal aliens over American students and lawful residents.

SB 98, signed by Governor Newsom on September 20, 2025, requires colleges and universities to alert students about immigration enforcement activities on campus, maintain strict confidentiality regarding students’ national origin or immigration status, and provide legal assistance and resources for immigration matters. California’s public universities are now expected to function as early warning systems and legal aid centers for those sought by federal law enforcement.

SB 307, signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, requires the California State University and University of California systems to implement measures to ensure that foreign nationals retain their academic status even if they cannot attend classes due to immigration enforcement actions. Additionally, it creates taxpayer-funded “Dreamer Resource Liaisons” that guarantees assistance and eligibility for illegal aliens seeking financial aid or non-resident tuition exemptions. American students already face fierce competition for limited financial aid and university resources; now, they must compete against foreign nationals who receive state-sponsored advocacy and support.

Assembly Bill (AB) 419, signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, prohibits local educational agencies from collecting national origin and immigration status information. The law requires schools to report any immigration enforcement inquiries and mandates multilingual communications that inform all students about their educational “rights” regardless of legal status. This measure effectively prevents schools from cooperating with federal authorities while simultaneously advertising California’s education system as a safe haven for illegal immigration.

AB 495, also signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, bars daycare centers and state preschool programs from inquiring about citizenship or immigration status and requires these facilities to establish policies that severely restrict cooperation with immigration enforcement efforts.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/Migrants%2C%20Money%2C%20Cracked%20Flag%2C%20School%20Bus.jpg.webp?itok=4Qm0Fglx,N,,2025-10-29 23:56:35.975173

In an essay published this week, Bhattacharyya outlined a solution for the justice department to handle Trump’s claim: do nothing.","Donald Trump’s effort to get his justice department to pay him hundreds of millions of dollars is based on specious legal claims that would likely be rejected if he were any other American, according to a legal expert and a former Department of Justice official who handled damages claims against the government.

Trump has asked the justice department to pay him $230m in damages, the New York Times reported last week. The amount is the total of two separate claims in which Trump argues he is entitled to compensation because of investigations into the links between Russia and his 2016 campaign as well as the 2022 search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and subsequent criminal prosecution.

In the Mar-a-Lago complaint, Trump argues he was subject to invasion of privacy, malicious prosecution and abuse of process related to the case.

The effort has set off alarm bells and seen as a staggering act of corruption because the two justice department officials with power to sign off on the claims are Trump appointees and allies. House Democrats sent a letter to the justice department this week calling the effort “blatantly illegal and unconstitutional”.

Trump is seeking compensation under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), a law that allows people to seek damages from the federal government. The law requires claimants to first file an administrative claim for damages; the government then has six months to either settle the claim or deny it. After six months, or if the claim is denied, the claimant can file a lawsuit. The government has not responded to either of Trump’s claims, but Trump has not filed a lawsuit. It is extremely difficult for a claimant to successfully recover damages under the law.

The New York Times published the form Trump used to make the claim about the Mar-a-Lago raid – the only claim that has become public so far. Trump requested the government pay him $100m in compensation. Additionally, a memo attached to the claim requested $100m in punitive damages and says the president suffered $15m in actual harm due to legal costs connected to the case. It is not clear why the claim cover sheet seeks $100m in damages while the memo outlines $115m in requested damages.

Trump’s legal costs in the case were covered by his Super Pac, Save America. Trump retained six lawyers for himself in the classified documents case, including Todd Blanche, who is now the deputy attorney general.

Trump told reporters last week he would donate any money from a possible settlement to charity. The president has a history of making charitable promises that never materialize.

The amount Trump is demanding far exceeds the amount typically paid out by the justice department in administrative settlements under the FTCA. A Guardian review of FTCA claims filed against the federal government that were administratively settled from 2020 to 2024 shows the average settlement amount to be about $51,684. The largest administrative settlement during that time period was for $3.55m. The 139 administrative settlements the justice department reached last year with victims of Larry Nassar, the doctor who abused Olympic gymnasts and many others, totalled $138.7m.

Those seeking a settlement usually aim high because their initial request sets a ceiling on what they can recover, said Gregory Sisk, a law professor at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota. Still, he said, the amount Trump is requesting was difficult to take seriously.

“Typically, someone who was asking for this amount of money, it would be very quickly rejected, because it would be thought of as absurd to request that amount,” he said. “I cannot think of any prior claim, at least at this early stage, that has been settled that involves money approaching that level.”

Cases including a request for more than $4m typically have involved children who had been injured and had a lifetime of medical expenses and lost earnings capacity, according to Rupa Bhattacharyya, a former justice department attorney who worked on FTCA claims, adding that it was also extremely rare for the government to agree to such a big settlement without litigating it.

“A lot of the cases that get settled are small potatoes. If someone slips and falls in the Smithsonian and breaks their arm, they might settle that claim because it’s just not worth it to litigate it,” she said. “But big-money cases, it’s pretty rare for claims to be settled at the administrative stage because before the government pays out taxpayer funds, it wants to ensure that it in fact has a reason to do so.”

Normally, it would be easy for justice department lawyers to reject the overwhelming majority of the money Trump is requesting. The FTCA does not allow for punitive damages.

“It is a frivolous claim to ask for punitive damages under the FTCA. The statute is explicit,” said Sisk.

A key provision of the FTCA immunizes government officials when they are exercising their discretion within the bounds of a policy set by the government. The search warrants of Mar-a-Lago were approved by a magistrate judge.

“Since it was pursued pursuant to a warrant that had been issued by a judge who found that there was probable cause, that would be a pretty high hill to climb for the typical individual who claimed that they had been subjected to trespass by a search, even if the government ultimately concluded we’re not going to bring charges. Or charges were brought and you were acquitted,” Sisk said.

He added he would be surprised if there were many previous cases where anyone who was the subject of a search conducted after obtaining proper probable cause was able to obtain a settlement from the government.

Experts also questioned whether Trump would be able to recover attorneys’ fees in the case. The FTCA caps what an attorney gets paid as a portion of the plaintiff’s recovery, Bhattacharyya said.

Outside of the FTCA, when litigants try to get adversaries to pay their cases in court, judges typically investigate whether the amount billed was reasonable.

None of that may matter. The deputy attorney general and the associate attorney general both have the authority to require FTCA claims above $4m. Both positions are currently held by men who are Trump allies. Blanche, the deputy attorney general, defended Trump in the criminal cases against him. Save America also paid legal fees for Stanley Woodward, the associate attorney general who leads the department’s civil division, and who defended Trump’s valet, Walt Nauta, in the classified documents case. Both men have final authority on sign-offs for the settlements.

This has raised alarm and created serious legal ethics problems, said Joseph Tirrell, who was the top ethics official at the justice department until he was fired earlier this year. He is suing the department for wrongful termination.

“There’s just nobody that can make this decision, career or political appointee, who’s not going to be chock-full of ethical conundrums here,” he said. “In this case, there’s nobody to kick it up to. The attorney general has just as significant conflicts, if not more so than Mr Woodward and Mr Blanche. And, frankly, the risk of any or all of them being fired if they don’t make a decision that comports with the president’s wishes is just as significant and applies to every employee in the department of justice, if not every employee in the executive branch.”

“In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials,” said Chad Gilmartin, a justice department spokesperson. That was of little reassurance to Tirrell.

“Can you imagine an ethics official, a career official, making this decision without thinking, ‘Well, if I don’t tell them what they want to hear, I’m going to lose my job’?” he said.

There also may be little information provided to the public once a settlement is reached. Details of administrative settlements are not typically disclosed to the public, though some basic details are included in a year-end report to Congress.

In an essay published this week, Bhattacharyya outlined a solution for the justice department to handle Trump’s claim: do nothing.

The FTCA does not require the department to respond to Trump’s request for a settlement, and the president can pursue it in court, where he would have to more fully flesh out his arguments before a judge and offer evidence in the public eye.

“If President Trump wants to press his legal claims in a court of law, let him try, as thousands of tort claimants do every year,” she wrote.

“Settling President Trump’s administrative claims before there has been any opportunity to test or defend those claims should be a non-starter for the justice department if it is to retain any integrity, a commitment to doing justice, and a sense of responsibility for the US taxpayer dollars with which they have been entrusted.”

Reports, photos and videos from several community members show that federal agents were active in multiple locations on Oct. 29 afternoon in Wilmette.

Wilmette Village Manager Michael Braiman, speaking for the Village, said the resident accounts of federal law enforcement activity Wednesday are credible; though, local police did not witness any such activity.

Braiman added that police took calls on Wednesday describing multiple incidents involving federal agents in Wilmette. He could not immediately confirm, though, if agents apprehended any individuals.

Resident Chad Boomgaarden told The Record that he spoke with at least one border patrol agent around 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday in an alley between Park and Prairie avenues near his home. Boomgaarden, who shared photos supporting the encounter, said he inquired about federal jurisdiction on and near private property, among other topics.

He was walking his dog and was not pleased to see men in “face masks, camo, tactical gear and long rifle weapons” just feet from his backyard.

“You know, I’m a pretty chill dad/husband/person,” he wrote to The Record via text message, “but I’ve always had a soft spot and protective instinct for people or animals being bullied … so I have to say I was really pissed off.”

Boomgaarden did not see the agents make any arrests; however, Patrick Hanley, a Winnetka resident and local politician, who followed the agents’ vehicles into the alley reportedly witnessed up to seven armed and masked agents in fatigues detain and drive away with two individuals.

Hanley shared a video taken Wednesday with The Record that shows two vehicles in an alley and at least six uniformed and masked members of law enforcement.

“With no disrespect to sharks, it was like seeing sharks in open water. You know these people are dangerous and don’t know what they are going to do,” said Hanley, the leader of the New Trier Democrats and candidate for Illinois senate.

Hanley and dozens of community members use a group chat to track the local presence and activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officials.

Erinn Martin, of Winnetka, is also in that group chat and said when she saw messages saying ICE agents were in Wilmette, she parked her car near the Wilmette library.

When she saw a possible federal vehicle — as described in the group chat — pass by, she and a handful of other cars driven by community members in that same group chat followed it.

The car stopped at one point and agents got out, she said.

“They open the door and are standing there in tactical gear, like it’s Afghanistan, here in Wilmette,” said Martin, who grew up in Wilmette. “… They are bringing unnecessary trauma and chaos into our neighborhoods.”

Martin said she began blowing a whistle, a growing resistance measure to alert communities of federal agents in the area. She was not alone.

Boomgaarden said six people came to the alley within 30 seconds and were blowing whistles and documenting the agents via photo and video.

Martin and others continued following the alleged federal vehicles out of Wilmette, through Glenview and to the Home Depot in Niles.

Martin said the group chat has a segment they call a rapid response team, of which she is a part, and the team’s goal is to respond to the scene of an ICE sighting and warn community members while also letting the agents know they are unwanted.

“Because this is wrong,” she said. “You can have a conversation about whether immigrants need to be deported, but that’s not what this is about. If you’ve seen footage of them arresting U.S. citizens, breaking windows — there is no responsibility. Nothing is going to stop them except for us. So we have to stop them.”

She added, “There is fear in the air, and everybody should stand up. Nobody should feel that way.”

Wednesday’s incidents come on the heels of an emotional discussion during Wilmette’s Village Board meeting on Tuesday night, Oct. 28, when a large contingent of residents packed board chambers urging Village officials to respond to local ICE activity.

To address the topic, the Village Board directed staffers to prepare possible policy changes the board could approve to “help keep community members safe,” according to a community email sent by the Village on Wednesday.

The board also wants staff to prepare communication material to educate residents and better promote resources available to immigrants in the community.

On July 10, immigration agents executed a search warrant at a cannabis farm in Camarillo. There was a clash with demonstrators, and some threw rocks at agents. Federal officials announced that a number of those people are in custody.

""During the summer we were very clear that anyone who engages in criminal conduct, who assaults our agents or damages government property - we're going to find you, and we're going to arrest you and we're going to charge you,"" acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at a press conference.

Ten people were arrested. Charges include civil disorder against law enforcement officers.

Authorities are searching for more protesters who allegedly engaged in violence.

AIR7 captured one person who allegedly fired a gun toward federal agents during the Camarillo confrontation. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to a conviction.

""And while the First Amendment protects the freedom of speech and the freedom to peacefully assemble, it does not provide for a right to assault federal officers,"" said Eddy Wang, Homeland Security Investigations Los Angeles special agent in charge.

The announcement comes as a U.S. district judge ruled that Essayli has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. The decision represents another setback to the Trump administration's effort to extend handpicked acting U.S. attorneys beyond the 120-day limit set by federal law.

Attorney General Pam Bondi now named Essayli first assistant U.S. attorney.

Essayli responded to the ruling during Wednesday's press conference.

Under the relevant federal law, the president can federalize the national guard under certain conditions, including when he could not executive the laws or there was a danger of rebellion.
Franz Schoening, a Commander with Portland Police Bureau was there—he was a team commander during the protests in 2020.","A federal judge has again been forced to consider whether the Trump administration had directly disobeyed her in its response to her Oct. 4 order temporarily blocking the deployment of federalized Oregon National Guard members in the city.

The judge, Karin J. Immergut, first wondered this on Oct. 5 when the administration, in what she said appeared to be in direct contravention of the previous day’s order, mobilized National Guard members from other states to the city, prompting her to issue a broader restraining order.

But the Trump administration admitted Wednesday morning to yet another instance in which it may have disobeyed the judge’s order, several hours after it was first published.

Asked about the matter, a spokesperson for U.S. Northern Command said, “We cannot comment on ongoing litigation.”

On the morning of Saturday Oct. 4, Portlanders were awaiting Immergut’s ruling on whether to issue an emergency block on the deployment of Oregon National Guard members to the city.

Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the federalized guard members were in motion, preparing for the mission. Some were converging on local military bases. And around 11:30 a.m. Oct. 4, according to a military document turned up in subsequent litigation, and reviewed by WW, a small advance group of 9 soldiers had arrived in the U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement facility itself.

By around noon that day, the document says, those troops “assumed their first support mission.”

A few hours later, at 3:40 pm, Immergut would issue a temporary restraining order blocking that mission.

But the troops, a military document indicates, remained at the until early Oct. 5—more than 8 hours after the restraining order was issued.

A government lawyer admitted as much to Immergut Wednesday morning, as a trial got under way to help the judge determine whether to issue a more durable block on the deployment.

The government lawyer explained to the judge that it took time for the feds to issue the information about the temporary restraining order to the people on the ground.

Whether the lingering presence of the troops constituted contempt of court or was in direct violation of her temporary restraining order, Immergut responded, would be discussed later: She had a trial to proceed with.

After opening statements, lawyers for the city and the feds jumped into opening statements.

“This case is about a simple proposition, as this court well knows,” said Caroline Turco for the city of Portland. “This is a nation of constitutional law.” She added that her team was confident that at the end of this case, “the court will find that the city does not need the National Guard and the federal government does not need the National Guard.”

Eric Hamilton offered the rejoinder for the Trump administration. “For months, agitators have used violence and threatened violence against the men and women who serve their country by working for the departments of Homeland Security here in Oregon,” he said. Under the relevant federal law, the president can federalize the national guard under certain conditions, including when he could not executive the laws or there was a danger of rebellion.

Hamilton says both of these things were true. And yet, he added, it is not for the court to determine whether these things were “actually” true; Congress, he argued, left such a judgement to the president.

Instead, Hamilton said, it is for the court to decide whether the president has made a plausible “assessment of the facts and law within a range of honest judgment.”

If the testimony from local law enforcement officers that formed the bulk of the first day at trial was meant to provide the factual basis on which the judge could make that call, the discussion also served as a referendum on the quality of the police work that local and federal officers have been doing during the protests outside the ICE facility in South Portland.

The feds contend that local law enforcement has provided inadequate help, failing to intervene to clear protesters from their driveway, for example—claims they said bolstered the argument that the troops need to come in to do the job.

From the stand though, local law enforcement officer made a consistent case: the protests they have been observing and occasionally intervening in outside the ICE building have been relatively tame and lawful. They also contended that the federal counterparts have not infrequently escalated tensions unnecessarily, at times even deploying munitions in a manner that is disproportionate to the “crime or violence” of the assembled demonstrators.

The testimonies tracked how protests grew intense in June, and then became tamer into late September, when tensions rose again after Trump announced he would call in the troops.

But the relevant history clearly went back farther. Portland’s history of protests and riots following the murder of George Floyd in 2020 shaped the image of a city in the minds of many around the nation—including the president himself.

Franz Schoening, a Commander with Portland Police Bureau was there—he was a team commander during the protests in 2020.

From the stand Wednesday, he was asked how he would compare the protests at ICE from June until today to the downtown unrest then.

“I’d say there is no comparison,” he said. “The level of violence, criminal conduct that we saw in 2020 was markedly different.”",https://www.wweek.com/resizer/v2/7VYCYEQCQJCNVN5HV4GZ7OKT6A.jpg?smart=true&auth=d71b18d03e25f8e55b0b30c6ea6fa1d7695732491e91cc41fb2ec190aabefc42&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-29 22:56:50.327682

The one-page suspension by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came before Greg Bovino’s first late-afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the courthouse in downtown Chicago.

Ellis ordered the meetings Tuesday after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by government agents working Operation Midway Blitz, which has resulted in more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Bovino told Fox News that he was eager to talk to Ellis. But government lawyers were appealing her decision at the same time, calling it “extraordinarily disruptive.”

“The order significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis,” the Justice Department argued.

Judge troubled by tear gas

Lawyers for news outlets and activists whose lawsuit alleging excessive force by agents in and around Chicago prompted the judge to order the briefings from Bovino have until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond in the appeals court.

Ellis’ order followed the use of tear gas in a neighborhood where children gathered for a Halloween parade last weekend on Chicago’s Northwest Side. Neighbors joined in the street as someone was arrested.

“Halloween is on Friday,” the judge said Tuesday. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

Bovino defended agents’ actions.

“If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s going to have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino told Fox News. “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here.”

Related cases in many courts

Meanwhile prosecutors filed charges against Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate, and five other people over protests at an immigration enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago. The indictment unsealed Wednesday accuses them of illegally blocking an agent’s car on Sept. 26.

Abughazaleh called the prosecution an “attempt to silence dissent.”

The Chicago court actions came as groups and officials across the country have filed lawsuits aimed at restricting federal deployments of National Guard troops.

President Donald Trump’s administration will remain blocked from deploying troops in the Chicago area until at least the latter half of November, following a U.S. Supreme Court order Wednesday calling on the parties to file additional legal briefs.

The justices indicated that they would not act before Nov. 17 on the administration’s emergency appeal to overturn a lower-court ruling blocking the deployments.

In Portland, Oregon, a federal trial seeking to block a troop deployment got underway Wednesday morning with a police commander describing on the witness stand how federal agents at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building repeatedly fired tear gas at nonviolent protesters.

Judge wants real-time updates

In Chicago, Bovino, who is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was to sit for daily 5:45 p.m. briefings to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, Ellis said. The check-ins were to take place until a Nov. 5 hearing.

Ellis also demanded that Bovino produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz.

The judge expressed confidence Tuesday that the check-ins would prevent excessive use of force in Chicago neighborhoods.

Ellis previously ordered agents to wear badges and has banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She subsequently required body cameras after the use of tear gas raised concerns that agents were not following her initial order.

Ellis set a Friday deadline for Bovino to get a camera and to complete training.

Lawyers for the government have repeatedly defended the actions of agents, including those from ICE, and told the judge that videos and other portrayals of enforcement actions have been one-sided.

“If we allow it to continue here, in the nation’s capital, what happens next?” WTOP has reached out to Nadeau’s office about the residents’ concerns.
Residents said D.C. police are arresting undocumented immigrants for minor infractions.
Nadeau’s committee invited the D.C. Office of Human Rights, which handles cases involving human rights violations, to attend the meeting.
“If actions by our own agencies do not comply with D.C. law and human rights, we need to know and we need to make demands of the executive to put an end to those actions,” Nadeau said.","Dozens of District residents spoke out at a public hearing before the D.C. Council on Wednesday about what they described as a continued collaboration between the city’s police department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

The neighbors told D.C. Council member Brianne Nadeau, who hosted the discussion, that what they’re seeing on city streets are human rights violations.

“I walk with my passport in hand,” said Nadia Salazar Sandi, a core organizer with Colectivo de Familias Migrantes, a human rights nonprofit in D.C. “I’m a parent and I can’t fathom being separated from my 3-year old. … My parents walk with a fear that I’ve never seen before, with passport copies in hand and a prayer that nothing will happen to anyone in our family.”

Last month marked the end of a 30-day cooperation between D.C. police and ICE agents. Mayor Muriel Bowser said then that officers would no longer be involved in immigration arrests.

But residents said it’s still happening.

“Every single day within one mile of the house where I was born and raised, 15 to 20 immigrants are snatched up by masked federal agents with no warrants and no due process,” said Tanya Golash-Boza, a professor of sociology at the University of California who studies immigration law enforcement.

“Our neighbors are being attacked. Families are living in terror. Children are losing their parents. And people are scared to leave their houses,” she said. “If we allow it to continue here, in the nation’s capital, what happens next?”

WTOP has reached out to Nadeau’s office about the residents’ concerns. Her office did not comment on the issue.

Residents said D.C. police are arresting undocumented immigrants for minor infractions. Then, minutes later, ICE agents will arrive on the scene to arrest them.

“On the way to grab my morning coffee, about a dozen masked ICE agents were staging in the firehouse parking lot on the corner of 14th and Newton Street,” said D.C. resident Dante O’Hara. “The workers … on the same corner of the firehouse are absolutely terrified. One of their workers told me that she was afraid to walk her daughter to school in fear of being kidnapped in front of her daughter.”

O’Hara called for the city to follow the lead of Chicago, which recently set up “ICE-free zones.” It bans federal immigration agents from using city property and private businesses as staging areas to scope out suspected undocumented immigrants.

Residents are also asking the city for more legal services for immigrants and more data collected during arrests to track which agencies are on the scene.

Nadeau’s committee invited the D.C. Office of Human Rights, which handles cases involving human rights violations, to attend the meeting. She said the office turned down her request to join.

“If actions by our own agencies do not comply with D.C. law and human rights, we need to know and we need to make demands of the executive to put an end to those actions,” Nadeau said.

The 11-page indictment, which was filed on October 23 and unsealed Wednesday, accuses Abughazaleh and the other protesters of using “force, intimidation and threat” as part of a conspiracy to prevent an unnamed ICE agent from “discharging his duties” and to “injure him in his person or property.”

The conspiracy, as the charging document describes it, involves allegations that the protesters “banged aggressively” on a federal agent’s car, “crowded together in the front and side of the Government Vehicle and pushed against the vehicle to hinder and impede its movement,” and “scratched the body of the Government Vehicle, including etching a message into the body of the vehicle, specifically the word ‘PIG.’”

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment,” wrote Abughazaleh, in a statement to The Intercept. “This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges.”

The indictment alleges that Abughazaleh, a former journalist and candidate in the Democratic primary for Illinois’s 9th Congressional District, put her hands on the hood of the car and “braced her body and hands against the vehicle while remaining directly in the path of the vehicle.”

The disruption, according to the indictment, forced the federal agent “to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators.”

If convicted, the protesters could face up to six years in prison for the conspiracy charges and eight years in prison for the intimidation charge. Conspiracy charges are a common tool for prosecutors to use against protesters.

Abughazaleh — who went viral earlier this year after video emerged of ICE agents slamming the 26-year-old Democratic candidate to the ground at the same facility — pointed to the irony of the Trump administration accusing protesters of violence.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” she wrote.

The Broadview ICE processing center has been noted for its violent clashes between federal agents and protesters — with ICE agents deploying aggressive tactics at demonstrators — including an infamous incident where agents shot a pastor in the back of the head with a pepper ball.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to The Intercept’s request for comment.

U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis issued a temporary restraining order against federal agents in the Chicago area earlier this month, requiring them to wear a body camera and give at least two advanced warnings before deploying tear gas.

To federalize the Illinois Guard members, Trump invoked 10 U.S.C.
Barrett asked the full court to consider whether the term “regular forces” in the statute refers to the regular forces of the U.S. military — such as members of the Army, Navy and Air Force.
If the Supreme Court agrees with Lederman that “regular forces” refers to the U.S. military, it could upset almost all of Trump’s domestic military deployments so far.
With exception to Los Angeles, Trump hasn’t sent regular military forces to any city in which he’s attempted to deploy National Guard troops.","A district court block to President Donald Trump’s attempted military deployment in Chicago will stand for at least the next few weeks as the Supreme Court takes up a key question over the president’s ability to federalize the state National Guard.

In response to Trump’s emergency appeal of the lower court block, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett Wednesday referred a question to the full court on the language of the statute the president invoked in calling up to 300 members of the Illinois Guard into federal service for deployment in Chicago earlier this month.

To federalize the Illinois Guard members, Trump invoked 10 U.S.C. 12406 (Title 10), an archaic and rarely used statute that allows the president to federalize state Guard troops when the country faces foreign invasion, when the U.S. government faces rebellion or when the president is unable to execute laws with “regular forces.”

In addition to the Illinois Guard, Trump also attempted to send federalized members of the Texas Guard to Chicago.

Barrett asked the full court to consider whether the term “regular forces” in the statute refers to the regular forces of the U.S. military — such as members of the Army, Navy and Air Force.

Barrett’s referral of the question was unexpected, as the states and cities challenging Trump’s domestic military deployments, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys defending them, generally haven’t broached whether the normal armed forces should be considered part of the “regular forces” referred to in the statute.

Parties involved in the lawsuits, including the Trump administration, have instead largely interpreted that to refer to federal law enforcement personnel executing federal law, such as the FBI or Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents.

The question appears to stem from an amicus brief filed to the Supreme Court by Martin Lederman, a former DOJ deputy assistant attorney general who’s now a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center.

Rather than referring to federal law enforcement, “regular forces” instead must refer to members of the formal armed forces within the Department of Defense, Lederman argued in the brief.

Lederman noted that throughout U.S. history, and specific legal history of 10 U.S.C. 12406, “regular” was often used as a shorthand for the Army — “the regulars” — as opposed to the state militias that evolved into today’s National Guard.

“It is highly uncommon, however, to refer to such civilian officials and employees as any kind of ‘forces’ at all; and they certainly are not ‘the regular forces’ to which [Title 10] refers,” Lederman wrote.

Because Trump never sent members of the armed forces to assist ICE in Chicago, Trump could not determine that he was unable to execute federal law with “regular forces” as required by Title 10 and therefore lacked the authority to federalize members of the Illinois Guard, Lederman asserted.

However, he stopped short of arguing that the president has the authority to execute federal law with members of the armed forces. That’s an authority regulated by several other laws — most prominently the statutes that make up the Insurrection Act, one of the president’s most expansive emergency powers.

“Amicus does not mean to suggest that this Court should opine on the scope of the President’s powers to use the military pursuant to the Insurrection Act,” Lederman wrote.

If the Supreme Court agrees with Lederman that “regular forces” refers to the U.S. military, it could upset almost all of Trump’s domestic military deployments so far. With exception to Los Angeles, Trump hasn’t sent regular military forces to any city in which he’s attempted to deploy National Guard troops.

When he sent troops to Los Angeles earlier this year, Trump simultaneously deployed hundreds of the Marines and federalized members of the California Guard.

Barrett asked Illinois and Chicago, and the DOJ, to submit written arguments in response to her question by Nov. 17, meaning the district court block to Trump’s Windy City deployment will likely remain in place over the coming weeks.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239839741-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 21:00:55.733696

U.S. Department of Justice attorney Jean Lin on Wednesday admitted to Judge Karin Immergut that Oregon National Guard troops were briefly sent to Portland despite Immergut’s order blocking such a deployment.
Lin did not share how many guard troops were sent or who ordered them.
Second federal admission The potential violation of Immergut’s court order is the second misstep federal lawyers have admitted to in recent days.
On Monday, the federal lawyers had to admit to the 9th Circuit that they had misrepresented the number of federal police that were sent to the ICE facility throughout the summer.","The federal government could be in contempt of court for defying a U.S. District Court judge’s order blocking National Guard deployment to Portland.

U.S. Department of Justice attorney Jean Lin on Wednesday admitted to Judge Karin Immergut that Oregon National Guard troops were briefly sent to Portland despite Immergut’s order blocking such a deployment.

The revelation came shortly before the opening of Oregon’s three-day trial against President Donald Trump and the federal government over Trump’s attempts to deploy troops to federal property in the city.

Before opening arguments, Immergut asked Lin whether her order had been defied. Lin told Immergut that between 11 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 4 and 2 a.m. Sunday Oct. 5, about six hours after Immergut issued the first of two temporary restraining orders blocking Guard deployment, members of the Oregon National Guard were sent to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland where protests were ongoing.

Lin did not share how many guard troops were sent or who ordered them.

“We’ll discuss later whether that’s contempt and a direct violation of my TRO,” Immergut told Lin.

In their lawsuit, lawyers for the state of Oregon and the city of Portland allege Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, as well as the agencies Noem and Hegseth lead, violated several laws and the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by attempting to deploy Guard troops to Portland over the objections of state and local elected leaders.

Each of these issues deals with the balance of state and federal power — particularly related to authority over policing within states — and the extent of presidential power over the U.S. military.

The state of California is also a party to the lawsuit, and lawyers for California asked Immergut that she determine in her final order that the roughly 200 California Guard that have been federalized and sent to Oregon, but blocked from deployment, be sent home. Those troops are waiting at Camp Withycombe in Happy Valley.

Trump federalized and attempted to deploy National Guard Oregon, then California, then Texas National Guard troops to protect the Portland ICE facility in late September claiming in a social media post that the city was “war ravaged” and that they were needed to protect federal property from protestors.

Second federal admission

The potential violation of Immergut’s court order is the second misstep federal lawyers have admitted to in recent days.

Late last week, the state of Oregon asked a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out a decision they made granting Trump the power to deploy Guard to Portland because they found testimony submitted by federal lawyers painting a picture of law enforcement woes at the ICE facility were inaccurate.

Federal lawyers had previously told the 9th Circuit judges that a “surge” of 115 Federal Protective Service officers were sent to work 24/7 since June to protect the Portland ICE facility from what Trump administration officials have tried to characterize as chaos and violence by protestors at the building.

But data that Oregon’s lawyers received as part of requests for evidence showed that no more than 31 federal police were present at the facility during any one-month period since June, and that during the three weeks around Trump’s orders to federalize National Guard troops, a low of 20 federal police officers were at the Portland ICE facility.

On Monday, the federal lawyers had to admit to the 9th Circuit that they had misrepresented the number of federal police that were sent to the ICE facility throughout the summer.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC094491-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 19:16:45.204932

The charges are contained in an 11-page federal indictment made public Wednesday accusing the group of conspiring to “interrupt, hinder, and impede” the agent from the “discharge of his official duties” on the morning of Sept. 26. The confrontation marked the height of protests outside the ICE processing facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview in the weeks after the Trump administration launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” a still-ongoing immigration enforcement campaign that has so far resulted in the arrests of more than 3,000 people.

Others charged include Cook County Board candidate Catherine “Cat” Sharp, 45th Ward Democratic Committeeman Michael Rabbitt, and Oak Park Village Board Trustee Brian Straw, all Democrats. They are set for arraignment next week.

During the episode, Abughazaleh and the other defendants — along with roughly two dozen others — surrounded a government vehicle the agent was attempting to drive inside the ICE facility’s perimeter and “banged aggressively” on its hood and windows. The vehicle’s side mirror and windshield wiper were broken during the confrontation, and the word “PIG” was etched into its side, according to the indictment.

Video of the incident, posted to the social media accounts Abughazaleh developed as a progressive activist and conservative media critic before launching her congressional campaign, shows the candidate in front of the vehicle as the agent drove slowly through the crowd.

In addition to the felony conspiracy charge, Abughazaleh and her co-defendants are each charged with misdemeanor simple assault of a federal officer, which does not require physical contact.

The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge April Perry, who has blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Chicago, which the White House claims is necessary due to “violent” protests. But Perry said the feds’ narrative of the protests has been “unreliable.”

Responding to the unsealed indictment Wednesday, Abughazaleh called it “a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent” by “weaponizing the federal justice system.”

“As I and others have exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls and tear gassed hundreds protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors and terrorizing us cannot be our new normal,” she said in a video posted to social media.

A federal judge earlier this month issued a temporary restraining order restricting agents’ use of riot control weapons like tear gas after protesters, journalists and clergy filed a lawsuit over the deployment of tear gas, pepper balls and other crowd-control tactics outside the Broadview facility.

But even as protests outside the ICE facility have calmed, clashes between U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents and civilians in Chicago neighborhoods have resulted in multiple deployments of tear gas in the last week. To account for the alleged violations of her order, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis summoned Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino into her courtroom Tuesday and ordered him to report for daily check-ins for the next week. But the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday stayed the order requiring Bovino to appear daily.

Abughazaleh isn’t the only congressional candidate who’s had a run-in with immigration agents since Operation Midway Blitz began. Earlier this month, state Rep. Hoan Huynh, D-Chicago, who is also running for the 9th District, said a Border Patrol agent pointed a gun at him while he warned residents of Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood of immigration enforcement activity nearby. Yet another 9th District candidate, Evanston Mayor Dan Biss, was tear gassed while protesting in Broadview last month. In a statement Wednesday, Biss called the charges against his opponent “frivolous” and said they should be “dropped immediately.”

Straw, the charged Oak Park trustee, said the Trump administration made a “decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies.” Through his attorney, he said he would “fight these baseless charges.”

State Rep. Lisa Hernandez, chair of the Democratic Party of Illinois, said the indictment was representative of “a hypocritical, tear-gas-loving Administration run on violence, political punishment and suffocating the First Amendment.”

“In this country, protesters are allowed to tell their government, ‘No, we will not stand by and just watch while you disappear our neighbors,'” she said.

“This political prosecution is an attack on all of our First Amendment rights,” Abughazaleh, a progressive influencer and journalist, said in the post. “I’m not backing down, and we’re going to win.”

Currently, Abughazelah is running for an open seat representing Illinois’s ninth congressional district, to the north of Chicago. She is slated to appear on the Democratic primary ballot in March.

Federal prosecutors, however, have accused her and her co-defendants of having “physically hindered and impeded” Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers at a detention facility in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

The indictment said they surrounded a government vehicle, “banged aggressively”, stopped the agent from driving forward, and etched “PIG” on the body of the vehicle. It further alleged that the group broke the vehicle’s side mirrors and a windshield wiper.

Abughazaleh was charged with “conspiracy to impede or injure an officer” and “assaulting, resisting or impeding” a federal agent for the September 23 incident.

Those charged alongside Abughazelah include Michael Rabbitt, a Democratic politician in Chicago’s 45th Ward, and Catherine Sharp, a Democrat running for a seat on the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

The charges come as the administration of President Donald Trump surges federal agents to Democrat-run cities as part of a large-scale deportation drive.

Several Democratic lawmakers have been charged after participating in counterprotests, including Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, and US Representative LaMonica McIver. Baraka has since seen the charges against him dropped.

Trump has also sought to deploy the National Guard to several cities, including Chicago, but has been repeatedly blocked by the courts. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in the Chicago case, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of such deployments.

A federal appeals court was also set to hear a Trump administration challenge on Wednesday to a lower court’s ruling barring the National Guard deployment to Portland, Oregon.

As part of those cases, the Trump administration has faced scrutiny over its treatment of immigrants and protesters alike.

The administration has also been criticised for comparing protesters to “terrorists” and pursuing disproportionate charges in court.

Even Abughazelah’s opponent in the 2026 Democratic primary, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, was among those condemning Wednesday’s indictment.

“The only people engaged in violent and dangerous behavior at Broadview have been ICE,” Biss said in a statement carried by the local news site Evanston Now.

Biss noted he had also protested the “kidnapping of our neighbours” at the facility multiple times.

“Now, the Trump Administration is targeting protestors, including political candidates, in an effort to silence dissent and scare residents into submission,” Biss said. “It won’t work.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/afp_690277c13c3e-1761769409.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-29 19:02:03.900332

Ellis' order for Bovino to appear in person came after she questioned the Border Patrol Chief for more than an hour Tuesday.
Attorneys representing the Trump administration asked Ellis to stay her requests in open court on Tuesday.
The appeals court has also asked that attorneys representing the protesters, clergy and journalists to weigh in by 5 p.m. Thursday.
In an interview with the Telemundo network last Thursday, Bovino said this when asked about Ellis' order:""Did Judge Ellis get hit in the head with a rock like i did this morning?","In a late afternoon call-and-response, a federal appeals court has placed a temporary pause on a federal judge's order that required Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino to appear in court every day before her.

This afternoon, attorneys representing the Trump administration appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay on federal judge Sara Ellis' Tuesday order which - in part - required Bovino to show up in federal court every day at 5:45 p.m. to discuss use-of-force related encounters with protesters or bystanders who object to the increased immigration enforcement operations in Chicago and surrounding suburbs.

Ellis' order for Bovino to appear in person came after she questioned the Border Patrol Chief for more than an hour Tuesday.

Ellis had previously issued a temporary restraining order back on October 9 barring federal immigration agents from using crowd control agents like tear gas or pepper spray on protesters unless there is a threat.

Her TRO came in response to a lawsuit brought by a group of protesters, clergy and journalists who sued the Trump administration alleging that the use of chemical irritants on them have been unnecessary and violated their constitutional rights to gather.

On Tuesday, Ellis ordered that Bovino appear in person after raising concerns about a number of incidents in which protesters, bystanders or their attorneys have alleged that they were tear gassed unnecessarily - and in violation of Ellis' TRO.

The judge has also asked for all use of force reports since ""Operation Midway Blitz"" began in early September and the accompanying body camera footage by the end of business Friday. Bovino will be required to wear a body camera as well.

Attorneys representing the Trump administration asked Ellis to stay her requests in open court on Tuesday.

She denied their requests.

In their appeal to the Seventh Circuit on Wednesday afternoon, attorneys representing the Trump administration wrote that Ellis' order:

...significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis. The court’s order is also untethered to the plaintiffs’ underlying claims and goes substantially beyond what is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the court’s prior orders.""

And later that:

""... Absent a stay, the government will be irreparably harmed because Chief Bovino will be required to prepare and sit for questioning in open court today and every weekday thereafter, with no stated endpoint in sight. Every occasion that Chief Bovino is required to prepare and appear for those daily court sessions is time that he would otherwise spend carrying out the important law-enforcement functions he has been assigned...""

In their ruling late Wednesday afternoon, the appeals court temporarily stayed Ellis' order that Bovino have to appear daily in court - for now - writing:

""IT IS ORDERED that the government’s request for an administrative stay is GRANTED. Pending a decision on the petition for a writ of mandamus, the district court’s October 28, 2025 order is temporarily STAYED only to the extent it required Gregory Bovino to appear in court, in person, each weekday at 5:45 PM.""

The appeals court has also asked that attorneys representing the protesters, clergy and journalists to weigh in by 5 p.m. Thursday.

NBC 5 Chicago has reached out to Department of Justice attorneys asking for clarity on Wednesday's ruling.

It comes as a deposition for Bovino is set for Thursday - ahead of a preliminary junction hearing set for November 5th where attorneys representing the protesters are trying to prohibit further use of chemical agents.

Top deputy officials with Border Patrol and ICE testified last week that the use of chemical agents in at least two cases were justified because protesters either blocked the path of agents trying to leave during an immigration arrest or threw objects at agents.

Bovino himself has been accused by the plaintiffs' attorneys of violating Ellis' temporary restraining order by using tear gas on a crowd that gathered last Thursday in Little Village where agents were conducting more arrests.

Bovino and the Department of Homeland Security said the use of tear gas was necessary because Bovino had been hit in the head by an object. Bovino said it was a rock.

In an interview with the Telemundo network last Thursday, Bovino said this when asked about Ellis' order:""Did Judge Ellis get hit in the head with a rock like i did this morning? I had to apply gas this morning against people. Was she hit in the head with a rock? Maybe she needs to see what that's like before issuing an order like that,"" Bovino said.

Bovino replied: ""We have always followed orders...""",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/10/IMG_5384.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-29 19:57:44.984891

Some Illinois Democrats accused the Justice Department of singling out President Trump’s political opponents for prosecution with the indictment, which was unsealed on Wednesday. The top federal prosecutor in Chicago defended the charges as upholding the rule of law.

For nearly two months, federal agents have flooded the Chicago area as part of the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration, making more than 3,000 arrests and clashing repeatedly with protesters and residents.

The charges unsealed on Wednesday related to a Sept. 26 protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the suburb of Broadview, Ill. Demonstrators have gathered repeatedly at the Broadview site, sometimes blocking access to the driveway and engaging in physical confrontations with federal agents. Those agents have at times used tear gas, pepper balls and physical force against protesters.

The charging document asserts that the defendants were part of a larger group that tried to block a federal agent from driving to the ICE facility that morning. The indictment said members of the group banged on the vehicle, stood in front of it, pushed against it and damaged a side mirror and a windshield wiper. Someone in the group etched the word “PIG” into the vehicle, the charging document said.

All six defendants were charged with interfering with a federal agent and conspiring with one another to interfere with an agent. Both charges can carry multiyear prison sentences.

“All federal officials must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation or threats,” said Andrew S. Boutros, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, in a statement. “As we have warned repeatedly, we will seek to hold accountable those who cross the line from peaceful protests to unlawful actions or conspiracies that interrupt, hinder or impede the due administration of Justice.”

Those indicted included Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic candidate for Congress; Brian Straw, an Oak Park, Ill., village trustee; and Cat Sharp, a candidate for the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

Ms. Abughazaleh, who is running for an open seat in Illinois’s solidly Democratic Ninth Congressional District, said in a video posted online that “this is a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent.” That seat, which includes part of the North Side of Chicago and several suburbs, is now held by Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat who is not seeking another term.

Ms. Sharp said in a statement that “I am confident that a jury of my peers will see these charges for exactly what they are — another effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Mr. Straw said in a statement that “the Trump Justice Department’s decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies will not deter me from fulfilling my oath of office.” He added that “I will fight these baseless charges, and I will continue to stand with and protect our immigrant neighbors.”

The unsealing of the indictment in Illinois came on the same day that federal prosecutors in California announced the arrests of 10 people accused of breaking the law during protests of immigration enforcement in that state. The officials said that an 11th defendant was in state custody and was expected to be transferred to the federal authorities, while they declared a 12th person a fugitive.

Nine of the defendants in California were accused of obstructing, impeding and interfering with law enforcement during a large demonstration in downtown Los Angeles on June 8. The protest, which grew chaotic at times, occurred the day after President Trump ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to Southern California.

In Illinois, the tactics of federal officers have come under repeated scrutiny in recent weeks as agents have been filmed using tear gas on protesters and bystanders while making arrests. Federal officials have said force has been used appropriately after agents have come under direct threats. A federal judge, Sara L. Ellis, placed restrictions on agents’ actions after a lawsuit accused them of indiscriminately deploying tear gas and using force.

During a hearing this week, Judge Ellis, an Obama appointee, voiced concern that agents had not always followed her restrictions. She ordered a senior Border Patrol official, Gregory Bovino, to appear in her courtroom each weeknight to discuss that day’s enforcement activities. Mr. Bovino had been expected to make his first such trip to court on Wednesday evening, but a federal appellate court temporarily blocked that requirement shortly before the hearing was set to begin.

The court intervened on Wednesday before Greg Bovino’s first late afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis.

Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening. It is an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by agents in the city. The operation has produced more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Ellis's order followed enforcement actions in which tear gas was used, including in a neighborhood where children had gathered for a Halloween parade on the city's Northwest Side. Neighbors had joined in the street as someone was arrested.

“Halloween is on Friday,” she said. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News, Bovino defended federal agents' actions and said he was eager to talk with the judge.

“If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s going to have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,"" Bovino said. ""I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here.”

Among those who face charges related to impeding federal law enforcement is Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate indicted along with five other people over allegations they blocked a federal immigration enforcement building in the Chicago suburbs. The indictment was unsealed Wednesday.

Abughazaleh said in a social media post that the prosecution was an “attempt to silence dissent.”

The Chicago court actions came as groups and officials across the country have filed lawsuits aimed at restricting federal deployments of National Guard troops.

The administration will remain blocked from deploying troops in the Chicago area until at least the latter half of November, following a U.S. Supreme Court order Wednesday calling on the parties to file additional legal briefs.

The justices indicated they would not act before Nov. 17 on the administration's emergency appeal to overturn a lower court ruling that has blocked the troop deployments.

A federal trial seeking to block a troop deployment in Portland, Oregon, got underway Wednesday morning with a police commander describing on the witness stand how federal agents at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building repeatedly fired tear gas at nonviolent protesters.

In Chicago, Bovino, who is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was to sit for a daily 5:45 p.m. briefing to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, Ellis said. The check-ins were to take place until a Nov. 5 hearing in a lawsuit from news outlets and protesters who say agents have used too much force during demonstrations.

Ellis also demanded that Bovino produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz.

The judge expressed confidence Tuesday that the check-ins will prevent excessive use of force in Chicago neighborhoods.

Ellis previously ordered agents to wear badges, and she’s banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She subsequently required body cameras after the use of tear gas raised concerns that agents were not following her initial order.

Ellis set a Friday deadline for Bovino to get a camera and to complete training.

Such foreign nationals will need a formal approval of their renewal application and receipt of a new physical EAD.

Under the automatic extension practice, foreign nationals who had timely filed an application to renew their EAD in certain categories would receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization validity anywhere between 180 days through 540 days from the expiration date of their current EAD, while their renewal application are pending.

DHS states that ending this practice will better allow the “proper screening and vetting” of foreign nationals, as well as fraud detection.

Under the new interim final rule, as of Oct. 30, 2025, foreign nationals who file to renew their EAD will no longer receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization. Rather, they would need to wait for a formal approval of their renewal application and receipt of a new physical EAD to extend their employment authorization.

DHS has identified limited exceptions to the interim final rule, including extensions provided by law or through a Federal Register notice for Temporary Protected Status-related employment documentation. Further, DHS has confirmed that the interim final rule does not affect EADs automatically extended prior to Oct. 30, 2025.

In light of these changes, USCIS advises that foreign nationals should apply to renew their EADs as soon as possible, up to 180 days before their current EAD expires. Foreign nationals who may be eligible to renew their EADs under premium processing, may wish to do so. These actions can help minimize any potential lapse in their employment authorization.

However, due to the unpredictable fluctuations in EAD processing times and the limited availability of premium processing or expedited review in most employment authorization categories, temporary lapses in employment authorization may occur, even for foreign nationals who file an EAD renewal application at the earliest possible instance.

The one-page suspension by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came before Greg Bovino’s first late-afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the courthouse in downtown Chicago.

Ellis ordered the meetings Tuesday after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by government agents working Operation Midway Blitz, which has resulted in more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Bovino told Fox News that he was eager to talk to Ellis. But government lawyers were appealing her decision at the same time, calling it “extraordinarily disruptive.”

“The order significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis,” the Justice Department argued.

“We are thrilled this act of judicial overreach has been paused,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Attorneys still met with Ellis in the evening to discuss logistics in the evidence-gathering phase of the case. They agreed to a 9 p.m. deadline to submit body camera recordings of federal agents using tear gas on people in the predominantly Mexican American neighborhood of Little Village last week.

Judge troubled by tear gas

Lawyers for news outlets and activists whose lawsuit alleging excessive force by agents in and around Chicago prompted the judge to order the briefings from Bovino have until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond in the appeals court.

Ellis’ order followed the use of tear gas in a neighborhood where children gathered for a Halloween parade last weekend on Chicago’s Northwest Side. Neighbors joined in the street as someone was arrested.

“Halloween is on Friday,” the judge said Tuesday. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

Bovino defended agents’ actions.

“If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s going to have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino told Fox News. “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here.”

Related cases in many courts

Meanwhile prosecutors filed charges against Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate, and five other people over protests at an immigration enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago. The indictment unsealed Wednesday accuses them of illegally blocking an agent’s car on Sept. 26.

Abughazaleh called the prosecution an “attempt to silence dissent.”

The Chicago court actions came as groups and officials across the country have filed lawsuits aimed at restricting federal deployments of National Guard troops.

President Donald Trump’s administration will remain blocked from deploying troops in the Chicago area until at least the latter half of November, following a U.S. Supreme Court order Wednesday calling on the parties to file additional legal briefs.

The justices indicated that they would not act before Nov. 17 on the administration’s emergency appeal to overturn a lower-court ruling blocking the deployments.

In Portland, Oregon, a federal trial seeking to block a troop deployment got underway Wednesday morning with a police commander describing on the witness stand how federal agents at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building repeatedly fired tear gas at nonviolent protesters.

Judge wants real-time updates

In Chicago, Bovino, who is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was to sit for daily 5:45 p.m. briefings to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, Ellis said. The check-ins were to take place until a Nov. 5 hearing.

Ellis also demanded that Bovino produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz.

The judge expressed confidence Tuesday that the check-ins would prevent excessive use of force in Chicago neighborhoods.

Ellis previously ordered agents to wear badges and has banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She subsequently required body cameras after the use of tear gas raised concerns that agents were not following her initial order.

Ellis set a Friday deadline for Bovino to get a camera and to complete training.

That distinction, he said, could give them an edge in an administration heavily invested in increasing the number of immigration arrests and deportations.","Border Patrol agents have carried out more arrests in the Chicago area than their counterparts at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, illustrating the expanded role they are playing far away from U.S. borders under the Trump administration, internal federal government data obtained by CBS News indicates.

This week, arrests by Customs and Border Protection in the Chicago-area ""Midway Blitz"" operation surpassed those recorded by ICE, the agency that is, on paper, responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws in the interior of the country.

Since Sept. 16, agents at CBP have recorded roughly 1,500 arrests in the Chicago region, compared to over 1,400 arrests carried out by ICE officers, according to the internal Department of Homeland Security figures. In mid-October, ICE's arrest tally in the Chicago operation was higher, totaling around 1,000, compared to roughly 800 arrests recorded by CBP at the time.

The government figures underscore the unprecedented way the second Trump administration has used Border Patrol agents, whose work has been historically limited to intercepting the illicit movement of people and drugs along the borders with Canada and Mexico, as well as some coastal sectors.

As part of its nationwide mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has dispatched teams of green-uniformed Border Patrol agents across the country, instructing them to arrest suspected unauthorized immigrants in major Democratic-led cities.

That effort has been spearheaded by Gregory Bovino, an outspoken Border Patrol sector chief who has personally led arrest operations, first in Los Angeles and Sacramento over the summer, and most recently in Chicago. He has gained infamy among critics who denounce his agents' tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate, as well as support among those who view him as an effective, no-nonsense enforcer of President Trump's aggressive clampdown on illegal immigration.

Over the summer, sweeping ""roving patrols"" by Border Patrol agents in the Los Angeles area targeted day laborers at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes, triggering widespread local backlash, including accusations of racial profiling that federal officials have strongly denied.

Nearly identical scenes have played out in the Chicago area in recent weeks, where the Border Patrol teams led by Bovino have conducted similarly aggressive operations, prompting protests and confrontations with local residents and activists. Videos posted on social media have depicted cases of Border Patrol agents chasing individuals in densely populated areas or being confronted by angry residents. Bovino has joined agents on some of those Chicago-area operations, as well as outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, where protesters have gathered for weeks.

On Tuesday, Bovino was summoned before a federal judge in Chicago who has ordered his agents to limit their use of force against protesters and to generally give them two warnings before deploying chemical agents. The judge told Bovino to ensure his agents comply with the order, citing several cases of them deploying tear gas, including one incident she said affected children getting ready for a Halloween parade.

Federal officials have said they've deployed tear gas in volatile situations and to protect agents. In an interview with CBS News earlier this month, Bovino said, ""the use of force that I've seen has been exemplary — the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission.""

Border Patrol's actions have caused tensions inside DHS, where some ICE leaders feel their counterparts' operations have become too aggressive and controversial, undermining public support for Mr. Trump's mass deportation pledge, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.

Though anyone found to be in the U.S. illegally is eligible to be arrested under the Trump administration, routine ICE operations are typically targeted in nature, informed by previous intelligence gathering and surveillance and aimed at arresting people in the country unlawfully who also have criminal records. ICE officials have privately argued the focus should be on arresting those with criminal records, not undertaking more indiscriminate and visible sweeps in locations like Home Depot parking lots, sources familiar with the internal deliberations told CBS News.

But in a sign that top Trump administration officials think Border Patrol's aggressive style can help boost deportation levels, CBS News reported earlier this week that officials made plans to reassign roughly half of ICE's 25 field office directors and, in many cases, replace them with CBP officials.

DHS, which oversees both ICE and CBP, said in a statement to CBS News Wednesday the department ""is one team and we have one fight, to secure the homeland.""

""DHS has arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens, including rapists, murderers, and gang members, as part of DHS's Operation Midway Blitz,"" the department added.

The vast majority of CBP personnel deployed to Chicago are Border Patrol agents, though some officers from its Office of Field Operations branch are also there. As federal immigration officers, Border Patrol agents, like ICE officers, have the authority to stop people they suspect are in the U.S. illegally anywhere in the country, though they have heightened search and seizure powers near border areas.

Matt Hudak, who started at the Border Patrol in the late 1990s until retiring as deputy chief in 2023, said the way the Trump administration has deployed Border Patrol agents to U.S. cities is ""unique,"" though he emphasized their nationwide immigration authorities.

Hudak said the administration is increasingly turning to Border Patrol for interior immigration enforcement because the agency has roughly 20,000 agents — significantly more than ICE's team of fewer than 6,000 deportation officers. Border Patrol is also no longer facing a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, where government figures show illegal crossings have plummeted to a 55-year low after soaring to record highs under the Biden administration.

But Hudak said Border Patrol agents can also operate in a ""faster-paced"" and more ""forward-leaning"" way compared to ICE officers, whose approach to arrests is ""methodical"" and slower. That distinction, he said, could give them an edge in an administration heavily invested in increasing the number of immigration arrests and deportations.

""It's just like a baseball game, right?"" Hudak said. ""If you're not getting the scoring, the game's not going the way you want, you look at another head coach, or you change pitchers during the game to get that different result.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/29/04af6a81-60bf-4832-89c0-3028d375f127/thumbnail/1200x630/ed57edd01f68d208127a77669b7eac84/gettyimages-2243444780.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 21:00:46.002942

“That is the fundamental challenge,” said a person close to the Trump administration, also granted anonymity to speak candidly.
But there is significant friction among the Trump administration’s top immigration officials.
“Border Patrol, as a general matter, is more equipped and better skilled at playing the political game,” said the administration official.","“Border Patrol just wants to go out and arrest every person in the world, and it’s easy for them to do that because they go out and arrest them and they turn them over to ICE,” said an administration official, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “You’re giving ICE all of these cases that aren’t ready to be removed. And that creates a challenge for ICE.”

The dynamic highlights a tension at the center of the president’s second term immigration agenda. Trump officials are eager to ramp up arrests and removals, but continually run up against resource and operational challenges amid an overloaded deportation system.

The Trump administration has seen historic lows for illegal border crossings, and roughly 60,000 migrants are currently in ICE detention, a major increase since the president took office. The number of daily arrests peaked at more than 2,000 but typically hover around 1,000 — far less than the 3,000-a-day target floated earlier this year by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. But even Trump allies continue to question the administration’s deportation figures — citing limited data transparency — and say removals can’t keep up with the pace of arrests, a problem that’s bound to expand.

“That is the fundamental challenge,” said a person close to the Trump administration, also granted anonymity to speak candidly. “The real backlog is with the removal process.”

The GOP megabill, signed by Trump in July, provided DHS with billions of dollars in fresh funding to bolster ICE’s ranks and expand detention capacity, but the build-out process has been slow and ICE has struggled with its hiring. The money has helped, but it hasn’t yet been able to square the mismatch between the White House’s large appetite for better numbers and ICE’s expanding but still limited capabilities.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the administration’s progress and said the president’s “entire team is working in lockstep to implement the president’s policy agenda.”

“The tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves,” she said.

But there is significant friction among the Trump administration’s top immigration officials. Even as they share the same goal, they differ on the best way to accomplish the president’s promises to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, said the administration official and others close to the administration.

Border czar Tom Homan and acting ICE director Todd Lyons, two career immigration enforcement officials, are more cognizant of the agency’s limitations as it expands and are focused on apprehending criminals and immigrants who already have a final order of removal from an immigration judge and can be deported quickly, said an administration official and the two people close to the administration.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Corey Lewandowski, a chief adviser to Noem and a special governmental employee, want to ramp up numbers and are eager to use aggressive tactics to arrest all unauthorized immigrants, the people said.

“It seems to me that [Lewandowski’s] thinking in political terms, whereas, Tom and Todd, I know they’re thinking in operational terms — the operational benefits to doing this, and public safety benefits and safety of ICE officers,” said the person close to the administration. “They didn’t get where they are without understanding the political aspect of it, but that’s not their primary concern.”

DHS did not specifically respond to the notion that there are differing opinions inside the administration, but DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, responding to reports of internal tensions, said it’s “one team, one fight,” led by Noem. In a separate statement to POLITICO, she said the administration is working at “turbospeed on cost-effective and innovative ways” to deliver on mass deportations, citing the megabill that provided DHS funding to hire more ICE officers and expand detention capacity.

“The Trump Administration is on pace to shatter historic records and deport nearly 600,000 illegal aliens by the end of President Donald Trump’s first year since returning to office,” she said. “More than 2 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. including 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and over 527,000 deportations.”

The administration’s latest shift is connected to Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who has led a series of aggressive raids across Chicago and its suburbs, said the official and one of the people close to the administration. Noem and her inner circle are impressed with Bovino’s approach. He has emerged as the key face of the Trump administration’s immigration blitz in sanctuary cities and was ordered by a federal judge this week to report to her daily after reports of combative enforcement in Chicago, including the use of tear gas.

“Border Patrol, as a general matter, is more equipped and better skilled at playing the political game,” said the administration official. “This very much shows how Border Patrol can get in front of DHS leadership and get them to do things that benefit the Border Patrol.”

The efforts build on the Trump administration’s expanded use of CBP agents and Border Patrol officers, as well as law enforcement officials from across the federal government to support ICE’s operations in recent months. Border Patrol, in particular, is a more aggressive agency, and its expanded role will help the administration stoke fear in its targeting of blue cities, said Deborah Fleischaker, who served as ICE chief of staff under the Biden administration.

“Border Patrol and ICE have different missions, and this appears to be part of the effort of trying to import the Border Patrol mission, which is much more militarized, much less constrained and a little more Wild West, and bring that into an agency that historically has been very focused on identifying and enforcing against specific targets,” she said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F48%2Ff4%2Fafca33bb486984a92381bf1e7af5%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2235818079,N,,2025-10-29 17:57:21.626713

Torrance County Manager Jordan Barela told commissioners during a 10-minute meeting Wednesday in Estancia that the ongoing government shutdown might be behind the delay, and said it’s unclear what will happen if the county does not receive a contract extension by Saturday.

Immigrant advocates: NM ICE detention ban should have been on special session agenda

In recent years, Torrance County and ICE have renewed the contract with repeated months-long contract extensions, most recently with a six-month extension enacted in April that expires Friday.

While ICE has not yet provided a new contract, “There have been some discussions back and forth,” Barela told commissioners Wednesday. “It’s my understanding that they are currently working on a 30-day contract amendment. I don’t know to what degree that the government shutdown has any implications with that.”

The commission approved delegating authority to Barela to approve an extension if he receives an amended contract from ICE in the next two days.

If ICE takes until Nov. 1 or later to provide an amended contract, Barela will have to take the matter back to the commission. In the meantime, “I imagine if there’s a lapse in the contract term, that revenue would not be coming into the county and could not be distributed to Core Civic [which operates the jail] for providing the services,” he said.

The brief meeting did not allow for public comment, though about a dozen members of immigration advocacy groups tuned in to the livestream, including some whose profile pictures were quotes from current or former Torrance County ICE detainees alleging mistreatment.

NM advisers to US Civil Rights Commission call for closure of ICE detention facilities

The groups have cited poor conditions at Torrance, including whistleblower accounts from former jail staff and violations from the Office of the Inspector General. They are calling on the commission to cease its contract, and also on state lawmakers to pass legislation that would ban local governments from contracting with ICE.

Commissioners have pointed to the jobs that could be lost in the rural county without the funding from ICE to house detainees. Barela recently testified before a local Civil Rights commission that the detention center employs approximately 93 Torrance County residents, paying them “millions of dollars a year” in salaries and benefits in an “economically depressed area with few substitute sectors of the economy.”

Shortly before Wednesday’s vote, Torrance County Commissioner Linda Jaramillo asked Barela whether detainees would still receive services if the contract lapses.

“I have had discussions with the facility,” he said. “I can’t definitively speak for them, though they do think that for at least a period of time, the services will continue.”

Barela’s answer did not satisfy Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, one of the groups seeking to cancel the contract. He maintains ICE detainees don’t receive the services they need now, even while the contract is in effect.

“We appreciate her concern about people still getting the services,” he said. “But we would also like to remind the commissioner and the public of the ongoing failures of service provision, both from a due process and a human rights standpoint that occur every single day.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-29-at-9.02.58-AM-2048x1104.png,N,,2025-10-29 17:02:25.328600

The indictment, filed last week, alleges that the 26-year old Palestinian American candidate and five other individuals “physically hindered and impeded” a federal agent who was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators”.

Abughazaleh, who is running for Illinois’s ninth congressional district to replace the outgoing Democrat Jan Schakowsky, was charged with conspiracy to forcibly impede or injure a federal agent, and assaulting or impeding the agent while they were performing official duties.

According to the indictment, the group “conspired with one another and others, known and unknown, to prevent by force, intimidation, and threat, Agent A, a United States law enforcement officer, from discharging the duties of his office”.

It alleged that Abughazaleh, along with the other individuals, “banged aggressively” on the agent’s vehicle, “crowded together in the front and side” of the vehicle and “pushed against the vehicle to hinder and impede its movement”.

According to the indictment, the group etched the word “pig” on to the vehicle and broke a side mirror and a rear windshield wiper. It also alleged that Abughazaleh specifically “joined the crowd at the front of the government vehicle, and with her hands on the hood braced her body and hands against the vehicle while remaining directly in the path of the vehicle, hindering and impeding” the agent.

Following the indictment, Abughazaleh, who is known for her large social media platform on which she frequently criticizes Donald Trump’s immigration crackdowns, called the indictment “political prosecution”.

“This is a … gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the first amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges,” she said.

Abughazaleh added: “As I and others exercised our first amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal.

“This case targets our rights to protest, speak freely, and associate with anyone who disagrees with this government … I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism and I’m not going to give up now,” she continued.

Abughazaleh, Michael Rabbitt, Andre Martin, Catherine Sharp, Brian Straw and Joselyn Walsh are each being charged with conspiracy to impede or injure federal officers, according to a federal grand jury indictment that was returned under seal on Oct. 23. Some of those indicted protesters also face individual counts of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers as they protested outside the Broadview ICE facility last month.

Sharp is a Cook County board candidate and currently the chief of staff for Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th), and Rabbitt is a 45th Ward Democratic committeeperson. Martin is Abughazaleh’s campaign field director, and he declined to comment Wednesday.

Straw has served on the Village of Oak Park’s board of trustees in 2023 and also practices as an attorney for a Chicago-based law firm. According to his firm’s web site, Straw has done pro bono work and provided legal support for non-profit organizations with a focus on “immigration, asylum, discrimination and constitutionality issues.”

The indictment focuses on a Sept. 26 protest and accuses the six people charged of surrounding a government vehicle as it approached the Broadview building “with the intent to hinder and impede” an agent from proceeding. According to the indictment, those six, and others, “banged aggressively” on the vehicle, crowded together and pushed against the vehicle.

Someone scratched the word “PIG” on the vehicle and broke a side mirror and windshield wiper, the indictment said. Abughezaleh and others are accused of putting their hands on the hood of the vehicle and remaining “directly” in its path.

“All federal officials must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation, or threats,” U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros said in a statement Wednesday. “As we have warned repeatedly, we will seek to hold accountable those who cross the line from peaceful protests to unlawful actions or conspiracies that interrupt, hinder, or impede the due administration of Justice. The rule of law must always be upheld.”

In a post on social media, Abughazaleh on Wednesday described the case as “yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up.”

“That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges, but I need your help to do it,” Abughazaleh wrote to her followers alongside a fundraising plea. “We cannot diminish ourselves in the face of these tactics; it’s time to unite and show up for humanity, for our rights, for everyone terrorized by Trump’s lawless secret police.”

Abughazaleh has been a regular presence at protests outside the Broadview processing facility, sharing videos on social media of federal agents throwing her to the ground at one point last month.

‘The Charges … Are Ludicrous’

The charges were viewed as an attempt at stiffing protest and dissent against Trump’s government, said some of those facing charges.

“The charges brought against Ms. Sharp are ludicrous,” Molly Armour, attorney for Sharp, said in a statement. “We are confident that a jury of Ms. Sharp’s peers will see them for exactly what they are: an effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Vasquez, who has worked with Sharp for years, said the charges won’t have the effect the Trump administration intends for them to have.

“They want to scare us into submission. It won’t work,” Vasquez said. “With these charges, they’re acting with the same lack of regard for the constitution that we’ve seen from them every day on the streets of Chicago. All we need to say is ‘see you in court.'”

In a statement Wednesday, Straw said he joined the protests at Broadview “because of what is happening to our immigrant neighbors: children zip-tied and shoved into vans, mothers pulled from cars on the way to school, neighbors afraid to go to church or work.”

“The Trump Justice Department’s decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies will not deter me from fulfilling my oath of office,” Straw said. “I will fight these baseless charges, and I will continue to stand with and protect our immigrant neighbors.”

Brad Thomson, an attorney representing Walsh, called the indictment “an egregious attack on First Amendment protected activity” and said that Walsh would be “pleading not guilty to these outrageous charges.”

The Protest At The Heart Of The Indictments

A Sept. 26 social media post by Abughazaleh depicts what appears to be the encounter at the center of the conspiracy indictment.

“At the Broadview ICE facility, an ICE agent tried to run dozens of protesters over with an SUV as we walked on a public crosswalk,” Abughazaleh wrote in the post, which published just before 8 a.m. that day. “He kept driving for about a full football field until ICE barraged us with pepper balls.”

In the 21-second clip, Abughazaleh and about a half dozen others are at the front of a group of protesters crowding around the government vehicle. The crowd chants, “up up with liberation, down down with deportation” as the vehicle slowly pushes forward while Abughazaleh and others hold on to its hood and each other. Multiple people can be seen banging on the vehicle’s hood while others toss stuffed animals at it as the video ends.

The Sept. 26 protest at the heart of the indictment featured hours of conflict between federal agents and demonstrators. Agents deployed rubber bullets, pepper spray balls and pepper spray against protesters — at one point doing so for an hour and a half as outraged protesters crowded in a narrow parking lot adjacent to the facility. The riot-control weapons hit organizers, journalists and photographers who were also at the scene and, at one point, a sniper on the building’s roof fired projectiles that shattered the windows of a nearby business.

Organizers were forced to move locations during that day’s protest because federal officials had erected a fence in the street near the processing center. Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered the removal of that fence after the Village of Broadview filed a lawsuit that said it was put up illegally.

The Justice Department has now charged two dozen people with either assaulting or impeding federal immigration officers in the past month, coinciding with its Operation Midway Blitz effort aimed at enforcing federal immigration laws, according to records reviewed by Block Club.

Five cases were quickly dismissed by prosecutors, including one in which a grand jury refused to return an indictment.

When U.S. District Judge April Perry issued a ruling that temporarily blocked the deployment of the National Guard in Illinois, she pointed to some of those dismissals when questioning the Department of Homeland Security’s “credibility and assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago.”

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

""This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations, beginning on Wednesday. It is an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the city after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by agents.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She's running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

Kat Abughazaleh, 26, a social media influencer and former journalist running for Congress in Illinois’s 9th District, was hit with two counts: conspiracy to impede or injure an ICE officer and assaulting or impeding them while they engaged in their official duties.

She’s charged alongside five others, including Michael Rabbitt, a Democratic committeeperson in Chicago’s 45th Ward, and Catherine Sharp, who is running to sit on the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

Their arraignment has been scheduled for Nov. 5.

Court records show the indictment was handed up by a grand jury last week but unsealed by a federal judge on Wednesday.

The indictment says Abughazaleh and her co-defendants “surrounded” an ICE officer’s vehicle on Sept. 26 as he attempted to reach the immigration enforcement facility in Broadview, Ill., which has become the focus of protests in the area.

The group allegedly “banged aggressively” on the government vehicle and crowded together on the front and side of the car, pushing against it to impede its movement. They also etched the message “PIG” into the body of the car and broke both a mirror and a windshield wiper, prosecutors say.

“It was further part of the conspiracy that the co-conspirators … physically hindered and impeded Agent A and the Government Vehicle such that Agent A was forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators and in doing so slowly progressed towards the BSSA to discharge the duties of his office,” the indictment reads.

In a statement posted to Instagram, Abughazaleh said she was charged for exercising her First Amendment rights over ICE tactics in Chicago, while federal agents have “hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included.”

“Because Chicago doesn’t back down from bullies in masks who teargas our neighborhoods, this administration is resorting to weaponizing the federal legal system to scare us into silence,” the congressional candidate wrote. “But we are not going to be silent.”

If convicted, the conspiracy count carries a sentence of up to six years in prison, and the assault count carries up to an eight-year sentence.

The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge April Perry, who is also overseeing the case regarding President Trump’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to Chicago — in part to help protect the Broadview ICE facility, according to federal officials.

The others charged are Andre Martin, Brian Straw and Joselyn Walsh.

Abughazaleh’s lawyer, Joshua Herman, called the case a “political prosecution that tries to turn dissent and First Amendment opposition to the Trump administration’s cruel policies into a conspiracy.”

“Kat has steadfastly opposed those policies and she will fight these charges with the same principled determination,” he said.

Sharp said in a statement that she’s confident a jury of her peers will “see these charges for exactly what they are — another effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.” Her attorney, Molly Armour, called the charges “ludicrous.”

Straw, a member of the Village Board in suburban Oak Park, called the charges “baseless” and said he would fight them while continuing to stand with immigrants.

“The Trump Justice Department’s decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies will not deter me from fulfilling my oath of office,” he said.

Brad Thomsen, who represents Walsh, called the indictment an “egregious attack on First Amendment protected activity” and said Walsh would plead not guilty.

The court docket did not immediately show defense attorneys listed for Rabbitt and Martin.

Abughazaleh is a former video producer at the liberal watchdog Media Matters for America who has also garnered a TikTok following of more than 289,000 people.

The congressional candidate is running to replace Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who announced in May she would not seek another term, in the northern Chicago suburbs.

Clips of operations, such as those used in the DHS video in question, have been used by administration officials in a minimum of six pro-President Trump immigration agenda videos put out within the last three months, according to the Post.

Dan Lamothe, a journalist for the Post, shot back at the DHS in a post Wednesday on X, saying that the DHS’s post “includes only a Washington Post headline.”

“Here’s the actual story, laying out detailed reporting with receipts,” Lamothe added, featuring a link to the report.

Since Trump’s return to office in January, the administration has heavily cracked down on immigration, increasing raids across the country.

Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons said New York City would experience a higher rate of immigration arrests in the wake of protesters confronting officers amid an operation.

“You will see an increase in ICE arrests because there are so many criminals and illegal aliens that have been released in New York, specifically,” Lyons said on Fox News.

Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., among other cities, have also been targeted by the administration.

“Federal law enforcement officials operating in Seattle are not above the laws of our city,” said Mayor Harrell.

The second order reaffirms that the City has no role in civil immigration enforcement, which is solely the responsibility of the federal government.

Seattle – Today, Mayor Bruce Harrell proposed a new ordinance to prohibit the use of face coverings by law enforcement, with limited exceptions, and require all law enforcement officials to have visible emblems and badges that identify their agency while performing enforcement duties in Seattle.

This legislation puts Seattle on track to be the first city in Washington and one of the first major cities in the country to adopt a mask ban to increase transparency and accountability around federal law enforcement activity, including immigration enforcement operations.

“Federal law enforcement officials operating in Seattle are not above the laws of our city,” said Mayor Harrell. “The Trump administration’s tactic of using masked, unidentified agents to carry out their inhumane deportation agenda with impunity not only erodes accountability but also sows fear in our communities and creates a dangerous possibility for copycat actors. In the face of Trump’s tyrannical militarization of American cities, this ordinance is a concrete step we can take to uphold our local values and protect our immigrant and refugee communities from these unjust actions. My administration remains committed to using every tool at our disposal to protect the safety and dignity of our residents from federal overreach.”

Face coverings include any mask, garment, helmet, headgear, or other item that conceals or obscures the facial identity of an individual, including a balaclava, tactical mask, gator, and ski mask. The ordinance includes exemptions, including medical or surgical masks to protect against transmission of disease, and respirators to protect against toxins or other environmental hazards.

A willful and knowing violation of the ordinance by a law enforcement officer or agency can result in a civil violation and penalty of $5,000. The ordinance will be enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR).

“Accountability is not punishment, it is a promise kept,” said Derrick Wheeler-Smith, Director of the Seattle Office for Civil Rights. “This legislation strengthens civil rights by ensuring that masked or unidentified federal agents, and those pretending to be, are seen, documented, and addressed rather than swept aside. By holding every officer and agency to the same standard, we protect the rights of our immigrant and refugee neighbors and affirm a simple truth: justice is not selective, it is shared.”

The legislation follows the two Executive Orders the mayor signed earlier this month on preparedness and coordination in the event of unilateral troop deployment to Seattle and protecting immigrant and refugee communities from unjust immigration enforcement actions. The second order reaffirms that the City has no role in civil immigration enforcement, which is solely the responsibility of the federal government.

Additionally, the Seattle Police Department (SPD) is currently developing guidance for officers responding to emergency calls where masked or unidentified individuals are detaining people. The increased use of masks and plainclothes officers has led to multiple arrests across the country of civilians impersonating federal immigration enforcement officials, posing a real public safety threat to communities.

“Our officers’ appearance will be consistent when someone calls 9-1-1 for help and Seattle police officers are dispatched. They will show up ready to serve the public with their faces uncovered and their SPD badge and name proudly displayed,” said Seattle Police Chief Shon Barnes. “At our core, we are peace officers, and our goal is to protect people and keep the peace.”

“For our client communities to truly feel welcome, it is essential to have protections in place that promote trust and safety for all,” said Malou Chavez, Executive Director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. “This legislation is an example of the City of Seattle’s leadership seeking to protect all communities, and we hope that other jurisdictions follow suit.”

The City is also developing an ordinance to prohibit staging and operations of federal immigration activities on City-owned properties. This is intended to prevent federal immigration enforcement from using parking lots and similar spaces for staging, which has occurred in other cities like Chicago.

Since the beginning of Trump’s second term, Seattle has advanced multiple legal and legislative steps to protect residents from his administration’s unlawful actions and funding cuts. Efforts include passing legislation that strengthens local protections for people seeking gender-affirming and reproductive health care; a lawsuit over DEI and gender ideology Executive Orders and unlawful conditioning of funds; a lawsuit challenging threats to cities with sanctuary policies; and a lawsuit over frozen counterterrorism funds through the Securing the Cities program.",https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/10/107445313_3180711121967837_4273542399787129931_n.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 16:02:32.139945

NPR reached out multiple times to DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin with detailed questions about their social media campaign.
American culture is all cultures.""","If you were to base your entire knowledge of American current events solely on the social media feeds of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), you could easily conclude that the U.S. is at war. Earlier this month, a recruitment video featured on the agency's social media platforms urged viewers to join ICE, stating: ""under the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Noem, we've reclaimed our border, secured our nation, and have begun to deport these foreign invaders. Equally important as the task of securing our borders is the task of defending our culture - and what it means to be an American.""

The video is part of a social media and advertising blitz to build public support for the current crackdown, and recruit new immigration agents. Homeland Security's stated mission is law enforcement, immigration, travel security and cybersecurity. Its campaign calling for the protection of American culture from invaders has raised eyebrows, and prompted accusations by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch Project, of promoting a White, Christian nationalist agenda.

Consider the agency's Instagram, which has nearly half a million followers: it's a potpourri of pop culture memes, action film quality videos of ICE raids, and paintings of white settlers expanding West as Native Americans flee into the shadows. There's also a lot of re-imagined vintage World War II style posters, often featuring Uncle Sam calling on Americans to join ICE.

Julio Anta, a graphic novelist, says the vintage quality evokes ""the good old days of America, back when America was great."" The World War II themes, he says, are a call to arms, ""trying to inspire this newer generation to see this fight against immigrants as something in line with the greatest generation [who fought in the second World War].""

There's a long history of illustrations demonizing immigrants in America. In the late 1800's and early 1900's, editorial cartoons regularly attacked Irish, Italian, Chinese and Jewish immigrants. There's an infamous 19th century newspaper cartoon of Uncle Sam hovering angrily over a melting pot, the caption reads: ""we can't digest the scum."" In another illustration from 1911, a burly immigrant shines a shoe, the caption is a racial slur for Italians and how much garlic they eat.

Anta notes that DHS's social media artwork today almost entirely features White Americans and a romanticized past. ""When I look at these images, I see predominantly white people in it. This is all about a time when society was great for white people, and trying to bring it back to that time again.""

NPR reached out multiple times to DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin with detailed questions about their social media campaign. She did not respond.

Anta, the son of Cuban and Colombian immigrants, says he's disheartened by the images. He says the rhetoric, combined with the mass arrests of undocumented immigrants, at times with little or no due process, has made him feel unsafe right now as a Latino man. He carries a picture of his passport with him in case he gets stopped. He's taken aback by the recent DHS's recruitment ad which affirms that ""we know what it means to be an American. Everyone knows what an American is.""

""I think when I was growing up I might have felt included by that statement,"" says Anta. ""I was raised to see America as this place that was made up of immigrants, and that the cultures that we all brought made this country a better place. And now we don't even get that.""

42 percent of Latino voters elected Trump, a historic number for a Republican presidential candidate. But about a year into his presidency, polls show a changing picture: a recent New York Times/Sienna poll show 69% of Hispanics disapprove of the President.

The same poll shows 26 percent of Latinos do support Trump.

Among them, Peter Gonzalez, a 66 year old who lives in Tallahassee, Florida. He says he voted for President Trump in large part because he says he wanted illegal immigration controlled. His own parents are Cuban immigrants, but he emphasizes - they came to the U.S. legally.

""I have no problem with immigrants coming into this country,"" Gonzalez says. ""We are all immigrants. But there's a process, there's procedures, there's background checks. All that stuff needs to be done.""

Gonzalez, a retired Coast Guardsman, supports the ongoing immigration enforcement campaign. Gonzalez identifies as Hispanic and white, but says he's no stranger to anti-Latino racism—he faced it growing up. Still, he insists the DHS rhetoric isn't about race. It's about enforcing immigration law. ""I don't feel targeted. I mean, everybody knows my last name. They know that I'm bilingual. I don't feel that the administration is targeting Latinos.""

Gonzalez rarely uses social media. In fact, our interview marked the first time he'd seen DHS's Instagram recruitment posts. Scrolling through them, his discomfort becomes evident. ""Protect your homeland, defend your culture,"" he repeats aloud. ""Why? I'm ok with 'protect your homeland', meaning illegal criminals coming in. But the second part…"" He stops. ""'Defend your culture'? I don't agree with that. American culture is all cultures.""

Gonzalez says he still supports President Trump's immigration crackdown.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1170x658+0+402/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbb%2Fda%2Fc4fa1da6476cbeb0ca963236b99f%2Fprotectdefend-jpg.jpeg,N,,2025-10-29 17:02:29.076984

“This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said, adding that the charges are “unjust.”

Sharp’s attorney, Molly Armour, called the charges “ludicrous,” saying, “we are confident that a jury of Ms. Sharp’s peers will see them for exactly what they are: an effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.”

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a brief in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in a case challenging expedited removal—a process in the law in which border officers can bypass immigration courts and get illegal aliens out quickly. President Trump has expanded this process to its maximum extent authorized by Congress—and the same anti-borders group that had tried and failed to stop him from doing so in his first administration is trying to stop him again.

Before Trump’s first term, and during the Biden Administration, expedited removal was limited to aliens who were caught within 100 miles of any land or sea border and who entered the U.S. without inspection less than 14 days before they were encountered. Using authority granted by Congress, the first Trump Administration expanded the program to include all aliens who are found anywhere in the United States without immigration papers, if they are unable to prove that they have been continuously present in the country for two years. After the weak border enforcement of the Biden interregnum, the second Trump Administration reinstated this expansion.

The plaintiff, and anti-borders activist group, was granted an injunction of the expansion by an activist district court. In its brief on appeal, FAIR shows that the court had no jurisdiction to grant the injunction, because the statute of limitations has run, having begun, under the expedited removal statute, when Trump first expanded the program in 2019, not when he later reinstated that action.

FAIR also shows that the plaintiff’s members—illegal aliens who are not supposed to be in the country at all—lack any protected “liberty interest” in avoiding expedited removal, and thus cannot take the first, necessary step in making out a claim under the Due Process Clause. Even if they could, the expedited removal statute, which provides aliens with notice of the action against them and an opportunity to be heard, affords all the process that is due.

“The Trump Administration has expanded expedited removal to its maximum extent under the law,” said Dale L. Wilcox, executive director and general counsel of FAIR. “This step was made necessary by the tremendous number of illegal aliens in the country, and the immense backlog in our immigration courts. We hope the court sees the major holes in plaintiffs’ case, and does not allow it to slow the removal process down.”

BATON ROUGE – In a stunning violation of a federal court order, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported Chanthila Souvannarath, to Laos. Mr. Souvannarath, who has claims to American citizenship for over 20 years, is now detained in a foreign country despite a federal court ruling that recognized his substantial claim to citizenship and prohibited his removal.

On October 23, Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana issued a temporary restraining order explicitly prohibiting ICE from removing Souvannarath from the United States. ICE deported him anyway.

""ICE just ignored a federal court order and tore yet another family apart,"" said Alanah Odoms, executive director for the ACLU of Louisiana. ""This is the deportation of someone who has strong claims to American citizenship. This administration has shown it will ignore the courts, ignore the Constitution and ignore the law to pursue its mass deportation agenda, even if it means destroying the lives of American citizens.""

Souvannarath was born in a refugee camp in Thailand and entered the United States before his first birthday, receiving lawful permanent residence. He became a U.S. citizen as a minor when his father naturalized and gained sole custody of him, meeting all requirements for derivative citizenship under immigration law at the time.

Despite his citizenship, ICE detained Souvannarath on June 18, 2025, and held him at the notorious Camp 57 detention facility inside Angola prison, Louisiana's former slave plantation turned maximum-security prison. From detention, Souvannarath, representing himself, filed a habeas petition with the federal court seeking recognition of his citizenship and immediate release.

""This should shock the nation,'"" said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. ""The deportation of an individual with a substantial claim to U.S. citizenship represents a catastrophic failure of the immigration system and a flagrant violation of constitutional rights. It raises urgent questions about just how many other people, potentially including other U.S. citizens, have been wrongfully deported because our immigration system does not require legal representation of individuals placed behind bars at jails masquerading as ‘immigration detention centers.’”

""ICE defied a federal court order by deporting Chanthila on Friday,"" said Bridget Pranzatelli, Staff Attorney at the National Immigration Project. ""This should alarm everyone. Federal agencies cannot simply ignore the other branches of government. ICE–like every other federal and state enforcement agency–is bound by the orders of the court. We call for the immediate return of Mr. Souvannarath and for ICE to be held accountable for his flagrantly illegal removal.""

“Mr. Souvannarath's case isn't just about the federal government ignoring a court order,"" said Sarah Gillman, Director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. ""It's about a chaotic system of mass detention that subjects people to abuse behind bars and unjust deportation. This is what happens when you disappear people to notorious, isolated prisons under the guise of 'civil' detention - you end up wrongfully deporting individuals who have pending federal litigation involving their claims to U.S. citizenship.""

The ACLU of Louisiana, along with its partners at RFK Human Rights and the National Immigration Project, are exploring all legal options to secure Souvannarath's immediate return to the United States and hold ICE accountable.

The one-page suspension by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came before Greg Bovino’s first scheduled, late afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the courthouse in downtown Chicago.

Ellis had ordered the meetings Tuesday after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by government agents working Operation Midway Blitz. It has produced more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Bovino told Fox News that he was eager to talk to Ellis. But government lawyers, at the same time, were appealing her decision. Lawyers for news outlets and activists who say agents have used too much force, including tear gas, have until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond in the appeals court.

Ellis’ order followed enforcement actions in which tear gas was used, including in a neighborhood where children had gathered for a Halloween parade last weekend on the city’s Northwest Side. Neighbors had joined in the street as someone was arrested.

“Halloween is on Friday,” she said. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

Bovino defended agents’ actions.

“If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s going to have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino told Fox News. “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here.”

Meanwhile, prosecutors filed charges against Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate, and five other people over protests at an immigration enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago. The indictment, unsealed Wednesday, alleges they illegally blocked an agent’s car on Sept. 26.

Abughazaleh said the prosecution was an “attempt to silence dissent.”

The Chicago court actions came as groups and officials across the country have filed lawsuits aimed at restricting federal deployments of National Guard troops.

President Donald Trump’s administration will remain blocked from deploying troops in the Chicago area until at least the latter half of November, following a U.S. Supreme Court order Wednesday calling on the parties to file additional legal briefs.

The justices indicated they would not act before Nov. 17 on the administration’s emergency appeal to overturn a lower court ruling that has blocked the troop deployments.

In Portland, Oregon, a federal trial seeking to block a troop deployment got underway Wednesday morning with a police commander describing on the witness stand how federal agents at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building repeatedly fired tear gas at nonviolent protesters.

In Chicago, Bovino, who is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was to sit for a daily 5:45 p.m. briefing to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, Ellis said. The check-ins were to take place until a Nov. 5 hearing.

Ellis also demanded that Bovino produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz.

The judge expressed confidence Tuesday that the check-ins would prevent excessive use of force in Chicago neighborhoods.

Ellis previously ordered agents to wear badges, and she’s banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She subsequently required body cameras after the use of tear gas raised concerns that agents were not following her initial order.

Ellis set a Friday deadline for Bovino to get a camera and to complete training.

Lawyers for the government have repeatedly defended the actions of agents, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and told the judge that videos and other portrayals of enforcement actions have been one-sided.

The indictment makes Abughazaleh the latest Democratic figure to be targeted by the Trump administration for challenging the regime’s aggressive tactics.

Abughazaleh shared the news of her indictment on social media on Wednesday. “This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the first amendment,” she says in the video.

The indictment accuses Abughazaleh — whose name is repeatedly misspelled in the document — of bracing her hands on the hood of an ICE vehicle that was attempting to drive through a group of protesters outside of the Broadview Processing Center, ICE’s Chicago command center.

Since announcing her candidacy, Abughazaleh has made ICE’s violent deployment in Chicago a focal point of her campaign, holding press conferences and participating in protests at Broadview. On social media, she’s documented officers reacting violently to protesters presence: Abughazaleh was slammed to the ground in one incident, and hit in the face with a baton during a separate encounter.

“Since I and others have exercised our first amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls and teargassed hundreds of protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors and terrorizing us cannot become our new normal,” she says in the video posted Wednesday. “And because Chicago doesn’t back down from bullies in masks who tear gas our neighborhoods, this administration has resorted to weaponizing the federal justice system to scare us into silence. But we’re not going to be silent.”

Abughazaleh announced her bid to primary Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who has represented Illinois’ 9th District since 1999, in March. Soon after, Schakowsky announced her intention to retire when her current term expires, setting the stage for the first competitive primary in the district in almost 30 years.

Editor’s picks

Abughazaleh was the first to announce in a crowded field that had grown to 18 candidates, including two state senators, a state representative, and Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss. A recent poll, conducted by MDW Communications and commissioned by Abughazaleh’s campaign, showed the upstart trailing Bliss by five points, and well ahead of the rest of the field, with nearly half of the electorate undecided.

According to a Public Policy Polling survey conducted in September, two thirds of Evanston residents oppose the aggressive tactics ICE has used in the city.

The Department of Homeland Security under the Biden administration adopted regulations giving immigrants with pending renewals of employment authorization documents an automatic extension of 540 days.
Exceptions include extensions for immigrants with employment authorization through the Temporary Protected Status program and or extensions provided by statute.
Immigrants with pending renewal claims have already been screened at least once and sometimes multiple times by the government if they’d previously renewed work permits.
“The primary reason for the work permit auto-extension has been the government’s failure to process work permit applications in a timely fashion—routinely leaving immigrants and their employers waiting for over a year.”","The Trump administration is removing an automatic grace period for immigrants with pending work permit renewals, a move that will force out of the workforce many people stuck in worsening administrative backlogs.

The Department of Homeland Security under the Biden administration adopted regulations giving immigrants with pending renewals of employment authorization documents an automatic extension of 540 days. They’d previously received an automatic extension period of 180 days.

Immigrants admitted as refugees, asylum seekers, and dependent visa holders of H-1B workers were among the applicants who benefited from the automatic grace period. Exceptions include extensions for immigrants with employment authorization through the Temporary Protected Status program and or extensions provided by statute.

The interim final rule released Wednesday will take effect October 30. It won’t affect the validity of work permits automatically extended before the rule’s publication, but immigrants who file to renew on or after Oct. 30 won’t receive a grace period.

Immigrants with pending renewal claims have already been screened at least once and sometimes multiple times by the government if they’d previously renewed work permits. But DHS said more frequent vetting allowed by ending automatic extensions will better enable the government to detect fraud.

Joseph Edlow, director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the Biden administration had “prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security.”

“It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended,” he said in a statement. “All aliens must remember that working in the United States is a privilege, not a right.”

Immigrants can file to renew employment authorization documents up to 180 days before they expire. As of June 30, more than 47,000 renewal applications were pending six months or more for asylum applicants and more than 165,000 renewals were pending for all work permit holders.

Without major improvements to processing times, the ripple effects of the move will be catastrophic for immigrants, as well as their employers and communities that rely on them to fill critical jobs, said Conchita Cruz, co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project.

“Asylum seekers and other immigrant workers are valued employees and colleagues, and provide critical services to local U.S. communities,” Cruz said. “The primary reason for the work permit auto-extension has been the government’s failure to process work permit applications in a timely fashion—routinely leaving immigrants and their employers waiting for over a year.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/1c309f8/2147483647/crop/4000x1542+0+672/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2Fd0%2Fabe660d340e0bbb8d299161209eb%2F427710899-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 17:02:34.280457

(WCIA) — The man accused of crashing into a vehicle with four people inside — killing two and sending another two to the hospital — has been issued an immigration detainer, an ICE spokesperson said.

Illinois State Police previously told WCIA that 34-year-old Edwin Pacheco-Meza was traveling eastbound at West Lincoln Street near South Division Street in Westfield Friday evening. He then reportedly crossed the center line and hit a truck head-on. A Coles County board member and his wife were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, ISP confirmed. The other two passengers were taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. Pacheco-Meza and his passenger weren’t hurt.

WCIA previously reported that Pacheco-Meza was facing a charge of reckless homicide and two counts of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol. Now, he is facing three additional charges:

No valid license/ permit never issued

Class B Misdemeanor

Not driving on the right side of the road

Class P Other

Failure to reduce speed

Class P Other

According to ICE, Pacheco-Meza was living in the county illegally; they said he is from Honduras.

ICE said they issued an immigration detainer for Pacheco-Meza, which requests two things from law enforcement agencies:

ICE is asking to be notified “as early has possible” if and when Pacheco-Meza is released.

The detainer requests holding him for up to 48 hours beyond the time they would ordinarily release them. ICE said this would allow DHS time to assume custody.

During a detention hearing on Monday, Pacheco-Meza was denied pretrial release.

ICE added that Pacheco-Meza’s passenger was also living in the country illegally. The 18-year-old is reportedly from Guatemala and is now being processed to face immigration proceedings.

On Sunday, State Representative Adam Niemerg (R-Dieterich) released a statement regarding Friday night’s crash:

“The driver who hit Coles County Board member Mike Clayton and his wife Gail was in the U.S. ILLEGALLY. More lives lost because of failed leadership. Governor JB Pritzker’s reckless policies keep putting Illinois families at risk,” he wrote in a post on social media.

Previously, Illinois State Police told WCIA that Pacheco-Meza was living in Indianapolis.

State Senator Chapin Rose (R-Mahomet) also shared a statement following the crash. Rose said Illinois’ laws protect people living in the country illegally over citizens.

“Worse yet, under Illinois’s idiotic laws that protect illegals and criminals over citizens – laws that Governor Pritzker refuses to fix – the Clark County Sheriff is not even allowed to enforce the ICE order to detain the suspect, Edwin O. Pacheco-Meza,” Rose said in a statement shared to his website. “It is also totally ridiculous that the Illinois State Police have apparently been ordered not to release the citizenship status of the suspect – hiding the basic details of this tragedy from the public at large.”

When asked to confirm if Pacheco-Meza was living in the United State legally, State Police said that they are prohibited from inquiring about or investigating the citizenship or immigration status of any individual in their custody, per the Illinois TRUST Act.

This crash follows a similar tragedy that took place in Urbana at the beginning of 2025. Julio Bol of Guatemala is accused of rear-ending a Honda Civic at University and Coler Avenues in Urbana. The crash ended the lives of 21-year-old Chloe Polzin from Deerfield and 20-year-old Katherine Abraham of Glenview. Three other passengers in the Honda Civic were hurt.

Recent immigration enforcement in Chicago — Operation Midway Blitz — is in honor of Katie, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said.

In a statement sent to WCIA on Tuesday, an ICE spokesperson said the agency is committing to remove people living in the United States illegally.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem will not allow criminal aliens to walk freely on U.S. streets. ICE will continue to prioritize public safety by arresting and removing alien offenders from the U.S.,” an ICE spokesperson said.

The rule does not affect: Automatic extensions already granted by the timely filing of an EAD renewal application prior to the publication date of October 30, 2025; or Automatic extensions provided by law (e.g., Temporary Protected Status (TPS) notices).
Employers are reminded to reverify employment authorization before the current EAD expires as failure to do so may result in significant penalties.","On October 29, 2025, DHS provided an advanced notice of the Interim Final Rule (IFR) titled “Removal of the Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization Documents” (8 CFR §274a.13(e)) to be published on October 30, 2025. The effective date is upon publication in the Federal Register, October 30, 2025, and the comment deadline will be 30 days from publication.

What does this rule do?

This rule eliminates the automatic 540-day extension of certain Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for noncitizens that had timely filed a Form I-765 application to renew their EAD. This rule is applicable to those individuals that have obtained work authorization based on one of the category codes listed by USCIS here. This rule is effective for Automatic EAD extensions for renewal applications filed on or after October 30, 2025.

Who is impacted by this rule?

For EAD renewal applications filed on or after October 30, 2025, applicants – that are not eligible for an exception noted above – will now be required to wait for USCIS adjudication and issuance of a new EAD before continuing employment after their EAD card expires unless they have an alternative option for work authorization.

The rule does not affect:

Automatic extensions already granted by the timely filing of an EAD renewal application prior to the publication date of October 30, 2025; or

Automatic extensions provided by law (e.g., Temporary Protected Status (TPS) notices).

It is important to note that if a noncitizen provides an EAD card as evidence of work authorization with one of the category codes referenced above, together with a Form I-797C (Receipt Notice) that shows a timely filed EAD renewal application filed prior to October 30, 2025, they are still eligible for the 540-day automatic extension.

Why is this rule being published?

USCIS cites national security and vetting concerns, stating that automatic extensions allowed continued employment without full eligibility review and may “allow bad actors to continue to work and generate income to potentially finance nefarious activities that pose an imminent threat to the American public.”

DHS acknowledges that this rule may cause employment authorization gaps and operational strain for employers but asserts that public safety and program integrity take priority.

What are important takeaways for Employers?

Employers are reminded to reverify employment authorization before the current EAD expires as failure to do so may result in significant penalties. It is even more essential that employers track the expiration of work authorization for noncitizens and take appropriate employment action if an individual is unable to provide evidence of continued work authorization – either through a timely filed extension (if applicable) or a new work authorization document (if applicable).

Actions employers can take:

Remind employees to file renewal applications early.

Review current EAD cards to determine potential lapses in work authorization and prepare accordingly.

Plan for increased processing delays and employment disruptions during USCIS backlogs.

Provide immediate notice to any eligible individuals to file the extension/renewal EAD applications online via the myUSCIS account today, October 29, 2025. Such individuals include:

(a)(12) – Temporary Protected Status granted(c)(3)(A) – F-1 student, pre-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT);(c)(3)(B) – F-1 student, post-completion OPT;(c)(3)(C) – F-1 student, 24-month extension of OPT for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students;(c)(8) – Application for Employment Authorization Based on Pending Form I-589, Application for Asylum or for Withholding of Removal, and Applicants for Pending Asylum under the ABC Settlement Agreement;(c)(11) – Paroled for urgent humanitarian or significant public benefit purposes;(c)(19) – Certain pending TPS applicants who USCIS has determined are prima facie eligible for TPS and who may then receive an EAD as a “temporary treatment benefit” under 8 C.F.R. 244.10(a); or

(c)(33) – Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) You must have a pending or approved Form I-821D to file Form I-765.

EXCLUSIVE – Federal authorities on Wednesday arrested an anti-ICE protester who allegedly damaged a vehicle belonging to immigration agents during a pot farm raid over the summer near Los Angeles.

Fox News was exclusively embedded with Homeland Security during the pre-dawn arrest of Isai Carrillo, who was taken down by agents in a dark alleyway.

The pre-dawn raid targeted two anti-ICE activists who federal authorities say played a lead role in the disturbing, viral video that shows activists bottlenecking immigration agent’s cars and then violently smashing-in their windows during a notable pot farm raid in Camarillo, Calif., over the summer.

Carrillo was captured on video dramatically smashing in federal agents' windows on the pot farm. A female, a known anti-ICE ""agitator"" who allegedly trails agents and posts videos, was also wanted at the same address as Carrillo.

However, she escaped arrest Wednesday morning and is potentially going to be named a fugitive, authorities said.

Wednesday's arrests were part of a broader, sweeping take down across Los Angeles of suspects wanted for allegedly engaging in violence against law enforcement during this summer’s chaotic protests across the city.

Around 10 arrests are expected to be announced, Fox News has learned.

The raids allegedly associated with Carrillo happened in July when federal authorities targeted Glass House Farms in Camarillo and another site in Carpinteria.

More than 300 people were arrested, and one farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse roof. In addition, 14 minor immigrant children were found on the properties, authorities said.

The raids were part of the Trump administration's ongoing immigration enforcement operations.

U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick last week ordered U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep Chanthila “Shawn” Souvannarath, 44, in the United States while he presented what the judge called his “substantial claim of U.S. citizenship,"" court records show. He was born in a refugee camp in Thailand but was granted lawful permanent residence in the U.S. before his first birthday, according to court filings.

But Souvannarath on Sunday messaged his wife on WhatsApp and told her he was in Dongmakkhai, Laos, according to a screenshot she shared with The Associated Press. The message ends with “love y'all.”

“It is very unfortunate, especially for the children that we have together,” Beatrice Souvannarath told AP.

Emails, phone calls and text messages sent to ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security were not immediately returned.

The ACLU of Louisiana, which is representing Souvannarath, called the deportation a “stunning violation of a federal court order.” Before his deportation, Souvannarath had been detained at a newly opened ICE facility at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.

“ICE just ignored a federal court order and tore yet another family apart,” said Alanah Odoms, executive director for the ACLU of Louisiana, in a statement. “This administration has shown it will ignore the courts, ignore the Constitution and ignore the law to pursue its mass deportation agenda, even if it means destroying the lives of American citizens.”

The deportation comes as Trump administration officials have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants. There have been previous cases of U.S. citizens being deported, including U.S.-born children.

Chanthila Souvannarath was taken into ICE custody in June following an annual check-in with immigration authorities in Alabama, where he had been living, his wife said.

“When he went to check in, they detained him. And our two younger kids were with him,"" Beatrice Souvannarath told AP. ""It was the hardest two months of my life.”

He spent much of his childhood living with one or both of his parents in Hawaii, Washington state and California. His father, a native of Laos, is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and Souvannarath claims his citizenship derives from that status.

“I continuously lived in the United States since infancy,” Souvannarath wrote in a letter from immigration detention, “and I have always considered myself an American citizen.”

Souvannarath filed an emergency motion seeking to delay his deportation. Dick, the federal judge based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, issued a temporary restraining order Thursday, citing the “irreparable harm that would be caused by immediate deportation.”

""Though the government has an interest in the enforcement of its immigration laws, the potential removal of a U.S. citizen weighs heavily against the public interest,"" wrote Dick, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Barack Obama. Souvannarath would be “unable to effectively litigate his case from Laos,"" she added.

The court docket shows no changes in Souvannarath’s case since the judge issued the temporary restraining order, which was set to expire Nov. 6. Dick declined to through her office to comment.

Democratic leaders attending the APEC summit should speak strongly in reaffirming that human rights and democratic principles are universal standards enshrined in international law.
Democratic governments meeting at APEC need to stand up and defend the international system and its vital systems and institutions.","U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will meet on October 30 during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Gyeongju, South Korea. Media headlines will focus on trade and tariffs. But away from the limelight of the great powers boxing ring and the fears about how China-U.S. competition is impacting global economics, what lurks in the shadows is far more disturbing.

The meeting comes at a time of intensifying authoritarianism, accelerating democratic backsliding, and general deterioration in the international order, fueled in large part by Trump’s and Xi’s attacks on the international human rights system.

With both China and the United States, the attacks on international norms are linked to abuses at home.

In China, Xi started his tenure in late 2012 with an explicit focus on seven political “perils,” including universal values and human rights. Since then, repression has intensified across China, and radiated from its borderlands to outside its borders, as Beijing subjected Uyghurs to crimes against humanity, eradicated freedoms in Hong Kong, and expanded harassment and surveillance of diaspora communities abroad.

In the U.S., in just nine months in office Trump has quickly ramped up attacks on democratic norms that began during his first term. His administration is now threatening the very foundations of democratic rule in the United States, disregarding the country’s constitutional system of checks and balances while threatening institutions perceived to be critical of him. He has deployed the national guard in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere, and greatly expanded abusive immigration raids and forced deportations without due process.

On the international stage, both leaders’ hostility toward people’s inherent dignity and the rule of law has translated into efforts to openly undermine the United Nations’ core human rights infrastructure and its multilateral agencies. Each government has worked in its own way to undermine the International Criminal Court, the court of last resort for grave international crimes.

The U.S. has curtailed its voluntary contributions to the United Nations and withdrawn from numerous U.N. institutions that other governments attending APEC have invested in for decades, including the World Health Organization and the U.N. Human Rights Council, and other multilateral agencies that promote global action against epidemics, atrocity crimes, and climate change.

China, although having long presented itself as a champion of multilateralism at the U.N., has been aggressively silencing criticism at the U.N. of its own human rights record. It has repeatedly sought to defund U.N. human rights institutions, block or weaken U.N. resolutions on civil society, human rights defenders, and peaceful protests, and advanced innocuous-sounding concepts like “win-win cooperation” that are meant to dilute the concept of accountability.

These actions, alongside Russia’s similarly destructive actions against the U.N. system, appear aimed to dismantle the international human rights system and multilateral action, and cement a more lawless world order in which geopolitical strength reigns supreme.

At a summit dominated by two leaders who have demonstrated such utter hostility to the international system, human rights law, and democratic principles, how should rights-respecting, democratic countries respond?

With courage and conviction.

Democratic leaders attending the APEC summit should speak strongly in reaffirming that human rights and democratic principles are universal standards enshrined in international law. They should unabashedly defend the U.N. system and the international rule of law. They should publicly state their opposition to attacks on multilateral institutions by both China and the U.S. and call on both to restore and sustain U.N. funding.

Democratic governments should also pledge to establish an Asia Democracy Defense Fund, to mitigate the harm to human rights defenders and civil society in the region. A fund would provide a vital lifeline to human rights defenders and independent journalists now increasingly at risk due to growing repression and cuts to U.S. foreign funding.

Democratic leaders should also forge an action plan to create safe havens in democratic countries in Asia and across the world, so activists and journalists – many of them now in exile – can continue to function effectively. The action plan should include a special resettlement stream for human rights defenders, similar to one created in Canada, to protect activists from cross-border repression and other.

The U.S. and Chinese governments’ attacks on the international order are undermining global institutions and efforts that many governments in the rest of the world care deeply about, and have invested in, for decades. Democratic governments meeting at APEC need to stand up and defend the international system and its vital systems and institutions.

The speakers will present their academic arguments, drawing on their academic writings, and suggest litigation strategies for those contesting immigration detention, and provide guidance for judges seeking to vindicate the rule of law and fundamental rights.

The speakers will discuss the paper titled “The Pre-Removal Detention of Immigrants: A Return to Ordinary Meaning” by Bas Schotel and Ingo Venzke.

About the paper:

The EU Return Directive demands that immigrant detention be as short as possible, but, by logical implication, this also means that detention can be as long as necessary. What concerns the maximum length of detention, the Return Directive is remarkably generous: Immigrants can be detained for a period of up to eighteen months—a deprivation of liberty that is otherwise justified only as punishment for serious crimes. The practice of such long-term detention, now burgeoning, is highly questionable for moral, practical, and—our focus—legal reasons.

The European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) provides the relevant yardstick. While discussions on the legality of immigrant detention have focused on requirements of necessity, we shift attention towards the surprisingly absent question of maximum duration. Our analysis delves into the drafting context of the ECHR to reveal that it only authorizes the pre-removal detention of immigrants for markedly short periods. Picking up the interpretative canon of the regime, we note that meanings can of course change, but we argue that it is a legal mistake to consider that long-term detention is now sanctioned by the Convention.",https://www.hertie-school.org/fileadmin/_processed_/c/3/csm_Event_Immigration_Detention_Establishing_Clear_Boundaries_in_International_Human_Rights_Law_6f01cc1e79.png,N,,2025-10-29 16:02:36.375154

Each person who leaves brings Trump one step closer to his purported goal of removing millions of immigrants from the country.
And while Trump promised to target criminals, immigrants with no criminal record comprise the largest group of people being held.
Although he had followed all government orders and broken no laws, he was sent to immigration detention and fast-tracked for deportation.
Agents have arrested over 1,600 people who appeared for routine hearings only to be snatched by armed, masked ICE agents.","Under the Trump administration, thousands of people who have not broken any laws currently sit trapped in detention centers without any idea if or when they will be able to return to their families and communities. In addition, they’re enduring terrible conditions such as extreme overcrowding, inadequate food and hygiene, and lack of access to legal counsel.

The administration’s agenda is clear: forcing immigrants to endure months or even years of detention under inhumane conditions while their cases make their way through the backlogged immigration system ensures that people will give up and agree to return to their home countries. Even when their cases are likely to succeed, eventually giving them the right to remain lawfully in the U.S., many are unwilling to endure the squalor and uncertainty.

There are some signs the plan is working. The AP recently reported that, while it’s impossible to know how many immigrants have fled the U.S. voluntarily since Trump took office, “The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts, said judges granted ‘voluntary departure’ in 15,241 cases in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30. That compares with 8,663 voluntary departures for the previous fiscal year.”

Trump’s mass deportation agenda involves flooding America’s streets, businesses, and courthouses with ICE agents to terrorize, arrest, and detain immigrants in intolerable conditions for long periods of time. The ultimate goal is to dramatically increase the number of people who are deported from America, many of whom have legally valid bases to stay in the country.

Thousands of New Yorkers Swept Up, Detained, Deported

Trump isn’t just keeping immigrants locked up for longer while their cases wind slowly through immigration court. His administration is also arresting, detaining, and deporting more people.

A Times Union analysis of ICE data found that agents arrested over 4,600 New Yorkers in the first seven months of 2025, more than the total number arrested in the year prior. Some New Yorkers were arrested on their way to work, waiting at bus stops, or taking their children to school. Most appeared to have ongoing immigration cases.

The number of people deported also surged during these months, the Times Union reports. Over 300 people arrested by ICE were deported between January and July, with at least 170 leaving voluntarily – six times the number of people who did so in 2024.

The harm caused by the Trump administration’s action is immeasurable. Whether trapped in a detention facility or on the other side of the border, tearing New Yorkers from the lives they have built here has devastating ripple effects. Children lose the loving presence of their parent. Families lose their income, their homes, and their vehicles. And employers lose their best workers, leaving them unable to fulfil contracts. Whole communities, our economy and our state suffer under Trump’s mass deportation scheme.

An Impossible Choice

Prolonged detention – in deplorable conditions – has increasingly become a threat hanging over the heads of people who entered the country legally and have broken no law.

They face a cruel ultimatum: to deport themselves voluntarily or remain in detention for however long it takes their immigration cases to navigate the overburdened system.

Each person who leaves brings Trump one step closer to his purported goal of removing millions of immigrants from the country. ICE detentions have ballooned since he took office in January, reaching a record high of over 60,000 in August. And while Trump promised to target criminals, immigrants with no criminal record comprise the largest group of people being held.

Under previous administrations, immigrants were primarily arrested by Customs and Border Patrol agents in regions close to the border, often shortly after entering the country. But ICE agents are now making a majority of arrests in the country’s interior, spreading fear among immigrants who having been living in their communities for years and even decades.

How We’re Fighting Back

Critically, the government does not have authority to indefinitely detain anyone who is not a flight risk or a danger to others. Stripping people of their right to release is not only cruel, it’s illegal.

Here are some of the ways we are fighting back and demanding that the administration respect the rights of immigrant New Yorkers.

A Teen Illegally Detained by ICE

When 19-year-old Oliver Mata Velazquez dutifully showed up to his immigration court appointment in Buffalo in June, he was abducted by ICE agents. Although he had followed all government orders and broken no laws, he was sent to immigration detention and fast-tracked for deportation. But the NYCLU, Prisoners’ Legal Services of New York, and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights sued. And we won his release. Oliver is now back home with his family, in his community, while his asylum case proceeds.

A Buffalo Asylum Seeker Locked Up for Over Seven Months

We’re working with Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights to secure the release of another Buffalo resident who has been subjected to a prolonged and illegal detention. Our client fled political persecution in Cuba and entered the U.S. legally through the CPBOne app. He applied for legal status under the Cuban Adjustment Act and received work papers and a social security number. But in February of 2025, he was falsely accused of a petty crime and turned over to ICE. The charges were dismissed, yet ICE has kept him detained ever since in the Batavia detention facility near Buffalo – a facility notorious for its egregious conditions.

Weaponizing Courthouses

Since Trump was sworn into office in January, the epicenter of ICE arrests in New York has been the immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. Agents have arrested over 1,600 people who appeared for routine hearings only to be snatched by armed, masked ICE agents. This cruel policy denies people their right to due process and undermines the functioning of our immigration courts, and along with the ACLU, Make the Road New York, and Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel, we’re suing to end ICE’s courthouse arrests.

Inhumane Conditions in ICE Detention Facilities

ICE has been unable to safely hold the surge of people they’re detaining in courthouse arrests, and at 26 Federal Plaza immigrants were made to sleep on the floor of temporary holding cells intended for only hours of use. Yet for days and even weeks at a time, immigrants trapped in these overcrowded quarters were denied changes of clothing, basic hygiene items, adequate food and access to legal counsel. Along with the ACLU, Make the Road New York, and Wang Hecker LLP, we sued to put a stop to this inhumane treatment, and a judge granted a preliminary injunction requiring the government to reduce overcrowding, provide sleeping mats, improve access to hygiene and ensure that people can make unmonitored calls to their lawyers within 24 hours of being detained.

A Bronx High Schooler Illegally Detained

Our client, Joel, is a 16-year-old Bronx high school student. He has special immigrant juvenile status, which generally shields minors from deportation. Yet with breathtaking disregard for both the law and basic human decency, ICE agents snatched Joel when he showed up for a mandatory, routine immigration check-in. Along with The Door’s Legal Services Center, we have filed suit to demand his immediate release.

Every year, thousands of immigrants, including many children, leave behind intolerable conditions elsewhere to seek safety in the U.S. They expect a fair chance, not another unbearable situation and an impossible bind. The Trump administration’s rabid attempt to eviscerate their chance to seek justice in our courts is not only cruel, it’s against the law.",https://www.nyclu.org/uploads/2025/10/web24-ice26fed-v1-1200x630-1.png,N,,2025-10-29 13:58:46.000507

In passing that law, Republicans have said sanctuary policies present a threat to the public by allowing, in Ayotte’s words, “dangerous criminals” into communities.","Over the past nine months, Megan Chapman has seen the federal government run deportation flights out of the Portsmouth International Airport.

Chapman heard about several counties considering deals with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with four county sheriff’s offices, seven local police departments and New Hampshire State Police signing onto agreements deputizing them to assist ICE and enforce federal immigration laws.

She watched as the federal prison in Berlin began to house immigration detainees earlier this year. Not long ago, just one location in New Hampshire held detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: the Strafford County Jail, which has done so for decades.

Then, she decided to take action.

Chapman, a human rights lawyer from the North Country town of Albany, is one of many people participating in so-called “sanctuary communities,” a grassroots effort that seeks to create a network of people across New Hampshire to monitor and document ICE activities and advocate against what they call “police-state tactics” by the Trump administration.

“We’ve come together to reaffirm and uphold the best values upon which our nation is built and to root out and cure the worst human instincts that the rhetoric of this moment is trying to unleash,” she told a small crowd at Saint Paul’s Episcopal Church in Concord on Tuesday. “Practically, we must also push back the effort to lay the infrastructure for the authoritarian state and terror regime on our own soil, here in New Hampshire.”

The network of eight groups across the state — some new, others that have existed for several years — seeks to offer trainings on bystanders’ right to witness and record what’s happening in their community, Chapman said.

State Republicans say they’re keeping a close watch on activists and are prepared to punish anyone who crosses the line.

“Threats to law enforcement or efforts to obstruct them will not be tolerated in New Hampshire,” Gov. Kelly Ayotte said in a press release. “If you disrupt law enforcement activity, you will be prosecuted.”

State Rep. Joe Sweeney, the deputy majority leader of the Republican caucus that controls the House of Representatives, warned undocumented immigrants in his statement: “If you are here illegally, you are not welcome in New Hampshire,” he said. “You cannot hide. We will find you and deport you.”

Ayotte signed a law earlier this year banning cities and towns from adopting so-called “sanctuary” and “welcoming” policies designed to keep local police from assisting federal immigration enforcement. In passing that law, Republicans have said sanctuary policies present a threat to the public by allowing, in Ayotte’s words, “dangerous criminals” into communities.

Most people detained by ICE and border patrol have no criminal convictions.

Of the nearly 60,000 people detained in the U.S., less than a third have been convicted of a crime, according to the most recently available federal data. Roughly 15,000 detainees have pending criminal charges, and more than 27,700 people were designated as “other immigration violators.”

As Republicans keep a close watch, activists said they have no intention of breaking the law. They do intend to do everything in their legal rights to protect others from what they view as unlawful actions by ICE.

Bob Baker, an immigrant and a lawyer who lives in Columbia, said federal agents arresting and detaining people off the streets — sometimes while masked and in unmarked vehicles — denies those people of due process in the courts.

Towns and cities in New Hampshire can no longer instruct their local police not to cooperate with ICE, and while lawsuits are an option, Chapman said that path of resistance could jeopardize state or federal funding. Individual community members can still put pressure on institutions, she said.

“By forming a citizens’ movement, No. 1, we make it not about towns and cities and authorities,” Chapman said. “It’s about human beings and citizens saying, ‘We don’t accept this.”

The sanctuary communities plan to host trainings and come up with ways to share information across the network. In the meantime, though, they’re still figuring it out.

“We’re going step by step. We’re not highly sophisticated. We’re just relatively ordinary citizens,” said Larry Brown, an organizer from Lancaster. “This is what citizen movements are about. They grow, and they turn here and there. We don’t know where this is going. We don’t know… if we’re going to be successful, whatever that might mean. This is truly the David and Goliath moment in our history.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.concordmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/P1010137-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-29 11:19:05.578277

(San Francisco Chronicle) — Opponents of Prop 36, the tough-on-crime ballot measure California voters approved last year, say it has failed to provide “mass treatment” for drug offenders.","CAMPAIGN FORESHADOWING — As the shutdown standoff over health care funding drags on, GOP leaders are trying to rope one of California’s signature policies into the debate.

For weeks, the Republicans’ messaging has targeted health care for undocumented immigrants — accusing congressional Democrats of demanding federal dollars flow to people in the country illegally as a condition of reopening the government, while separately charging California with exploiting a federal loophole to pay for its in-state program.

The attacks offer a preview of what Gov. Gavin Newsom — who in 2022 approved a major expansion of the state’s Medicaid program — might expect if he enters the presidential race in 2028. California was the first state to offer health insurance to unauthorized immigrants of all ages with low incomes, and GOP figures have used the program’s very existence to make the case that Democrats prioritize immigrants over U.S. citizens.

“It was Gavin Newsom who made this an issue by doing something no other state has done,” said Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican and frequent Newsom antagonist. “It is an interesting contrast when you have all of these national (Democratic) political figures who are saying ‘no no no, that’s not something we would ever do.’”

Democrats have condemned the Republican attacks as misleading or outright false, accusing them of conflating state and federal programs and noting the law prohibits federal dollars from flowing to undocumented immigrants. Newsom has repeatedly called the GOP out for what he calls bald-faced lies about California’s program, which runs entirely on state funding — a point echoed by New York Democrats.

More broadly, Newsom and fellow Democrats argue the GOP is trying to distract from its own record, distorting facts to shift the shutdown conversation away from unpopular health care cuts — including the looming expiration of popular Obamacare subsidies, a central sticking point for Washington Democrats. The governor denounced Republicans’ strategy as “pathetic.”

“It also shows how wrong they are, and the overwhelming now bipartisan opposition to these massive increases in health care costs that are going in effect in January,” Newsom said. “That’s why they’re desperate to paint a different picture.”

But the GOP has a penchant for pivoting to immigration. And if 2020 and 2024 are any indication, it’s likely to be a focus again in 2028. If Newsom is in the race, California’s program is likely to come into the spotlight.

“Republicans are returning to an issue that’s a winner to them: Any time they’re talking about benefits for undocumented or illegal immigrants, that’s a winner for them,” said David Gilliard, a California-based Republican consultant.

California’s program has continually courted controversy. Newsom has defended it as fiscally wise and morally righteous. But he pared the initiative back this summer as soaring costs helped fuel a massive budget deficit, angering liberal supporters and vindicating Republican foes who had long called the idea unsustainable.

The political dynamics in Republican-controlled Washington are starkly different than in Democratic-dominated states like California. While a national Pew poll late last year found Americans overwhelmingly opposed offering public benefits to immigrants, California voters broadly favor extending coverage to the state’s huge undocumented population. That support rose this summer as Trump threw a deportation dragnet over cities like Los Angeles.

There’s a history there: In the 1990s, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson’s push to cut off state aid to undocumented immigrants drew a stark dividing line in California’s politics, helping to enshrine a semi-permanent Democratic majority by activating a generation of Latino voters and politicians like Sen. Alex Padilla.

“There was a general feeling for many years, post-Pete Wilson, that the Pete Wilson immigration attacks backfired on the (Republican) party,” said Anthony Wright, who heads the health care advocacy organization Families USA and spent years advocating for universal insurance coverage in California. “The temperature was turned down partially because they didn’t want to fall into the trap they felt Pete Wilson did.”

Fast forward 30 years and California’s program even drew bipartisan support as recently as last year, with Republican then-Assemblymember Devon Mathis arguing it reduced cost pressures on straining rural hospitals. But Mathis said in an interview that the White House believes it is channeling the will of voters.

“This is another one of those 80/20 issues,” Mathis said, “where the Trump administration has figured out that people are tired of paying for people who aren’t here legally.”

IN THE COURTS

ESSAYLI RULING — A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, has been illegally serving in the role since July, Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report.

The former Republican Assembly member left the Legislature in April after President Donald Trump picked him to serve in the role. But Essayli should have departed the post by July 31 under a 120-day limit imposed by federal law, U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright concluded.

An unusual maneuver by Attorney General Pam Bondi to extend Essayli’s tenure into 2026 violated federal appointment laws, the Hawaii-based George W. Bush appointee ruled.

“Simply stated: Essayli unlawfully assumed the role of Acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California,” Seabright concluded. “Essayli may not perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney … He is disqualified from serving in that role.”

Essayli emphasized in a post on X that the ruling permits him to continue serving as the highest-ranking official in the office he oversaw, even if he can’t hold the title of U.S. attorney.

“Nothing is changing,” he wrote.

Essayli did not address another possibility: Under federal law, the judges of the Central District of California could appoint some other attorney to fill the U.S. attorney post until Trump can get a nominee confirmed to the post.

The Justice Department declined to comment, while Sen. Adam Schiff criticized the Trump administration for leaving Essayli in place.

“‘Unlawfully serving’ in his role. Acting illegally. But left in place? While this Administration continues to replace career professionals with illegitimate political allies eager to do Trump’s bidding, Californians need better relief than this,” Schiff said in a statement.

POLLING PLACE

WITH VOTES TO SPARE — More than half of likely voters are planning to support California Democrats’ redistricting ballot measure next week, a new poll shows.

The survey from the Public Policy Institute found that, of the 56 percent of likely voters who plan to support the Nov. 4 measure, 95 percent disapprove of how Trump is handling his job, while 86 percent approve of Newsom’s performance as governor. As Juliann Ventura reports, 43 percent of voters say they will be voting no on Proposition 50, according to the poll, which was conducted by Ipsos.

Regardless of political party, nearly 70 percent of likely voters say that the outcome of the special election is “very important” to them.

MORE ON REDISTRICTING

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: AD ALERT — Reproductive Freedom for All will today debut a new ad in support of Proposition 50, Democrats’ Nov. 4 redistricting measure. The group said it’s making a “five-figure” digital buy to target voters in the battleground districts of Republican Reps. Young Kim and David Valadao.

The spot argues that supporting Prop 50 will help “defend reproductive freedom right now,” a familiar argument that Democrats have deployed as they seek to convince voters that passing the measure will help put a check on Trump’s policies and grip on power in Washington.

CLAIM GAME — Newsom and Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara have declared victory over the state’s wildfire insurance availability crisis. But it’s still spiraling, according to new data from the state’s insurer of last resort that shows customers are still unable to find private insurance.

Top Talkers

TAKING A PASS — The GOP’s efforts to redraw congressional maps in red states before the midterm elections are hitting roadblocks from state-level Republicans. As Andrew Howard writes, Trump’s team is finding there are some Republicans who simply won’t budge — despite threats and force — on a legally questionable strategy that would grow the GOP’s advantage in next year’s fight to keep the House.

“Trump absolutely controls the national narrative on a day to day basis … but politics continues to be local,” said GOP operative Matthew Bartlett, a New Hampshire native. “It’s hard enough to run the show on the national level; good luck to you getting way into the details and weeds on a state level.”

BLAME GAME — Several Democratic states are blaming Trump and Republicans in Congress for the government shutdown on government websites, as the funding cliff for the millions who rely on federally funded food aid — which is known as SNAP — rapidly approaches, write Jacob Wendler and Cheyanne M. Daniels.

A POLITICO review of all 50 states and D.C.’s SNAP websites found that most have added notices to state webpages about federal benefits. But a handful of Democratic-controlled states — Illinois, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania — are using the sites to draw attention to their political opponents. California calls out the “failures of Trump and Congress,” which is under GOP control.

SEE YOU IN COURT — Florida’s Attorney General James Uthmeier is once again taking California to court. On Tuesday, Uthmeier announced that he is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a complaint that alleges California’s tax system is unconstitutional and is calculated in a way that penalizes multi-state corporations that relocate. He also criticized Newsom in the announcement.

As Gary Fineout reports for subscribers, Uthmeier argues Florida has no other alternative way to challenge the tax rules being used by California than to file directly with the Supreme Court. Earlier this month, Uthmeier asked the Supreme Court to force California and Washington to stop issuing commercial driver’s licenses to people who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.

FIRED TO HIRED — Newsom has hired Michele Beckwith, the former acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento who was fired by Trump, as a deputy legal affairs secretary, The New York Times reports. “Michele brings to our office more than 20 years of legal experience and invaluable knowledge of the law,” Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Newsom, told the Times. “Trump’s loss is California’s gain.”

BOVINO BACKSTORY — Gregory Bovino, Trump’s top immigration enforcer charged with handpicking new leaders at ICE, first engaged his controversial tactics in California, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. His El Centro sector carried out “Operation Return to Sender,” a surprise January raid in Bakersfield that ensnared U.S. citizens, and he has been on the ground for several immigration raids in California and elsewhere.

Window-shopping for health plans delayed The window for enrolling in ACA health plans begins Saturday.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President JD Vance said Tuesday that he believes U.S. military members will be paid at the end of the week, but did not specify how the Trump administration will reconfigure funding in the second-longest government shutdown.

The funding fight in Washington gained new urgency this week as millions of Americans face the prospect of losing food assistance, more federal workers miss their first full paycheck and recurring delays at airports snarl travel plans.

The building strain on lawmakers to end the impasse was magnified by the nation's largest federal employee union, which called Monday on Congress to immediately pass a funding bill and ensure workers receive full pay. Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said the two political parties have made their point.

""It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship,"" said Kelley, whose union carries considerable political weight with Democratic lawmakers.

Still, Democratic senators, including those representing states with many federal workers, did not appear ready to back down. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said he was insisting on commitments from the White House to prevent the administration from mass firing more workers. Democrats also want Congress to extend subsidies for health plans under the Affordable Care Act.

“We’ve got to get a deal with Donald Trump,” Kaine said.

But shutdowns grow more painful the longer they go. Soon, with closures lasting a fourth full week as of Tuesday, millions of Americans are likely to experience the difficulties firsthand.

“This week, more than any other week, the consequences become impossible to ignore,"" said Rep. Lisa McClain, chair of the House Republican Conference.

Shutdown's impact is set to grow dramatically

The nation’s 1.3 million active-duty service members are at risk of missing a paycheck on Friday. Earlier this month, the Trump administration ensured they were paid by shifting $8 billion from military research and development funds to make payroll. But it is unclear if the Trump administration is willing — or able — to shift money again.

Larger still, the Trump administration says funding will run out Friday for the food assistance program that is relied upon by 42 million Americans to supplement their grocery bills. The administration has rejected the use of more than $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits flowing into November. And it says states won't be reimbursed if they temporarily cover the cost of benefits next month.

The Agriculture Department says the contingency fund is intended to help respond to emergencies such as natural disasters. Democrats say the decision concerning the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, goes against the department's previous guidance concerning its operations during a shutdown.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the administration made an intentional choice not to the fund SNAP in November, calling it an ""act of cruelty.”

Another program endangered by the shutdown is Head Start, with more than 130 preschool programs not getting federal grants on Saturday if the shutdown continues, according to the National Head Start Association. All told, more than 65,000 seats at Head Start programs across the country could be affected.

Will lawmakers find a solution?

At the Capitol, congressional leaders mostly highlighted the challenges many Americans are facing as a result of the shutdown. But there was no movement toward negotiations as they attempted to lay blame on the other side of the political aisle.

“Now government workers and every other American affected by this shutdown have become nothing more than pawns in the Democrats’ political games,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

The House passed a short-term continuing resolution on Sept. 19 to keep federal agencies funded. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of legislative session ever since, saying the solution is for Democrats to simply accept that bill.

But the Senate has consistently fallen short of the 60 votes needed to advance that spending measure. Democrats insist that any bill to fund the government also address health care costs, namely the soaring health insurance premiums that millions of Americans will face next year under plans offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's 13th attempt to advance the House-passed measure failed once again Tuesday.

Window-shopping for health plans delayed

The window for enrolling in ACA health plans begins Saturday. In past years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has allowed Americans to preview their health coverage options about a week before open enrollment.

As of Monday, Healthcare.gov appeared to show 2025 health insurance plans and estimated prices, instead of next year’s options. CMS was expected to temporarily bring back all its workers furloughed during the shutdown, in part to manage the ACA open enrollment period.

Twenty-eight senators, mostly Democrats, signed a letter urging Trump’s administration to let ACA enrollees start previewing next year’s health insurance options on its marketplace website.

Republicans insist they will not entertain negotiations on health care until the government reopens.

“I’m particularly worried about premiums going up for working families,” said Sen. David McCormick, R-Pa. ""So we’re going to have that conversation, but we’re not going to have it until the government opens.”

Congressional leaders dig in deeper

Schumer said Republicans would prefer to shut the government down than work with Democrats in preventing massive spikes in their health insurance costs. He said the average American doesn’t want to pay an extra $20,000 a year to cover their health insurance.

“And we Democrats want to solve this crisis right away,” Schumer said. “So lowering health care is not a crazy demand.”

Vice President JD Vance attended a Republican luncheon on Capitol Hill Tuesday. But with President Donald Trump traveling in Asia and congressional leaders dug into their positions, a quick deal appeared unlikely.

Meanwhile, some rank-and-file lawmakers urged colleagues to consider the impact of their standoff on the lives of federal employees and Capitol police officers who have not been paid for weeks.

“We have got to come together, which means we’ve got to talk to one another,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said in a floor speech urging leaders to stop focusing on who was winning the political fight. “Right now, those that are losing are the American people.""

FEMA teams, now stretched thin up and down the coast, reported widespread harassment fueled by Trump’s claims.
In contrast, Democratic-led states like Maryland and Washington have been denied disaster aid by the president, even when their damage far exceeded FEMA’s threshold and approval was recommended.","In the final month of the 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump put his critique of FEMA’s response to Hurricane Helene front and center, making false claims that funding was stolen for illegal migrants and the agency ignored requests for help.

One particular claim had legs – that Republican residents were not getting the aid they needed because of their political affiliation.

An investigation that began under then-President Joe Biden and carried over into the Trump administration ultimately cleared the Federal Emergency Management Agency, finding no evidence of a systemic effort to deny aid based on politics while singling out one supervisor’s actions as illegal and improper.

But at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, leadership including Secretary Kristi Noem weren’t satisfied, three former senior FEMA officials told CNN. Within weeks, leaders ordered a new investigation that came to a much different conclusion.

Noem announced last week that the DHS probe found “for years, FEMA employees under the Biden Administration intentionally delayed much-needed aid to Americans suffering from natural disasters on purely political grounds.” She called it “textbook political discrimination” against Trump supporters.

The investigation looked at whether FEMA workers who went door-to-door in disaster zones recorded any protected private information about survivors’ political views. It found roughly 100 field reports — a small fraction out of tens of thousands of cases during the Biden administration — where FEMA workers visiting homes mentioned campaign signs or made notes related to “political beliefs.”

Investigators flagged a few instances where canvasser notes mentioned “Trump” or “Biden,” but in most cases, workers were documenting gun signage, which also was categorized as political. The report does not show that disaster survivors were denied aid because of these notations, and sources say the gun notations were often made for safety reasons.

Yet Noem portrayed the findings as proof of FEMA’s “widespread” and “systematic” bias and said she would refer the issue to the Justice Department for potential prosecution — her latest public attack on an agency she argues needs sweeping reforms or even abolition. Behind the scenes, insiders accuse DHS and Noem of stoking rumors and misinformation to help justify tearing FEMA down, as some argue it’s the Trump administration using disaster aid as a political weapon.

“They’ve been looking to prove that narrative any way they can, and to me, this is just a fabricated way of advancing it when really it’s not factually there,” said one of several FEMA officials who asked not to be named for fear of retribution.

“If we do something wrong, okay, hold us accountable,” the official added. “But don’t fabricate it because it meets your political narrative. That’s just bad government.”

Two hurricanes and a political firestorm

The political firestorm began last September after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina. Then-candidate Trump accused FEMA and the Biden administration of ignoring Republican areas and spending all its disaster aid on undocumented immigrants.

FEMA workers soon faced threats and hostility in disaster zones, and some teams were pulled from areas for safety. Weeks later, Hurricane Milton hit the Florida coast. FEMA teams, now stretched thin up and down the coast, reported widespread harassment fueled by Trump’s claims.

In late October, FEMA field supervisor Marn’i Washington delivered a now infamous directive to her 11 staffers deployed in Florida: “Avoid homes advertising Trump.”

Washington told CNN at the time that her supervisors had issued the orders, citing concerns about abuse from Trump supporters. However, the investigation later determined that no such directive was given; it was Washington’s own interpretation of how to protect her team.

FEMA leadership working under the Biden administration fired Washington and denounced her actions, deploying staff to the homes that may have been skipped. Then-FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell was called before Congress, where she condemned the directive as illegal and unacceptable, and said she’d already referred the case for further investigation.

“I stand by the testimony I provided to Congress under oath. When the initial incident came to light, I immediately took decisive action and addressed the situation,” Criswell told CNN in a statement last week. “I remain confident that we responded appropriately to the information we had.”

Still, Florida’s attorney general filed a lawsuit alleging civil rights violations against FEMA and Criswell. To some, Washington’s actions were proof that Trump was right: FEMA is biased against Republicans.

An investigation clears FEMA

Over the next four months, FEMA’s Office of Professional Responsibility, Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Special Counsel investigated the incident and broader agency culture – a probe that carried into Trump’s term.

Days after his inauguration, Trump visited western North Carolina and floated the idea of eliminating FEMA.

In March, Trump’s acting FEMA administrator, Cameron Hamilton, told lawmakers that three additional staffers had been fired in connection with the Washington incident, primarily for poor supervision or misleading investigators, two sources told CNN.

But Hamilton’s letter to Congress said investigators found “no evidence that this was a systemic problem, nor that it was directed by agency or field leadership.”

In fact, they found the opposite: that politics rarely came up in disaster zones.

“Tens of thousands of records were screened and reviewed. We found there was no reasonable evidence to authenticate a statement that denial of aid or assistance occurred based upon political bias from FEMA leadership,” Hamilton told CNN this week. “These isolated incidents were awful and a breach of public trust, however I did not see evidence that they were systemic across the agency. I say this as a lifelong Republican and supporter of President Trump.”

The probe formally cleared Criswell and FEMA in April, and Florida settled its lawsuit with no damages paid.

At the time, agency leaders believed the case was closed and perhaps the findings would ease the anti-FEMA rhetoric from Trump and Noem. They were wrong.

A second look at FEMA wrongdoing

Roman Jankowski, the newly appointed head of DHS’s Privacy Office and an alum of the Heritage Foundation, launched a separate review weeks after the internal probe concluded and requested the data investigators had relied on, multiple sources said.

Jankowski took a different approach, focusing on whether FEMA aid workers violated privacy laws by recording protected information — such as political beliefs — and whether that information could have been used to withhold disaster aid for political reasons. His review went beyond the initial investigation, which focused solely on the 2024 hurricane season, and examined data from the entirety of Biden’s four years in office.

“He definitely made it clear that he suspected FEMA was involved in broad-scale wrongdoing,” said a senior FEMA official who spoke directly to Jankowski about the review. “You could tell he had already arrived at a conclusion that FEMA as an agency needed to be severely punished, which was evident in his tone and language.”

Jankowski’s team released its report last week.

The 22-page report concludes FEMA canvassers going door-to-door repeatedly violated – or may have violated – privacy laws by collecting information on survivors’ political beliefs, and in a handful of cases, bypassed certain homes based on the details they noted.

But more than a dozen current and former FEMA officials argue that the evidence does not support claims of a systemic problem. They point out canvassers referenced Trump just 15 times in their reports, and it remains unclear whether workers never returned to those homes.

“I’m not a statistician, but when you’re looking at four years of data across tens of thousands of damaged homes, it doesn’t seem significant,” former FEMA chief of staff Michael Coen, who served under the Biden and Obama administrations, told CNN. “It doesn’t demonstrate that people were discriminated against in a systematic way.”

FEMA officials say these freeform notes are primarily used to alert colleagues about field conditions, especially for safety, and were not surprised that most of the so-called “partisan” notes referenced gun signage.

After Hurricane Helene, those safety worries reached a fever pitch. Trump’s relentless attacks on FEMA had sparked a wave of threats against the teams trying to help survivors in North Carolina, leaving workers on edge.

“We were hearing that guys in trucks with guns were out looking for FEMA employees, and the teams were freaked out,” a former senior official deployed to North Carolina said. “Let’s have common sense. FEMA employees are not law enforcement officers. They’re not walking around with bulletproof vests. This idea that they’re just going to run into harm’s way to register somebody is ridiculous.”

The report points to a few specific entries from canvassers who allegedly skipped homes, such as: “Survivor very anti govt anti Biden. Told me to tell Biden to go [f***] himself” and “…a lot of explicit political flags, posters, etc. ‘F*** Joe Biden’ ‘MAGA 2024’ ‘Joe Biden Sucks’ ‘Trump 2024.’ We do not recommend anyone visiting this location.”

DHS raised concerns that such notes likely led FEMA teams not to return to the homes.

But Noem has been more definitive in her claims about what the investigation found, saying the probe found “FEMA employees systematically refused to visit the houses of disaster survivors that displayed signs and flags they disagreed with, including those with campaign signs supporting President Trump.”

Trump’s FEMA ended door-to-door canvassing earlier this year, largely because of safety concerns and the fact that most survivors now apply for FEMA assistance online or through call centers, not through canvassers.

Several current and former senior FEMA officials acknowledged that some canvassers may have violated privacy laws and agreed that reviewing those cases would be appropriate. However, they cautioned that using this as evidence of an agencywide systemic effort to deny aid based on politics is unfounded.

“Whether or not there was bias in note taking, that’s a highly subjective analysis, but we didn’t find it to be sufficient to conclude wide-spread impact,” Hamilton said this week of the first internal investigation.

The next phase of Trump’s war on FEMA

As Noem paints the agency as partisan and inept, the new FEMA Review Council is set to present recommendations for reforms in the coming weeks. Trump has vowed to start phasing out FEMA after hurricane season, though he hasn’t detailed what that will entail.

From the outset, Noem positioned herself as Trump’s point person to fulfill his promise to dismantle FEMA. She now says the goal is to eliminate FEMA “as it exists today,” and she’s made clear that “cleaning house” and asserting control are central to that process.

“She’s trying to drive this narrative of how woke, terrible and unaccountable FEMA is, which is why they need to abolish it,” one former top official said.

Meanwhile, current and former FEMA officials say her attacks continue to erode public trust in the agency responsible for helping disaster survivors in their most vulnerable moments.

“It’s dangerous,” said Coen, the former FEMA chief of staff. “The faith in FEMA has declined. When people lose their trust in the federal government in a time of need, they’re going to feel more helpless.”

Some FEMA officials note the irony of these accusations, as Trump himself faces criticism for politicizing disaster aid — repeatedly posting on Truth Social about sending millions to states that supported him.

Last week, Trump announced $2.5 million for Missouri after speaking with its Republican governor, despite FEMA recommending denial because the damage was below the agency’s threshold for federal aid to be distributed.

“That request was dead and buried in our minds,” a senior FEMA official involved in the process told CNN. “Our damage assessments didn’t seem to indicate the recovery was beyond the State’s capacity. And believe me, we’re generally eager to help our state partners when it’s warranted.”

The Trump administration had previously fast-tracked FEMA money to Missouri while emergency funds for other states remained frozen.

In contrast, Democratic-led states like Maryland and Washington have been denied disaster aid by the president, even when their damage far exceeded FEMA’s threshold and approval was recommended.

Noem has ramped up her rhetoric in recent months.

Last month, she issued a press release announcing the firing of a FEMA staffer and an agency contractor for viewing sexually explicit content on government devices.

“We are cleaning house at FEMA to make this dysfunctional agency work for the American people the way that it was intended,” she wrote at the time.

Since pledging to dismantle FEMA at the start of the administration, DHS leaders have subjected staff to polygraph tests, publicly fired employees, and placed dozens on administrative leave without warning or explanation. More than a quarter of FEMA’s full-time workforce has left through layoffs and buyouts, including dozens of senior leaders.

Behind the scenes, DHS has consolidated power at FEMA, filling leadership roles with political appointees and pushing out career experts who helped shape disaster response and recovery.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/04-gettyimages-2176731070.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-29 11:19:09.483826

But during the Trump administration, Border Patrol agents have been taking part in immigration enforcement operations around the country, far from their more traditional duties.","One current official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity, said 12 ICE field office directors were being reassigned.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is reassigning at least half the top leadership at Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices around the country in a major shake-up of the agency responsible for carrying out the president’s vision for mass deportations, according to one current and one former U.S. government official.

The current official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity, said 12 ICE field office directors — the officers who run the network of field offices around the country responsible for immigration enforcement — were being reassigned.

Half are to be replaced by existing or retired Customs and Border Protection staff, while the other half would be replaced by ICE officers, both the current and former officials said. The changes were initiated by the Homeland Security Department, the current official said, without specifying which cities were impacted.

The former official, who has direct knowledge of the changes and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information that was not intended for public release, said on top of the 12 reassignments, leaders in another four cities were being swapped out through retirements or other circumstances. He said the cities include major immigration enforcement targets such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington.

He added that ICE leadership has been discussing the changes with other Trump administration officials for some time as part of a broad review of the agency.

The reason for the personnel changes wasn’t immediately clear. But they indicate a greater integration of Border Patrol agents in ICE at a time when Customs and Border Protection has been accused of using heavy-handed tactics in its immigration enforcement.

With a total of 25 field offices around the country, the reassignments amount to turnover of about half or more of the top staffers carrying out the president’s hardline immigration enforcement plans, which has seen a major deployment of law enforcement in major American cities, thousands of arrests and surging fear among residents, especially in immigrant communities.

Homeland Security and the White House did not comment on the reassignments and each instead highlighted that all elements of immigration enforcement were working as one team.

Putting Customs and Border Protection officers into top positions within Immigration and Customs Enforcement would create an expanded role for an agency that is already at the forefront of many of the aggressive tactics seen in both Los Angeles and now in Chicago.

CBP officers — specifically Border Patrol agents — have carried out some of the most controversial operations as part of immigration crackdowns in both of those cities, including a recent raid in Chicago where officers rappelled down onto a building in an apartment complex from a helicopter. Border Patrol agents have also popped out of a moving truck and chased after people and conducted patrols through downtown Chicago.

Border Patrol agents protect the land and water between the official border crossings to prevent human trafficking, drug smuggling or other types of contraband from entering the U.S. ICE, since its creation in 2003, is the main agency responsible for immigration enforcement inside the country.

But during the Trump administration, Border Patrol agents have been taking part in immigration enforcement operations around the country, far from their more traditional duties.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol sector chief from California who has been heading the Border Patrol’s operations in both cities, is himself accused of throwing tear gas canisters at protesters and took the stand Tuesday as a defendant in a federal lawsuit about whether federal officials are using excessive force in Chicago.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement says its agents carry out “targeted enforcement operations,” which often involve hours of time staking out people they’re trying to remove from the country.

This is the third shake-up at ICE since Trump took office, reflecting the importance of the agency’s role in executing the president’s vision.

In February, Homeland Security reassigned Caleb Vitello, the acting director of ICE, to another position. Todd Lyons, a veteran ICE agent, was later announced as the new acting head of the agency, a position he still holds.

Then in May, ICE announced the reassignment of the two top officials heading the agency’s main branches.

A spokesperson for Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, did not comment Tuesday on the personnel changes but said in a statement that the department remained “laser focused on RESULTS and we will deliver.”

“This is one team, one fight,” she said. “President (Donald) Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary (Kristi) Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an e-mailed statement: “The President’s entire team is working in lockstep to implement the President’s policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.”

While the House stands at recess, no reforms to the H-2A program can be debated or voted on.","This story is is supported by funding from the Chicago Region Food Systems Fund.

President Trump’s deportation of more than half a million people, along with his ending of several programs that allowed immigrants to work in the country legally, has created labor issues across the agriculture sector, including for farmers, an important political constituency.

While experts warned mass deportation would result in agricultural labor shortages, which could then lead to food shortages, Trump officials predicted U.S.-born workers would happily fill those vacant jobs. So far, that hasn’t happened.

There has also been a lack of movement by the Trump administration and his congressional allies toward creating a viable, long-term solution for the immigration system.

Corporate agriculture has often pursued lax safety standards, few labor protections and low wages. In many cases, only immigrants and undocumented workers are willing to toil long hours in extremely hot fields and to cut animal carcasses in hazardous meatpacking plants.

In recent months, to increase the number of farmworkers in the country, the administration has tinkered with the H-2A visa program, which allows some agricultural employers to hire foreign nationals for months at a time. The administration said it has streamlined the process to apply to bring workers to the U.S., and it’s trying to allow farmers to pay foreign visa workers less.

But full-scale reforms — the kind industry groups say are necessary — have not yet materialized, even as the administration ramps up immigration enforcement. Also, some agricultural industries, such as dairy, are not eligible to hire through the program.

“The H-2A program is not the sustainable solution, but it is a short-term solution,” said John Walt Boatright, the director of government affairs at the American Farm Bureau Federation, the leading farmer advocacy group. “I do foresee the H-2A program continuing to increase in use, but by no means is that a measure of its popularity.”

While the Trump administration is relying on the H-2A program to help a vital voting bloc, its approach to government funding has also created problems for those who need it.

As Trump and his congressional allies battled over federal funding with Democrats, the government shut down Oct. 1. That day, the U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees the H-2A program, said a funding lapse resulted in the program’s suspension.

“A prolonged lapse of funding,” the labor department stated in a notice, “will exacerbate processing delays … especially” for the H-2A program.

In mid-October, more than two weeks into the shutdown, the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins saying the delays “imminently threaten agricultural production,” according to Civil Eats. The association did not respond to a request for comment.

While farmers are dealing with roadblocks to one labor source, the Trump administration continues to crack down on another.

Out of about 2 million farmworkers in the U.S., government surveys show about 44% are undocumented. Hundreds of thousands of others in the food supply chain — meatpacking plants, grocery stores, restaurants — are also undocumented.

Trump’s policies have also created more undocumented immigrants in the country. He ended humanitarian parole programs that allowed immigrants escaping unsafe environments to work in the U.S. The move left some meatpacking plants without a reliable labor pool.

Immigration raids, or the threat of them, have led to worker shortages across the country. In Pennsylvania, some dairy farmers, who often have to rely on undocumented laborers, have sold off their herds because they could not find any interested workers, according to Politico. In California this summer, some fields were not harvested because many workers stayed home, according to Reuters. In Idaho, similar concerns pervade farm country.

It’s difficult to know exactly how many undocumented farmworkers have left the labor force, but the country has seen a decline in immigrant workers overall. About 750,000 immigrants have left the labor force since January, the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan organization, estimated in August. The decline in the immigrant workforce is likely to reduce the overall labor force, which could harm the country’s economy, according to CNBC.

The cumulative effect of the Trump administration’s actions will likely lead to fewer small farms and a trend toward larger industrial-sized farms, which will have the ability to access visa workes and explore options for mechanization, said Mary Jo Dudley, former director of the Cornell Farmworker Program and current director of Migrant Advocacy and Support.

“As more people are detained, farms are going to lose workers,” she said. “Dairy producers who don’t have access to H-2A workers are faced with hard decisions: Should they just sell their cows if their workers are going to disappear any day? The possibilities for small family farms are quickly slipping away.”

Despite farmer concerns, immigration raids continue

For months, Trump has said a solution is in the works. During a July 4 speech, he said, “We have some great stuff being written.”

However, Trump’s main goal and the platform he ran on — mass deportation — has always taken precedence.

Over the summer, Rollins pushed Trump to pause enforcement on farms, citing farmers’ concerns, according to the New York Times. A few days later, raids resumed. Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide, has told the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the home of ICE, it needs to arrest 3,000 people a day, according to Axios.

In mid-September, Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, told local TV station WWNY that “there are discussions going on now” about raids affecting farm labor. But he made clear the increased enforcement would continue.

“President has said there won’t be amnesty,” Homan said. “But he is looking at options for farms.”

The labor department did not respond to a request for comment on the statement in the proposed rule. When a spokeswoman was contacted via email, she said she’d have to wait to respond until the government shutdown was over.

Differing views of agriculture labor source

The labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, said during a June speech the H-2A program will help solve farmers’ labor concerns, according to The Packer.

“I would love for Americans to want to do those jobs,” she said over the summer to the Western Governors Association. “I can just tell you, none of the Americans I know want to do some of these jobs.”

Her comment stands in contrast to other Trump officials, who have consistently said the objective is to replace immigrant farmworkers with U.S.-born workers. About two weeks after Chavez-DeRemer’s comments, Rollins contradicted her.

With Congress in recess, no deliberation on possible labor solutions

The agriculture committee in the U.S. House of Representatives has studied the H-2A program, and last year it offered a template for reforms.

Currently, employers — or specialty firms that employers hire — must file paperwork with three federal departments to bring foreign farmworkers to the U.S. The committee recommended creating a single portal for employers to use. It also suggested lowering how much employers spend on wages and housing.

This summer, a bill was introduced based on the template, but it has not received a committee hearing.

The House has not convened since Sept. 19, and it’s unclear when it will resume. U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and the body’s speaker, has faced criticism from his own party for the long delay, according to The Hill. While the House stands at recess, no reforms to the H-2A program can be debated or voted on.

With Republicans controlling both houses of Congress and the White House, Investigate Midwest contacted all 30 Republicans on the House agriculture committee to understand their perspective on how the shutdown is affecting a possible labor solution for farmers hurt by increased immigration enforcement.

However, most did not respond, and a few said they would not comment. The chair of the agriculture committee, Glenn “GT” Thompson, a Pennsylvania Republican, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

DOL creates new office, unclear if old issues addressed

The Trump administration has sought to curtail other visas and legal statuses in its effort to severely limit the number of immigrants in the country, but it has backed expanding the H-2A program, which is only for agricultural employers.

In addition to ending humanitarian parole programs, the administration has proposed requiring employers who hire through the H-1B program to pay a $100,000 fee per application. H-1B holders are considered “highly skilled” immigrants who work in high-paying industries, such as tech. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued over the fee.

On the other hand, H-2A farmworkers are typically paid slightly more than minimum wage for jobs that don’t last long, and wage theft is a well-documented problem.

The Trump administration could be attempting to replace many undocumented farmworkers with foreigners who spend just months at a time in the U.S., said Daniel Costa, a lead immigration researcher at the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute.

“Basically, they’re saying, ‘We want workers, but we don’t want people,’” he said.

This summer, the DOL created a new office it said would help increase the number of farmers participating in the H-2A program. However, it’s unclear how the office is addressing issues created by the program’s popularity.

During the June speech to governors of western states, Chavez-DeRemer, the labor secretary, said she was creating a “one-stop shop” for the H-2A program. The new office would help address a backlog of applications, as well as speed up approvals for farmers who need workers quickly, she said, according to The Packer.

“We’re finally going to lean in,” she said, “and then we’ll work with Congress on the longer-term issues of immigration reform as it needs to be addressed.”

The new office, named the Office of Immigration Policy, will set “strategic oversight,” “strategic management” and “strategic priority” for visa programs, according to Chavez-DeRemer’s memo.

The man tapped to run the office, Brian Pasternak, has worked as a civil servant at the labor department for more than 20 years. Most recently, he oversaw the Office of Foreign Labor Certification, which processes and approves H-2A visa applications submitted by employers.

Even before the current shutdown, the labor certification office struggled to keep pace with the increasingly high demand for H-2A workers, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office report.

Staff members were shifted from their regular responsibilities to processing H-2A applications, which led to longer processing times for other visas. As the number of applications increased, regulators also dinged employers for fewer infractions, such as lacking proof of adequate housing, a longtime problem for farmworkers on visas.

Having enough staff was an issue before Trump assumed office, and it’s unclear if staffing cuts by Elon Musk’s DOGE affected the processing of H-2A applications.

The labor department lost about 1% of its workforce in DOGE’s initial purge, according to The New York Times, and more cuts could be coming during the government shutdown.

The labor department did not respond to a question about how many staffers handling H-2A applications were fired or took early retirement since January. It also did not respond when asked how it plans to handle the issues the Government Accountability Office identified.

The new office “will support President Trump’s efforts to prevent illegal immigration by helping employers access and navigate these programs – supporting legal pathways to work,” said Courtney Parella, a labor department spokeswoman. “By establishing the (Office of Immigration Policy), which reports directly to the Secretary, the Department is cutting red tape and streamlining its ability to execute immigration-related policy priorities and administer foreign labor certification programs.”

Boatright, with the American Farm Bureau, said the labor department’s new office holds a lot of promise. However, at least so far, little has changed on the ground.

“No news yet,” he said, “but we’re anxious to see what this Office of Immigration Policy can do.”

""They blocked me, they hit my driver window at that time,"" she said, ""opened my door, took me out, put me against the car and put handcuffs on me. They weren't answering any of my questions.""

She said she was scared, ""Maybe they were impersonating? Or, getting kidnapped and not seeing my family again?""

She said an agent told her it was illegal to take their photos and took her to Portland's ICE building.

""They chained my legs up,"" she said, ""and they put me in a cell for seven hours. They wanted to ask me questions and record it, and I refused to answer any questions.""

She said when she asked to contact a lawyer, she was told the landline phones were down. She said she was fingerprinted and had her cheek swabbed, and agents acknowledged her record came back clean.

,Human Rights,2025-10-29 13:01:43+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Immigration agents are raiding California hospitals and clinics. Can a new state law prevent that?,Claudia Boyd-Barrett,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-29/california-health-facilities-immigration-raids-pushback,"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents also have shown up at community clinics.
In response to such immigration enforcement activity in and around clinics and hospitals, Gov.
Tanya Broder, a senior counsel with the National Immigration Law Center, said immigration arrests at health care facilities appear to be relatively rare.
Mangia said St. John’s staff had two encounters with immigration agents over the summer.
Another occurred in July, when immigration agents descended upon MacArthur Park on horses and in armored vehicles, in a show of force by the Trump administration.","In recent months, federal agents camped out in the lobby of a Southern California hospital, guarded detained patients — sometimes shackled — in hospital rooms, and chased an immigrant landscaper into a surgical center.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents also have shown up at community clinics. Health providers say officers tried to enter a parking lot hosting a mobile clinic, waved a machine gun in the faces of clinicians serving the homeless, and hauled a passerby into an unmarked car outside a community health center.

In response to such immigration enforcement activity in and around clinics and hospitals, Gov. Gavin Newsom last month signed SB 81, which prohibits medical establishments from allowing federal agents without a valid search warrant or court order into private areas, including places where patients receive treatment or discuss health matters.

But while the bill received broad support from medical groups, health care workers and immigrant rights advocates, legal experts say California can’t stop federal authorities from carrying out duties in public places like hospital lobbies and general waiting areas, parking lots and surrounding neighborhoods — places where recent ICE activities sparked outrage and fear. Previous federal restrictions on immigration enforcement in or near sensitive areas, including health care establishments, were rescinded by the Trump administration in January.

“The issue that states encounter is the supremacy clause,” said Sophia Genovese, a supervising attorney and clinical teaching fellow at Georgetown Law. She said the federal government has the right to conduct enforcement activities, and there are limits to what the state can do to stop them.

California’s law designates a patient’s immigration status and birthplace as protected information, which like medical records cannot be disclosed to law enforcement without a warrant or court order. And it requires health care facilities to have clear procedures for handling requests from immigration authorities, including training staff to immediately notify a designated administrator or legal counsel if agents ask to enter a private area or review patient records.

Several other Democratic-led states also have taken up legislation to protect patients at hospitals and health centers. In May, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the Protect Civil Rights Immigration Status bill, which penalizes hospitals for unauthorized sharing of information about people in the country illegally and bars ICE agents from entering private areas of health care facilities without a judicial warrant. In Maryland, a law requiring the attorney general to create guidance on keeping ICE out of health care facilities went into effect in June. New Mexico instituted new patient data protections, and Rhode Island prohibited health care facilities from asking patients about their immigration status.

Republican-led states have aligned with federal efforts to prevent health care spending on immigrants without legal authorization. Such immigrants are not eligible for comprehensive Medicaid coverage, but states do bill the federal government for emergency care in certain cases. Under a law that took effect in 2023, Florida requires hospitals that accept Medicaid to ask about a patient’s legal status. In Texas, hospitals now have to report how much they spend on care for immigrants without legal authorization.

“Texans should not have to shoulder the burden of financially supporting medical care for illegal immigrants,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in issuing his executive order last year.

California’s efforts to rein in federal enforcement come as the state, where more than a quarter of residents are foreign-born, has become a target of President Trump’s immigration crackdown. Newsom signed SB 81 as part of a bill package prohibiting immigration agents from entering schools without a warrant, requiring law enforcement officers to identify themselves, and banning officers from wearing masks. SB 81 was passed on a party-line vote with no formal opposition.

“We’re not North Korea,” Newsom said during a September bill-signing ceremony. “We’re pushing back against these authoritarian tendencies and actions of this administration.”

Some supporters of the bill and legal experts said California’s law can prevent ICE from violating existing patient privacy rights. Those include the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits searches without a warrant in places where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Valid warrants must be issued by a court and signed by a judge. But ICE agents frequently use administrative warrants to try to gain access to private areas they don’t have the authority to enter, Genovese said.

“People don’t always understand the difference between an administrative warrant, which is a meaningless piece of paper, versus a judicial warrant that is enforceable,” Genovese said. Judicial warrants are rarely issued in immigration cases, she added.

The Department of Homeland Security said it won’t abide by California’s mask ban or identification requirements for law enforcement officers, slamming them as unconstitutional. The department did not respond to a request for comment on the state’s new rules for health care facilities, which went into immediate effect.

Tanya Broder, a senior counsel with the National Immigration Law Center, said immigration arrests at health care facilities appear to be relatively rare. But the federal decision to rescind protections around sensitive areas, she said, “has generated fear and uncertainty across the country.” Many of the most high-profile news reports of immigration agents at health care facilities have been in California, largely involving detained patients brought in for care.

The California Nurses Assn., the state’s largest nurses union, was a co-sponsor of the bill and raised concerns about the treatment of Milagro Solis-Portillo, a 36-year-old Salvadoran woman who was under round-the-clock ICE surveillance at Glendale Memorial Hospital over the summer.

Union leaders also condemned the presence of agents at California Hospital Medical Center south of downtown Los Angeles. According to Anne Caputo-Pearl, a labor and delivery nurse and the chief union representative at the hospital, agents brought in a patient on Oct. 21 and remained in the patient’s room for almost a week. The Los Angeles Times reported that a TikTok streamer, Carlitos Ricardo Parias, was taken to the hospital that day after he was wounded during an immigration enforcement operation in South Los Angeles.

The presence of ICE was intimidating for nurses and patients, Caputo-Pearl said, and prompted visitor restrictions at the hospital. “We want better clarification,” she said. “Why is it that these agents are allowed to be in the room?”

Hospital and clinic representatives, however, said they already are following the law’s requirements, which largely reinforce extensive guidance put out by state Attorney General Rob Bonta in December.

Community clinics throughout Los Angeles County, which serve more than 2 million patients a year, including a large portion of immigrants, have been implementing the attorney general’s guidelines for months, said Louise McCarthy, president and chief executive of the Community Clinic Assn. of Los Angeles County. She said the law should help ensure uniform standards across health facilities that clinics refer out to and reassure patients that procedures are in place to protect them.

Still, it can’t prevent immigration raids from happening in the broader community, which have made some patients and even health workers afraid to venture outside, McCarthy said. Some incidents have occurred near clinics, including an arrest of a passerby outside a clinic in East Los Angeles, which a security guard caught on video, she said.

“We’ve had clinic staff say, ‘Is it safe for me to go out?’” she said.

At St. John’s Community Health, a network of 24 community health centers and five mobile clinics in South Los Angeles and the Inland Empire, chief executive Jim Mangia agreed the new law can’t prevent all immigration enforcement activity, but said it gives clinics a tool to push back with if agents show up, something his staff has had to do.

Mangia said St. John’s staff had two encounters with immigration agents over the summer. In one, he said, staff stopped armed officers from entering a gated parking lot at a drug and alcohol recovery center where doctors and nurses were seeing patients at a mobile health clinic.

Another occurred in July, when immigration agents descended upon MacArthur Park on horses and in armored vehicles, in a show of force by the Trump administration. Mangia said masked officers in full tactical gear surrounded a street medicine tent where St. John’s providers were tending to homeless patients, screamed at staff to get out and pointed a gun at them. The providers were so shaken by the episode, Mangia said, that he had to bring in mental health professionals to help them feel safe going back out on the street.

A DHS spokesperson told CalMatters that in the rare instance when agents enter certain sensitive locations, officers would need “secondary supervisor approval.”

Since then, St. John’s doubled down on providing support and training to staff and offered patients afraid to go out the option of home medical visits and grocery deliveries. Patient fears and ICE activity have decreased since the summer, Mangia said, but with DHS planning to hire an additional 10,000 ICE agents, he doubts that will last.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1811c06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6233x3272+0+348/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe9%2F4a%2Fa3fcfde046efb99213f4d148f7ee%2F1513307-me-ice-macarthur-park07a-cs.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 10:17:04.327191

Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, both Democrats.","A federal judge disqualified the United States Attorney in Los Angeles on Tuesday, the latest rebuke to the Trump administration’s attempts to circumvent congressional approval for federal prosecutors.

The ruling creates leadership uncertainty in the nation’s largest judicial district, the Central District of California, which serves seven counties in the Los Angeles area. The order was issued by Judge J. Michael Seabright of the Federal District Court in Hawaii, who ruled that the Trump appointee, Bill Essayli, “is not lawfully serving as acting United States Attorney” and “cannot continue to perform any role” that job entails.

But it was unclear what the practical effect of his order would be, since the judge also allowed Mr. Essayli to revert to the role of the office’s top deputy, as the first assistant United States attorney.

The judge, an appointee of George W. Bush, said he shared concerns expressed by lawyers who had challenged Mr. Essayli’s status that the result was “little remedy at all” and agreed that the Department of Justice was effectively circumventing the intent of the law. But he said he was constrained “to apply the statutes as written.”

The judge also did not dismiss the three criminal cases being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney’s office in which defense lawyers had argued that Mr. Essayli lacked legal standing to prosecute. And while Mr. Essayli could not supervise the cases as the head of the office, the judge ruled, he could supervise them as the office’s top deputy.

A spokesman for Mr. Essayli could not immediately be reached for comment.

The Trump administration’s strategy of forgoing congressional approval has clouded the legitimacy of several prominent regional offices of the Department of Justice. Three federal judges have now rejected attempts by the administration to retain federal prosecutors on an “acting” basis, without Senate or judicial confirmation, after their initial 120-day terms expired. A fourth challenge was brought last week by James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, who has asserted in court filings that Lindsey Halligan, a prosecutor Mr. Trump put in place in Virginia, was improperly appointed.

And California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office confirmed on Tuesday that the governor had hired one of the federal prosecutors purged by the Trump administration, Michele Beckwith, the former acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento.

Last month, a federal judge disqualified Nevada’s top federal prosecutor, Sigal Chattah, from handling four cases, saying that she was “not validly serving as acting U.S. attorney” and that her involvement in cases “would be unlawful.” Challenges have since arisen in other federal cases brought in that state. In August, a different judge ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for Mr. Trump, had been serving as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney without legal authority. Both decisions have been appealed.

Mr. Essayli and Ms. Chattah had initially been appointed “interim” U.S. attorneys. Interim appointments expire after 120 days, but in late July, the Trump administration extended their terms by naming them both acting U.S. attorneys. Permanent U.S. attorney appointments typically require approval either by the U.S. Senate or by federal judges in the affected district.

In a hearing on Mr. Essayli’s situation in Los Angeles earlier this month, lawyers debated the fine points of laws dictating the rules for appointments, which are not always straightforward. Alexander Robbins, an assistant U.S. attorney, argued that “it’s pretty clear that Mr. Essayli legitimately works here, like I do and like all the other A.U.S.A.s in this office.”

Public defenders in Nevada and California have led the challenges but have not discussed them publicly. But they have been joined by other lawyers who have.

“They are trying to get around congressional oversight,” Mark Windsor, one of the private lawyers challenging Mr. Essayli’s appointment on behalf of a client, said during the hearing in Los Angeles. “I don’t think that this court can avoid the conclusion that this really is an intentional, knowing, deliberate attempt to circumvent some of the key safeguards within our Constitution and that it deserves the most extreme remedy that this court can fashion in order to deter that conduct,” he added.

The case is likely to be appealed along with the others. In remarks during the court hearing, Judge Seabright said that “no matter what” he ruled, the case would inevitably end up before a higher court.

Mr. Essayli, a former state assemblyman who once worked as an assistant U.S. attorney, is a Trump ally who has been far more outspoken on political issues than have many of his predecessors. In social media posts, he has criticized Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, both Democrats. In an appearance on Fox News, he said that many state lawmakers appeared to have “a disease in the mind” and “want soft-on-crime policies.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/28/multimedia/28nat-la-essayli-mlbj/28nat-la-essayli-mlbj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 12:02:14.310917

She be founder and executive director of the Inner-City Muslim Action Network.

And Reverend Quincy were intent.

Thanks to all of you for joining us for this discussion.

I want to get a sense from all of you.

So the Department of Homeland Security's Operation Midway Blitz began in September.

And since then, of course, we have all seen the video of ICE agents in Chicago neighborhoods, masked men pending people to the ground as state leaders.

What is your reaction when you see video like that in and around your communities?

Father, want start with you, please it, Tony source anger within myself and also I kind of feel with the congregation this last lost the pope.

>> I know even before that, just listening to parishioners with this fear that was just kind of boarding up at this point, like seen that it just really create a lot of tension and and, you know, within myself, it's just like how do we bring, you know, hope to this community?

How do we hope to people to be able to walking just just around the neighborhood and be able to their normal life.

>> It's unconscionable.

What's happening.

I think we are seeing the worst of what human beings are capable of doing being enacted in our streets in our communities amongst people that are neighbors, they're our friends, our co-workers, people who are important members of our community who are not even feeling safe to let their children walk home from school to do their jobs, cutting lawns or going into their their places of of employment.

And we are feeling how and what do we do and trying to find as many tangible ways that we can stand up.

We can speak out.

We can be there and we can help.

From an SUV.

>> It's been really a reign of terror and it's inflicted some of the most dramatic set of circumstances that will be with people for the rest of their lives.

We're talking about women that have been selling them honest and neighborhoods for 30 years.

We're talking about residents of the South side like in South Shore woman that lived entire life on the South side, never confronted any form of violence until ice age and put a gun in her face that's affecting everyday people.

King came to the Chicago over 60 years ago in neighborhoods that worked in London for the last 30 years to confront what he called evil that was inflicted upon the city at that time.

I think at this moment we need to as faith leaders and organizers call what we're seeing, what it is.

It's evil.

>> Strong words Reverend.

>> Yeah, I agree with everything everybody Definitely sense of shock and I'm hoping a righteous anger.

Quickly followed the question of what Christ have do and where would cry said a stand?

>> A rabbi, your synagogue in Evanston.

It's right next to where ICE has been active in Evanston, detaining people.

How are members of your congregation reacting?

Our candidates are showing up and saying what do I do?

They are getting whistles.

They are being trained.

They are coming into the streets.

They are standing across from Home Depot.

They're walking around the neighborhood, making sure that they are seeing what they can see and ready to call out.

They're also gathering together to at support one another.

We know so many families that don't have enough food right now that aren't able work or terrified to leave their houses.

And so our congregation collected over $5,000 in gift cards over our high holidays as a start to say, how do we give these to school social workers and ESL teachers?

How do we help a little bit makes something easier that we can in the face of so much destruction and so much of humanity photo and tell us about some of your because you said that members have asked for zoom option because they're scared to make the trip to church.

Yeah, it's been unfortunate where like?

>> mass attendance has been kind of regular.

You kind of see a little bit of a flow that goes up and down.

But not too dramatic.

But when it comes to light the day today, you know, religious education costs like that's where like I'm just scared of walking out with my child.

And so is there an option go back to what we had and we experienced of COVID, which is a sad and, you know, to know that the human encounters necessary, especially when our faith by fan just recognizing the dignity of others.

And so we've gone back to some of those classes and others have also given the opportunity car pulls, says like what we we take the same class, have always go together.

And I think you often so point so, that's it's been a very alarming to hear that from starting as soon mask just yet as the COVID days.

No, not yet.

One of the things is that we talked about it is just a calm at the end of the day since people are still coming.

But this is the one thing that's normal.

The one thing where they can calm and just kind of take a deep breath.

>> We don't know that's going to last for long.

You know, as you know, we've seen that there's been some ice presence in my parking lots churches and so forth.

So it's just being really careful with that.

But we can't lose that.

That strand of ensuring to give some are mallet, eat everything that's happening.

>> Revenue Bennett, the broad, detention center every week since September on.

In fact, you were standing just feet away from Reverend David Black out when he was pepper sprayed and hit with pepper.

What was that moment like?

>> Terrifying shocking.

again moment of righteous anger and it quickly shifted to find him if they're doing this to us broad daylight, they're doing this to clergy in front of cameras.

What in the world is going on inside detention center that has oversight.

And how are those people being treated?

Yeah, and we're looking at some of that video just now of that incident happening >> roaming we've seen students investigated or even detained for voicing support for Palestinians.

We have seen clergy pepper sprayed for protesting outside Broadview as we're discussing.

You've spent decades in interfaith activism.

What does it say to you that people who dissent, whether it is over Gaza or ISIS presence in our communities, that it's being met with this kind of state response one of our legendary organizers from the South side, Chicago Pentecostal preacher once used to say in our sermon who got next.

And I think right now what we as organizers and also rooted in faith like that one shun that I leave in a city with some action network.

The man knows that, you know, none of us are isolated from the types of tactics that we're seeing deployed, whether it's fathers in broad when the Ritz, you know, inside folks as homes and so one of the things that we know we need to do in this moment is find ways to connect together to stay together and to find ways to realize that there is no limits to the types of tactics that they're willing to deploy.

So there should be no limits in organizing tactics that were ready to use to bring hearts and communities and minds together that lean into the best of our traditions, especially in this moment.

>> To all of you, what do what is your, you know, your respective faiths, what they say about the persecution of in this case, immigrants and some will say all black and brown people.

But what is for one will come to you first.

What is your fate say about the persecution of humans of immigrants in this case?

>> it's just recognizing that people are just looking for, you know, play to survive.

And starfish just kind of says it's like how and your heart you becoming more Christ like and this can be both for the immigrant also for those that are persecuting following others like, how are you exemplifying what Christ taught us and what he came to do when you come to master, come to celebrate the Eucharist to come to.

He seemed Jesus Christ himself in at the end.

That's an invitation for conversion conversion.

Meaning you trying to glorify the road the best we can and it starts at home.

It starts with how do you provide to your family?

How do you do that?

And so even for the immigrant is how do you how do we get out of, you know, whatever difficulty or poor situation we're living in or violence and it's so it's again following the steps of Christ to be able to be safe and be able to live.

You know, just a life that can take you to that Santa to that we're all called to >> Judaism believes that every human being is created.

LaMelo.

which translates to in the image of the divine.

We don't know what looks like.

So God must look like us all.

And the idea that 36 times in the Tara, it says that you shall love the stranger, the immigrant, the person who has different among you.

And it is a deep part of our tradition to look back and say this has happened to us.

This has happened to other people.

It is our responsibility to recognize the good in human beings.

We believe that human beings are created.

Good.

And if we're all created essentially good at heart, then it's our responsibility to help uncover that good in others.

And the best way we can do that is in relationships with other people in thinking about how we use our Jewish traditions, too.

Both nourish and raise us up in this moment in ICE and immigration.

Jews aren't being targeted.

But yet, as you said, Robbie, I think who's next in this question of how do we with empathy?

And with quarter values and making relationships and reaching out to one another partner with each other each other's burdens and to really live the values that that we believe me.

>> Yeah.

In the in the tradition there's a prophetic, Heidi.

The tradition from the Prophet Muhammad peace blessings be that said none of you believe unless you want for your brother and sister, what you want for yourself.

And and the word here is none of you really have faith.

So for its a challenge, not just to the muscle commute, all faith communities.

If we don't put ourselves in the positions of one another and understand what does a family community that has been tending to people's lawns are sending bodies are working in anyone's neighborhood are working.

These fathers and mothers that have been working now coming home to a family that has been rent asunder and living in this extraordinary moment of trauma.

How do we connect to that?

And like you said earlier, none of us in this moment.

Free from Even if you espouse basic human dignity for Palestinians are whether you're standing with your Latino neighbors or whether you're standing with you right for African-American, black and brown communities that have been traumatized.

This is a moment that challenges our core expression of faith.

And I believe it's a challenge, but it's also an opportunity to stand up and exemplify what real faith looks like.

Reverend.

Yeah, I got my reading of scripture leads me to believe that God is preferential treatment to the poor the marginalized and the oppressed.

>> And we see Jesus talking prophetically teaching prophetically in living prophetically that we need to stand with those people and make sure that they know that they loved by God and that God's grace extends to them.

And one of the things that we see Jesus condemning people for are people like me in this country are privileged just by the nature of my skin.

My ethnicity, my gender, my sexuality Jesus condemns people in my position who do not use that privilege to stand up for the people who can't stand by themselves and I can't speak for themselves.

And so for me, it's it's a matter of if the gospel is going to claim supreme in my life.

Then I have to take the teachings of Jesus very seriously.

Which means that I to the to use my privilege.

To show preferential treatment to the press, the marginalized and the outcast.

All of that said, do you feel like you've heard our national and federal leaders in power?

>> Hughes get basically Christian nationalism to justify their actions.

>> Yeah, they have.

And I think the use scripture that that they've utilized has been nothing short of an affront to the Gospel, plain and simple.

I think it's important and it's one of the most offensive uses of scripture to to use it too dominate in dehumanize people is the antithesis of the teachings of Christ.

And so I think we need to take of a very hard look at ourselves as faith leaders and make sure that we speak out very loudly very clearly and very plainly it it's an important piece of scripture.

>> Rabbi, for many in Jewish community, there is a collective memory of soldiers patrolling the streets in Europe.

When you see masked men detaining men and women and sometimes children and American neighborhoods today.

Does that history?

Does that come to mind for Absolutely.

I've had congregants say to me, this feels like Germany, 1938, when my grandparents are my parents where terrified to leave their houses.

And at the same time, we also look at the history that says, look who came out and supported us.

Look who came out to say this is wrong.

We have to stop this and who spoke up.

And that's really what we're trying to embody to say that Judaism doesn't say, well, this happened to us.

So we survived it.

And now we're done.

It says in every generation you have to tell the story of the exodus as though you lived it yourself and you're still living yourself to remind ourselves that well, we might have a level of privilege is most of us in our congregation are white and middle class.

But our neighbors don't.

And so it's our obligation to say how do we, as you said, use that privilege.

How do we stand up and make sure that we're surrounding and a company?

Father?

Juan, you join Eucharistic procession to the Broad View Detention center a few weeks ago.

You what we're hoping you all were hoping to hold a service for those on the inside.

We will out now.

So we were denied There was congregation about 7 that we're going to try and distribute communion inside.

>> That was denied.

So now we're going to try to get November first on Saturday will be having a mask outside about the detention center and another group will also be trying to attempt to go inside.

And so to be able to distribute hope, not just communion to those that can receive but also hope to the rest that are there.

>> Revenue warning to the national detention standards requires that people in ICE custody be allowed to practice their faith and have adequate space for religious activities.

And it sounds from when also from what you've seen and heard that what or is that being allowed and what's the impact of not being able to observe your faith even though in detention?

No, it's Monday night.

Every there have been at least 3 or 4 efforts.

>> Just in the past month to try and get communion or religious services into them.

Obviously.

>> Might Roman Catholic brothers and sisters?

I think at the biggest push and I'm excited for you all to be there on Saturday.

>> I don't even know what to say about it.

It's just it's we've been using the word of Horton unconscionable lot here in that.

It fits right in with I think especially people who are captive.

And separated from their families and their future so uncertain.

I mean, that's when they need to know God's presence among us.

And that's when they need to feel God's grace.

The most it in my tradition, it which isn't Roman Catholic, unfortunate and Presbyterian.

We believe that communion don't break are you know?

looking to get we believe that Communion is essentially steroid injection of grace into the community.

>> Right.

And so you're denying people grace, you're denying people the comfort of the Holy Spirit I mean, it.

That alone is a basic human rights violation.

Let alone the denial of a basic bands.

Khathavong contributed to one of Philadelphia’s most shocking and senseless acts of violence — the 1994 death of Philadelphia high school student Eddie Polec, who was murdered on the steps of a local church.

“We sincerely hope that the removal of Bou Khathavong can finally help the family of Eddie Polec and the city of Philadelphia heal from one of the most horrifying crimes in Philadelphia’s history,” said ICE ERO Philadelphia acting Field Office Director David O’Neill. “ICE is working daily to safeguard the American public and bring justice for the families of those who are harmed by illegal aliens.”

Khathavong legally entered the United States from Laos on June 23, 1980.

On Nov. 11, 1994, Khathavong was arrested by the Philadelphia Police Department for his role in the brutal murder of Polec, 16, who was savagely beaten to death by a mob of suburban teenagers in the Fox Chase neighborhood of Philadelphia.

The brutal murder horrified the community and made national headlines. Khathavong was charged with two counts of murder, possession of an instrument of crime, and criminal conspiracy.

Reporting at the time recounted how the victim was mercilessly beaten with baseball bats and other weapons while lying defenseless on the steps of a church. Despite desperate calls for help, the attack continued until Polec succumbed to his injuries.

On March 19, 1996, Khathavong was convicted of criminal conspiracy and sentenced to a minimum of five years and a maximum of ten years in prison.

On Feb. 14, 1996, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service lodged an immigration detainer against Khathavong at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility in Philadelphia.

While policymakers have described parental notification as less onerous than parental consent laws, parental notification laws effectively grant parents—or a judge—veto power over a young person’s abortion decision.

Lawmakers in states with parental notification laws should repeal these laws and affirm young people’s rights to make fundamental decisions about their bodies and lives.

(New York) – State laws requiring healthcare providers to notify a parent about a young person’s abortion decision cause harmful delays and can block access to abortion, Human Rights Watch and If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice said in a report released today. As access to abortion in the United States continues to deteriorate, young people face additional hurdles to receiving care.

The 89-page report, “Whose Abortion Is It? The Harms of State-Mandated Parental Notification for Abortion and Judicial Bypass in the United States,” documents how state-mandated parental notification laws in six US states threaten young people’s health and safety and undermine their human rights. Most young people considering abortion involve a parent in their decision. Those who do not often have no access to a parent or fear that parental involvement will lead to severe consequences, such as physical abuse, loss of housing, family alienation, or forced continuation of a pregnancy against their wishes. The alternative to notifying a parent involves petitioning a judge for a court order in an invasive, stressful, and often traumatizing process called “judicial bypass.”

“Young people should be able to access abortion care without being forced to involve an unsupportive parent or appear before a judge in court,” said Margaret Wurth, senior children’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch and a co-author of the report. “State lawmakers committed to reproductive freedom should defend young people’s health, safety, and dignity by repealing parental notification for abortion laws.”

Currently, 25 US states where abortion is legal at some point in pregnancy require a healthcare provider to notify or obtain consent from a parent or legal guardian before providing abortion care to anyone under 18. While policymakers have described parental notification for abortion laws as less onerous than parental consent laws, Human Rights Watch and If/When/How found that parental notification laws effectively grant parents—or a judge—veto power over a young person’s abortion decision.

The researchers found that judicial bypass delays care, endangers young people, and can present an insurmountable barrier for some.

Researchers interviewed 62 healthcare providers, attorneys experienced in representing youth in judicial bypass cases, people working for abortion funds (organizations offering support to those seeking care), advocates, and public health researchers across the six states, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Iowa, Montana, and New Hampshire. They found that state-mandated parental notification laws have harmful impacts on youth similar to those in states with parental consent laws. Earlier this year, a similar law went into effect in Nevada, but that state is not included in the report. Legal challenges to Nevada’s law are ongoing.

When parents are able to withhold financial support, restrict young people’s movement or access to communication or transportation, or threaten life-altering consequences, they can effectively block young people’s access to abortion care even if the law requires only notice and not explicit consent, the researchers found.

“All young people should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and futures with the support of the people they trust,” said Jessica Goldberg, associate director of youth access at If/When/How and a co-author of the report. “Whether a young person can access abortion or not can determine the entire trajectory of their life. In this moment of continuous efforts to cut off access to abortion, it’s imperative that state policymakers use their power to remove needless barriers for young people.”

Even for young people who involve a parent and do not pursue judicial bypass, forced notification laws can delay and obstruct access to abortion, pushing young people to seek care later in pregnancy that may be more costly or time-consuming. Interviewees described young people delaying care by a week or more to track down contact information for a parent or legal guardian who was no longer involved in their lives. The laws compel some young people to involve unsupportive parents who belittle or shame them as they seek abortion care, the groups found.

In one case in the report, clinic staff believed a young person was so frightened by parental notification that she remained pregnant against her wishes. “We scheduled her for an appointment and hoped she could come, and we could walk her through the process [of parental notification or judicial bypass],” but the young person never made it to the appointment. “We lost contact with her.”

These laws also grant immense power to judges whose biases and antiabortion beliefs can influence their decisions to block a young person’s access to abortion. The system lends itself to arbitrary decision-making, with judges using factors such as young people’s grades, extracurricular activities, or career ambitions to determine their maturity to make an abortion decision.

“The idea that a young person is not mature enough to make a decision about whether they want to parent, but they are mature enough to raise a child … feels so disingenuous,” said the director of a clinic that provides abortion. “You can’t decide not to be pregnant, but you can raise a child for the rest of your life with no one questioning your maturity level?”

Parental notification laws and judicial bypass processes cause distinct and additional harm to youth already facing systematic barriers to accessing abortion care and fair treatment in the US legal system in general, especially Black, Indigenous, and other young people of color, and young people in the foster system, the groups found.

The deal involves the deportation and offshore detention of refugees, raising significant human rights concerns. Critics argue that this policy undermines Australia’s international standing and sparks internal political conflict. The Albanese Government is under pressure from both activists and allies to reassess its stance on immigration and human rights.

Background of the Nauru Deal

The Nauru deal, a cornerstone of Australia’s immigration policy, involves deporting asylum seekers to Nauru for offshore detention. This approach, aimed at deterring boat arrivals, has been controversial due to the harsh conditions reported on the island. The recent billion-dollar renewal of this policy has reignited debates over its efficacy and ethical implications. This move highlights Australia’s ongoing struggle with balancing border security and humanitarian obligations.

Human Rights Concerns

Key objections to the Nauru deal center on human rights violations. Reports from Nauru highlight overcrowding, inadequate medical care, and mental health issues among detainees. Organizations like Human Rights Watch argue that such conditions breach international human rights laws. The implications extend beyond ethics—these issues could tarnish Australia’s global reputation as a promoter of human rights. Critics urge immediate policy reform to align with international standards.

Learn more about the human rights criticisms here: https://www.hrlc.org.au/news/first-nauru-deportation/

Political and Economic Ramifications

Domestically, the Nauru deal fuels political tensions. The Albanese Government faces criticism from opposition parties advocating more humane refugee policies. Economically, the billion-dollar expenditure raises questions about fiscal priorities amid budget constraints. Internationally, strained relations with countries prioritizing human rights could impact trade and diplomacy. The economic and political stakes emphasize the need for a balanced immigration strategy that considers both security and human rights.

Potential Paths for Policy Reform

Addressing these concerns requires strategic policy shifts. Advocates suggest increasing transparency in detention centers and improving living conditions for asylum seekers. Additionally, exploring alternative paths, such as onshore processing, might alleviate human rights criticisms while maintaining border security. For Australia, adopting more compassionate immigration policies could restore its international image and foster political stability.

This perspective is gaining traction among legislative analysts and human rights groups.

Final Thoughts

Australia’s Nauru deal remains a controversial element of its immigration policy. While aimed at controlling immigration, the approach has sparked significant human rights concerns and political unrest. The Albanese Government stands at a crossroads, needing to balance national security with ethical obligations. Addressing these issues could improve Australia’s global standing and internal political landscape. By reassessing and potentially reforming its policies, Australia has the chance to align more closely with international human rights standards—an essential move for future harmony.

The ultimate objective is not legitimate law enforcement, it is to scare people to death.
It’s law enforcement at its most fearful.
He was willing to promote immigration enforcement in the manner that this administration wants, which is unlike anything I have ever seen before.","Every day, news of federal immigration raids, and the protests they attract, pop up across the country. Enforcement blitzes have drawn attention to Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities. In-your-face videos of aggressive tactics repeat — tear gas fired off in city streets, projectiles shot at journalists, children detained.

Sarah Saldaña, a former U.S. attorney in Texas, led Immigration and Customs Enforcement between 2014 and 2017 during President Barack Obama’s second term. Her tenure coincided with an influx of Central American families and unaccompanied children showing up at the Southern border, a period in which Obama received the moniker “deporter-in-chief” from immigration rights advocates. She was the last ICE director confirmed by Congress, and the agency has been led by acting heads ever since.

In a conversation with The Marshall Project that has been edited for clarity and length, Saldaña discussed how the agency has operated in past administrations and how it has changed since Trump returned to office earlier this year.

The Marshall Project: When you see ICE on the news today, what goes through your mind as a former leader? What tactics stick out to you?

Sarah Saldaña: We did not do our business out in public. We did not record our operations. Things are different. We weren’t out to make the news.

We were out to enforce the priorities of the administration, which at that time was [focusing on apprehending] terrorists down to aggravated felons, people who had a criminal conviction.

The priorities were not to go to a Home Depot and pick up people standing there waiting for day labor. That’s not something that happened. You planned ahead, and then you carried out the plan. And if you found the person you were looking for, that's the person you took. It wasn’t a matter of course that you would ask for identification of everybody in the household, let's say, and haul off people who were not a priority. That’s a very different operation than what’s happening now.

What do you think about the video footage that has been created and shared by Department of Homeland Security agencies like ICE?

I think the videoing is for clips for the evening news. That’s my opinion. All I know is that I’ve never seen ICE on the evening news so much as I have in the last three or four months. We were just as happy to work behind the scenes rather than having the people photographed or videoed. I think [Secretary] Kristi Noem is in half of them. And she’s not even with ICE. She’s with Homeland Security. She’s their boss, but I am not sure why she needs to go out on these operations other than one reason and one reason alone, and that’s advertising.

The secretary of Homeland Security has more important things to do than go out on operations. I can see doing it once or twice. I did it myself, just to know how an operation is conducted, but she’s in an awful lot of these videos. It strikes me as advertising. It strikes me as wanting to get the 15-second video and provide it to the evening news.

What’s your response to footage of the helicopters, flash-bangs and different means of luring people out of their homes during immigration enforcement operations?

I would describe it as “shock and awe.” It is intended. It is a different approach, certainly from what I experienced and from what I was familiar with. Its primary purpose does not appear to be making the community safer. It is intended to instill fear in those who might be subjected to our laws in the immigration area, as opposed to fostering public safety.

Is it effective?

If that’s the way you want to run your country, there are a lot of things that are effective. It’s effective to, like they are doing now, take drug dealers before trial, line them up against a wall, or shoot them in a boat and kill them. That’s very effective. That person won’t be dealing drugs anymore. But is it the way you want to run your country, is the question? Apparently the majority of the voting American public thought that was a good thing — that the ends justify the means. So it’s hard to say, “This is not our country,” because people had a choice when they voted and they voted for this approach.

Can ICE do these things?

Well, there are lawsuits all over the country that will test that issue. My personal belief is that a number of them, they cannot. And they will not withstand a legal challenge.

For instance?

The recent Supreme Court decision , I would say, to profile people. But clearly now that's legal after the Supreme Court case: If you speak Spanish and you look like you could be from another country, you could be interrogated. We will see where things come out. I am done predicting what the law of the land is because the Supreme Court is fashioning laws in a way that I would have never expected, like that profiling case.

My skin is brown. I speak Spanish fluently. I have been on occasion in old tattered clothes. I don’t think that that should be permitted to stop me — who was born in this country and has lived here for 73 years. I don’t think so, but apparently the law has changed, and profiling is allowable under those circumstances. We’ll see if specific cases are challenged, whether the facts of those cases justify if law enforcement can articulate a reason for stopping that person. It’s a slippery slope as far as I am concerned.

How would you have reacted to an agent stopping people for looking and sounding brown, or like they could potentially be undocumented?

It wouldn't have been tolerated.

Every administration has a right to set its own priorities. In this administration, it is, “Pick up anybody who is in the country without authorization.” Period. End of story. Even though they say, “Well, we are only after the worst of the worst,” I am sorry, that’s baloney.

What we are seeing today under this administration is extraordinary. It has never been done in this way before. There were already 11 or 12 million people without authorization in the United States before [President Joe] Biden took office. So I don’t know how you can blame President Biden for that. Now, did he let a lot more in? Of course he did. I have little patience for people who try to throw all that in one bag and say, “Look at where this country is now because of Biden.” It’s all the administrations beforehand. And it was the American public who said this is what I want to do. The voting public has a responsibility too.

You recently wrote a letter in The Dallas Morning News, titled “Stop the hate for ICE and for immigrants,” arguing for an overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws that would include a more secure border, reform of asylum restrictions and a “rational plan for allowing people from other countries to work here in jobs our citizens cannot or will not do.”

There is not a thoughtful, informed, methodical approach to immigration. It is slapdash, and as long as we don’t reform the immigration statute, not just through Band-Aids, but wholesale, we are going to continue this way. Every administration kind of comes in and does their thing. It doesn’t mean the future administrations considering comprehensive immigration reform won’t have their own priorities, I am just saying things like asylum can be tightened and accomplished without going after people who are here legally and seeking asylum.

What’s your reaction to Illinois state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat, who said ICE has acted like ""an invading army,"" with helicopters ""terrifying families"" from above, and in violation of people's ""right to live free from persecution and fear”?

I’d be open to somebody telling me how many times this has been repeated. I’d be open to those facts, but I have a problem with both sides using extreme rhetoric.

This idea that every immigrant who is in the country without authorization should not be dealt with, that’s not the law. The law prescribes that they have broken it by coming to the country without authorization. And remaining in the country without authorization is also illegal. I don’t know why we have to have an extreme on either side — either take everybody down or keep those borders open. There is so much wrong with both of those positions. It’s sad, but that’s where the extreme comes from.

Now this particular legislator, I am equally disturbed by activity like that [which Jiménez described]. I am not willing to say this is happening everywhere and it’s a national crisis. I don’t see it that way.

What do you think when you see federal agents with their faces covered, and the aggressive operations. Does that feel like the same agency to you?

No, no, no. It’s intended for TV. It’s intended for effect. It’s intended to instill fear. The ultimate objective is not legitimate law enforcement, it is to scare people to death. It is effective. There are a lot of people staying in their homes that would ordinarily come out, that are immigrants in the country without authorization. So, it’s effective. But it is disturbing to me to see that. It’s not law enforcement at its best. It’s law enforcement at its most fearful.

Face coverings?

There actually may be a basis for it. I think [immigration officers] are being targeted. Once they are targeted, of course, it’s not just the agent, it’s their families, their homes, getting doxxed. Now the left has provided a basis for those coverings. They weren’t legitimate at first, but now, you know, if I am on an airplane meeting somebody, I am not bragging that I am an ICE agent to anybody because they become targets. That Enforcement and Removal officer is not making policy.

What was Tom Homan, Trump’s appointed immigration czar, like to work with when you ran ICE?

I know him to be a great guy, based on my experience with him up through 2017. Very confident. Knows this area left and right. He is a convert, though, and a believer in this administration. He has always been fiercely loyal to whoever the head is. He was very easy to work with. I worried that he was going to die from a heart attack because he worked so hard. He’s a good human being. I just think he’s a believer in everything that this administration is doing.

He was willing to promote immigration enforcement in the manner that this administration wants, which is unlike anything I have ever seen before. I can’t judge him. I wish he would consider otherwise, but who is to say if you’ve got your own person in there. Expected to follow what the head honcho has to say. So, Tom is doing that.

Reportedly, ICE has increased spending for small arms from about $10 million to $70 million. Was it hard to get money when you were running ICE?

Not really, but our priorities were different. If you are picking up everybody, you are going to need a lot more money for that. Our priorities were, OK, we have $6 billion, we have 34,000 beds approved by Congress. Who should we be focusing on to fill those beds? Do we take a gardener who is working at a landscape company who has a pristine record in this country and has a family and has been here for decades? Or do we focus on the drug dealers, sexual assaults, domestic abuse perpetrators? It’s just prosecutorial discretion. Happens everyday in law enforcement. If we needed more money, we asked for it. Nothing like the numbers being discussed now.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/8ue3GBa_FYhMjMqKV4gwUBN8Vr8OWQp24dBjm5ukLTw/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9udHJ3a2VsZ2Ju/N2dvbm55eWphc2R4/N211dmZpLzI1MTAy/OV9DU29tb2Rldmls/bGFfU2FyYWhTYWxk/YW5hX0dldHR5SW1h/Z2VzLmpwZw,N,,2025-10-29 06:56:44.312385

As a response, FirstEnergy and its board retained separate outside counsel to perform internal investigations.
The District Court for the Southern District of Ohio found that privilege did not apply and granted access.
I.e., the internal investigation was initiated by legal counsel for the purpose of providing legal advice.
It was therefore evident that the driving force behind the internal investigations was in anticipation of litigation.","On October 3, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed that the fruits of internal company investigations conducted by counsel are protected by both the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. In re FirstEnergy Corp., No. 24-3654.

In 2016, the federal government launched an investigation into FirstEnergy, an Ohio-based public utility company, in connection with an alleged bribery scheme involving later-convicted State Representative Larry Householder. As a response, FirstEnergy and its board retained separate outside counsel to perform internal investigations. Two securities class actions against FirstEnergy followed, and the claimants requested access to all withheld documents from the two separate investigations. The District Court for the Southern District of Ohio found that privilege did not apply and granted access. FirstEnergy petitioned the Sixth Circuit for a Writ of Mandamus and a stay of the District Court’s order. The Sixth Circuit overruled the District Court’s Order on the following grounds:

Attorney-client privilege applied because “what was true for” Upjohn Co. v. United States, was also true for FirstEnergy. I.e., the internal investigation was initiated by legal counsel for the purpose of providing legal advice.

The work product doctrine applied in First Energy’s case because both the company and its board retained outside counsel in anticipation of legal risk, which later became the actual risk of liability resulting from the government’s potential investigations. The Court highlighted that “but for” the federal government’s investigation into FirstEnergy, the company and its board would not have retained counsel for the internal investigations. It was therefore evident that the driving force behind the internal investigations was in anticipation of litigation.

Takeaways for In-House Counsel:

To avail itself of privilege, it is imperative to clearly establish that counsel is being engaged for legal advice, because, as the Court highlighted, what matters most under attorney-client privilege is that a company seeks legal advice. Therefore, in-house teams should avoid ambiguity surrounding the role of outside counsel to maintain attorney-client privilege, even if the information obtained from that engagement informs other (non-legal) decisions within the company.

Equally as important is to clearly state in engagement communications with outside counsel that their services are being sought as a response to anticipated legal risk and/or potential litigation, including labeling documents with “attorney work product.”",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15853_0143.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 10:01:05.550921

Bovino appeared Tuesday for a tense hearing before U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse in downtown Chicago.
Those orders forbid agents from using tear gas or “riot control” weapons without giving two warnings and from deploying them against people who pose no immediate threat.
And that’s OK. That’s what democracy is,” Ellis said during the hearing, referring to protesters or others who might be voicing opposition to federal agents on the ground.
“If [federal agents] are using tear gas, they better be able to back it up,” she said.","CHICAGO — U.S. Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, the face of “Operation Midway Blitz” cracking down on illegal immigration, must report daily to a federal judge after reports of combative enforcement, including using tear gas.

Bovino appeared Tuesday for a tense hearing before U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse in downtown Chicago. She questioned him about reports of aggressive immigration enforcement and the federal agents’ treatment of protesters, journalists and even children during the ongoing “immigration blitz.”

The hearing was part of an ongoing lawsuit brought by local media organizations alleging that federal agents have violated prior court orders restricting their use of force. Those orders forbid agents from using tear gas or “riot control” weapons without giving two warnings and from deploying them against people who pose no immediate threat.

“They don’t have to like what you’re doing. And that’s OK. That’s what democracy is,” Ellis said during the hearing, referring to protesters or others who might be voicing opposition to federal agents on the ground. “They can say they don’t like what you’re doing, that they don’t like how you’re enforcing the laws, that they wish you would leave Chicago and take the agents with you. They can say that, and that’s fine. But they can’t get teargassed for it.”

While Bovino’s immigration enforcement efforts came under scrutiny Tuesday, President Donald Trump threatened to send ""more than the National Guard"" to combat crime in blue cities like Chicago. Some National Guard members have already been sent to Illinois, though they have yet to be deployed to the streets. The president has also sent the National Guard into Washington and is seeking to send troops to Portland, Oregon.

In Chicago, the judge, an Obama appointee, imposed a new requirement: Bovino must meet with her every weekday to update her on the immigration enforcement efforts. “Mr. Bovino’s going to be here every day at 6 to tell me what happened,” she said.

From the outset of the hourlong hearing, Ellis made clear her expectations. “My role is not to tell you that you can or cannot enforce validly passed laws by Congress,” she said. “My role is simply to see that any enforcement of those laws is done in a manner that is consistent with your obligations under the law.”

The judge reminded Bovino of rules that state he must “leave journalists alone. If they’re doing their job, they need to be left alone to do their job.”

Bovino agreed. “We’re on the same page,” he said.

Bovino listened intently while on the stand, and at least once took time to gaze across the courtroom, which was crowded with reporters and a few onlookers.

Outside the courthouse, a few protesters waved signs reading “Stop ICE Brutality” and “Judge Sara Ellis is a Boss.”

Inside, the tone was serious as Ellis read anecdotes aloud from reports that federal agents had used tear gas in Chicago neighborhoods during Halloween festivities. “Kids were tear gassed on their way to celebrate Halloween,” the judge said, referring to an incident in the Old Irving Park neighborhood on Chicago’s North Side. “Those kids were dressed up in their Halloween costumes. You can imagine, their sense of safety was shattered.”

Halloween was on the judge’s mind as she told government attorneys: “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

For his part, Bovino responded throughout the informational hearing with “yes ma’am,” and challenged only when asked about tear gas being used. “Your honor, I believe that each situation is dependent on the situation. I’d like to know more about what happened.”

Attorneys for the plaintiffs moved to ban tear gas altogether, but Ellis said for now she would not decide. “If [federal agents] are using tear gas, they better be able to back it up,” she said. “And if they can’t, then they will lose that as something they can use.”

Ellis raised concerns from the public that federal agents haven’t identified themselves. “I instructed all agents under my command to place an identifier conspicuously somewhere on their uniform,” Bovino replied. Ellis suggested IDs appear “in a conspicuous location” in at least two places, and Bovino agreed.

Ellis demanded that Bovino deliver use-of-force reports and body-worn camera footage compiled since Sept. 2.

And she ordered him to wear a camera himself. “The camera is your friend,” the judge said.

Bovino had acknowledged that he hadn’t been wearing one. “How about by Friday you get one for yourself?” Ellis asked. Bovino agreed, saying, “We can get that.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x7IeHFYMCuh6wslcl8CUKw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/c1271e1ada2a1017b9eb1774c151e36a,N,,2025-10-29 10:56:44.921761

Mnemty, an anti-racism nongovernmental organization, became the latest group to receive a one-month suspension order on Tuesday, its spokesperson Zied Rouin said.

Its president, Saadia Mosbah, has been detained since May 2024 along with several other migrant rights activists, as a once-vibrant post–Arab Spring civil society has steadily been eroded throughout the tenure of President Kais Saied.

Mnemty’s announcement came less than a week after similar suspensions were handed down to other leading groups.

The Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights — known by its French acronym FTDES — received a similar notice on Monday and the Tunisian Association for Democratic Women, a prominent feminist organization, days earlier.

Romdhan Ben Amor, FTDES spokesperson, told The Associated Press on Monday that he considered the move an attempt to deflect attention from major national issues, particularly environmental protests convulsing the city of Gabes. Targeting human rights groups like FTDES, he said, “aims to stigmatize individual and social rights and freedom defenders.”

He said he believed the group was targeted for its stances on two issues: the migration crisis and high-profile “conspiracy against state security” cases launched against politicians and opposition figures.

Ben Amor maintained that FTDES has always adhered to financial transparency laws. FTDES plans to appeal the suspension, he added.

The one-month suspension orders against FTDES and ATFD are the latest in a series of measures critics say are aimed at curbing the work and independence of civil society organizations since Saied’s 2021 consolidation of all branches of power.

As president, Saied has often cited foreign funding as a threat to Tunisia, using it to fuel a populist narrative and accuse his political opponents and social justice activists of being foreign agents and stirring unrest at home.

FTDES is among dozens more nongovernmental organizations that have been struck by continuous financial and tax audits in the past few months.

Colorado state law prohibits state and local agencies from assisting in most federal immigration enforcement.","Chaos erupted outside of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Tuesday in southwestern Colorado after agents took a family into custody and Durango police tried to get the children released. The arrest and subsequent protest have sparked outrage from some in the small city and statements denouncing ICE's actions from local immigrant advocacy groups.

In a now-widely circulated video, a masked agent took a 57-year-old woman's phone as she recorded the events and as she tried to retrieve it, he threw her to the ground. The agent is only identified with a patch on his vest that reads ""police"" with a badge next to it.

She and other protesters characterized it as theft and assault. This all unfolded around 6 a.m.

""I was videotaping this ICE agent, and I said to him -- because they swear that they're good Christians, right? -- and I said to him, 'you're a good Christian, right?' Looking him in the eyes, and I said, 'what would Jesus do?' and that's when he flipped out and- I don't know if he grabbed my phone or flicked it out of my hands, that's sort of a blur to me,"" Franci Stagi told CBS News Colorado in a Zoom interview on Tuesday. ""Then I had my knee-jerk reaction of sort of going after my phone, which I shouldn't have done, but I don't know, I just- so I did touch him on the shoulder after he grabbed my phone.""

That's when Stagi said the agent reacted violently.

""He grabbed me by the hair, and he lifted me off the ground somehow, in a chokehold. It's still really blurry, but I've seen the video myself,"" she said, choking up in tears as she recalled. ""Then he and two other ICE agents were over top of me which- they're huge people and it's just pretty surprising that this would happen.""

Stagi described herself as a 5-foot-2-inch waitress and worries about how children in custody are being treated -- the initial reason for the protest outside the facility.

""If they're doing this to me- there's an 11-year-old girl. A little girl and her brother in detention right now. What are they doing to her? It's horrible,"" she said. She went on to say the initial agent who grabbed her was pulled away from her by another masked agent, whose vest said ""ICE.""

The crowd of about 50 protesters gathered after they and immigrant advocacy groups said ICE arrested a Colombian family seeking asylum while the father took the children to school the previous day.

""Despite our members remaining entirely peaceful, an ICE agent violently punched one of our community members in the face,"" a statement from the Southwest Colorado Rapid Response Network read, in part. ""This excessive force against peaceful protestors is unacceptable and underscores the brutal tactics ICE is willing to employ.""

A spokesperson for ICE's Denver Field Office and the Department of Homeland Security -- ICE's parent agency -- in Denver, said the agency was looking into the incident and questions about the family's arrest and likely wouldn't have a response or statement until Wednesday.

A joint statement from city leaders said Durango police officers tried to intervene in the detention of the children.

""On multiple occasions, Durango Police requested to facilitate the release of the children to their mother, but were unsuccessful. On Tuesday, the Police Department received a report that one of the children may have been in distress and potentially experiencing abuse. In response, officers attempted to conduct a welfare check and to bring food. Unfortunately, federal agents denied officers entry to the facility,"" the statement read, in part.

""In moments like these, our duty is not only to uphold the law, but to preserve our humanity,"" Durango Police Chief Brice Current said in a statement. ""While we have a sworn responsibility not to interfere with federal operations, our department advocated for the children's well-being. These situations are complex and often misunderstood. I want to be clear: the Durango Police Department operates independently and remains fully committed to protecting every member of our community with compassion and professionalism.""

The detained family has not been publicly identified, but Stagi said the girl is 11 and her brother is 14.

City officials have asked the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate the events from the protest. Because the event occurred on federal property, the city says the FBI is also investigating.

In addition to calling for the release of the children, the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition is calling for an investigation into ""the use of excessive force by ICE agents against peaceful protestors"" and an investigation by the Colorado Attorney General's Office into ""local cooperation with ICE."" The organization specifically called attention to the participation of Colorado Highway Patrol troopers.

""The presence of state troopers with ICE raises alarming questions about the level of local and state cooperation in this operation,"" said Gladis Ibarra, co-executive director of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. ""We need immediate clarity from state officials on their role in this family's separation and the violence that followed. The people of Colorado have a right to know if their state is violating its own laws to aid in tearing families apart.""

Colorado State Patrol said troopers did respond to the protest ""at the request of local law enforcement,"" saying protesters ""were reported to have blocked the facility's exit and bolted an access gate closed."" The agency said troopers did not assist in any immigration enforcement action or deploy any weapons or chemical munitions.

""The Patrol's role was to aid in de-escalation and protection of all parties present, maintain the peace, and address any identified unlawful behavior,"" CSP said in a statement.

Colorado state law prohibits state and local agencies from assisting in most federal immigration enforcement.

Stagi said she just wants the children released and reunited with their family.

""If my child was abducted and I knew where they were, I would hope that people would show up. I would hope people would show up and help me, even if they're total strangers,"" Stagi said. ""I see you. I hear your call. I feel what you're going through. I have empathy, compassion, I want to help you and I don't know how, but by being there physically with my presence, I was hoping to help.

“ICE has blocked all the mother’s attempts to see her children, and is reportedly preparing to forcibly separate these minor children from their father and send them alone to Texas.
In its statement, Durango officials said that ICE told local police that immigration agents tried to release the kids to another parent.

“The federal government’s lack of transparency about its immigration actions in Durango and the free state of Colorado remains extremely maddening,” he wrote.","Two children and their father on their way to school were detained by federal immigration agents in southwestern Colorado on Monday, sparking protests from demonstrators who tried to prevent the family from being separated and moved to different facilities.

Videos of the protest posted on social media Tuesday show law enforcement clashing with demonstrators outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Durango, where agents in tactical gear carried weapons capable of firing less-lethal projectiles. Video taken overnight shows one agent taking and throwing a woman’s phone and then throwing the woman to the ground. Other protesters appeared to have been hit by projectiles fired by federal officers.

In a statement, the city of Durango said it had asked the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate the woman who was shoved by the federal agent.

Fernando Jaramillo Solano and his two children, ages 12 and 15, were detained by ICE on Monday morning while driving near their home, said Enrique Orozco-Perez, the co-executive director of the Compañeros Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center.

The family applied for asylum after coming to Colorado from Colombia and has an active, ongoing immigration case. The children’s mother, who is the primary applicant on the asylum case, has not been detained, the group said.

“ICE has blocked all the mother’s attempts to see her children, and is reportedly preparing to forcibly separate these minor children from their father and send them alone to Texas. This is not enforcement; it is a traumatic kidnapping of family members who are doing everything right and being punished for it,” Compañeros said in a statement.

Steve Kotecki, spokesman for ICE’s Denver field office, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The protests echoed similar opposition that’s been mounted against ICE facilities in Chicago and Portland, where protesters have gathered outside of the agency’s offices and detention centers.

Orozco-Perez said in an interview that Solano was “violently” arrested Monday morning while taking his kids to school. He shouted to volunteers who’d arrived to observe the arrest that his children were in the car, and the kids were also handcuffed and detained.

In its statement, Durango officials said that ICE told local police that immigration agents tried to release the kids to another parent. Orozco-Perez said the children’s mother was afraid to come to the scene for fear of being arrested. Local police “then offered to facilitate the release of the children back to their mother, but were informed that it was no longer an option,” according to the city’s statement.

Volunteer legal aides from the group also came to the ICE field office, where the family was held, to provide documents about the family’s pending asylum case. ICE officials refused to accept the documents, Orozco-Perez said.

The police also attempted a welfare check on the children, one of whom “may have been in distress and potentially experiencing abuse,” the city said. But Durango officers were denied entry into the facility.

“In moments like these, our duty is not only to uphold the law, but to preserve our humanity,” said Police Chief Brice Current. “While we have a sworn responsibility not to interfere with federal operations, our department advocated for the children’s well-being.”

Protesters began to gather outside the facility shortly after the arrests Monday. When an attorney later arrived to again try to provide documents to ICE, legal aides were told by ICE that the family would be detained together, Orozco-Perez said.

But the children’s mother later told advocates that she’d spoken with one of her kids and that they had been told they would be transported to Texas while their father was moved to Colorado’s immigration detention center in Aurora. Protesters then set up an all-night vigil to try to prevent any vehicles from leaving.

That’s when one volunteer from Compañeros was shoved by an ICE agent, Orozco-Perez said. Video posted to Facebook by the group shows a masked agent grab a phone from a volunteer who’d held her camera close to the man’s face. The agent then throws the phone as the woman yelled for him to return it. He then grabbed the woman and threw her to the ground, the video shows.

In its statement, the city said it had requested an independent investigation into the incident. Rob Lowe, spokesman for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, declined to comment on the request Tuesday.

The protests continued into Tuesday morning and afternoon. Law enforcement began handcuffing and pulling people sitting in front of the office’s gates. A group of Colorado State Patrol troopers were also present and appeared to be clearing the road so several SUVs could leave the building. Protesters threw objects and bottles of water at the SUVs, one of which grazed a protester standing in the roadway as it sped past them.

Susy, who volunteers with a local immigrant advocacy group and asked to be identified only by her first name to avoid retaliation, said ICE personnel were picking up and “bodily throwing” protesters who’d blocked the gates. She said they were then sprayed in the face with pepperspray.

“To have it in our little peaceful community is just — ” she sighed. “I don’t know what to say. To have our own government attacking people and spraying tear gas in our faces, it’s bad.”

Video also shows a masked agent in tactical gear unloading what appear to be pepper balls from close range on two people sitting in the roadway.

“What you saw was people defending our community with their bodies, trying to not allow ICE to leave,” Orozco-Perez said.

Sgt. Ivan Alvarado, spokesman for the state patrol, said the agency was at the protest to assist. In a subsequent statement, an unnamed agency spokesperson wrote it arrived “at the request of local enforcement.”

“The Patrol did not participate in any immigration enforcement action. Demonstrators were reported to have blocked the facility’s exit and bolted an access gate closed,” the spokesperson wrote. “The Patrol’s role was to aid in de-escalation and protection of all parties present, maintain the peace, and address any identified unlawful behavior. Members of the Colorado State Patrol did not use any weapons or chemical munitions.”

Tom Sluis, spokesman for the city, said the city had notified the patrol about ICE’s apparent plans to transport the family and that the patrol then said it would be present at the Durango facility.

In a statement, Gov. Jared Polis said he was “deeply concerned” about the family’s detention.

“The federal government’s lack of transparency about its immigration actions in Durango and the free state of Colorado remains extremely maddening,” he wrote. “The federal government should prioritize apprehending and prosecuting dangerous criminals, no matter where they come from, and keep our communities safe instead of snatching up children and breaking up families.”

In a statement, Durango School District spokesperson Karla Sluis said the district could not confirm whether any students were involved in “immigration enforcement action” because of federal privacy laws.

“Our schools remain safe and welcoming places for every student who walks through our doors. By both state and federal law, every child is entitled to a public education regardless of background or circumstance, and the district does not collect or share information about immigration status,” Sluis said.

The Durango arrests come days after a Parker teacher and her family were detained during a routine check-in appointment in Centennial, despite having legal authorization to live and work in the United States.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-Z-durango-ice-protest-003.jpg?w=1024&h=955,N,,2025-10-28 23:17:14.840019

It was that order, halting the mission while litigation proceeded, that the appeals court panel would go on to assess.
But in its Oct. 20 order, the appeals court panel majority disagreed, finding that Immergut should have deferred more to Trump’s analysis of events and his military judgement.
The dissenting judge on the panel had asked her colleagues on the broader appeals court to consider rehearing the case en banc—as a larger group.
Soon, another judge on the appeals court initiated proceedings for a vote.","In yet another twist in a weighty legal dispute, an appeals court has cancelled a ruling that had largely cleared the way for the Trump administration to deploy U.S. troops in Portland, opting to rehear the matter with a larger group of judges instead.

“Upon the vote of a majority of nonrecused active judges, it is ordered that this case be reheard en banc,” wrote Chief Judge Mary H. Murguia of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in an order Tuesday evening. The previous order, which a three judge panel of the court had published Oct. 20 “is vacated,” she wrote.

“This ruling shows the truth matters and that the courts are working to hold this administration accountable,” said Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield in a statement shortly after the latest order came down. “The Constitution limits the president’s power, and Oregon’s communities cannot be treated as a training ground for unchecked federal authority.”

What comes next at the appeals court level was not immediately clear. The order gave no other information, and did not set a schedule for its proceedings.

But the development means a Portland district court judge’s temporary restraining orders, which have now for weeks been blocking the deployment, are set to remain in place until their natural expiration dates, which remain a few days out.

Meanwhile, Oregon continues to seek a more durable block on the deployment: an injunction. The lower court is set to consider this matter in a three-day bench trial beginning Wednesday.

It has now been a month since President Donald Trump acted, following a provocative post on his social media platform, Truth Social, to deploy federalized Oregon National Guard members to Portland to quash protests surrounding the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on the south end of town—a move state and local leaders said was plainly unnecessary, but which the president said would restore order to a leftist hellscape allegedly besieged by domestic terrorists.

Arguing that this nightmarish characterization was an absurd fiction, Oregon officials filed suit, and won a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment to Portland. It was that order, halting the mission while litigation proceeded, that the appeals court panel would go on to assess.

The lower court judge, Karin J. Immergut, had found that the conditions on the ground in Portland did not appear meet any of the legally relevant circumstances under which the President was authorized to federalize the National Guard for domestic deployment.

But in its Oct. 20 order, the appeals court panel majority disagreed, finding that Immergut should have deferred more to Trump’s analysis of events and his military judgement.

The appeals court decision, rejecting the reasoning of the lower court’s first restraining order, seemed to all but clear the way for the deployment to proceed.

Yet there was another wrinkle. The dissenting judge on the panel had asked her colleagues on the broader appeals court to consider rehearing the case en banc—as a larger group. Soon, another judge on the appeals court initiated proceedings for a vote.

On Friday, the appeals court, noting that it had the consent of the members of the smaller panel, paused the Oct. 20 ruling of their colleagues while they considered whether to go the en banc route and hear the case as a larger cohort. The results of that vote arrived Tuesday evening.

On Wednesday morning, meanwhile, the case is set to proceed on a parallel track in Immergut’s courtroom at the federal courthouse in Portland.

Lawyers for Oregon and the Trump administration have in recent days been filing briefs citing various authorities—old court cases, media reports, an 1891 dictionary definition for the word “rebellion”—as they establish their basic cases for why the judge should, or should not, establish a more durable block on the deployment.

At issue is whether the situation at the ICE facility justified the calling in of the National Guard—and specifically, whether the president, as the applicable federal law puts it, “is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States” or “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

In its brief, the U.S. government argues that “both conditions apply in Portland.”

In the weeks and months before the president made this assessment, Trump administration lawyers write, “agitators assaulted federal officers and damaged federal property in numerous ways.”

In its brief, however the state of Oregon and its allies say the challenges federal and local law enforcement have faced outside that facility have been plainly ordinary.

If the protests indeed grew violent in June, they remained well the capacity of law enforcement to manage, the state says, and from there they grew far tamer, into September, when police reports indicate little of note was happening outside the ICE facility at all.

Then, Oregon says, came Trump’s Sept. 27 post saying he would send troops to “War ravaged” Portland. Crowd sizes and tensions again increased, Oregon officials argue, though the most problematic interactions involved altercations between protesters and counter protestors—rather than being directed at federal officers.

One thing that both parties seem to agree on is that relations between the Portland Police Bureau and federal agents have been poor of late—though their analyses differ greatly.

The feds note that local law forbids PPB from assisting with immigration enforcement, but that the local police department has an “extraordinarily capacious understanding of the scope of this prohibition” and has at times refused to help to protect the ICE facility, or work constructively with their federal counterparts to, say, clear the ICE driveway of protesters.

Portland Police Bureau officers are set to testify otherwise at trial. And the state’s brief, for its part, argues that relations soured as federal law enforcement needlessly deployed munitions, gassing PPB officers themselves and creating made-for-TV spectacles out of minor protest events. Meanwhile the state says, the federal officer deployment surged without a clear command and control structure, undermining communication between federal and local officials.

As an example of the problems that emerged, the brief notes a moment when pepper balls were shot in the direction of a PPB officer. When confronted, the brief says said, federal officials responded, “help or get out of the way.”",https://www.wweek.com/resizer/v2/NTDHZXJD2JDYVPMNUFEIV6PS3I.jpg?smart=true&auth=33dd5c63b73248b8e8e25b9e5951e08324efcb94fd949d237773ef1d039c915d&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-29 01:56:58.141089

(Reuters) -President Donald Trump’s administration has told the U.S. Supreme Court he needs to deploy National Guard troops to the Chicago area in part because local police have failed to respond to what the Justice Department described as mob violence by people protesting his aggressive immigration enforcement.

Those law enforcement agencies have given the nine justices a starkly different account of protests they called limited in scale, detailing in court filings how they have responded on specific dates and explaining how a unified command they set up to coordinate efforts dealt effectively with the demonstrations.

This is just one of many contrasts in how events on the ground are being portrayed in the case, creating for the justices what may be a dilemma over who to believe as they mull the Justice Department’s October 17 emergency request to allow the deployment. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the move, rejecting the administration’s legal rationale and its version of events. The Supreme Court could act at any time.

The Justice Department relied heavily in its Supreme Court request on two written statements to justify its stated need for the National Guard to protect federal agents and property. The statements by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency official Russell Hott and Border Patrol official Daniel Parra portray the situation on the ground as dire and dangerous.

The Justice Department cited Hott’s declaration 37 times in its 40-page application to the Supreme Court, and Parra’s 15 times, a Reuters analysis showed.

Chicago-based U.S. District Judge April Perry found the sources of the administration’s facts to be unreliable, a determination an appeals court upheld.

“In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor” by Hott and Parra, Perry wrote in her decision, “it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts.”

In the U.S. legal system, trial judges and juries have the primary role in fact-finding, with higher courts generally deferring to those conclusions.

“Here, the district judge carefully detailed the factual record and found it ‘impossible to align’ with the statements in the affidavits submitted by the administration. The judge also raised serious credibility concerns with those statements,” said Brandon Garrett, a Duke University School of Law expert in legal evidence.

Garrett said it would be “all the more problematic for the Supreme Court to engage in fact-finding which is outside of its role as an appellate court.”

University of Chicago constitutional law professor Aziz Huq said it is not surprising for the court to be encountering a major gap between versions of events given its increasing willingness to settle weighty matters on its so-called emergency docket – as in this case – before the facts of a dispute have been fully determined.

“The Supreme Court has created a situation in which the ordinary process for settling factual disputes no longer exists in these cases,” Huq said.

The Justice Department declined to comment. An ICE spokesperson said that agency “is not going to comment on court documents and pending litigation.” The Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment.

DOMESTIC DEPLOYMENTS

In their legal challenge to Trump’s deployment, the city of Chicago and state of Illinois have said he is using protests that have been limited in size and severity as a pretext to dispatch troops to punish adversaries and stifle dissent. They noted that Trump has talked about sending the military into Democratic-led cities like Chicago for years.

Trump since June has deployed troops to various Democratic-led jurisdictions in an extraordinary expansion of the use of the military for domestic purposes. Trump also has sent them to Los Angeles, Memphis and Washington, D.C., and has sought to dispatch them to Portland.

Challenges to those deployments are playing out in other cities. A judge who already has blocked the Portland deployment is set to preside over a trial beginning on Wednesday.

GLARING DIFFERENCES

A comparison of statements provided by both sides as evidence in the case reveals important differences in how the situation in Chicago and at a federal immigration processing facility called BSSA in the suburb of Broadview is being described, including the nature and size of protests and the response of local and state authorities.

Hott stated that “riots at the BSSA escalated from September 12 to the present,” alleging blocked traffic, vandalized property and assaults on personnel. Broadview Police Department Chief Thomas Mills, in his own written statement, never mentions a riot or rioters, and said protesters number typically fewer than 50.

On the use of tear gas and pepper spray near the BSSA, Parra said federal agents take such steps only after issuing warnings and only against “assaultive subjects.” But Mills called this use by federal agents indiscriminate and “unlike anything I have seen before,” sometimes targeting a protest with no more than 10 people.

The Hott and Parra statements use nearly identical language in detailing an October 4 incident in which a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a female driver in Chicago who allegedly aimed her car at the agent, the Reuters analysis found.

For instance, both statements include the following passage: “Approximately 200 rioters converged near the scene of the shooting at three separate locations. Over the next four hours, rioters threw objects at agents, including glass bottles and traffic cones, and forcefully pushed the agents. The Chicago Police Department initially refused to assist, but over one hour later, they provided perimeter security.”

The gender of the federal agent who shot the woman was changed from male in the Hott and Parra statements to female in the Justice Department’s later Supreme Court filing.

“A declaration or affidavit is far less credible if it uses repeated text or legal language,” Garrett said. “A hearing can shed more light on such documents. And that kind of fact-finding is the role of a district court. The Supreme Court is not in a position to carefully evaluate a factual record.”

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces answering to state governors except when called into federal service by the president. Trump has relied on a law that lets a president deploy state National Guard troops to suppress a rebellion or if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Trump’s administration federalized 300 Illinois National Guard troops and ordered more Texas National Guard troops into Illinois.

WINNING WAYS

In almost every challenge to Trump’s actions since he returned to office in January, the Supreme Court has ruled in his favor, often lifting orders imposed by district court judges.

“The Supreme Court does not appear to give a great deal of weight to district court findings of credibility. To my mind, that is a very problematic stance for the court to take,” Huq said.

“It suggests that the Supreme Court has the power not just to pick and choose what the law is, but it has the power to pick and choose what the facts are,” Huq added.

Perry, appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment as likely violating the federal law establishing preconditions for use of National Guard troops as well as the state’s rights under the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment.

Perry faulted the statements by Hott and Parra for “equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting or doing violence.”

A three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously left Perry’s order in place, concluding “the facts do not justify the president’s actions in Illinois.” Two of the three judges were appointed by Republican presidents, including one by Trump.

Richard Friedman, a University of Michigan Law School expert on evidence and the Supreme Court, said if the justices apply normal standards, they would overturn the district judge’s factual findings only if they are “clearly erroneous” – a high bar, Friedman said.

That form of deference may yield to another in this case, given it involves the president and his power over military matters.

“The court will presumably give a great deal of deference to the executive,” Friedman said.

The US must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the air strike on the Sa’ada migrant detention centre and make the results public.
Kristine Beckerle “The US must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the air strike on the Sa’ada migrant detention centre and make the results public.","A new, in-depth investigation by Amnesty International concludes that a US air strike on a migrant detention centre in Sa’ada, north-western Yemen, on 28 April 2025 that killed and injured dozens of African migrants amounted to an indiscriminate attack. US authorities must promptly and transparently investigate it as a war crime.

The attack, carried out by the US military during “Operation Rough Rider,” inflicted catastrophic civilian harm on vulnerable migrants, many of whom were held by the Huthi de facto authorities in the detention centre solely for their irregular immigration status.

‘It is a miracle we survived’: US air strike on civilians held in Sa’ada detention centre is based on interviews with 15 survivors, all of whom were Ethiopian migrants detained in Sa’ada, and analysis of digital evidence, including satellite imagery, photos and videos. The report provides compelling evidence that, in carrying out this attack, the US failed to abide by its obligation under international humanitarian law to distinguish between civilian objects and military objectives.

The strike killed and injured dozens of the migrants held at the detention centre at the time of the attack. Survivors who spoke to Amnesty International were able to identify by name and approximate age 16 of the people – all Ethiopian migrants, all men and most in their twenties – who had been killed.

This was a lethal failure by the US to comply with one of its core obligations under international humanitarian law.

“The harrowing testimonies from survivors paint a clear picture of a civilian building, packed with detainees, being bombed without distinction. This was a lethal failure by the US to comply with one of its core obligations under international humanitarian law: to do everything feasible to verify whether the object attacked was a military objective,” said Kristine Beckerle, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.

“Victims and their families should receive full reparation, including financial compensation. Given the air strike killed and injured civilians, the US authorities should investigate this attack as a war crime. Where sufficient evidence exists, competent authorities should prosecute any person suspected of criminal responsibility, including under the doctrine of command responsibility.”

Amnesty International formally requested information from US Central Command (CENTCOM) and US Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) on 27 August 2025, detailing its findings and seeking clarification on the military objective attacked and the precautions taken. CENTCOM provided only a brief response on the same day the request was sent, stating that it was still “assessing all reports of civilian harm”, that it was taking all of them “seriously” and reviewing them “thoroughly”.

Amnesty International also requested information from the Huthi de facto authorities on 11 September 2025, sharing its findings and seeking clarification regarding the uses of the Sa’ada prison compound and the migrant detention centre, the number of people detained at the time of the attack, their conditions of detention, and what steps, if any, the Huthi authorities took to investigate the failure of prison guards to allow detainees to seek safe shelter.

The Huthi Ministry of Justice and Human Rights provided two detailed responses on 24 September and 6 October 2025, including information on the number of migrants detained at the centre, denying any wrongdoing in terms of conditions of detention, and sharing a list of casualties from the US air strike.

A mass-casualty attack on a known civilian target

Amnesty International’s investigation found no evidence that the migrant detention centre was a military objective. Survivors said the migrant detention centre was an open space, so they were able to see everyone who was present in the building, whom were all migrant detainees.

The facility, part of the Sa’ada prison compound, had been used for years by the Huthis to detain migrants, and its civilian nature was widely known. It was visited by humanitarian organizations.

A few years earlier, on 21 January 2022, the Saudi-led coalition carried out an air strike on another detention facility within the same prison compound in Sa’ada. The 2022 attack, which Amnesty International also investigated, was carried out using a US-made precision guided munition, killing more than 90 detainees and injuring dozens.

Given this context, the US should have known the facility was a civilian object and that any aerial attack could result in significant death and injury to civilians. Under international humanitarian law, attacking forces have an obligation to do everything feasible to verify whether their intended target is a military objective and, if there is doubt in this respect, to refrain from launching an attack or to cancel or suspend it.

Survivors severely injured, maimed and traumatized

Almost all the 15 survivors Amnesty International spoke to said that they were sleeping when they heard the sound of an explosion nearby, sometime between 4 and 4:30 a.m. This was most likely a US air strike on a different structure within the Sa’ada prison compound which took place minutes earlier.

According to satellite imagery, another building, located about 180 meters from where the migrants were detained, was hit and destroyed the same day. In their response to Amnesty International, the Huthis stated that this building was a prison administration building.

Survivors said they woke up terrified and ran towards the gate of the detention centre. They screamed for help and pounded on the gate, asking the prison guards to let them out to seek safety. Instead, prison guards fired warning shots, to keep the detainees inside. Minutes later, a second US airstrike hit the migrant detention centre.

In their response to Amnesty International, the Huthi de facto authorities stated that 117 African migrants were detained at the time of the strike, of whom 61 were killed and 56 injured. They also claimed that “there were no recorded instances in which prison guards prevented detainees from fleeing the targeted area or from seeking a safe location”, but did not respond clearly to whether they had investigated this particular incident.

The air strike caused profound civilian harm with devastating, long-lasting consequences. Of the 15 survivors interviewed by Amnesty International, 14 sustained critical injuries with lifelong impacts including lost limbs, serious nerve damage, as well as head, spine and chest trauma. Two of the 15 migrants had their legs amputated, one had his hand amputated, and one lost an eye.

One 20-year-old survivor, Hagos*, who lost his leg and regained consciousness days after the attack in hospital, described his pain, stating: “You just wish you were dead there… I am begging for some money from friends to get the treatment and pills.”

Another survivor, Desta*, suffered from a head injury and lost one of his eyes. He was so traumatized that he could not speak for 20 days. He said: “The attack was really terrible, it killed lots of people, it made us disabled and left others in shock and terror.”

At the time of the interviews, almost two months after the US air strike, 10 survivors said that they still required some form of medical treatment, including follow up surgeries and medication. They also said that, despite their dire economic situation, they were paying for this treatment themselves or with the support of their financially struggling families back home.

Urgent call for accountability and reparations

In addition to its obligations under international humanitarian law, the USA has codified in its domestic law and policies key human rights protections and international humanitarian law obligations. The US Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction on Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response notes that mitigating civilian harm is not limited to compliance with international humanitarian law and encourages commanders to “take additional protective measures not required by the law of war as they deem appropriate”.

Critical systems put in place in recent years in the US to reduce and better respond to civilian harm caused by US military actions abroad are under threat by the Trump Administration. Amnesty International urges the US Congress to ensure that civilian harm mitigation and response mechanisms remain intact and robustly funded to effectively respond to this and other recent incidents.

The US must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the air strike on the Sa’ada migrant detention centre and make the results public.

Kristine Beckerle

“The US must conduct a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, and transparent investigation into the air strike on the Sa’ada migrant detention centre and make the results public. Survivors of this attack deserve nothing less than full justice. They must receive full, effective, and prompt reparations, including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition, through an effective and accessible mechanism,” said Kristine Beckerle.

Amnesty International also urges the Huthi de facto authorities to conduct a transparent investigation into the failure to evacuate and provide shelter to the detained migrants. They should also end the arbitrary detention of migrants based solely on their immigration status and nationality and provide survivors of the US air strike with temporary residency status so they may recuperate, heal, and complete essential medical treatment without fear of re-detention.

The administration is downplaying the importance of a leadership reshuffle at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the infusion of Customs and Border Protection leaders into ICE field offices is already getting a sour reception at the agency.

The move, news of which broke Monday night, involved sending CBP leaders into as many as 12 of ICE’s “underperforming” field offices. Deputy ICE Director MADISON SHEAHAN said on Fox this morning, “What you are seeing here is us being able to work with Secretary [KRISTI NOEM] and President [DONALD TRUMP] to be able to deliver on his promise to remove the worst of the worst.”

But there’s already internal blowback. An administration official told our own Myah Ward that “it’s not going over well at ICE. Not at all going over well.” NatSec Daily granted the official anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the personnel changes.

Border Patrol is a significantly more aggressive agency than ICE, but it lacks some of ICE’s community knowledge that could be useful in the sensitive situations Trump’s crackdown could create, according to KATHLEEN BUSH-JOSEPH, an immigration lawyer and analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute think tank in Washington.

Border Patrol is “used to very quickly deport primarily single Mexican men, and they were the ones who were doing expedited removal, which means deportation in a matter of hours,” she told NatSec Daily. ICE, meanwhile, is used to dealing with the issues that arise when federal agents arrest people in workplaces and in their neighborhoods.

That makes it likely that the leadership reshuffle is teeing up additional internal divisions within the U.S. government’s immigration enforcement apparatus.

The shakeup at ICE — which is expected to affect field offices in cities including Los Angeles, San Diego, New Orleans and Philadelphia — comes as progress has stalled towards the Trump administration’s promise to deport a million unauthorized immigrants in a year. ICE has had to navigate a limited number of beds to hold and process immigrants in its custody and intense pressure from the White House over the last few months. It has pushed to quickly hire 10,000 new agents, but that recruitment is expected to still take some time as officers are screened and trained.

The Trump administration has commissioned CBP agents and Border Patrol officers, as well as agents and officials from across the U.S. government, to support ICE as it tries to ramp up deportations. Arrivals at the southern border have ticked up in recent months, but those numbers are still below the levels they were at when the Trump administration took office.

The U.S. government also hasn’t released comprehensive data about removals in months, leading some analysts to question whether the deportation figures the administration touts are accurate.

For its part, DHS is arguing that there’s no daylight between any parts of the administration on how to achieve deportation and immigration goals.

Spokesperson TRICIA McLAUGHLIN told NatSec Daily that “since the beginning, President Trump promised to arrest the worst of the worst criminals and those in our country illegally. Our leadership understands that mission and is committed to defending the homeland.” McLaughlin also pushed back on the idea that these would be anything more than “standard personnel changes.”

The Inbox

RAFT OF RARE EARTHS: Trump and Japanese Prime Minister SANAE TAKAICHI signed an agreement today to each “intensify” their efforts to increase the “resilience and security of critical minerals and rare earths supply chains.” In other words, make sure there are plenty of options beyond China for obtaining minerals needed for advanced technology, including on the battlefield.

The framework, released by the White House, says reps from both countries will convene a bilateral ministerial on mining within 180 days. The two sides also agreed to take steps to “provide financial support” to projects that will generate products for delivery in the U.S., Japan and “like-minded countries.”

Critical minerals have been a clear focus of Trump’s trip through Asia, and he has reached agreements with Cambodia and Malaysia and frameworks with Thailand and Vietnam to cooperate on the processing and exports of critical minerals. He inked another with Australia last week to boost efforts to produce the coveted raw materials.

NADIA SCHADLOW, a former deputy national security adviser for strategy, told NatSec Daily these deals should be seen in the context of Trump’s meeting planned for Thursday with Chinese President XI JINPING.

“It gives Trump leverage ahead of his meeting with Xi,” she said. “It shows there’s ongoing concern over giving the Chinese continuing leverage over critical inputs. This is an alternative, this is a counterweight. These deals show how powerful working with partners can be.”

CEASEFIRE ON THE ROCKS: The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be in trouble.

Israel launched strikes on an area of Gaza close to Shifa hospital after Israeli Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU declared that he’d ordered strikes on the strip earlier today.

In a post to social media ahead of the attacks Netanyahu announced that he had ordered the military to “immediately carry out forceful strikes in the Gaza Strip” after “security consultations,” our own Gregory Svirnovskiy reports.

Although Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of ceasefire violations since the peace agreement was struck earlier this month, Israel’s move today marks a major escalation of conflict under the fragile truce.

Netanyahu did not provide a rationale for the decision, though Israel earlier today claimed that Hamas had opened fire at Israeli military forces in southern Gaza, adding to frustrations over Hamas’ return of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage that had already been retrieved.

Hamas has accused Israel of obstructing the entry of heavy machinery needed to clear rubble and find bodies, both of Israeli hostages and Palestinians killed in airstrikes. Today, the group said Israel is violating the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to hold Israel to the terms of the ceasefire. It also said it would delay the handover of a body of an Israeli hostage “due to violations by the occupation.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the strike decision.

HIT ’EM WHERE IT HURTS: Ukrainian President VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY wants to expand Ukraine’s strikes against oil facilities deep within Russia and is stressing that he needs more weapons to do it, our own Veronika Melkozerova reports.

In comments to a small group of journalists Monday, including Veronika, Zelenskyy pointed to the success of prior strikes on Russian oil facilities that forced the country to redistribute production to other refineries.

“Therefore, our task is absolutely clear,” Zelenskyy said, “to continue our work at other plants that have started to increase the volume, especially diesel.” According to the BBC, Kyiv has hit 21 of Russia’s 38 major oil refineries since January.

The Ukrainian president said that a key priority for Kyiv is building upon its long-range capabilities. While Ukraine completed 90 percent of deep strikes into Russia with its own long-range drones and cruise missiles, according to Zelenskyy, he said he still wants European allies to continue giving long-range missiles to help with the effort. In addition to its own weapons, Kyiv also uses U.K.-made Storm Shadow and French SCALP missiles.

Zelenskyy hopes that a combination of continued strikes on Russian refineries and pressure from U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies — as well as a potential European loan to Kyiv funded by Russian frozen assets — could force Russian leader VLADIMIR PUTIN to the negotiating table.

CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE: The Federal Communications Commission is taking more steps to prevent imports of high-risk communications technology, in particular targeting gear from China, our own John Hendel reports (for Pros!)

In a unanimous vote today, the FCC moved to close loopholes on imports of gear on the so-called covered list of tech considered to present national security risks to the U.S. Among the security concerns: fears that adversaries like China could use the equipment for espionage.

Today’s move addressed worries that some of the equipment on the list was still being used, since FCC rules didn’t bar use of previously authorized versions of the gear. Under the proposal, earlier models of equipment sold by Chinese companies like Huawei and Hikvision would join the list of barred import items.

The vote immediately garnered backlash from China’s Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. and Hikvision, who argued that the move “exceeds the scope” of the FCC’s authority.

The Complex

HOW MANY IS IT NOW? Another day, another set of boat strikes.

The U.S. military conducted three more strikes on four boats suspected of ferrying drugs in the Eastern Pacific on Monday, Secretary of Defense PETE HEGSETH announced in a post on social media today.

The strikes killed 14 people and left one survivor. According to Hegseth, Mexican search and rescue authorities took responsibility for coordinating the survivor’s rescue, roping another country into the U.S.’s widening military operation in the region. But the Mexican navy has yet to locate the individual, The Wall Street Journal reports.

During a news conference Tuesday, Mexican President CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM said she had requested a discussion on the strikes between the Mexican navy, foreign ministers and the U.S. ambassador in Mexico City as part of a new security initiative between the two countries, the Journal reports.

As in previous attacks, Hegseth claimed that the individuals aboard the ships were “narco-terrorists,” but did not provide evidence for those allegations.

On the Hill

KUWAIT AMB. NOMINEE TANKING: It’s been a bad few days for Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Kuwait.

AMER GHALIB, the mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, is facing bipartisan opposition over his history of allegedly antisemitic remarks. At least three Senate Foreign Relations Republicans plan to vote “no” on Ghalib, our own Benjamin Guggenheim reports today, all but assuring that his nomination won’t succeed inside the panel — or on the chamber floor.

If three Republicans join all Democrats to vote “no,” then Vice President JD VANCE would have to cast a tie-breaking vote. Sen. JOHN CURTIS (R-Utah), Sen. TED CRUZ (R-Texas) and Sen. JOHN CORNYN (R-Texas) all said they’d vote against Ghalib. A potential fourth lawmaker, Sen. PETE RICKETTS (R-Neb.) indicated that he’s not committed to supporting Ghalib’s nomination either.

Ghalib was grilled during a hearing last week over comments he’d previously made suggesting that Israel deserved to be attacked by Hamas and for lauding the Muslim Brotherhood and SADDAM HUSSEIN. The Michigan mayor made waves last year for his endorsement of Trump, as a Muslim mayor alongside an all-Muslim city council in the small Midwestern city.

Broadsides

WE’RE WATCHING YOU: Major importers of Russian oil are railing against the Trump administration’s new sanctions, but Sen. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.) is warning that the U.S. won’t put up with plans to undermine its sanctions efforts.

“To Hungary, Turkey and Slovakia: if you think we’re not watching your efforts to undercut U.S. sanctions on Russian oil, you are mistaken,” the Russia hawk cautioned in a social media post today, adding that purchasing Russian oil “is funding terrorism, death and destruction.”

Hungarian Prime Minister VIKTOR ORBAN said last week that the country was working on ways to “circumvent” U.S. sanctions on Russian oil. Hungary, along with Turkey and Slovakia, remain largely reliant on Russian oil, while other European countries have made efforts to shift away from those imports since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

This is the first known deportation under the Government’s recently expanded Nauru regime – a secretive and multi-billion-dollar arrangement that allows people to be banished offshore.

Earlier today it was reported that Nauru’s President, David Adeang, told the Nauruan Parliament last Friday that the first person had arrived under the new offshore detention deal. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, which supports people seeking asylum held on Nauru, had heard reports of an arrival but has been unable to confirm or make contact with the individual. The organisation holds serious concerns for the person’s wellbeing, safety and current whereabouts.

The Albanese Government made a secret deal with Nauru for the transfer of migrants and refugees in the so-called NZYQ cohort. The deal was signed alongside new laws allowing deportations to occur without any consideration of the consequences people would face, such as whether a person might die without proper medical care, be permanently separated from their families, or face persecution in Nauru.

It was revealed in estimates it could cost up to $7 billion, and there are serious concerns about corruption risks tied to past offshore detention contracts, including payments to companies linked to criminal organisations.

The organisations are calling on the Albanese Government to immediately halt deportations to Nauru, end offshore detention once and for all, and uphold equal treatment under our laws. Australians voted against fear and division at the last election, and they will not accept the return of cruel, secretive policies that punish people for seeking safety.

Jana Favero, Deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said:

“This kind of ICE-like behaviour ripping people from our community is not in line with what our community expects from our government. This is a scary, shocking precedent, and it is not what people voted for in the recent Federal election.

Deportations are life-changing – we all know people who weren’t born here, who we consider as part of our community. It’s another blatant example of politicians trying to distract us from the real issues and demonising migrants – and they are spending billions of dollars in secrecy to do it.”

Laura John, Associate Legal Director at the Human Rights Law Centre said:

“The Albanese Government has today demonstrated it is willing to completely disregard the basic rights of migrants and refugees, and ignore serious questions about the lawfulness and safety of its deportation deal, by condemning the first person to exile in Nauru. The government’s mass deportation plans have been shrouded in secrecy from the outset to ensure that it does not have to grapple with the real, human consequences of its actions.

“Some people facing deportation to Nauru have lived in Australia for most of their lives, others are stateless with no other home, and some have serious health conditions meaning they will likely die in Nauru. They should not be subjected to lifelong suffering. Our rights should be the same, regardless of visa status.”

Sarah Dale, RACS Centre Director & Principal Solicitor said:

“There have been many dark days in our immigration history: 24 August 2001, 19 July 2013 and now we add 24 October 2025 to that list. It is a day when our country chose exile over basic principles of humanity. This should shake to the core anyone who cares about the rights of refugees in our community.

We do not seek to deny the complexity of the situation for many of the people in this cohort. However, exile, family separation, significant ill-health and possible return to a fate of torture or death – none of these should be an acceptable outcome for any human being. It’s yet another dire chapter added to the horror story of Australia’s deplorable Offshore Detention policy.”

Paul Power, CEO of the Refugee Council of Australia said:

“The people being sent to Nauru are being sentenced to a lifetime of exile.

CONCORD—Immigrants’ rights activists from several New Hampshire cities and towns on Tuesday announced the formation of Sanctuary Communities, a grassroots project to oppose “police state tactics” employed by federal immigration enforcement agencies.

At a news conference held at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church across the street from the State House in Concord, the group said that while it is now illegal for municipalities to refuse cooperation with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), the law cannot prevent Americans from exercising their Constitutional rights to protest, publicize, and lawfully resist the agency’s actions.

“We’re here as people of faith, people of conscience, people of conviction and compassion, who are doing what people have done for millennia: organize to protect community members who are facing persecution, organize to insist on a better world, to insist that our values of love and care and dignity are reflected in how we treat each other, creating circles of support and accompaniment and resources, attempting to match the courage and the leadership of immigrants in this community who are targeted by so much racism and xenophobia and dehumanization,” said Maggie Fogarty, a member of the Seacoast Interfaith Sanctuary Coalition, one of eight New Hampshire groups calling themselves “Sanctuary Communities.”

“We are people from many walks of life and probably a variety of political persuasions,” said Philip Kaifer, representing the Manchester and Merrimack Region Sanctuary Community. “But our common concern is the fear we have because federal police are interfering with life as we know it,” he continued. “Our Granite State motto is ’Live Free or Die,’ but we no longer feel so free when we see secret agents—often masked and with no ID —whisking people off our streets and even disappearing them.”

“We are witnessing news headlines that read like something out of Nazi Germany,” said Bob Baker, a former Air Force Intelligence officer who lives in Columbia, near the Canadian border. “We cannot sit by while lawlessness and indecency are being visited upon us by masked agents sent into our communities from Washington.”

“Let’s talk about due process,” Baker, a retired lawyer, said later in the news conference. “Every single human being in this country, all they have to be is on the soil, is entitled to due process. That means, in simplest terms, the right to know what the charges are against you when you’re arrested. That’s not happening.” When people don’t even know what they’re being charged with, they can’t defend themselves, he said. “Just think about that. That’s wrong,” Baker said.

The Sanctuary Communities groups drew critical responses from Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte before their news conference had ended, and in press releases from other Republicans later on Tuesday.

In a statement headlined, “New Hampshire is NOT a Sanctuary for Criminals,” Ayotte said, “Threats to law enforcement or efforts to obstruct them will not be tolerated in New Hampshire. We are not a sanctuary for criminals who have come into this country illegally, and the law I signed earlier this year reinforces that. If you disrupt law enforcement activity, you will be prosecuted.”

The Sanctuary Communities project was born several months ago in New Hampshire’s North Country, where J. Larry Brown and Judi Garfinkel, residents of Lancaster, circulated a concept paper stating, “Any community—groups of concerned people from nearby towns, churches and institutions—can informally come together and declare themselves a Sanctuary Community, ready to provide assistance to people whose lives and well-being are threatened by federal security forces. Individual Sanctuary Communities can simply announce themselves publicly and organize to take steps they choose.” The idea was to spark a grassroots upsurge of groups openly objecting to ICE abuses and providing support for those harmed by them.

“History is clear,” they wrote, “that the only way to thwart growing authoritarian rule is for common people to speak out and resist. The courts alone cannot do it. The media alone cannot do it. Masses of American citizens rising up to oppose heavy-handed tactics is the way to salvage our democracy and to highlight the rule of law.”

From there, Brown and Garfinkel created a website to promote the concept and encourage activist groups to sign up. At this point, New Hampshire has eight self-designated Sanctuary Communities: North Country, Mt. Washington Valley and Lakes Region, Concord and Capitol Region, Manchester and Merrimack Region, Monadnock, Plymouth Area, Seacoast, and Sunapee/Upper Valley.

The Sanctuary Communities concept received a boost in August when former Labor Secretary Robert Reich promoted it on his Substack newsletter, calling it “an important way to fight Trump fascism.”

Brown said they have received hundreds of inquiries from other states, but at this point, only groups in New Hampshire are listed on their website. “The nice thing about this is that we’re not asking people to join our parade. We’re simply saying, create Sanctuary Communities, but do them in your own way,” Brown said. According to the website, “The Sanctuary Community movement is not an organization and has no leader. It is an idea around which people can organize themselves, creating groups from towns and communities in an area that the participants define.”

The Monadnock Immigrant Solidarity Collaborative defines itself as “a network of people in the southwest corner of New Hampshire, some of us immigrants, some of us allies, who support our immigrant neighbors. We believe immigrants enrich and strengthen our communities through their hard work, wisdom and culture. Our communities are welcoming places and we intend to keep them that way.”?

Any group can declare itself a sanctuary community, the website says, by “organizing a group of 6-10 people from different cities and towns in your area.” Next, a new group should write a statement of purpose, give themselves a name, decide what actions they will take, publicize their existence, and hold meetings to plan and evaluate its actions. “Each Sanctuary Community across the nation can operate on its own but in conjunction with sister Communities as national momentum and news coverage builds.”

New Hampshire Sanctuary Communities represented at the press conference say they will engage in activities such as monitoring and videotaping ICE raids; providing witness information to state and national media and local law enforcement; informing houses of worship, veterans groups, health facilities and schools about heavy-handed ICE actions; and writing letters and placing ads to oppose police-state tactics that threaten legal immigrants, neighbors and fellow citizens.

Megan Chapman, a human rights lawyer from Albany, New Hampshire, who is part of the Mount Washington Valley and Lakes Region group, called for a pushback against “efforts to lay the infrastructure for the authoritarian state and terror regime on our own soil.”

“At the beginning of 2025, there was just one ICE detention center in New Hampshire, at the Strafford County Jail,” she said. “In March, the federal prison in Berlin became the second. Now ICE is trying to negotiate with three more counties in our state to use their jails to incarcerate our neighbors. We must push back in Rockingham, Merrimack and Hillsborough County, and any/everywhere else.”

Chapman cited the example of Wells, Maine, where the town has just revoked a 287-G cooperation agreement with ICE, as an example for New Hampshire jurisdictions to follow.

The group cautions against engaging in any illegal activity, such as physically interfering with ICE operations, but says videotaping ICE agents is lawful. “It is anticipated that as the number of Sanctuary Communities grows across the nation, the Administration will threaten and intimidate us. It’s a sign of success, don’t let that stop us,” they say.

State Senator Bill Gannon and Representative Joe Sweeney, both Republicans, released statements as well. “Across New Hampshire, local police departments are working closely with federal officials to enforce the law and keep Granite Staters safe. We have seen the consequences of Democrats’ continual support for open border policies, and we will never have Sanctuary Cities in New Hampshire,” said Gannon, who was the prime sponsor of a bill outlawing “Sanctuary Cities.”

“The ban on Sanctuary Cities is the law of the land,” said House Deputy Majority Leader Sweeney. “We will not allow activists to skirt the law to create open-border policies in New Hampshire.”

The Sanctuary Community groups are well aware of the law. Noting in a Q&A handout distributed at the news conference that Ayotte had recently signed a “Sanctuary Cities” prohibition, the group said, “The Governor’s action pertains to municipalities like cities, towns and counties but it does not pertain to individual citizens. We have a First Amendment right to speak and to organize Sanctuary Communities. We do not work for the Governor.”

In response to the governor’s news release, Megan Chapman said it is ICE that is violating the law and the Constitution. “We do want to be a sanctuary in which people’s rights are upheld and the Constitution is upheld, and that’s what we’re standing for.”

“There’s nothing that we talked about today that is in violation of any New Hampshire or federal law,” Chapman added. “In fact, what we’re trying to do is uphold the Constitution, uphold its guarantees, uphold the rights that are afforded to the people, and make sure that those are protected against a lot of policies and practices that are happening now in violation of those rights.”

“For many of us, this is about answering to a higher law, a law that that calls us to care for the vulnerable, to push back against state sponsored violence and persecution,” Maggie Fogarty commented.

“We’re going step by step,” Larry Brown said as the news conference closed. “This is what citizen movements are about. They grow and they take turns here and there. We don’t know where this is going.”

Success is by no means assured, Brown said. “This is truly the David and Goliath moment in our history. But let us all get organized. Let us work together and see what we can do.”",https://indepthnh.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bob-Baker-speaking-at-Sanctuary-Communities-news-conference-1170x780.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 21:57:17.186494

The facility quickly drew immense criticism for its inhumane conditions and treatment of detainees.

Though Alligator Alcatraz is currently shut down due to environmental and moral concerns, the Trump administration’s use of it as a model for expanding detention capacity across the country is extremely concerning. Reports described the center as having contaminated food, floors flooded with sewage water and overcrowded cells resembling cages, according to AP News.

This precedent reflects a disregard for human rights and normalizes mistreatment under the guise of immigration control. The situation highlights a distinct lack of empathy from Trump’s administration and other officials, as they easily cross other humans’ boundaries in this facility.

Additionally, detainees were denied the opportunity to speak to lawyers, family or friends, according to NBC News. They were effectively denied one of America’s most fundamental rights: access to a fair justice system.

The detention center is oppressive toward immigrants who deserve equal and just treatment. Even the most basic standards of human decency are ignored, as if immigrants deserve fewer rights than any other citizen does. Everyone, including immigrants, should reserve the ability to possess human rights, no matter their origin.

In the midst of it all, the government’s reaction toward public criticism is offensive. Its complete disregard for the public’s opinions shows a disinterest toward serving the people of America, which should be one of their top priorities.

Trump’s unprofessionalism was shown clearly as he joked that detainees would have to “learn how to run from alligators,” according to CNN. Instead of understanding the cruel conditions they forced the detainees of Alligator Alcatraz into, the administration ridiculed them.

To prevent more unjust facilities from being built, Americans must stand up and hold government leaders accountable, demanding humane treatment for all people, regardless of their immigrant status. The same goes for officials, whose silence makes them complicit in the moral wrongdoings of Trump’s administration.

Similarly, the government must take responsibility and shut down existing facilities with inhumane conditions. It has a duty to ensure that detention centers, or any other facility, meet basic human rights.

And in a nation that prides itself on being a country of immigrants, forcing people to suffer because of their background is deceitful. These centers take away dignity, separate families and reduce people to less than human.

Americans can not claim to value the right to freedom while tolerating this kind of abuse. Ending these facilities is not just about policy, but about deciding what kind of country we want to be.",https://hhsepitaph.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/alligatoralcatrazillustration.png,N,,2025-10-28 22:21:08.297040

“Our interfaith leaders who are present here today are doing just that, and they’ve been doing that.","What's at stake:

Advocates and interfaith leaders gathered outside the Fresno ICE Processing Center to denounce racial profiling and detentions of immigrants attending required appointments with no criminal record.

On Tuesday morning, around 40 community members and faith leaders gathered outside the Fresno U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Processing Center for public prayer and “moral witness” as local detentions continue to rise.

Faith in the Valley, along with clergy from Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, Indigenous, and other traditions, also held a parallel interfaith vigil outside the Stockton ICE Processing Center simultaneously with the Fresno rally.

Some local interfaith leaders emphasized the challenges faced by immigrants and Indigenous communities in Fresno and the broader Central Valley, describing these struggles as “permanently intertwined and interlinked.”

“We have to stand up against ICE and its unjust and inhumane treatment of our immigrant sisters and brothers,” Hajj Reza Nekumanesh, executive director of the Islamic Cultural Center of Fresno said. “And we have to stand up against the genocide of all indigenous peoples, and in particularly of the Palestinians, because all of these struggles, sisters and brothers, and all of our victories, are permanently intertwined and interlinked with one another.”

Faith leaders spoke out against ICE raids in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and numerous other communities, highlighting repeated violations of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The leaders condemned these detentions as civil rights violations, which affect both U.S. citizens and undocumented workers. They also raised concerns about racial-profiling, violent arrests, prolonged detentions without access to legal counsel, and deportations to third-party countries, such as South Sudan, where people face indefinite imprisonment, torture, and even death.

Fresnoland has previously reported that immigrants attending required appointments at the Fresno U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office, are being detained during or after their visits — despite having no criminal records and maintaining current paperwork.

Fresnoland also reported that immigrants attending required appointments related to their permanent residence status at the Fresno U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office were detained during or after their visits—despite having no criminal records and maintaining current paperwork.

Earlier, in June, two undocumented immigrants were taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents during an ICE-led operation outside Fresno’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) office, reflecting a practice seen in several states.

ICE arrests in California’s Central Valley have increased by 58% during the first seven months of President Donald Trump’s administration compared to the same period the previous year, according to The Fresno Bee.

At the vigil Tuesday, advocates raised concerns about California’s newest and largest detention center, a 2,560-bed facility that opened in late August in California City’s Antelope Valley. They cited reports of poor conditions, alleged mistreatment by staff, and the fact that CoreCivic has not yet received approval for its operating permits.

‘Racialized targeting’

Nekumanesh called on interfaith clergy to uphold “consistency, consistency, consistency” in defending immigrant rights, fighting police brutality, addressing the genocide in Palestine, and standing against other instances where human rights are being denied.

Other faith leaders, including Rev. Akiko Miyake-Stoner of the United Japanese Christian Church, drew on their personal histories to highlight the parallels between current immigration detentions in Fresno and the city’s past.

She noted that the Fresno Fairgrounds served as a temporary detention facility, the Fresno Assembly Center, from May to October 1942, where over 5,000 Japanese Americans, many from Central California, were held during World War II, describing the similarity as “eerily familiar.”

“One doesn’t have to look hard to see the parallels with today’s ICE raids done with such brutality and without due process,” Miyake-Stoner. “Both rely on racialized targeting that singles people out by appearance, language or national origin rather than individual guilt. Both depend on sweeping executive and bureaucratic power that suspends ordinary protections and normalizes detention. Both leave families separated, lives disrupted and communities carrying intergenerational trauma.”

Rev. Madeleine Guekguezian of the United Methodist Church of Merced, an Armenian Armenian American and descendant Armenian Genocide survivors, reflected on U.S. immigration policy, emphasizing that enforcement has often targeted people based on race rather than legal status.

She highlighted how undocumented immigrants are subjected to inhumane detention and removal from their communities, framing those who look different from the white-skinned Anglo majority in the U.S. as threats rather than as fellow human beings.

“The Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin II had once said, ‘justice is a gift from God, lack of justice is a sin against God.’ I carry that with me,” Guekguezian said. “For those standing in line for ICE processing, for check ins, my prayer is that justice and relief comes to you as soon as it may be through the action of the people and the repentance of our leaders, but it will not be soon enough.”

How to build a first line of defense

Nora Zaragoza-Yáñez, Faith in the Valley’s Watch Network program manager, said she struggles to speak to people who think it’s acceptable for families to be torn apart and denied due process. She emphasized that caring for neighbors should be a basic value learned from childhood.

“They’re dragging people out of their homes, out of their cars and out from public spaces in front of their families because of where they were born, not because of whatever crap they made up or discovered after,” Zaragoza-Yáñez said. “Where’s the due process? No, really, where is the due process? This isn’t acceptable.”

Zaragoza-Yáñez explained that the Watch Network empowers the community by educating people about their rights, accompanying them to check-ins or court appearances, and preparing families for potential incidents. She described the program as the community’s first line of defense, operating across eight Central Valley counties to respond to the tactics used by ICE.

“We keep our community safe by adding our little grain of sand into the bigger picture,” Zaragoza-Yáñez said. “Our interfaith leaders who are present here today are doing just that, and they’ve been doing that. They have bared witness to the atrocities that are being committed against our communities, they’re standing strong against any dehumanization of them, and their efforts are the embodiment of what it means to accompany someone to bear witness to what’s happening.”

That sense of shared responsibility also resonated with local community members in attendance. Jackie Pierson shared with Fresnoland that, as a white person whose “Christian faith is tied to the most marginalized,” she strives to leverage her privilege by volunteering with watch networks and by listening to and walking alongside her neighbors.

While attending the No Kings protests, Sylvia Valdez, a community member invited by an interfaith leader from On Ramps Covenant Church, told Fresnoland that the narrative seems to be shifting, with more white people showing up in solidarity with the communities most directly affected by the actions of Trump’s administration.

Valdez said she wasn’t sure what to expect from the morning’s vigil but ultimately felt “unity, peace, and God doing something powerful” through the gathering.

“I was able to look inward and grieve what’s happening,” Valdez said. “I thought about the needs of the people.”",https://fresnoland.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1347-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 19:01:42.515663

""Me and my dad had nothing to hide,"" the Houston teenager said at a news conference Monday. ""We were confused, so we just pulled over in a parking lot.""

According to Arnoldo, the two cars then blocked them in, and masked law enforcement officers — whom he claimed did not have identifying badges on their vests — began hitting the windows. Arnoldo said he and his father were scared, so his father decided to drive away.

""That's when me and my dad went [into] fight or flight,"" he said. ""He was trying to protect me. That's what he told me — ‘I'm going to protect you.’ ''

The unmarked cars then followed Arnoldo and his father down Boone Street in Southwest Houston to the Restaurant Depot on Bissonnet Street, where the two got out of the car, according to Arnoldo.

""I ran with my dad, but then they tackled him,"" he said. ""Three of them jumped on him, but when I saw they started choking, kicking, punching, it's when I reacted. I just ran to my dad, and a lady, she grabbed my shirt.""

The Montgomery County Processing Center, which is used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told Houston Public Media that Arnulfo Bazan was deported to Mexico on Monday — the same day his son recounted their experience during a news conference organized by FIEL Houston, an immigrant rights nonprofit. The organization reported that Arnulfo was taken to the processing center north of Houston after the Oct. 23 encounter at Restaurant Depot, while Arnoldo said he was returned home after he told the officers he was a minor and U.S. citizen.

The detention center did not provide further details regarding Arnulfo's immigration status or why he was deported. A Houston-based ICE spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the deportation or the Oct. 23 incident involving Arnulfo and his son.

FIEL Houston Executive Director Cesar Espinosa said he fears “more incidents like this can unfold” as federal immigration enforcement ramps up under the administration of President Donald Trump.

“In our beautiful diverse city, we are so worried for our communities and all the families that will be separated and hurt by this administration,” Espinosa said in a statement.

Arnoldo alleged that the officers who confronted him and his father choked him and took his cell phone. He said he believes his phone was taken because he had used it to film the encounter.

""Then that's when they tackled me and even though I said I was underage, the dude started choking me more,"" Arnoldo said.

A separate video shared online by FIEL appears to show Arnoldo and his father being detained in the entrance of the Restaurant Depot. While Arnoldo said he didn't see any identifying markings on the officers' uniforms, the video shows five officers, four of whom had ""police"" patches on their vests and one who had a “DEA” patch on the back of their vest.

In the video, the person filming the incident can be heard saying, ""You're fixing to break his neck"" while pointing the camera at two officers trying to restrain a young man who appears to be Arnoldo.

“They cover their faces and they don’t act like regular law enforcement or other federal agents,” Manny said.","Angelica Vargas was driving to get coffee near her home in Downey, California, when she saw a disturbing, yet now-familiar sight: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents running down the street, arresting a man who was painting a gas station. Immediately, Vargas moved to action: She pulled over and confronted the officers, using the firm, calm tone she’s learned is effective in situations like these.

“Of course, they got a little bit defensive. But then I started recording for evidence. And I reminded the guy he had rights. I kind of gave the officers a rough time,” Vargas said in a phone interview. Her initial plan was only to assist the detainee and document the officers. But then, seemingly in retaliation, some ICE vehicles remained behind to “box in” Vargas’s car, preventing her from leaving.

“That pissed me off. I mean, they weren’t gonna be there forever, boxing me in,” Vargas recalled. “So when they took off, I said, Let’s go. I have a really fast car. So I gave them a run for their money that day.”

For Vargas, a Mercedes-driving self-described “soccer mom,” that was the start of a new extracurricular: chasing ICE vehicles on the road, and posting the videos on TikTok. Now Vargas is known to her hundreds of thousands of followers—and the tens of millions of people who have watched her content—for her videos with cheeky titles like “Spending Quality Time With ICE.” Posted in time-lapse speed to jaunty Mexican music, Vargas’s videos show ICE vehicles weaving lanes, and in some cases making multiple or illegal U-turns, to avoid her. In one video, Vargas cuts across what appears to be a gas station parking lot to speed up her pursuit.

“I love you taking shortcuts to get back to them that they don’t know about. Guess who’s actually from there,” one user commented. Indeed, the overall effect, as commenters have noted, is like Grand Theft Auto: exhilarating, even heroic.

ICE raids have skyrocketed under the Trump administration, striking fear in immigrant communities. Fueled by a $75 billion funding increase this year, arrests surged in the Los Angeles area, where Vargas lives. Over 2,000 immigrants without criminal records were arrested this summer, the majority from Mexico and Guatemala. Other areas have been hit hard more recently; in Chicago and its suburbs, for instance, federal agents have used tear gas and smashed car windows while carrying out raids.

Raids are designed to inspire fear, with agents frequently wearing masks, seizing students off the streets, and even incorporating theatrical, militarized elements like agents on horseback. “The Trump administration’s goal is to make life as unnavigable, unstable and uncomfortable as possible” for undocumented immigrants, CalMatters reported in August. The effects in the LA area have been palpable. Bus ridership decreased in LA over the summer, and Cal State Los Angeles, which serves working-class communities, allowed students to take classes online for fear of immigration enforcement.

In these conditions of terror, Vargas’s decision to turn the fear back on ICE offers much-needed catharsis for her viewers. “You had them stressing 😂,” commented one user on a June video. “ICE works hard but Angie works harder 😭,” said another. “Do you think they sit around campfires and tell horror stories about you?” another joked.

Vargas’s favorite responses, she said, come from older generations. “There was a girl who reached out to me and told me that her dad was an illegal immigrant, and before his passing, he loved my TikTok page,” she said. “It brightened up his day.”

Vargas did not intend to become a public vigilante. She works by day as a mental health professional and dedicates much of her free time to raising her two daughters, student athletes aged 15 and 16. But times are too dire to stay home, she said. Before the ICE raids, she said, “people were able to do their daily lives, go to Home Depots without having the fear of being detained, or even showing up to their jobs without the fear of being raided by immigration agents. A lot has shifted. We are definitely living under terror.”

Vargas first discovered her superpower—her ability to stand up to ICE—in June, when she got a distressing call from her mother: Vargas’s sister, a US citizen, had gotten stuck at a “super chaotic” ICE raid at a Home Depot in Downey. “There was tear-gassing, fire bombs, a bunch of stuff that, you know, it’s just not normal. On a Saturday morning,” Vargas recalled. “My mom was scared, and I took initiative. I said, ‘Mom, I’m going to go get her.’”

Although ICE had blocked off the parking lot and wasn’t allowing anybody to leave, Vargas drove up to the Home Depot. She managed to push through the barriers and convince the ICE agents to allow her sister to drive out in her truck. “Mind you, she was one of the only people that was allowed to leave. I convinced the federal agents, right? So I’d seen what I could do,” Vargas said. “It really made me see how privileged I am to be a US citizen. Everybody’s told me, like, you carry this confidence in you, even officers respect you. So I’m gonna use that to my advantage and for the community.”

Vargas thinks she is able to get through to ICE agents because she is a US citizen and speaks fluent English. She’s strengthened her communication tactics—she tries to keep it “smart and professional,” having noticed that federal agents don’t respond well to cursing or aggressive questioning. Vargas, a former psych major, also tries to use “reverse psychology tactics” against the agents, trying to “relate to them, get on their level.”

“I feel like a lot of people stay indoors and just watch through a phone,” she said, “when they have the legal status to go out there and make a difference.”

Emboldened by her success at Home Depot, Vargas started keeping track of ICE raids in her community. She uses civilian-run Instagram and TikTok accounts that report ICE raids in the hopes of mobilizing responders. Manny, the 29-year-old community college student behind the Instagram account @LAHoodLove, is one such source.

On a given day, @LAHoodLove blasts a series of potential ICE sightings, often naming streets and posting grainy photos.

Manny, who is also an ICE chaser, was already active in organizing fundraisers for street vendors and leading peaceful protests, including at the Downey Home Depot, which is often hit by raids. Manny said ICE chasers stepped up their tactics because ICE doesn’t play by normal rules. “They cover their faces and they don’t act like regular law enforcement or other federal agents,” Manny said. “I call them kidnappers, because they’re wearing masks. No plates, no badge number. They’re just grabbing, pulling out guns. This is worse than cartel. They take you, and you disappear.”

Vargas and Manny, like many organizers, took advantage of the fact that ICE, at least in the early months of the Trump administration, was disorganized. Manny’s first time chasing ICE was in February. He said he sensed that the agents were nervous. “I already had an idea that ICE was going to hire contractors. So I just figured, OK, they haven’t done this in a while, so it’s gonna be a little off,” Manny said. “So once I approached them, they were shook because I was recording them. I had my phone right in their faces, and I was like, who are you guys? Where you work?”

The agents, Manny said, claimed to be probation officers, but the effect on the people they were detaining was confusion and terror. Indeed, ICE’s practice of wearing masks during raids earned swift public pushback and is facing legal and policy challenges.

Vargas said ICE is getting more effective now—but so too is resistance. “They’re scared to be ambushed by civilians, especially now, since we’re all well connected,” Vargas said.

Social media, Vargas said, has been a “huge blessing” for community members to coordinate their response, whether that is ICE chasing, documenting raids, or informing detainees of their rights. It also helps build morale. There are the viral videos of mass confrontations with ICE and the Border Patrol, from LA to Portland to Chicago. But there are also people standing up on a smaller scale. Social media is filled with choppy videos filmed by bystanders bearing witness to raids.

In July, the Los Angeles Times compiled a list of social media videos that showcase civilians intervening in local ICE arrests. From cars honking in warning as Border Patrol trucks enter a parking lot, to a woman screaming, “What’s wrong with you?” at agents arresting a taco vendor, to a woman commenting, “Bitches,” as she records agents making arrests at a Home Depot, social media bears witness to a tapestry of quiet and overt resistance.

Nonetheless, ICE chasing carries significant risks. Manny said that “unfortunately” he has never consulted with a lawyer or gotten legal protection for his ICE chasing; he works alone because he doesn’t want to endanger a passenger if he is detained. Just in case, he switched cars. Vargas, too, said she chases alone: “Nobody knew where I was. Only, like, my best friends had my location.” While she isn’t afraid of detention by ICE since she’s a US citizen, she did initially fear being pulled over by police.

Now that she’s often busy responding to ICE sightings, Vargas’s mother steps in to help take care of her daughters. “They are my number-one supporters,” Vargas said of her family; while she doesn’t bring her daughters on ICE chases for safety reasons, they help charge her phones, batteries, and media equipment, and accompany her to “friendlier, family-oriented protests.” Meanwhile, Vargas’s social media followers sought ways to help. Responding to comments offering to pay for her gas, Vargas set up a GoFundMe page, “Support Angie in Protecting Our Latin Community,” that has raised over $122,000.

To her community, in-person and online, Vargas is a hero. She said she’s always been this kind of person—someone who stands up when things are difficult. This quality she attributes to her father, an ex-professional soccer player, who raised her with privilege in the suburbs but “never let [her] forget she is brown.” She also credited her organizing chops to managing her daughter’s soccer team. Beyond ICE chasing, she stays active in her community through mutual aid efforts and food distributions, and has contemplated running for office in the future.

“It definitely doesn’t come with a manual,” Vargas said of organizing against ICE. “Everything is going to be different. One day you can be helping a person with groceries. The next day, you can be chasing ICE and confronting federal agents.”

These days ICE comes to Downey less often, hopefully a result of ICE-chasing efforts, Vargas said. “I’m not getting as much ICE leads around my city, which is a good thing. But now I have to commute longer in order to do what I was doing. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable because it’s not within my comfort zone, like, I don’t know the streets, what freeways I’m at. But I still make an effort to go out there and help out the community.”",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FotoJet-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 18:17:00.778459

Window-shopping for health plans delayed The window for enrolling in ACA health plans begins Saturday.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The pressure to end the second-longest federal government shutdown is gaining new urgency this week as millions of Americans face the prospect of losing food assistance, more federal workers miss their first full paycheck and recurring delays at airports snarl travel plans.

The building strain on lawmakers to end the impasse was magnified by the nation’s largest federal employee union, which called on Congress to immediately pass a funding bill and ensure workers receive full pay. Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said the two political parties have made their point.

“It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship,” said Kelley, whose union carries considerable political weight with Democratic lawmakers.

Still, Democratic senators, including those representing states with many federal workers, did not appear ready to back down. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said he was insisting on commitments from the White House to prevent the administration from mass firing more workers. Democrats also want Congress to extend subsidies for health plans under the Affordable Care Act.

“We’ve got to get a deal with Donald Trump,” Kaine said.

But shutdowns grow more painful the longer they go. Soon, with closures lasting a fourth full week as of Tuesday, millions of Americans are likely to experience the difficulties firsthand.

“This week, more than any other week, the consequences become impossible to ignore,” said Rep. Lisa McClain, chair of the House Republican Conference.

Shutdown’s impact is set to grow dramatically

The nation’s 1.3 million active-duty service members are at risk of missing a paycheck on Friday. Earlier this month, the Trump administration ensured they were paid by shifting $8 billion from military research and development funds to make payroll. But it is unclear if the Trump administration is willing — or able — to shift money again.

Larger still, the Trump administration says funding will run out Friday for the food assistance program that is relied upon by 42 million Americans to supplement their grocery bills. The administration has rejected the use of more than $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits flowing into November. And it says states won’t be reimbursed if they temporarily cover the cost of benefits next month.

WATCH: ‘I don’t see the path for’ Trump 2028 presidential bid, Johnson says

The Department of Agriculture says the contingency fund is intended to help respond to emergencies such as natural disasters. Democrats say the decision concerning the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, goes against the department’s previous guidance concerning its operations during a shutdown.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the administration made an intentional choice not to the fund SNAP in November, calling it an “act of cruelty.”

Will lawmakers find a solution?

At the Capitol, congressional leaders mostly highlighted the challenges many Americans are facing as a result of the shutdown. But there was no movement toward negotiations as they attempted to lay blame on the other side of the political aisle.

“Now government workers and every other American affected by this shutdown have become nothing more than pawns in the Democrats’ political games,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

The House passed a short-term continuing resolution on Sept. 19 to keep federal agencies funded. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of legislative session ever since, saying the solution is for Democrats to simply accept that bill.

But the Senate has consistently fallen short of the 60 votes needed to advance that spending measure. Democrats insist that any bill to fund the government also address health care costs, namely the soaring health insurance premiums that millions of Americans will face next year under plans offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Window-shopping for health plans delayed

The window for enrolling in ACA health plans begins Saturday. In past years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has allowed Americans to preview their health coverage options about a week before open enrollment.

As of Monday, Healthcare.gov appeared to show 2025 health insurance plans and estimated prices, instead of next year’s options. CMS was expected to temporarily bring back all its workers furloughed during the shutdown, in part to manage the ACA open enrollment period.

Twenty-eight senators, mostly Democrats, signed a letter urging Trump’s administration to let ACA enrollees start previewing next year’s health insurance options on its marketplace website.

Republicans insist they will not entertain negotiations on health care until the government reopens.

“I’m particularly worried about premiums going up for working families,” said Sen. David McCormick, R-Pa. “So we’re going to have that conversation, but we’re not going to have it until the government opens.”

Congressional leaders dig in deeper

Schumer said Republicans would prefer to shut the government down than work with Democrats in preventing massive spikes in their health insurance costs. He said the average American doesn’t want to pay an extra $20,000 a year to cover their health insurance.

“And we Democrats want to solve this crisis right away,” Schumer said. “So lowering health care is not a crazy demand.”

Vice President JD Vance planned to attend a Republican luncheon on Capitol Hill Tuesday. But with President Donald Trump traveling in Asia and congressional leaders dug into their positions, a quick deal appeared unlikely.

Meanwhile, some rank-and-file lawmakers urged colleagues to consider the impact of their standoff on the lives of federal employees and Capitol police officers who have not been paid for weeks.

“We have got to come together, which means we’ve got to talk to one another,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said in a floor speech urging leaders to stop focusing on who was winning the political fight. “Right now, those that are losing are the American people.”

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs.","WASHINGTON (CN) — Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had little to say Tuesday about reports that the Department of Homeland Security purged immigration enforcement chiefs in several U.S. cities as the Trump administration looks to supercharge its mass deportation campaign.

Both Republicans and Democrats were hesitant to weigh in on the staffing shake-up, which would see officials from U.S. Border Patrol replace the heads of Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, among other cities.

But at least one lawmaker speculated that the Homeland Security Department made the staffing changes to support what he called the White House’s “unrealistic” deportation quotas.

According to a report from the Washington Examiner, the agency last week removed five ICE field office chiefs and moved them to positions elsewhere in the country. In addition to reassigning the heads of immigration enforcement in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, the Homeland Security Department also removed ICE chiefs in Phoenix and San Diego.

The administration reportedly plans to replace most of the ousted immigration heads with senior staff from Border Patrol, though in Philadelphia, the vacant ICE role will be filled by an official from Homeland Security Investigations.

While the move to replace top ICE officials with Border Patrol — which has taken an aggressive approach to immigration enforcement under its chief, Gregory Bovino — is unprecedented, lawmakers largely claimed Tuesday that they didn’t have enough information to take a firm stance on the issue.

Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, a senior Republican member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, declined to comment to Courthouse News. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, another GOP lawmaker on the homeland security panel, said that he had seen reporting about the purges but that he didn’t “know enough” about the situation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed ignorance of the ICE leadership purge during a news conference Tuesday morning, telling Courthouse News that he had only just learned about the reports. He added that “some of these things get mis-portrayed.”

Democrats were similarly reticent to offer their thoughts. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy told Courthouse News that he had not yet been briefed and declined to offer any additional input.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a fellow Connecticut Democrat who also sits on the Homeland Security committee, posited that the staffing shake-up at ICE’s field offices was thanks to the immigration agency’s failure to meet the Trump administration’s “completely unrealistic” deportation quotas.

White House adviser Stephen Miller has long demanded that ICE arrest as many as 3,000 immigrants a day, or 1 million per year.

“This kind of executive action simply shows the moral bankruptcy of their policies,” said Blumenthal.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, did not directly respond to reports of the purge at ICE, saying instead that Americans were “understandably horrified” at the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.

“It’s our hope that, if there’s going to be a change in personnel, it’s actually to enact a more humane approach, rather than what we’ve seen in community after community in the country,” said Jeffries.

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs. The agency’s assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, told Courthouse News in a statement Tuesday that it had “no personnel changes to announce right now.”

“This is one team, one fight,” McLaughlin wrote. “President Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary [Kristi] Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

A spokesperson for the Border Patrol union did not return a request for comment.

News that Border Patrol officials may be taking over for ICE in several major cities comes as Bovino on Tuesday was dressed down by a federal judge over his failure to comply with a court order blocking federal agents from deploying tear gas and other riot control weapons against protesters, journalists and other bystanders in Chicago.

The judge demanded that Bovino, who has personally participated in the federal crackdown on the Windy City and has himself deployed tear gas on demonstrators, appear before her daily to report new incidents. Bovino admitted to the court that he did not use a body-worn camera and agreed to begin wearing one.

The Trump administration has in recent weeks sent federal agents and National Guard troops into several U.S. cities, including Chicago, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The White House has framed the move as an effort to crack down on crime and illegal immigration. Some federal courts have ruled that the president’s deployment of National Guard troops violates federal law.

According to recent statistics, more than 70% of people held by ICE have no prior criminal convictions.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/courthousenews.com/2025/10/immigration-ice-police-jacket.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-28 22:21:28.375460

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, said the administration had “no personnel changes to announce at this time,” but praised President Donald Trump and his team for “delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

It comes as Border Czar Tom Homan says he’s working with White House adviser Stephen Miller to increase the pace of deportations.

“We need to continue prioritizing public safety threats,” Homan told NewsNation. “Worst first but prioritization doesn’t mean everyone else is off the table. If you are here illegally, you ARE NOT off the table.”

Border Patrol has been carrying out the majority of the sweeping raids that generally lead to protests at the direction of Chief Gregory Bovino, who appeared in court Tuesday over allegations that he threw tear gas canisters during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.

Border Patrol agents also carry out targeted enforcement operations. By comparison, ICE officers generally stick to one target after they conduct research.

Earlier this month, Bovino told NewsNation that Border Patrol operations are “all legal, ethical and moral.”

Fox News reports that the change in staffing comes from competing factions within deportation enforcement, with Homan and ICE Director Todd Lyons squared off against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Bovino.

Sources believe that ICE’s current enforcement approach is not producing the number of arrests Trump wants, but Bovino’s broader methods appear to be what the administration is after.

“We are going to go throughout Chicago with reckless abandon — professionally, legally, ethically and morally — and arrest all illegal alien gang members that we can get our hands on,” Bovino told NewsNation.

Over months of conversations with NY1, former immigration judges recommended comparing how many judges had active Webex video channels now versus the beginning of Donald Trump’s presidency in January.

What You Need To Know

NY1 analysis shows a steep drop in immigration judges with active Webex channels since the beginning of the second Trump administration

Former judges told NY1 that no longer having a Webex link means the judge is on leave, took a buyout, retired or got fired

The Trump administration announced a plan to hire hundreds of temporary judges across the country

A former immigration judge in New York City, fired by the Trump administration, raised concerns about how prepared the temporary judges will be

They told NY1 the missing links had one of four potential outcomes: the judge could have taken a leave, taken a buyout, retired or been fired.

When NY1, using examined the government web pages from January 19, 2025 — the day before Donald Trump’s inauguration — compared to October 16, 2025, there were 15 judges whose names had disappeared over the course of the year.

One of those judges was Carmen Maria Rey Caldas, who had been a judge at 26 Federal Plaza until late this summer.

“It was an email,” she said from her Brooklyn apartment, describing how she found out her fate. “It was sent at 4:07 p.m.”

She said there was no reason given for her termination.

For the first time since 2015, according to data provided to NY1 by the U.S. Department of Justice, the number of immigration judges has dropped.

In that year, there were 254 immigration judges across the country per Department of Justice data, when the immigration case backlog was 456,216, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

However, in the decade since then, the backlog of cases has exploded to more than 3.4 million, as the number of judges reached a peak of 735.

In 2023, there was a federal report provided to Congress about the backlog of immigration cases and how hiring more immigration judges could impact that statistic.

At that point, the backlog of immigration cases nationwide was under 2 million. The number of immigration judges sat at 649, according to the report filed by the Congressional Research Service, which is a nonpartisan research agency that provides reports to Congress.

If 1,000 more judges had been hired at the time, that would have led to no backlog in about five years, according to the analysis done at the time. If no judges were hired, it would lead to a backlog of more than 3.1 million by 2033.

It took less than two years, rather than the predicted 10 years, to blow past that number nationally, however.

The backlog of cases means some respondents in immigration courts have hearings set for the next decade, according to immigration lawyers NY1 has interviewed in recent years.

On Jan. 19, there were 721 immigration judges across the country. Before a recent hiring announcement by the Department of Justice, at last count, it was at 575.

The remaining judges can face a culture of fear, according to Caldas.

“That is no way to run a court,” she said to NY1.

In the latest budget bill, Congress authorized the DOJ to have a total of as many as 800 immigration judges, and late this summer, the Trump administration announced a plan to hire up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary judges.

On Friday, the administration announced a new class of 36 immigration judges, about 70% of them temporary.

One permanent and one temporary hire will hear cases in New York City courtrooms starting this month.

This new class of judges will bring the total to more than 600 again, for the first time in a few months, according to the NY1 review of active Webex video channels.

Since the beginning of the administration, there has been a 15% drop in judges across the country, and in New York City, nearly mirroring the national average, has seen a 16% decrease, according to NY1’s analysis.

Those percentage drops include last week’s hiring announcement.

If the Trump administration fills all the temporary judicial positions, on top of the permanent ones currently on staff, it would represent the largest total number of judges nationwide.

The 600 potential temporary ones, however, will be reevaluated every six months, before a decision is made on whether to renew their position or not, according to the Department of Justice memo from this summer.

“I think they’re being set up to fail,” Caldas said in her interview about the temporary judges, which was done weeks before the new hires were announced.

She said immigration law can be complex, and judges are often ruling on cases at the moment, not having time to research decisions for weeks on cases where the stakes can be incredibly high.

“A wrong move can result in someone’s death. If you deport someone to a country where their life is in danger, that person could very well die,” she said.

A Department of Defense spokesperson told NY1 the agency “is identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as Temporary Immigration Judges.”

NY1 followed up by asking what qualities make a Department of Defense employee qualified versus unqualified.

“We don’t have anything additional to provide on this,” she said.

In a federal document outlining the new policy, the Department of Justice indicated it will look for “the most qualified individuals overall with primary weight given to an applicant’s education and employment history,” and that factors such as judicial, trial or immigration experience will matter.

The DOJ document said the temporary judges will receive the same “comprehensive, continuing training and support” as permanent judges.

But Caldas said she’s not sure if they will have the support team she had, including two clerks who helped with writing decisions and responding to motions.

When NY1 asked the Department of Justice spokeswoman about the plan to support temporary judges, she sent a document that she said included that information.

However, NY1’s review of the file led to nothing specific about staffing for the temporary judges.

More simply, Caldas has a question, at least at her former workplace, 26 Federal Plaza, if the government hires more judges than those who have left in recent months.

“Has anyone even looked at where these people are going to sit? There aren’t enough courtrooms,” she said. “We literally don’t have court space.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/_ERIC_PKG_JUDGES_DROPPING_CG,N,,2025-10-28 18:01:26.530296

WASHINGTON—The federal government has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review two appellate court decisions striking down President Trump’s executive order limiting constitutional birthright citizenship to children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Yesterday, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), in a brief joined by Landmark Legal Foundation, urged the Court to take up the cases.

In its brief, FAIR focuses on the true meaning of an historic Supreme Court case: United States v. Wong Kim Ark, decided in 1898. In that case, the Supreme Court held that, because—and only because—the parents of a man of Chinese ancestry were legally residing in the United States when he was born here, he was a U.S. citizen at birth under the Fourteenth Amendment.

In showing that the Court’s requirement of lawful permission to reside was part of its holding, FAIR sharply parts ways with the view taken by plaintiffs’ attorneys, activist courts, and many academic commentators that the Fourteenth Amendment makes anyone born in the United States whose parents are not diplomats or members of an invading army a citizen. On the contrary, the true reading of the Fourteenth Amendment, explicated in Wong Kim Ark, is that, to be a citizen at birth under the Fourteenth Amendment, one must be born in the United States to parents who, at the time, had permission to reside in the United States. This rule excludes the children of both illegal aliens and tourists from constitutional birthright citizenship, since neither class of aliens has permission to reside here.

Which interpretation is right is clearly an issue of such importance that the Court must resolve it. As the brief puts it:

This Court should grant certiorari to correct a glaring, widespread legal error, committed by both courts below, about the meaning of one of this Court’s central historical precedents. This Court should recognize that it remains bound by this precedent as properly understood, having no strong grounds to overturn it, and accordingly rule for petitioners.

“This holding has been sleeping in the law books, in a case largely mischaracterized in law schools and by academics, for 127 years,” said Christopher J. Hajec, deputy general counsel of FAIR. “Yet logic shows that it is there and still binding on the Supreme Court. We hope the Court interprets its prior case rightly, grants review, and upholds Trump’s executive order.”

Not anymore.

Nine months after the Trump administration dramatically stepped up immigration enforcement, many people from other countries are remaining at home for fear of being harassed, arrested or deported, possibly to a county they’ve never known. Instead of seeing their therapist at the clinic, a majority of Esperanza’s clients who speak Spanish are now opting for virtual sessions to avoid venturing outside.

But even at home they can’t function normally, said Ingrid Solares, clinical and health equity director for Adelante Mujeres, an Latino advocacy group that opened the clinic a year ago.

“People have a difficult time concentrating, making decisions, focusing, eating regularly, sleeping regularly,” Solares said.

The administration’s efforts to deport people and its racial profiling are starting to take a deep toll not only on many residents but also on those who serve them, advocates and providers told The Lund Report.

Providers at safety net clinics are bracing for potential raids as federal agents sit in unmarked cars with tinted windows in store parking lots and outside schools. Patients are still showing up for health appointments, but they’re reluctant to see unfamiliar specialists, with some even limiting treatment of severe conditions by their primary care provider.

State officials say they have not shared the personal information of undocumented immigrants with the Trump administration thanks to a pending legal action filed to block federal access. But immigrants who lack residency documents have become increasingly reluctant to sign up for state-paid health care benefits because they’re worried they might become a target — even though Oregon is one of several states offering such care.

The Healthier Oregon program provides free physical, mental and dental care benefits to low-income immigrants whose residency status excludes them from Medicaid, the federally backed health care program for low-income residents.

The number of people enrolled in the program had steadily grown, surpassing 100,000 in December and peaking at more than 107,000 in June, state enrollment figures show. Since then the number has dropped every month and currently stands at about 105,000.

By law, federal money is not supposed to be used for routine health care for undocumented immigrants. The state will cover $900 million to fund the program and use another $300 million in federal dollars to cover emergency and pregnancy care as required by the decades-old Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, EMTALA, according to the Oregon Health Authority.

After enrolling, many were reluctant to take advantage of the benefits and now they’re hesitant to even sign up.

“Even folks who might qualify, there's just a level of fear in signing up for any public benefit program,” said Jennifer Griffith, CEO of One Community Health, which runs clinics in Hood River and The Dalles in Oregon and in White Salmon and Stevenson in Washington.

Avoiding preventative care can lead to more serious conditions later on, requiring costly emergency room visits or worse.

If people don’t get care or if federal rules prevent safety net clinics from providing services, everyone will suffer, said Talbot Eckweiler, communications director for the Oregon Primary Care Association, which represents 34 safety net clinics in the state.

“That's going to cost the taxpayers more money, it's going to lead to worse health outcomes for that individual, and it just makes our populations less healthy, less able to function,” Eckweiler said.

Too soon to tell

Officials said it’s too early to gauge how much the crackdown might be affecting health services for undocumented immigrants. But anecdotally, health experts and advocacy groups say it’s definitely affecting people’s health.

“People are worried; providers are worried,” said Gil Muñoz, CEO of Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center, a safety net health system with six clinics in Washington and Yamhill counties.

“For a population that has a lot of trauma already this just adds another layer of stress,” he said.

Virginia Garcia serves 52,000 people. About 60% speak Spanish or another language as their primary tongue, and nearly as many are on Medicaid or qualify for Healthier Oregon. Muñoz has expected the federal activity to lead to many Spanish speakers canceling appointments, but he said that’s not happened so far.

“The demand is still very strong for the services,” Muñoz said. ”I’ve been impressed that people are still showing up despite concerns that there is more activity in the community.”

He suspects that the continued demand reflects trust in Virginia Garcia, which was established in 1975.

“We think people feel safe coming to Virginia Garcia,” Muñoz said. “But what we’ve heard anecdotally is that people may be more hesitant to go to referral visits.”

One Community Health, founded in 1986, serves over 28,000 patients, and about one-fifth who speak Spanish. Griffith, the CEO, said most patients are continuing to seek care.

“Part of that is we're a rural community,” Griffith said. “There are not a lot of options other than us, and we've been here for a long time. Community members trust us.”

But she said some immigrants on Medicaid or Healthier Oregon have asked whether they should give up the coverage to drop off the official radar.

“Our team so far has really been able to kind of talk folks out of it,” Griffith said.

But advocates, like those at the Oregon Latino Health Coalition, an advocacy group focused on reducing health care inequities, are having a tougher time these days persuading people to take advantage of Healthier Oregon. The nonprofit has three bilingual community health workers educating people in Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington counties about the program. After getting them signed up, they help people navigate the system.

In the past, they could get people signed up with a phone call or two, said Olivia Quiroz, the coalition’s CEO. Now, it takes longer.

“People are hesitant,” Quiroz said. “They want to know more information.” They have a lot of questions.”

Advocates, providers affected, too

Like many people the coalition helps, Quiroz was born in Mexico. She’s a U.S. citizen but understands the effect the crackdown is having on Latinos who feel they’re a target regardless of their immigration status. Every evening she’s reminded of the enforcement as she drives past the ICE detention center in south Portland on her way home from work.

“Personally, every time I see that corner my stress levels and my anxiety goes up,” Quiroz said. “All of us are feeling it.”

At Clinica Esperanza, Solares had to take a day off recently to regroup. From Guatemala, she said seeing images on the news of federal agents with guns brings back a traumatic memory of being a girl on her father’s shoulders one day and having to run because the police were shooting people.

“I feel scared and anxious and sad and pissed,” she said.

Like her clients, she, too, has felt under stress.

“The other day I went a whole day without drinking water,” Solares said.

As a provider, she’s had to adapt. When patients are traumatized, talk therapy often doesn’t work, she said. Instead, therapists use breathing and other body techniques to help clients loosen up.

The therapists at Clinica Esperanza also make sure patients have a safety plan and key phone numbers in the event a family member is arrested.

She recommends that patients and people in the community join the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition, PIRC, to get trained on how to deal with a potential ICE raid. She said she just joined a mutual aid group in the community and is working after hours to help.

“I have some privilege, and I can use my privilege to help others,” Solares said.

But her main focus is working with patients to keep them engaged.

“Our main goal is not to lose the connection with (our clients) who are afraid,” Solares said.

It’s not yet clear what the long-term impact of the current environment will have on people, but Griffith of One Community Health fears the effects could cause deep harm.

“Mental health is a huge component of overall physical well being,” Griffith said. “I don't think we know yet what the long-term effects are going to be, but I can't imagine they're positive.”

‘More complex issues’

One of the family physicians at One Community Health, Dr. Evan Saulino, said some patients appear to be delaying treatment.

“What I do see is people having a little bit more complex issues when they're coming in,” Saulino said. “They're waiting a little bit. They're waiting to see — ‘Can I wait this out? Maybe it'll just get better.’”

He said a longtime patient, an orchard worker with diabetes, came in recently with a foot problem that Saulino said was potentially limb-threatening.

The clinic referred him to a specialist in Portland, but Saulino said the man didn’t want to go.

“He expressed some reluctance over immigration concerns,” Saulino said. “I don’t know what his status is though.”",https://www.thelundreport.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-10/Clinic%20Esperanza%20hug.jpg?itok=QI3pfeAF,N,,2025-10-28 18:01:33.929184

In July, the Department of Labor (DOL) introduced an extensive plan to reduce regulations affecting various labor protections, including important workplace safety regulations. Officials presented the initiative as an effort to “put American workers and job creators first,” a misleading interpretation of policies that enable employers to jeopardize their workers’ well-being and complicate the process for employees to seek accountability.

This movement toward deregulation indicates a readiness to compromise the health and lives of workers, especially Black and brown workers who are overrepresented in the blue-collar industries that would be impacted, in pursuit of corporate profits. If approved, the far-reaching changes will adversely affect working conditions at construction sites and mines and limit the ability of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while performing inherently dangerous activities.

Loosening regulations that ensure health, safety, and dignity in the workplace will not eliminate outdated or unnecessary regulations. Rather, this plan undermines the fundamental right of employees to have safe and respectable working environments; indicates to employers that taking shortcuts is permissible and that the government will ignore the exploitation and subsequent dismissal of worker safety; and seems aimed at reducing expenses for employers by transferring risks and dangers onto employees.

The Importance of Regulatory Rules

Agencies draft federal rules to implement the specifics of legislation enacted by Congress. Regulations ensure that laws are properly implemented and administered so that workers have meaningful protections. This is especially important given that current labor law already falls short in creating adequate job quality standards. Trump’s deregulatory agenda requires agencies to identify ten regulations to repeal before enacting a single new regulation. This paradigm upholds the false notion that regulations hinder economic growth and burden employers.

Over half of the rules that Trump’s DOL wants to repeal are intended to make workplaces safer for employees. Since the establishment of OSHA, more than 712,000 workers have been saved under the OSH Act, and jobsite deaths have decreased by almost two-thirds, even as the size of the U.S. workforce has more than doubled. OSHA is the only agency that enforces and preserves worker health and safety.

Health and Safety Deregulations

Within this deregulation campaign, DOL intends to revise reporting thresholds and training mandates, and change enforcement priorities and inspection frequencies at OSHA. The twenty-five proposed rules all put worker safety protections at risk. Four of the most concerning are:

General Duty Clause

A proposed change that would limit OSHA’s ability to cite employers under the General Duty Clause for hazards deemed “inherent and inseparable” from certain professions in high-risk sectors is particularly harmful. Employers already have autonomy over what is “essential” to a job and how to establish workplace standards, especially in nonunionized settings. That makes the General Duty Clause one of OSHA’s most effective enforcement weapons to address the countless dangers workers may face, giving it the authority to address significant workplace dangers that are not covered by more focused rules. Without the clause’s vital safeguards, OSHA would be significantly less equipped to respond to developing risks or hold employers accountable for recognized hazards that lie within gaps in current regulations.

COVID-19 Reporting

The administration also intends to terminate OSHA’s independent system for monitoring COVID-related deaths and hospitalizations, as well as explicitly remove COVID-19 emergency reporting guidelines for health care settings from federal regulations. This change would mean that employers must only report the usual criteria for workplace risks, under which companies are only required to record hospitalizations if they occur within 24 hours of the job exposure. Since most COVID-related hospitalizations occur days or even weeks after exposure, returning to OSHA’s baseline reporting standard would essentially remove many workplace-related COVID cases from the record. The elimination of separate COVID-19 reporting also signals a concerning de-prioritization of reporting on the exposure of contagious illnesses, even in medical facilities where reporting is crucial for maintaining the safety of those settings, safeguarding access to care, and averting outbreaks that disproportionately affect those who are already at risk. If implemented, this change will harm workers in nursing facilities, assisted living communities, and home health agencies, as well as in other health care environments such as hospitals and medical offices.

Musculoskeletal Injury Reporting

Another proposal would remove the need for employers to disclose musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), even though these injuries are among the most prevalent and expensive workplace hazards. MSDs are injuries brought on by or made worse by heavy lifting, repetitive motions, poor workplace ergonomics, and other physically taxing jobs that are often not adequately protected by existing OSHA standards.

The vote on Monday paused consideration of the ordinances for six months. It came after a procession of clergy, nonprofit workers, activists and citizens stood before the panel of commissioners to deliver impassioned pleas against them. No one expressed support for the measures during a public comment period.

“You are proposing to penalize Knoxvillians for being good. You would turn food pantries, clinics and shelters into checkpoints and faithful servants into informants,” said Matthew Nance, a Knox County resident.

Nance was among the majority of speakers who cited scripture in opposing the measures.

“You would threaten directors for refusing to betray what Christ commands: to feed the hungry, welcome the stranger and heal the wounded,” he said.

But Commissioner Andy Fox, a cosponsor of the measures, chided many of the members of the public who spoke by name, telling one, “you do not rightly divine the Bible.”

“The people that like to bring up the Bible and say what would Jesus do …first of all the Bible, as I like to put it, is a book of personal piety not public policy,” Fox said.

“Now you can derive values from the Bible that you apply in public situations, but primarily the Bible is the book that is the Gospel message to the world and its primary focus is to draw attention to the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the need for repentance,” he said.

The two ordinances were initially introduced by Commissioner Angela Russell, an accountant who said the county should more strictly monitor nonprofits that receive county funds. The ordinances require more stringent audits and detailed reporting of expenditures.

One ordinance would attach the new requirements to nonprofits receiving funding via the county’s hotel tax; the other applies to general funds distributed to nonprofits.

Fox subsequently added a clause to the ordinances requiring nonprofit executive directors to provide sworn statements, subject to penalty of perjury, that no county funding is used to provide services to “any person or persons residing in, staying in, or visiting Knox County while in violation of U.S. immigration laws.”

Knox County issued $1.9 million in grants to charitable foundations through its general fund. The amount distributed to charitable funds through its hotel tax was not immediately available. Altogether, public officials said that the total amount granted to nonprofits is less than 1% of the county’s budget.

“While this misguided move has been rightfully challenged in court, it is imperative that you not wait to take action to rescind this unlawful attempt to undermine the CDFI Fund immediately.","Today, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar (TX-16) joined Representatives Maxine Waters (CA-43) and Bill Foster (IL-11) and 120 House Democrats in sending a letter to U.S. Department of the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, expressing grave concern about the Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to terminate staff at the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund amid the ongoing Republican government shutdown.

In the letter, the lawmakers underscore how for decades, communities across the country have benefited from the CDFI Fund, whose success has been made possible through the dedicated staff who have been essential to carrying out its statutory programs and functions. These public servants have helped CDFIs — including hundreds of community banks, credit unions, and loan funds — navigate rigorous certifications and applications, manage grants, and ensure funds reach the communities that need them most. Despite the Fund’s decades of proven success, the Trump Administration has repeatedly targeted the work of the CDFI Fund this year, delaying and even forcing reapplications for hundreds of millions of dollars in awards that community financial institutions leverage to provide financial access to consumers and small businesses. They go on to warn that firing CDFI staff would be reckless and would threaten the CDFI Fund’s core mission of expanding access to capital, especially to underserved groups and areas that have been historically and systemically shut out by traditional financial institutions.

The letter can be found in its entirety below and here.

”We write to express our deep concern at the attempt by the Trump Administration to unilaterally terminate all of the Treasury Department’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) staff as it pursues illegal “reductions in force” during the government shutdown. The CDFI Fund and the community financial institutions they serve are an essential and vital source of capital and financial services to underserved communities across the United States that traditional financial institutions historically don’t serve as well, including in urban and rural communities.

“For more than 30 years, across Republican and Democratic Administrations, the CDFI Fund has been a bipartisan success, providing grants, technical assistance, and other support to community financial institutions across the country that are certified as CDFIs. During the pandemic, Democrats and Republicans worked with the Trump Administration to ensure CDFIs could serve as a lifeline to consumers and small businesses in underserved communities across the country. For example, after the first round of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans went to preferred customers of the largest banks, Congress set aside $60 billion for CDFIs and other community lenders to help deploy PPP to truly small businesses in underserved communities. Congress subsequently worked with the Trump Administration to provide $12 billion in capital investments and grants for CDFIs and minority depository institutions (MDIs). These funds are estimated to boost lending by at least $130 billion to underserved communities over the next decade.

“Today, there are 1,376 community financial institutions certified as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that are located in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. These include 352 community banks, 444 credit unions, and 567 loan funds.6 Last year, CDFI Fund recipients financed more than 109,000 businesses, provided funding for more than 45,000 affordable homes, and originated almost $24.5 billion in loans and investments. CDFIs are vital to Main Street prosperity. Moreover, the New Markets Tax Credit program implemented by the CDFI Fund has contributed more than $81 billion in tax credit awards to projects that include investment in manufacturing facilities, educational centers, and hospitals. The sudden, inexplicable loss of this critical funding conduit could mean a decades-long recovery for impacted communities, as they seek to replace CDFI Fund dollars that are typically leveraged more than 8 times by private funding.

“Experienced, knowledgeable CDFI Fund staff support certified CDFIs, which are often very small community lenders, in completing the CDFI recertification and program award application processes. Furthermore, before the shutdown, the Trump Administration needlessly held up the delivery of hundreds of millions of dollars of previously appropriated CDFI awards, and then issued an updated application, forcing applicants to potentially adjust their application within a short period without having staff on hand to help. We ask that all applicants have a fair opportunity to access these funds. Going forward, without experienced staff being available to answer questions and help these institutions navigate the recertification process that must be completed by year-end, delays may cause investors to look to other opportunities, undermining the public private partnership that has supported so many communities gain financial access to credit.

“The CDFI Fund and CDFIs it supports have contributed for more than 30 years to addressing many difficult investment challenges that other financial institutions lack the capacity or ability to resolve. As some of us have recently noted, this reckless attempt to fire all of the public servants who administer the CDFI Fund flies in the face of what leaders of the Trump Administration have acknowledged about the importance of CDFIs. The outcry of alarm at this attempted gutting of the CDFI Fund and the show of support for the work of the CDFI Fund has been broad and bipartisan.

“While this misguided move has been rightfully challenged in court, it is imperative that you not wait to take action to rescind this unlawful attempt to undermine the CDFI Fund immediately. Doing so will help ensure that CDFIs and the communities that depend on them across the country will continue to thrive now and, in the years, to come.”",https://escobar.house.gov/images/facebook-meta-25.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 18:01:38.999228

The Democrats are pointing to a rolling contingency fund for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), saying Congress created that multibillion dollar pool for emergency situations like the current budget impasse. If the Trump administration refuses to spend the money, they say, it would violate the federal law designed to ensure that appropriated funds go where Congress intended.

“The contingency funding that we set aside for SNAP is not optional spending. It is required by the law,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, told reporters in the Capitol.

“We appropriated that money for this purpose. The White House must spend it,” she added. “And what they are doing right now, blocking these funds from going out, is illegal.”

At issue is more than $5 billion in the SNAP contingency pool, which Congress created to fund the low-income nutrition program in the event of emergencies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees SNAP, had initially said the administration is legally obligated to pay SNAP benefits in the event of a shutdown.

But last week, the department reversed course, saying the contingency fund is reserved for emergencies like natural disasters, not the current shutdown, which it blamed on Democrats. In that light, the agency said, it’s not withholding the money that would be illegal, but spending it.

“The contingency fund is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice,” the USDA said in a memo.

The cost to fund full SNAP benefits through the month of November is estimated to be almost $8 billion. Withholding the funds would affect more than 40 million low-income people, including roughly 16 million children, 8 million seniors and 1.2 million veterans.

Democrats dispute the USDA’s legal argument, saying the contingency fund is designed for situations like the shutdown. They’re invoking the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which limited the president’s powers to spend funds in ways inconsistent with Congress’s designs.

“The Trump administration has the appropriated funds, and legal authority, to fully fund SNAP in November — plain and simple,” said Rep. Angie Craig (Minn.), the senior Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. “They are refusing to follow the law. And they are cutting food assistance when there are ample funds available.”

Also on Tuesday, 25 states led by Democrats sued the Trump administration, similarly contending that it is legally obligated to spend the SNAP contingency funds.

Democrats are pointing out that the administration has recently found funding for other favored projects, including $40 billion to bail out Argentina’s flailing economy, $300 million for a new White House ballroom and $170 million for new private jets for top officials at the Homeland Security Department. If the administration wanted to fund SNAP, they contend, it would do so.

The Trump presidency has been a zenith of this xenophobic fervour, pathologising immigration as an existential threat to American identity.","The arrival of Columbus in the New World marked the beginning of a long history of human migration, driven by the universal quest for survival, hope and dignity. Yet, in a grotesque inversion of history, contemporary politics in the United States, particularly under the Trump administration, has perversely transformed immigration into a toxic battleground of fear, exclusion and ideological warfare. By erasing this brutal history, successive governments in the United States have perpetuated a myth of exceptionalism, even as it denies the humanity of those seeking refuge on its shores.

As schoolchildren, many of us were asked to write an essay on the theme, “What if Columbus had not discovered America?” Understandably, the very framing of this question is steeped in colonial ideology that assumes that Columbus’s landing was a historic necessity, a great leap for civilisation rather than what it actually was. Our answers, drawn from textbooks that valorised explorers and erased victims, inevitably celebrated Columbus’s courage and navigational daring. We were taught to admire the predator, never to mourn the prey.

The destruction of vibrant civilisations

But what if Columbus had not landed in the Bahamas in 1492? What if the Arawaks, the generous, peace-loving people he first encountered, had been allowed to live in peace? What if the Americas had been allowed to evolve on their own terms, with their own cultures, languages, and knowledge systems flourishing unmolested? The Iroquois Confederacy, for instance, had developed a sophisticated democratic system that inspired elements of the U.S. Constitution, though that influence is often buried or denied. These were not “primitive” societies awaiting rescue. They were civilisations with libraries, roads and astronomy, all destroyed in the name of gold and god.

From the early waves of European colonisation in the Americas and Africa to the apartheid regimes of South Africa, migration has not merely been a matter of movement. It has also been a means of conquest, expansion and domination. Settler colonial projects thrived through the forceful displacement and systematic downgrading of native populations, manifesting in overt and subtle ways through systems of oppression that are deeply ingrained in societal structures that perpetuate racial disparity and injustice. The U.S., frequently celebrated as an ideal for the “tired, poor, huddled masses”, was itself forged through the expurgation of native peoples and the abuse of enslaved labour. By denying entry to migrants, powerful nations conveniently obscure their own complicity in creating the conditions that drive people to flee.

The intricate dynamics of historical memory and its distortion are starkly illustrated in the U.S.’s approach to immigration and counter-terrorism. Let us for a moment go back to the distressing example of “Geronimo”, the code word said to have been used in the 2011 mission (“Operation Neptune Spear”) to eliminate Osama bin Laden. By appropriating the name of the legendary Apache leader, Geronimo, the U.S. military inadvertently highlighted its historical amnesia. Geronimo was a complex figure, a warrior who resisted Mexican and U.S. military forces, seeking to preserve Apache sovereignty and way of life. Labelling him a terrorist overlooks the nuances of his struggle and reduces it to simplistic binaries.

But this is no isolated misstep, for it is symptomatic of a deeper sickness in the dominant historical narrative; a narrative that begins in 1492 with the mythic arrival of Christopher Columbus. This moment is still described in textbooks, museums and mindless school rhymes as the “discovery” of America. The truth, of course, is far more brutal. Columbus did not discover a new world. He invaded one, and that invasion set in motion one of the most ferocious chapters in human history. Columbus’s arrival heralded not discovery, but genocide. The devastation was total.

What mainstream historians miss

Mainstream historians seldom dwell on the mass enslavement, the sexual violence or the cultural annihilation. To question Columbus’s legacy is to invite accusations of being “anti-American” or “revisionist”. But if revision means restoring truth to the record, then revisionism is a moral obligation. The problem is not that we remember too little; it is that we remember too selectively.

The Columbus myth, far from being a harmless fable, is the ideological blueprint for centuries of colonial expansion, white supremacy and racial capitalism. It legitimises the pillaging of the Americas, the enslavement of Africans, and the later interventions of American imperialism under the guise of spreading “freedom”. The mentality that justified the extermination of the Arawaks is the same that rationalises drone strikes today.

Fast-forward to the 21st century, and the brutal calculus of migration remains unchanged: flee war-torn Syria, economically ravaged Venezuela, or climate-ravaged sub-Saharan Africa, and you will be met with suspicion and hostility at the borders of the Global North. The Trump presidency has been a zenith of this xenophobic fervour, pathologising immigration as an existential threat to American identity. The border wall, family separations, and the Muslim ban are not just policy aberrations but ideological manifestos that codify cruelty and exclusion. These measures are not pragmatic responses to complex issues; they are declarations of war on the most vulnerable.

Moreover, the resurgence of exclusionary nationalism, a hallmark of Trump-era politics, has biased the discourse around belonging and citizenship. It designates the immigrant not as a fellow human in search of security but as an economic burden, a cultural contagion or a national security risk. What emerges, then, is a moral paradox of nations founded on violent migration and colonisation but now busy erecting moral and legal barriers to those seeking refuge.

If settler colonialism is justified under the banner of “civilising mission”, why should today’s migration be framed illegitimate? The glaring disparity between the revered pioneers of the past and the vilified migrants of today lays bare the insidious role of race, power and historical amnesia in shaping the immigration narrative.

A fundamental aspiration

Clearly, the future of immigration policy hinges on our willingness to confront the darkest chapters of our past and the brutal realities of our present. We need to excavate the buried subtexts of empire, capitalism and racial domination that continue to shape mobility, and forge a new path forward informed by historical reckoning and a commitment to human dignity. The right to seek safety, to move across borders, is not a privilege to be doled out to the few, but a fundamental human aspiration that must be recognised and protected.

To imagine, therefore, a world in which Columbus had not made landfall is not to indulge in idle fantasy, but to confront the brutal reality of a collective past. It is to consider the possibility of a world unshaped by genocide, a world where Indigenous peoples flourished on their own terms, where empires did not build their foundations on loot and plunder. The truth about history is not a matter of nicety, but a fundamental requirement for justice, accountability, and a future that does not replicate the wrongs of the past.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/opinion/op-ed/d0ue7k/article70213300.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/iStock-1321690745.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 21:57:20.733964

“Snap benefits are about to end on Saturday,” the agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said on Fox News.","A coalition of more than two dozen states on Tuesday sued the Trump administration over its decision to suspend food stamps during the government shutdown.

The lawsuit, co-led by New York, California and Massachusetts, asks a federal judge to force the US Department of Agriculture to tap into emergency reserve funds to distribute food benefits to the nearly 42 million families and children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). The USDA has said no benefits will be issued on 1 November.

“Snap is one of our nation’s most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running,” the New York attorney general, Letitia James, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on Snap, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.”

The Democratic attorneys general and three governors argue in their lawsuit that the federal government is obliged by law to maintain food benefits to the low-income households who rely on the program. They ask for a ruling by Friday on their motion.

Snap is the nation’s largest nutrition assistance program, according to the USDA, serving roughly one in eight low-income Americans at a cost of approximately $8bn per month. The USDA’s contingency fund is estimated to contain approximately $6bn.

The expiration of Snap benefits has emerged as a major pressure point in the shutdown standoff between Democrats and Republicans. Across the country, food banks and pantries, already struggling under the sharp cuts to federal programs, were bracing for a surge of hungry people if federal food aid is paused, as state officials scrambled to keep assistance flowing to recipients.

Many congressional Democrats and Republicans had called on the Trump administration to use the reserve funding to prevent widespread hunger and financial hardship on millions of American families, but it has so far declined.

“Snap benefits are about to end on Saturday,” the agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said on Fox News. “We don’t have the funding to cover them.”

The USDA’s food and nutrition homepage has a banner with a strikingly partisan message falsely accusing Senate Democrats of shutting down the government to provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants and trans Americans. “Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the notice says. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.”

“Despite having the money to fund Snap, the Trump administration is creating needless fear, angst, and harm for millions of families and their children especially as we approach the holidays,” the Massachusetts attorney general, Andrea Joy Campbell, said in a statement. “It is past time for the Trump administration to act to help, rather than harm, those who rely on our government.”

The plaintiffs cite a memo from the agriculture department stating that contingency funds were “not legally available to cover regular benefits” during the government shutdown, which the document blamed on Democrats. The agency said it was only able to tap into the reserve funds under certain circumstances, such as natural disasters.

The memo appears to contradict the department’s lapsed funding plan, released in late September, which stated that Congress’s “evident” intent was for Snap operations to continue during a government shutdown and pointed to “multi-year contingency funds” that could be tapped in the event the closures dragged on. The plan has been removed from the department’s website.

“USDA not only has authority to use contingency funds, it has a legal duty to spend all available dollars to fund Snap benefits,” said California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, adding: “We are taking a stand because families will experience hunger and malnutrition if the Trump administration gets its way.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1410d31b94ce628203719b2082c1e3b582b3cbc/283_0_2968_2374/master/2968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=980574d5e91db41195daec1499f438e2",N,,2025-10-28 19:01:35.217554

‘No Kings’ protests were people-driven, peaceful, and potent

The “No Kings” protests show the growing depth and breadth of opposition to an imperial presidency. Although most Americans lack experience in mounting major resistance efforts against a federal government engaged in authoritarian actions or policies, they peacefully organized in all 50 states to make their demands heard, reaching even further into conservative communities. People of all ages, races, economic statuses, and other backgrounds, including veterans and religious leaders, demanded transformative change in the face of the administration’s unprecedented abuses of power; the weaponization of the military against Democratic-led cities; illegal detentions and arrests by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents; President Donald Trump’s self-enrichment and lack of accountability; and the administration’s attacks on key parts of civil society and on the president’s perceived rivals—all while Congress and the courts are largely failing to act as a sufficient check and balance.

Despite the seriousness of the moment, the “No Kings” protests were infused with positivity. Many rallygoers dressed in festive costumes, carried humorous signs, played music, danced, sang, and performed other joyful acts. To show unity, many wore yellow, the color of several nonviolent movements around the world. These tactics can create enthusiasm and are effective tools against strongman leaders.

People voiced their views despite dangerous and threatening language used by some lawmakers and officials who claimed that the “No Kings” protests would be driven by hatred of America and would include terrorist sympathizers and violence. Yet, notably, there was not one reported arrest of any “No Kings” protester nor any widespread violence, perhaps because the organizers conducted nonviolence and deescalation trainings. Protest movements stand a much greater chance of success if they are peaceful.

The 3.5 percent ‘rule’ is an instructive measurement of public sentiment

In a prior article and video, CAP explained how a relatively small number of Americans—12 million—can help stop the nation’s slide into full-scale authoritarianism. Political science research developed by professor Erica Chenoweth of Harvard University and her research partners shows that when a mere 3.5 percent of a nation’s population mobilizes in peaceful protest at a key moment, it signals a powerfully broad movement, making it nearly impossible for the government to ignore the people’s demands. The 3.5 percent rule is not a fixed formula, but rather a solid predictor based on more than 300 successful nonviolent movements around the world. In fact, most movements that succeeded did so without reaching 3.5 percent.

How Peaceful Protest by Just 3.5 Percent of Americans Could Force Major Policy Changes From the Trump Administration

Michael Sozan

As CAP has discussed, movements gain power when they sustain public participation across diverse groups that refuse to allow the government to scare or divide them. Chenoweth’s research also reveals that 3.5 percent participation indicates deeper underlying societal support from nonprotesters and a sense of inevitability, which can help accelerate defections from key pro-government pillars, including leaders from the business, political, cultural, and media sectors. The most effective mobilizations also spur defections from security and military forces who refuse illegal government orders and members of the political party in power, pillars that an imperial-minded leader relies on to entrench his control.

A Green Light for Authoritarianism: How the Trump Administration Fuels Global Autocracy

Dan Herman, Robert Benson

In the months ahead, broader mobilization could spur change

The “No Kings” protests signal that the United States may be on the brink of a sustained and ideologically broad movement to counter an imperial presidency. Next steps could involve Americans engaging in other forms of nonviolent noncooperation, like they did during the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. For example, “general strikes that affect the economy, boycotts, sit-ins, walkouts, or shutdowns of parts of cities can put unavoidable pressure on political leaders to hear their constituents and resolve the matter.”

The grassroots organizations that coordinated the “No Kings” mobilization said they are exploring options such as those described above as well as creating a rapid response network to coordinate quick peaceful pushback, encouraging people to get involved with community groups, and connecting the protests to popular policies such as reducing skyrocketing health care costs or curbing elected officials’ corruption. CAP has suggested a wide range of activities for Americans to make their voices heard, including communicating directly with their federal, state, and local elected officials; creating websites to build a public record of harms to their communities; or pooling money with neighbors to amplify messages via newspaper ads or billboards.

Conclusion

People are refusing to stay silent and instead are engaging in peaceful dissent. Town by town, they are growing a movement to demand a government whose president is not above the law. The United States has crossed the halfway mark toward the 3.5 percent threshold. If people build an expansive ideological movement that creatively flexes its power and persuades key pillars of society to join, they could help course-correct the nation onto a pro-democracy path.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-2241815439-cropped.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 16:56:54.873308

And though advocacy organizations are doing their best to help TPS recipients find legal alternatives to stay, options are limited.","MIAMI — In the streets of downtown Caracas, Venezuela, university student Mariana stood alongside her family in a sea of yellow, red and blue. She was among other Venezuelans protesting an oppressive regime controlling the country.

“Hay que estudiar, hay que estudiar, el que no estudia se parece a Nicolás,” the crowd chanted. “We must study, we must study, the ones who don’t will be like Nicolás.”

Their cries declared their disdain for dictator Nicolás Maduro.

It wasn’t long until the military intervened, sparking violence and unrest. As Mariana sought refuge, a man got out of his car and stopped her – and pointed a gun at her head.

Her shock drowned out the chaos around her. All she heard was her father screaming her name.

“We were very used to violence and guns and crime being part of the day by day in the city,” Mariana recalled, adding that the man quickly returned to his car and drove away. “It was not really that shocking.”

Four years later, while on vacation in Miami with her boyfriend, Antonio, Mariana heard something on the radio about a new immigration benefit for Venezuelans fleeing the country amid food shortages, kidnappings and repression.

The conditions, the U.S. homeland security secretary said at the time, “reveal a country in turmoil, unable to protect its own citizens.”

Mariana and her boyfriend decided to stay in the United States and restart their lives – safe from harm – through what’s known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.

Today, like hundreds of thousands of others, the couple face the unimaginable idea of having to give up that new life.

As part of the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration agenda, the Department of Homeland Security has acted to terminate TPS for recipients from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

People from Venezuela and Haiti make up the vast majority of those losing status.

In April, DHS ended TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans, which meant work permits and protection from deportation were no longer valid. On Feb. 3, TPS is set to end for nearly 350,000 Haitians.

And this Wednesday, Sept. 10, is the deadline for the designation to end for another 250,000 Venezuelans – including Mariana and Antonio – who would then have about 60 days to figure out what comes next.

Amid ongoing legal wrangling, a federal judge on Sept. 5 found the administration’s actions unlawful and blocked it from ending protections for Venezuelans and Haitians.

As the court battles go on, some beneficiaries have holed up in their homes, fearful of arrest and deportation, while others scramble to find legal alternatives – or face losing everything.

“We have people … who have been here for over 15, 20 years, who have made a life in the U.S., who have families in the U.S. – children, homes, cars, businesses that are at risk,” said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigration advocacy group.

“Right now, the level of fear and trauma and terror cannot be explained,” Jozef said. “It is complete chaos. It is complete terror. It is complete trauma.”

Florida is home to more TPS recipients than any other state in the country – people such as Rafael Rodriguez, a former civil engineer and college professor from Valencia, Venezuela. He has gone from servicing a major cruise liner to barely leaving his home because he now is considered deportable. He obtained TPS in 2023; without it, his life in North Miami has transformed from one of prosperity to, in his estimation, a “prison.”

Sebastian, an architect also from Valencia, left Venezuela because of government oppression and dwindling career prospects. He obtained TPS in 2024, after fleeing to North Miami. For him, it was a “lifesaver.” And the loss of the benefit, he said, is the loss of his pursuit of “the American dream.”

Since 2021, Mariana and Antonio have lived in Aventura, north of Miami. They both started careers in finance, the subject they studied together in university back in Venezuela. For the couple, looming TPS expiration has made it nearly impossible to plan for their future.

(Photo by Grace Berry/News21)

“It has given me anxiety, a lot of sadness, a feeling of injustice,” said Mariana – who, along with Antonio and Sebastian, asked that her full name not be used because of concerns it could hurt her efforts to remain in the country.

“I feel like my life is on hold.”

‘America is not perfect, but it was human’

TPS began in 1990 as a way to protect individuals fleeing armed conflict, natural disasters or other unlivable conditions in their home countries. The status provides work permits and deportation protection for up to 18 months – and can be renewed at the discretion of the U.S. homeland security secretary.

As of Sept. 30, 2024, some 1.1 million people were protected by the benefit.

To qualify, individuals must meet several conditions, pay a fee that this year went from $50 to $500, and have never been convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors. These requirements, experts say, make holders of the humanitarian benefit some of the most vetted immigrants in the country.

“They are not criminals. They are not illegal,” said Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus in Miami. “So, what is this about?”

In a January interview with Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of TPS for some Venezuelans, saying a Biden-era extension of the benefit meant “they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another 18 months, and we stopped that.”

Noem referred to Venezuelans who were in the country legally – and those of the Tren de Aragua criminal enterprise – in the same breath, saying, “We are going to follow the process, evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country, including the Venezuelans that are here and members of the TDA. … The people of this country want these dirtbags out.”

In official announcements explaining the end of TPS, the agency has said conditions in some of the countries, including Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and violence-riddled Haiti, have improved enough to be safe for beneficiaries to return.

Humanitarian organizations disagree.

“The Taliban is one of the most repressive governments in the world,” said Matthew Soerens of World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization. “Until the U.S. Department of Homeland Security tried to make the argument, I’d never heard anyone suggest that Afghanistan was back to being a safe place for people to live.”

“In the case of Haiti, you’re just facing death,” said Daniel Noroña, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for the Americas. “You are facing a situation where there are no guarantees for your life or for your loved ones.”

In the case of Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement in July – titled “Standing with the Venezuelan People” – in which he denounced the regime of dictator Maduro as “corrupt, criminal and illegitimate.” The DHS, though, says that “notable improvements” in the economy, public health and crime prevention “allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.”

The State Department restricts travel to and from Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan with Level 4 travel advisories – the highest issued by the agency, warning of “life-threatening risks.”

Homeland Security also argues that it is against the “national interest” of the United States to allow many of these TPS recipients to remain. But to many advocates, that’s code for something else.

“Is it just racism? Is it just xenophobia? Is it just because we are brown and Black? Is this just about making America white again?” Ferro asked. “Why (is) America becoming this absolutely unrecognizable picture of what it was?”

“America is not perfect,” she added, “but it was human. Now it’s not.”

‘There’s only so much we can do’

Often called the “Gateway of the Americas,” Miami is known for its majority foreign-born population, which gives the city a multicultural flair unmatched by most other parts of the U.S.

In the north of the city, Little Haiti serves as the heart of Haitian culture. The country’s flag lines the streets, the air smells of rich Caribbean food, and the Little Haiti Cultural Complex – a vibrant building topped with ornate steeples – sits at its center.

The city of Doral is 12 miles west. Nicknamed “Doralzuela,” the city is home to some 30,000 residents of Venezuelan descent. Store owners are more likely to greet you with “Como estas?” than “How are you?” Arepas, corn cakes stuffed with fillings, are common menu staples.

The Florida and American flags fly outside the Doral Government Center in Doral, Fla. Under the Trump administration, 350,000 Venezuelans have lost TPS – along with the work permits and protection from deportation that came with it. About 40% of Doral’s residents are from Venezuela. (Photo by Grace Berry/News21)

Today, Miami’s cultural enclaves lack the bustle that once characterized them.

In North Miami, Rodriguez, the former civil engineer and professor, hides in his home with two cats and his wife, who also lost her legal status when the Trump administration canceled a different humanitarian program. The fear of immigration raids or being stopped by police keeps their lives confined to the walls of their condominium; they leave only once a week, to buy groceries.

“You feel like the net is closing around you,” Rodriguez said, “and there is nothing you can do.”

With their work permits no longer valid, he and his wife draw from their savings to live.

If he can, Rodriguez will pursue a national interest waiver, which allows professionals who hold an advanced degree or have “exceptional” abilities to more quickly gain legal status. If that’s not possible, he and his wife will self-deport – possibly to Spain.

They are waiting to see how ongoing court challenges shake out before making a final decision; several organizations have filed lawsuits in defense of TPS recipients, and that litigation continues.

“We want to do it legally,” Rodriguez said. “But it’s very hard to hear people trying to say, ‘Oh, come here legally,’ when the system is broken.”

Sebastian, the architect, is seeking an employment-based visa, but if it isn’t approved, he said, he will self-deport. He would leave behind his uncles, cousins and friends.

“I believe the majority of the (TPS) community is doing things right – we’re not criminals,” he said. “We are trying to make our voice heard and show the American people we deserve to be here. We need to be here.”

Advocates are coming together to help TPS recipients in whatever way they can.

The Miami-based Family Action Network Movement hosted a two-day summit in June at the Little Haiti Cultural Complex. Experts provided a know-your-rights training and legal workshops to help residents navigate the fast-changing landscape.

“There’s only so much we can do from a local level, but what we’re trying to do is to stop the American dream from being the American nightmare,” Michael Joseph, a first-generation Haitian-American and the mayor of North Miami Beach, said as the summit kicked off.

Across town, in North Miami, the Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center sits across the street from a Haitian restaurant. The nonprofit serves around 20,000 people each year and helps Haitian immigrants with applications for legal status.

On a rainy Tuesday, the center was filled with people waiting to speak with someone. Employees in cubicles hunched over their desks – some answering phones, others counseling clients.

Executive Director Gepsie Metellus, who came to the U.S. from Haiti when she was 12, sat in her office in a back corner. These days, she said, her organization’s work centers on helping TPS recipients figure out what to do next.

“If you have children who are U.S.-born and you don’t want to necessarily take them with you, you need a guardianship arrangement,” she said. “If you have property … let’s make sure that you have a power of attorney.”

It’s “lots of guidance, lots of counseling, lots of holding hands,” she added.

For some, the planning process involves considering self-deportation – but to where?

“We’ve had some clients suggest that they would prefer to return to the country through which they were granted some sort of status prior to coming to the United States,” Metellus said. “We’re talking Chile or Brazil.”

At the national level, two bills pending in Congress propose a pathway to legal permanent residency for TPS recipients.

And though advocacy organizations are doing their best to help TPS recipients find legal alternatives to stay, options are limited.

John De La Vega is a Miami-based immigration lawyer who counsels Venezuelan TPS recipients. Lately, his work has centered on helping his clients adjust their status to remain in the U.S.

“It’s very limited, because with a short amount of time, they have to be able to look for other options,” he said. “It’s very stressful, because they do not know what’s going to happen tomorrow.”

The first thing he asks clients is whether they have a relative who could petition on their behalf for permanent residence. For example, a U.S.-born person over the age of 21 could petition for their parent. Citizen spouses of TPS recipients may also petition for them.

If none of those options is available, De La Vega encourages his clients to apply for asylum. Some TPS recipients have already done so, but many never applied – assuming they were “safe” under Temporary Protected Status.

Though asylum can lead to permanent residency, applying also comes with risks. In addition to the multimillion-case backlog that has slowed the process, if a TPS recipient whose status has been terminated appears in court for a hearing, they could be placed in removal proceedings if asylum is denied.

Said Oscar Mendoza, an immigration attorney in Dallas: “Immigration courts become, unfortunately, a place where you can be detained.”

‘We dream of a normal life’

For the past four years, Mariana and Antonio have rebuilt their lives in the U.S. With their work permits, Mariana landed a job as an operations analyst at a wealth management firm, while Antonio found work as a retail banker dealing with personal and business accounts.

While they cherish their Venezuelan traditions – such as eating arepas almost every day for breakfast – they have adopted American customs. The couple host Thanksgiving at their apartment every year and even learned how to make a turkey.

They envision a future not unlike that of many Americans. They want to continue flourishing in their careers, get married, buy a house with a big backyard and have kids. “That’s normal life,” Mariana said. “We dream of a normal life.”

“We want to start a family, and we want to find a place where we could be stable and to have a certainty of the future,” Antonio added.

But for now, they can’t see any future beyond Sept. 10, the date their TPS is set to expire.

Mariana and Antonio spend much of their time consulting with lawyers and sifting through legal options.

“This immigration thing has taken over our entire lives,” Mariana said.

She said her company wants to support her, so she has looked into obtaining certification that allows employers to hire foreign workers to work permanently in the U.S. The couple have also explored student visas as an option.

The two recently applied for master’s programs at a university in Miami. Mariana was accepted into her program and starts classes in September. Antonio was accepted but later found out the university was unable to grant him a visa. He is now applying for asylum, despite the risks.

If their plans fail, they will move to Spain.

“I love projections – I love having everything under control,” Mariana said. “And I can’t project any type of future beyond September. … I’m just trying to navigate through it.”

This June, on a trip to New York City, Antonio proposed to Mariana while strolling through Central Park. Her engagement ring carries special significance: Engraved on the inside of the silver band is “M.A. + A.H. = K” – the couple’s initials added together to equal the symbol for a constant in mathematics.

It’s a callback to where the couple first met – in math class at university. For the two, the equation symbolizes a forever life together. As Antonio put it: “We can have ups and downs, but the constants are you and I.”

What was supposed to be one of the most exciting milestones in their lives is now shrouded in anxiety.

Mariana remembers the deep admiration she had for America as a young girl – and the poem, etched on the inside of the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal, that had always represented what she thought the country stood for.

She recited a line – “I lift my lamp beside the golden door” – then paused to think about what it had always meant to her.

“This used to be a place that welcomed people, people willing to work hard,” she said. “And I thought, ‘Of course, I’m going to make it there. The doors are going to be open.’

“That was the case for years, and now it’s not. It has made me very sad about what I thought of this country.”

MIAMI — In the streets of downtown Caracas, Venezuela, university student Mariana stood alongside her family in a sea of yellow, red and blue. She was among other Venezuelans protesting an oppressive regime controlling the country.

“Hay que estudiar, hay que estudiar, el que no estudia se parece a Nicolás,” the crowd chanted. “We must study, we must study, the ones who don’t will be like Nicolás.”

Their cries declared their disdain for dictator Nicolás Maduro.

It wasn’t long until the military intervened, sparking violence and unrest. As Mariana sought refuge, a man got out of his car and stopped her – and pointed a gun at her head.

Her shock drowned out the chaos around her. All she heard was her father screaming her name.

“We were very used to violence and guns and crime being part of the day by day in the city,” Mariana recalled, adding that the man quickly returned to his car and drove away. “It was not really that shocking.”

Four years later, while on vacation in Miami with her boyfriend, Antonio, Mariana heard something on the radio about a new immigration benefit for Venezuelans fleeing the country amid food shortages, kidnappings and repression.

The conditions, the U.S. homeland security secretary said at the time, “reveal a country in turmoil, unable to protect its own citizens.”

Mariana and her boyfriend decided to stay in the United States and restart their lives – safe from harm – through what’s known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.

Today, like hundreds of thousands of others, the couple face the unimaginable idea of having to give up that new life.

As part of the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration agenda, the Department of Homeland Security has acted to terminate TPS for recipients from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

People from Venezuela and Haiti make up the vast majority of those losing status.

In April, DHS ended TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans, which meant work permits and protection from deportation were no longer valid. On Feb. 3, TPS is set to end for nearly 350,000 Haitians.

And this Wednesday, Sept. 10, is the deadline for the designation to end for another 250,000 Venezuelans – including Mariana and Antonio – who would then have about 60 days to figure out what comes next.

Amid ongoing legal wrangling, a federal judge on Sept. 5 found the administration’s actions unlawful and blocked it from ending protections for Venezuelans and Haitians.

As the court battles go on, some beneficiaries have holed up in their homes, fearful of arrest and deportation, while others scramble to find legal alternatives – or face losing everything.

“We have people … who have been here for over 15, 20 years, who have made a life in the U.S., who have families in the U.S. – children, homes, cars, businesses that are at risk,” said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigration advocacy group.

“Right now, the level of fear and trauma and terror cannot be explained,” Jozef said. “It is complete chaos. It is complete terror. It is complete trauma.”

Florida is home to more TPS recipients than any other state in the country – people such as Rafael Rodriguez, a former civil engineer and college professor from Valencia, Venezuela. He has gone from servicing a major cruise liner to barely leaving his home because he now is considered deportable. He obtained TPS in 2023; without it, his life in North Miami has transformed from one of prosperity to, in his estimation, a “prison.”

Sebastian, an architect also from Valencia, left Venezuela because of government oppression and dwindling career prospects. He obtained TPS in 2024, after fleeing to North Miami. For him, it was a “lifesaver.” And the loss of the benefit, he said, is the loss of his pursuit of “the American dream.”

Since 2021, Mariana and Antonio have lived in Aventura, north of Miami. They both started careers in finance, the subject they studied together in university back in Venezuela. For the couple, looming TPS expiration has made it nearly impossible to plan for their future.

“It has given me anxiety, a lot of sadness, a feeling of injustice,” said Mariana – who, along with Antonio and Sebastian, asked that her full name not be used because of concerns it could hurt her efforts to remain in the country.

“I feel like my life is on hold.”

‘America is not perfect, but it was human’

TPS began in 1990 as a way to protect individuals fleeing armed conflict, natural disasters or other unlivable conditions in their home countries. The status provides work permits and deportation protection for up to 18 months – and can be renewed at the discretion of the U.S. homeland security secretary.

As of Sept. 30, 2024, some 1.1 million people were protected by the benefit.

To qualify, individuals must meet several conditions, pay a fee that this year went from $50 to $500, and have never been convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors. These requirements, experts say, make holders of the humanitarian benefit some of the most vetted immigrants in the country.

“They are not criminals. They are not illegal,” said Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus in Miami. “So, what is this about?”

In a January interview with Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of TPS for some Venezuelans, saying a Biden-era extension of the benefit meant “they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another 18 months, and we stopped that.”

Noem referred to Venezuelans who were in the country legally – and those of the Tren de Aragua criminal enterprise – in the same breath, saying, “We are going to follow the process, evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country, including the Venezuelans that are here and members of the TDA. … The people of this country want these dirtbags out.”

In official announcements explaining the end of TPS, the agency has said conditions in some of the countries, including Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and violence-riddled Haiti, have improved enough to be safe for beneficiaries to return.

Humanitarian organizations disagree.

“The Taliban is one of the most repressive governments in the world,” said Matthew Soerens of World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization. “Until the U.S. Department of Homeland Security tried to make the argument, I’d never heard anyone suggest that Afghanistan was back to being a safe place for people to live.”

“In the case of Haiti, you’re just facing death,” said Daniel Noroña, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for the Americas. “You are facing a situation where there are no guarantees for your life or for your loved ones.”

In the case of Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement in July – titled “Standing with the Venezuelan People” – in which he denounced the regime of dictator Maduro as “corrupt, criminal and illegitimate.” The DHS, though, says that “notable improvements” in the economy, public health and crime prevention “allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.”

The State Department restricts travel to and from Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan with Level 4 travel advisories – the highest issued by the agency, warning of “life-threatening risks.”

Homeland Security also argues that it is against the “national interest” of the United States to allow many of these TPS recipients to remain. But to many advocates, that’s code for something else.

“Is it just racism? Is it just xenophobia? Is it just because we are brown and Black? Is this just about making America white again?” Ferro asked. “Why (is) America becoming this absolutely unrecognizable picture of what it was?”

“America is not perfect,” she added, “but it was human. Now it’s not.”

‘There’s only so much we can do’

Often called the “Gateway of the Americas,” Miami is known for its majority foreign-born population, which gives the city a multicultural flair unmatched by most other parts of the U.S.

In the north of the city, Little Haiti serves as the heart of Haitian culture. The country’s flag lines the streets, the air smells of rich Caribbean food, and the Little Haiti Cultural Complex – a vibrant building topped with ornate steeples – sits at its center.

The city of Doral is 12 miles west. Nicknamed “Doralzuela,” the city is home to some 30,000 residents of Venezuelan descent. Store owners are more likely to greet you with “Como estas?” than “How are you?” Arepas, corn cakes stuffed with fillings, are common menu staples.

The Florida and American flags fly outside the Doral Government Center in Doral, Fla. Under the Trump administration, 350,000 Venezuelans have lost TPS – along with the work permits and protection from deportation that came with it. About 40% of Doral’s residents are from Venezuela.

Today, Miami’s cultural enclaves lack the bustle that once characterized them.

In North Miami, Rodriguez, the former civil engineer and professor, hides in his home with two cats and his wife, who also lost her legal status when the Trump administration canceled a different humanitarian program. The fear of immigration raids or being stopped by police keeps their lives confined to the walls of their condominium; they leave only once a week, to buy groceries.

“You feel like the net is closing around you,” Rodriguez said, “and there is nothing you can do.”

With their work permits no longer valid, he and his wife draw from their savings to live.

If he can, Rodriguez will pursue a national interest waiver, which allows professionals who hold an advanced degree or have “exceptional” abilities to more quickly gain legal status. If that’s not possible, he and his wife will self-deport – possibly to Spain.

They are waiting to see how ongoing court challenges shake out before making a final decision; several organizations have filed lawsuits in defense of TPS recipients, and that litigation continues.

“We want to do it legally,” Rodriguez said. “But it’s very hard to hear people trying to say, ‘Oh, come here legally,’ when the system is broken.”

Sebastian, the architect, is seeking an employment-based visa, but if it isn’t approved, he said, he will self-deport. He would leave behind his uncles, cousins and friends.

“I believe the majority of the (TPS) community is doing things right – we’re not criminals,” he said. “We are trying to make our voice heard and show the American people we deserve to be here. We need to be here.”

Advocates are coming together to help TPS recipients in whatever way they can.

The Miami-based Family Action Network Movement hosted a two-day summit in June at the Little Haiti Cultural Complex. Experts provided a know-your-rights training and legal workshops to help residents navigate the fast-changing landscape.

“There’s only so much we can do from a local level, but what we’re trying to do is to stop the American dream from being the American nightmare,” Michael Joseph, a first-generation Haitian-American and the mayor of North Miami Beach, said as the summit kicked off.

Across town, in North Miami, the Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center sits across the street from a Haitian restaurant. The nonprofit serves around 20,000 people each year and helps Haitian immigrants with applications for legal status.

On a rainy Tuesday, the center was filled with people waiting to speak with someone. Employees in cubicles hunched over their desks – some answering phones, others counseling clients.

Executive Director Gepsie Metellus, who came to the U.S. from Haiti when she was 12, sat in her office in a back corner. These days, she said, her organization’s work centers on helping TPS recipients figure out what to do next.

“If you have children who are U.S.-born and you don’t want to necessarily take them with you, you need a guardianship arrangement,” she said. “If you have property … let’s make sure that you have a power of attorney.”

It’s “lots of guidance, lots of counseling, lots of holding hands,” she added.

For some, the planning process involves considering self-deportation – but to where?

“We’ve had some clients suggest that they would prefer to return to the country through which they were granted some sort of status prior to coming to the United States,” Metellus said. “We’re talking Chile or Brazil.”

At the national level, two bills pending in Congress propose a pathway to legal permanent residency for TPS recipients.

And though advocacy organizations are doing their best to help TPS recipients find legal alternatives to stay, options are limited.

John De La Vega is a Miami-based immigration lawyer who counsels Venezuelan TPS recipients. Lately, his work has centered on helping his clients adjust their status to remain in the U.S.

“It’s very limited, because with a short amount of time, they have to be able to look for other options,” he said. “It’s very stressful, because they do not know what’s going to happen tomorrow.”

The first thing he asks clients is whether they have a relative who could petition on their behalf for permanent residence. For example, a U.S.-born person over the age of 21 could petition for their parent. Citizen spouses of TPS recipients may also petition for them.

If none of those options is available, De La Vega encourages his clients to apply for asylum. Some TPS recipients have already done so, but many never applied – assuming they were “safe” under Temporary Protected Status.

Though asylum can lead to permanent residency, applying also comes with risks. In addition to the multimillion-case backlog that has slowed the process, if a TPS recipient whose status has been terminated appears in court for a hearing, they could be placed in removal proceedings if asylum is denied.

Said Oscar Mendoza, an immigration attorney in Dallas: “Immigration courts become, unfortunately, a place where you can be detained.”

‘We dream of a normal life’

For the past four years, Mariana and Antonio have rebuilt their lives in the U.S. With their work permits, Mariana landed a job as an operations analyst at a wealth management firm, while Antonio found work as a retail banker dealing with personal and business accounts.

While they cherish their Venezuelan traditions – such as eating arepas almost every day for breakfast – they have adopted American customs. The couple host Thanksgiving at their apartment every year and even learned how to make a turkey.

They envision a future not unlike that of many Americans. They want to continue flourishing in their careers, get married, buy a house with a big backyard and have kids. “That’s normal life,” Mariana said. “We dream of a normal life.”

But for now, they can’t see any future beyond Sept. 10, the date their TPS is set to expire.

Mariana and Antonio spend much of their time consulting with lawyers and sifting through legal options.

She said her company wants to support her, so she has looked into obtaining certification that allows employers to hire foreign workers to work permanently in the U.S. The couple have also explored student visas as an option.

If their plans fail, they will move to Spain.

“I love projections – I love having everything under control,” Mariana said. “And I can’t project any type of future beyond September. … I’m just trying to navigate through it.”

This June, on a trip to New York City, Antonio proposed to Mariana while strolling through Central Park. Her engagement ring carries special significance: Engraved on the inside of the silver band is “M.A. + A.H. = K” – the couple’s initials added together to equal the symbol for a constant in mathematics.

It’s a callback to where the couple first met – in math class at university. For the two, the equation symbolizes a forever life together. As Antonio put it: “We can have ups and downs, but the constants are you and I.”

What was supposed to be one of the most exciting milestones in their lives is now shrouded in anxiety.

Abrego Garcia is in the eighth month of a fierce battle with the Trump administration that has drawn the fury of President Donald Trump himself and captured the attention of senior officials across the Trump administration.","TRUTH SERUM TIME — If former special counsel Jack Smith testifies on Capitol Hill, it would be a blockbuster. Will it happen?

Smith has asked Congress to let him testify in public about his failed criminal prosecutions of President Donald Trump — the first stemming from Trump’s complex plot to subvert the 2020 election, the other from Trump’s decision to hoard classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after his first term ended.

House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan is mulling the offer, as is Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley; lawmakers are usually loath to let witnesses dictate the terms of their appearances, but Smith is among the biggest fish their panels are chasing, and he wouldn’t be the first special counsel to speak publicly to lawmakers about his work.

High-profile congressional hearings are often an exercise in grandstanding, speechifying and limited substantive value. And Smith may have his own limitations: He could choose to plead the 5th, in an acknowledgment of Trump’s repeated threats to prosecute him; he may be bound by grand jury secrecy from discussing key aspects of the cases; and he must first obtain permission from the Justice Department to speak freely about his work.

But in a hypothetical world in which Smith has no obstacles to testifying — and is delivered a dose of truth serum beforehand — here are the five questions we would ask to generate genuine insight about his ill-fated, historic prosecutions:

1. Did it hurt to have to share oxygen with Alvin Bragg and Fani Willis?

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s hush money prosecution of Trump in New York was widely seen as the weakest of the four criminal cases against him but had the advantage of being the first. Bragg leveled the 34-count indictment in April 2023, two months before your classified documents case.

Fani Willis’ case in Georgia, charging Trump with seeking to corrupt Georgia’s 2020 election results, came less than two weeks after you brought similar charges at the national level. Willis’ indictment was seen as scattershot and resulted in Trump’s infamous mugshot; and of course, it later fell apart over allegations that Willis had a financial conflict stemming from a romantic relationship with a top prosecutor.

Those other cases helped Trump build an argument that he was being unfairly targeted in the heat of his reelection campaign — and group the graver allegations you lodged into an overarching persecution narrative. Would it have been easier if the field had been completely clear?

Moreover, the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling — finding presidents almost entirely immune from prosecution for their official conduct — warned about the potential for dubious cases against former presidents. Do you think Bragg’s trial, which was underway at the precise moment the Supreme Court weighed the immunity question, contributed to the justices’ concerns?

2. Explain the decision to charge only Trump for election subversion and leave the other alleged co-conspirators — like Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro — unindicted.

The speculation in legal circles was that keeping the indictment focused squarely on Trump simplified the presentation of evidence, limited the ability of those alleged co-conspirators to gum up the process with disruptive motions or privilege claims and amplified the stakes of the case against him. But it also allowed them to escape potential accountability.

Why did you opt against a more sweeping indictment that included those most closely associated with Trump’s scheme to cling to power?

3. Did the Justice Department’s relatively slow start to the Trump investigation end up being fatal to your case? Would the outcome have been different if prosecutors began pursuing potential crimes by the president in the immediate aftermath of Jan. 6?

Now, there is evidence that the review of those close to Trump began much earlier than the public realizes. The Justice Department inspector general began asking about then-DOJ attorney Jeff Clark within weeks of Jan. 6, and fights over efforts to access privileged materials began in early 2022. Trump also used grand jury proceedings to fight prosecutors’ efforts to access his aides’ testimony and his Twitter account, resulting in delays of weeks or even months.

But there was still a lag at the outset of the Biden administration that allowed Trump time to regroup and position himself for the legal fight ahead. Was that a mistake by Attorney General Merrick Garland?

4. Describe your team’s view of the work of the Jan. 6 select committee. Did you view their findings as credible and did you rely on any of their analysis or simply the evidence they amassed?

The House’s Jan. 6 committee interviewed hundreds of witnesses from Trump’s White House, inner circle and political operation, helping lay out in a series of major hearings the first comprehensive history of Trump’s bid to seize a second term despite losing the 2020 election.

But the panel’s most valuable asset was its collection of transcripts and documents from witnesses like former White House counsel Pat Cipollone, former Mike Pence aide Greg Jacob and several other former White House officials who interacted with Trump in the lead up to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.

The committee had an uneasy relationship with the Justice Department prior to your appointment as special counsel. The Democratic-led panel rebuffed prosecutors’ requests for their evidence until after the committee completed its work in December 2022, even as prosecutors began building a parallel case.

How much of your case was built upon the foundation the Jan. 6 committee laid?

5. Do you think the American justice system has the capacity to prosecute a former president of the United States?

Not only did your case result in the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, which all future presidents could use to shield themselves from legal consequences. But even before that, Trump had managed to stall the case for months over privilege disputes and grand jury battles that ultimately put it out of reach once he was elected.

Regardless of the cases’ merits, does the outcome show that the sheer power even former presidents can bring to bear on the legal system makes such prosecutions impossible? In other words, are presidents, as a practical matter, above the law, even after leaving office?

What'd I Miss?

— Graham Platner’s new campaign manager leaves operation after joining just days ago: Graham Platner’s campaign manager is stepping down after less than a week on the job, the latest departure on a Senate campaign that has seen several high-profile shake-ups in recent weeks as it attempts to fend off a string of controversies. The move, which was first reported by Axios, comes as the Maine Democrat has attracted a wave of criticism for troves of unearthed Reddit posts in which he endorsed political violence, downplayed concerns about sexual assault in the military and self-identified as a communist. That’s in addition to his Nazi-related tattoo.

— ‘Make American Shipbuilding Great Again’: Korea leans into shipbuilding as it woos Trump: President Donald Trump wants more ships made in America. He’s going to need foreign help. Key to this effort, which the administration sees as a national security and economic imperative, is South Korean shipbuilding giant Hanwha Ocean, which acquired the Philly Shipyard in Pennsylvania last year. It’s the linchpin of a broader strategy to counter China’s dominance in the field, which gives the People’s Republic a significant military and economic advantage over the U.S., whose shipbuilding capabilities are anemic in comparison. And shipbuilding could play a critical role in trade negotiations between the Republic of Korea and the United States.

— Trump administration is racing to deport Abrego Garcia ahead of criminal proceedings: The Trump administration is preparing to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia as soon as Friday, reversing an earlier commitment to bring him to trial on human smuggling charges federal prosecutors filed against him in June. Justice Department officials revealed the new plan Monday in a hearing convened by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who has blocked Abrego Garcia’s deportation while he attempts to stave it off for good. Abrego Garcia is in the eighth month of a fierce battle with the Trump administration that has drawn the fury of President Donald Trump himself and captured the attention of senior officials across the Trump administration.

— Another shutdown consequence: Democrats can’t visit ICE detention facilities: Federal immigration authorities say they no longer have to provide on-demand access to detention facilities for members of Congress. The reason? The government shutdown. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, who have been fighting a lawsuit brought by Democratic lawmakers over prior denied visit attempts,have informed lawmakers that they simply don’t have the staff or funding to support those visits. Lawmakers have previously been legally allowed to demand them as part of their oversight duties, which includes monitoring conditions and communicating with detainees facing deportation.

AROUND THE WORLD

FAMILY REUNION — Britain is pushing to form a Western alliance with the European Union to curb China’s dominance in the global steel market, multiple figures familiar with the talks told POLITICO.

The hope in London is that a coordinated approach could help the U.K. dodge the new tariffs Brussels plans to impose — a 50 percent duty aimed at shielding EU producers from China’s industrial overproduction.

Britain, which finds itself at the mercy of EU trade action post-Brexit, is currently seeking carve-outs from those measures.

WISH LIST — Friedrich Merz said the quiet part out loud back in May: Germany intends to build the Bundeswehr into “the strongest conventional army in Europe,” pledging to give it “all the financial resources it needs.”

Five months later, the German chancellor aims to add the hardware to that ambition, according to new internal government documents seen by POLITICO.

The sprawling 39-page list lays out €377 billion in desired buys across land, air, sea, space and cyber. The document is a planning overview of arms purchases that will be spelled out in the German military’s 2026 budget, but many are longer-term purchases for which there is no clear time frame.

PUPPET MASTERS — Nothing about the sand-colored façade of the palazzo tucked behind Milan’s Duomo cathedral suggested that inside it a team of computer engineers were building a database to gather private and damaging information about Italy’s political elite — and use it to try to control them.

The platform, called Beyond, pulled together hundreds of thousands of records from state databases — including flagged financial transactions and criminal investigations — to create detailed profiles on politicians, business leaders and other prominent figures.

Police wiretaps recorded someone they identified as Samuele Calamucci, allegedly the technical mastermind of the group, boasting that the dossiers gave them the power to “screw over all of Italy.”

MAHA MIND-POWER — When Sarah Jones was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, she couldn’t help but dwell on the past: She began dissecting her meals, her exercise regimen and more. Meanwhile, the Make America Healthy Again movement is playing out online and in the government. Every social media scroll yields a new fad diet or supplement, all sustained by the movement’s core tenet of “mind-power” — that you can “become the captain of your own body and the master of your own future.” For Intelligencer, Jones discusses what her post-diagnosis reckoning has taught her about MAHA’s ethos.

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs.","WASHINGTON (CN) — Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had little to say Tuesday about reports that the Department of Homeland Security purged immigration enforcement chiefs in several U.S. cities as the Trump administration looks to supercharge its mass deportation campaign.

Both Republicans and Democrats were hesitant to weigh in on the staffing shake-up, which would see officials from U.S. Border Patrol replace the heads of Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, among other cities.

But at least one lawmaker speculated that the Homeland Security Department made the staffing changes to support what he called the White House’s “unrealistic” deportation quotas.

According to a report from the Washington Examiner, the agency last week removed five ICE field office chiefs and moved them to positions elsewhere in the country. In addition to reassigning the heads of immigration enforcement in Denver, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, the Homeland Security Department also removed ICE chiefs in Phoenix and San Diego.

The administration reportedly plans to replace most of the ousted immigration heads with senior staff from Border Patrol, though in Philadelphia, the vacant ICE role will be filled by an official from Homeland Security Investigations.

While the move to replace top ICE officials with Border Patrol — which has taken an aggressive approach to immigration enforcement under its chief, Gregory Bovino — is unprecedented, lawmakers largely claimed Tuesday that they didn’t have enough information to take a firm stance on the issue.

Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, a senior Republican member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, declined to comment to Courthouse News. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, another GOP lawmaker on the homeland security panel, said that he had seen reporting about the purges but that he didn’t “know enough” about the situation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed ignorance of the ICE leadership purge during a news conference Tuesday morning, telling Courthouse News that he had only just learned about the reports. He added that “some of these things get mis-portrayed.”

Democrats were similarly reticent to offer their thoughts. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy told Courthouse News that he had not yet been briefed and declined to offer any additional input.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a fellow Connecticut Democrat who also sits on the Homeland Security committee, posited that the staffing shake-up at ICE’s field offices was thanks to the immigration agency’s failure to meet the Trump administration’s “completely unrealistic” deportation quotas.

White House adviser Stephen Miller has long demanded that ICE arrest as many as 3,000 immigrants a day, or 1 million per year.

“This kind of executive action simply shows the moral bankruptcy of their policies,” said Blumenthal.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, did not directly respond to reports of the purge at ICE, saying instead that Americans were “understandably horrified” at the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.

“It’s our hope that, if there’s going to be a change in personnel, it’s actually to enact a more humane approach, rather than what we’ve seen in community after community in the country,” said Jeffries.

The Homeland Security Department has so far refused to confirm or deny reports that it had reassigned ICE field office chiefs. The agency’s assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, told Courthouse News in a statement Tuesday that it had “no personnel changes to announce right now.”

“This is one team, one fight,” McLaughlin wrote. “President Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary [Kristi] Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country.”

A spokesperson for the Border Patrol union did not return a request for comment.

News that Border Patrol officials may be taking over for ICE in several major cities comes as Bovino on Tuesday was dressed down by a federal judge over his failure to comply with a court order blocking federal agents from deploying tear gas and other riot control weapons against protesters, journalists and other bystanders in Chicago.

The judge demanded that Bovino, who has personally participated in the federal crackdown on the Windy City and has himself deployed tear gas on demonstrators, appear before her daily to report new incidents. Bovino admitted to the court that he did not use a body-worn camera and agreed to begin wearing one.

The Trump administration has in recent weeks sent federal agents and National Guard troops into several U.S. cities, including Chicago, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The White House has framed the move as an effort to crack down on crime and illegal immigration. Some federal courts have ruled that the president’s deployment of National Guard troops violates federal law.

According to recent statistics, more than 70% of people held by ICE have no prior criminal convictions.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/courthousenews.com/2025/10/immigration-ice-police-jacket.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-28 16:56:59.811201

That order came Tuesday after Bovino testified before federal Judge Sara Ellis on questions surrounding the use of chemical agents by immigration enforcement officers in the city and suburbs.

Bovino, a chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was recorded on video throwing a cannister of tear gas Thursday during a clash between agents and protesters in the Little Village neighborhood.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Bovino was struck in the head by an object prior to the recorded incident, but it still raised questions about the tactics of officers after Ellis had issued a temporary restraining order aimed at curtailing the use of chemical agents during enforcement operations.

Ellis had also issued an order that all immigration agents in Chicago wear body cameras during operations.

During Tuesday’s hearing, Ellis ordered Bovino to appear in federal court in Chicago every day at 6 p.m. to report how operations proceeded in the city and suburbs during the preceding 24 hours.

Local

She also ordered Bovino to turn over agents’ use of force reports from September 2 forward, and to turn in body camera footage by Friday as part of that reporting.

Border Patrol officials have previously testified before Ellis that the use of chemical agents in multiple incidents was justified, alleging protesters were throwing objects at agents.

Last week, Ellis extended questioning of Bovino from two hours to five because she wanted to hear about agents’ recent use of force in the city’s Mexican enclave of Little Village. During a separate enforcement operation last week in Little Village and the adjacent suburb of Cicero, at least eight people, including four U.S. citizens, were detained before protesters gathered at the scene, local officials said.

Silva-Renteria said anxiety among holders of citizenship papers or a cherished green card, as well as those in the United States without lawful status, was growing.

“It’s very, very difficult to just see how separation is happening, the cruelty that is happening,” she said. “There’s just this fear that is happening across the board. The fear that we’re facing … it’s not only for the undocumented population.”

During a gathering of Kansas Democrats on Saturday in Wichita, Silva-Renteria said advocacy on behalf of immigrant communities might in the future be labeled subversive by the federal government and lead to legal challenges to her naturalization. She is executive director of the International Rescue Committee in Wichita.

“I think what I’m doing right now, it can be seen as me fighting against the government,” Silva-Renteria said. “It is a fear, even for someone like me who has been a naturalized citizen for more than 20 years. Before, it was never a question. I could share my story all over the place and I could feel safe. But now, I don’t.”

Silva-Renteria walked across the border from Mexico with her mother at age 10, received permanent resident status in the United States as a teenager and earned a master’s degree in social work at Wichita State University. She is a cofounder, with Wichita immigration attorney Sarah Balderas, of the Kansas Immigration Coalition. Its mission is to safeguard the dignity and well-being of immigrants statewide.

Risk of assumptions

Balderas, who teaches immigration law at Washburn University, said the political climate in regard to immigration could prompt people to insert themselves into enforcement activities by mistakenly alleging people were in the United States without legal authority.

“You see someone who is from another country speaking a different language, you can’t automatically assume they don’t have status,” she said.

She said general public knowledge of immigration law was so deficient that most people didn’t appreciate a person could hold a temporary visa, be part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program or hold permanent residency status without being proficient in English.

Reading and writing ability enters the picture in a federal regulatory sense when applying for citizenship, she said.

“There are so many misconceptions about immigration, and it’s simply because of a lack of education. Nobody talks about this stuff. We just hear what we hear in the news or we hear what we hear from friends, and it’s really complicated,” Balderas said.

She said the reality was there were millions of people in the United States who would never qualify for lawful permanent resident status, a prerequisite for applying for U.S. citizenship.

“You have a typical situation where you have mom and dad entering the country illegally together,” she said. “They came over 21 years ago because — guess what — their U.S. citizen-born kid is turning 21 and they’re like, ‘Hell, yes, our 21-year-old kid is going to apply for us.’ The problem is that they both, mom and dad, entered illegally. If each of them do not have a spouse or a parent with lawful permanent resident status or U.S. citizenship, they will never be eligible to become a lawful permanent resident.”

Politics of reform

Balderas said U.S. immigration law was designed to keep people out of the country. She said Congress, which is responsible for formation of immigration law, failed to make modest changes that could unclog the immigration system to better accommodate people in the United States without legal status who worked hard, paid taxes and avoided criminal entanglement.

She said the answer in the United States wasn’t debate about a politically fraught amnesty program.

“Everyone’s angry at President Trump. I get it. He is enforcing the immigration laws to the fullest extent possible,” Balderas said. “But we are going to be in this situation every four years if Congress doesn’t make changes in the immigration law. Politics is what’s holding these people hostage.”

U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican serving the Wichita area, has repeatedly praised the Trump administration for securing the southern border with Mexico. He said U.S. Border Patrol data indicated illegal crossing was at the lowest level since 1970s.

“President Trump promised to secure our southern border, and he has delivered on his promise,” Estes said. “In fiscal year 2025, Border Patrol captured 238,000 illegal immigrants. When Joe Biden was president, 2.2 million illegal immigrants were apprehended at the southern border.”

In September, the Trump administration reported elevated enforcement actions had led to deportation of 400,000 people and the voluntary departure of an estimated 1.6 million people from the United States.

Silva-Renteria said she worked primarily with people from Mexico, India, Vietnam, China, Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Latin American nations.

In Kansas, an estimated 116,000 people had at least one immigrant parent and 74,000 of these individuals earned the right to vote in elections.

“Something very important, especially for those that are elected officials, pay attention to the number of immigrants that now have voting rights,” Silva-Renteria said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sarah-Balderas-2-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:57:24.557943

The man is then lifted up off the ground and put into the backseat of a black car.

""They manhandled him trying to get him out of the car,"" witness Lizzie Eifler says. ""This poor man's face was smashed into the pavement and they would not get off of him.""

Pritzker signed Senate Bill 2487 into law, amending the Illinois Human Rights Act (“IHRA”), 775 ILCS 5/7A-102. Among other reforms going into effect on January 1, 2026, the legislation fundamentally changes how the Illinois Department of Human Rights (“IDHR” or the “Department”) processes charges of discrimination.

Most notably, the law eliminates mandatory fact-finding conferences. For decades, these conferences were a hallmark of the Department’s investigative approach, giving complainants, respondents, and the agency a chance to gather information early, test the strength of claims, and sometimes even prompt informal resolution. Their removal will change how employers, employees, and practitioners must navigate discrimination charges in Illinois.

Fact-Finding Conferences Generally

A fact-finding conference is essentially an informal, investigative meeting in which the Department brings the parties together to discuss the allegations in the charge of discrimination. The investigator can question witnesses, review documentary evidence, and attempt to clarify disputed facts. While not a mediation, these conferences often create opportunities for early settlement discussions. For employers, they also offer a critical chance to gain insight into the complainant’s allegations and to present documents and testimony before the Department issues a determination.

From Mandatory to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

Prior to Senate Bill 2487, fact-finding conferences were mandatory for nearly every charge of discrimination. An employer could only avoid this requirement if the charge was dismissed early, the Director issued a determination of substantial evidence, or the parties voluntarily agreed to waive the conference in writing. Nonattendance without good cause could result in dismissal of the charge or default judgment.

With the passage of the amendment, fact-finding conferences will be optional and occur only in limited circumstances.

If both the complainant and the respondent wish to have a fact-finding conference, they must make that request in writing within ninety (90) days of the charge being filed. Importantly, agreeing to a conference also means agreeing to extend the Department’s investigative deadline by an additional 120 days, giving the Department more time to complete its review. Even if the parties do not request one, the Department still has discretion to convene a conference on its own if it believes doing so would help clarify the case or resolve factual disputes.

The procedural rules surrounding attendance remain in place. If a conference is scheduled, the parties must appear. A complainant who fails to attend without good cause risks dismissal of the charge, while an employer who fails to appear can be held in default.

Rationale Behind the Switch to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

The legislature cited efficiency and backlog reduction as central reasons for eliminating mandatory fact-finding conferences. The Department has long struggled with processing times, and fact-finding conferences have historically been resource-intensive.

The amendment also brings Illinois more in line with federal practice, where charges of discrimination are typically investigated through written position statements, document requests, and interviews.

[Read: Are Large ICE Raids Coming Back to Orange County?]

Since the summer, dozens of residents and activists have shown up to several city council meetings demanding elected officials take a stance against the immigration crackdown and launch an immigrant aid fund to support Garden Grove families impacted by the raids.

For months a majority of city council members have avoided adopting any resolution in response to the federal immigration crackdown or starting a fund to help immigrants with rent, food or utility bills like in Anaheim, Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and potentially in Fullerton.

That might change at Tuesday’s 6:30 p.m. Garden Grove City Council meeting where officials are expected to consider adopting a resolution that calls on law enforcement agencies to respect civil liberties and would create an online resource hub on the city website.

To read the resolution, click here.

Councilwoman Ariana Arestegui, who requested the resolution, said it has been an “uphill battle” to get a majority of her colleagues on the dais to respond to the immigration sweeps impacting local families.

“Garden Grove is not unique in what it’s facing, but what has been unique is that we’ve been so slow to respond to an issue that so many of our regional partners are doing their best to address,” she said in a Monday phone interview.

“We’ve had so many residents come to us since the beginning of the federal law enforcement presence in our area, and the message is resoundingly clear – our residents want us to keep them informed.”

In August, Arestegui brought forth a resolution reaffirming that local police officers do not participate in immigration enforcement and recognizing the fear felt by residents amid an increased federal law enforcement presence but a majority of her colleagues voted to table it.

Arestegui said the resource hub would help provide important information to immigrant families as well as businesses owners impacted by the raids.

She also said whether Garden Grove launches a legal aid fund or rent assistance program for immigrants will be up to her colleagues on the council.

“Our community has expressed that that is an interest. My question to the other folks on my council is that an action that you are also willing to take? I cannot do this on my own, and I would need further conversations with my colleagues and my city staff to even see if that is a capability for us as a city,” Arestegui said.

Other elected officials in Orange County have called on local police to cooperate and work with federal immigration agents – a move that would violate California’s Sanctuary State law.

Garden Grove City Councilman Joe DoVinh recently received backlash for comments he made in Vietnamese on a radio show calling on police to cooperate with immigration enforcement officers and threatening to fire the police chief himself.

Arestegui said no council member has the power to individually fire the police chief.

In a news release after the nationwide No King protests earlier this month, DoVinh said there has been a politicization of Trump’s policies on immigration in Garden Grove and the millions that joined the protests do not speak for all Americans.

“While we strongly support law enforcement, we also call for the Equal Protection of all immigrants, documented or not– this is basic human rights that need to be respected in a civil society like US,” reads the Oct. 19 news release

DoVinh said in an email Monday he would speak to the issue at Tuesday’s meeting.

The proposed resolution reiterates that Garden Grove police officers do not conduct immigration enforcement.

In Garden Grove, about 49% of residents or roughly 84,000 people are foreign born. Of that, about 31,000 of residents are not U.S. citizens and 53,000 are naturalized citizens, according to the census.

Over 42% of the population in Garden Grove is Asian and 37% is Latino.

According to the USC Equity Research Institute, over 210,000 people in Orange County are undocumented.

Under the proposed resolution, city staff would be directed to identify immigration aid services and programs like legal aid and know your rights information and maintain a list of them on the city’s website.

Anaheim, Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Santa Ana and Stanton have all launched similar informational hubs on their websites.

Staff would also be directed to create emergency preparedness packets for families impacted by the raids and city officials would commit to working with nonprofits and community organizations to identify ways to better support residents amid the immigration crackdown.

Arestegui said as immigration enforcement sweeps spread in the city, the pressure from residents on elected officials in Garden Grove to respond amplifies.

She adds she is optimistic that the majority of city council members will support her resolution this time.

“The evidence that our community needs help is becoming incontrovertible,” Arestegui said.

“To turn the other way would be irresponsible for us.”

We’re also seeing people leaving within the human resources section of the Justice Department.
Terry Gerton Right, and you mentioned that usually these folks stay, regardless of the party that’s in control of the presidency.
Terry Gerton Were the majority of these DOJ departures as a result of the DRP?
Terry Gerton And DOJ also has a pretty large responsibility for enforcing tax laws, right?","Suzanne Monyak We found that more than a third of career managers at the Justice Department have left this year since the start of the second Trump administration. This is pretty unusual, because leaders who are hired through the career process tend to stay through political administrations. They’re not political appointees. They stay, sometimes for decades even, with the government.

Terry Gerton So what kind of roles are we talking about here? Lawyers, managers, all of the above?

Suzanne Monyak A mix of both. We used a federal directory posted by the Office of Personnel Management under government transparency law that included more than 300 career leaders at the Justice Department. They include some members of the Senior Executive Service and other management positions. Some of them are lawyers, some of them are not.

Terry Gerton Are there particular sectors in the Department of Justice that were more impacted by these departures than others?

Suzanne Monyak Yes, even though it was about a third overall at least, we saw more than three quarters of, for example, the civil rights division, those managers had left during the second administration. This, I think, is a reflection of how hard of a pivot that division has taken under this administration to align with the second Trump administration’s ideological priorities.

Terry Gerton And what about immigration and environmental divisions? They seem to be pretty significantly impacted as well.

Suzanne Monyak Yes, we really saw a lot of the attrition in divisions that affected policy areas that the administration has really targeted. So the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is the component that houses the immigration courts, and the environmental division, which enforces environmental laws across the country, lost about half of its career leaders, at least.

Terry Gerton We certainly hear a lot of talk in the press and in the political cycles about the Department of Justice. But what exactly do these folks do on a day-to-day basis? Are they defending the government? Are they prosecuting? What is their day-to-day role?

Suzanne Monyak It really varies. We looked at more than 300 roles across the department. So, yes, there are attorneys who are in management roles, maybe overseeing litigators. We’re also seeing people leaving within the human resources section of the Justice Department. So it really just runs the gamut in the types of roles that they are. But what they have in common is that they were all appointed through the career process. And that’s a merits based process. And a lot of those people have many years, if not decades, of experience each.

Terry Gerton Right, and you mentioned that usually these folks stay, regardless of the party that’s in control of the presidency. So what makes this cycle of departure so unusual?

Suzanne Monyak Well, that’s exactly it. Most people, a lot of people, when they joined the federal government, that’s a career for life for them. And some of the people that I spoke to for this story, they never saw themselves leaving at this time or retiring early. They saw this as where they were going to spend the rest of their careers. And then when this administration took over, deferred resignation offers came out and some of the divisions just had to take a very different stance than they had taken in the past, and they were being asked to do work they hadn’t been asked to do in the past that really just represented a departure from the work that had been done previously. And there’s just been an environment under this administration to really push out federal workers. And I think that’s something that administration officials have been pretty open about, that they want to get deep state actors out of government, as they describe them, and they want to do a fresh start or a redirect. And so we really did see that across the Justice Department and across the government more broadly, as people took those offers, were pushed out and left.

Terry Gerton Were the majority of these DOJ departures as a result of the DRP?

Suzanne Monyak It’s hard to say exactly why everyone left. Some people will disclose why they left in post. Some people do not. Quite a few were from the deferred resignation offer, absolutely. Two of those went out this year, which allowed federal government employees to remain on paid leave through the end of the fiscal year, which ended at the end of September. But we also saw people who were fired. We saw people who left voluntarily, technically, but after being forcibly reassigned or demoted. Some people, career managers with many years of experience, were put in a task force called the Sanctuary Cities Working Group, which ended up being known as a task force that didn’t do meaningful work, at least in the view of a lot of the people there, and now has no one working there. None of the people reassigned there are still with the department.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Suzanne Monyak. She’s a reporter at Bloomberg Law. So, Suzanne, with this significant departure, a third of the Department of Justice leaders, but concentrated in some particular divisions, what happens to DOJ’s functionality and effectiveness? Like, this seems to represent a significant loss of institutional memory. How will that impact how DOJ does its work?

Suzanne Monyak That’s a great question. And I think that’s one that a lot of former officials, a concern that they raised in the interviews for this story. It’s absolutely a significant loss of expertise and institutional memory. One role that career people will really have throughout the government is that when political administrations change, you’ll see new political appointees come in. And maybe they have experience doing this work at the career level, maybe they don’t. And having a career staff already in place, knowing how things work, knowing what to do, I’m told can really sort of ease that transition as the politicals come in and out as administrations change. Certainly, I think with this amount of loss, they’re going to be doing hiring. But until those new people are in place, we are, I cannot help but imagine that there will be some compromise of functionality to the Justice Department.

Terry Gerton Well, you mentioned the expectation that they would be hiring, and yet the federal government remains under a hiring freeze across the board. Has DOJ received any exceptions for that to begin hiring to replace these folks?

Suzanne Monyak There have been exceptions made. We’ve seen hiring, for example, at the civil rights division, the one that lost more than 76% of its career managers. It also lost a number of its lower level attorneys as well. And we have already seen hiring in that division. The political leader heading it has been posting on social media, we’re hiring, we’re hiring. So we are seeing some enthusiasm from administration officials to kind of bring those people on. So yes, there have been exceptions made.

Terry Gerton We’ve been talking here about the divisions that were most significantly impacted by departures, but were there others that weren’t, so that their workload kind of continued on?

Suzanne Monyak Yes, we saw lower levels of departures in the criminal division, for example. I think that one was slightly less affected. At the civil division, whose attorneys handle a lot of the litigation against the Trump administration’s federal policies, they lost at least about a quarter of their career managers. So while we did see pretty high shares across the board, there were certainly some that were below that one third we saw overall.

Terry Gerton And DOJ also has a pretty large responsibility for enforcing tax laws, right? They have a tax division. How were they affected?

Suzanne Monyak Yes. The tax division lost at least a third of its career managers, so right around that across the board point. The national security division lost about half. And I should also mention that these are really all minimum numbers. These were departures that we were able to confirm and be sure of, but it’s likely an undercount because there are people who would still be on the website, even though they’ve left and people are leaving every day. So in between when I report the story and it publishes, we might even have had a few more departures.

Terry Gerton And so as you talk to folks either in or recently in the Department of Justice, what’s their takeaway? What does this mean for the effectiveness of the department and its future?

Suzanne Monyak I mean, I think there’s definitely a lot of concerns, both about its ability to do its work and about morale across the department. One of the appeals of working in the government is having a stable job that you can spend years and years doing. And that ideal, I think, has really been eroded under this administration. And that’s not specific to the Justice Department. We’re seeing that everywhere. And I also think there’s been a lot of concerns about politicization at the Justice Department, as we’re seeing a lot of career people leaving, people who’ve worked through multiple political administrations from both parties who, their goal is just to do their job and enforce or argue the laws as they see them, or as they’re supposed to. We see with more political people coming in, career people coming out, I think that just kind of fuels those concerns that this department might be more politicized under this administration than it has in the past.

Terry Gerton And the technicalities of the cases that the Department of Justice handles are pretty significant. So it’s not like you can just walk in from a private sector commercial firm and understand the roles of the Department of Justice, right?

Suzanne Monyak Absolutely. A lot of people at DOJ have talked about how, what they do, it is a niche expertise. It is something that you have to learn how to do that, just as you said, working at a big firm would not necessarily, you wouldn’t come in knowing exactly what to do, hitting the ground running always. And so there is something to be said for having had that experience in the government, for having argued in court for the government for years and know what you’re doing before you, say, become a manager. So, you see that really from the top down. When people lose their managers, it it affects morale at the lower levels as well.

Terry Gerton And do you think in the long run, is this likely to affect the success of the DOJ in the cases that it does bring before the courts?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Trump_Justice_Department_47916-scaled-e1743102026706.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 19:01:56.718099

The judge’s warning is the latest example of Trump officials’ incendiary extrajudicial comments being used against the Department of Justice (DOJ) in high-profile criminal and civil cases.
Crenshaw also noted that Bondi made extrajudicial statements while officially announcing charges against Abrego Garcia in June.
The judge said despite the statements, he was confident Abrego Garcia would ultimately receive a fair trial because media coverage of the case has “gradually subsided” both nationally and in Tennessee.
Abrego Garcia’s lawyers moved to subpoena Blanche and other senior DOJ officials to testify at the vindictive prosecution hearing, which is set to take place next week.","A federal judge censured top Trump administration officials for making several out-of-court statements against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who the government wrongly sent to a Salvadoran megaprison before returning him to the U.S. to face immigrant smuggling charges in Nashville.

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said many prejudicial comments from Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other senior officials violated a local court rule and threaten Abrego Garcia’s right to a fair trial.

The judge’s warning is the latest example of Trump officials’ incendiary extrajudicial comments being used against the Department of Justice (DOJ) in high-profile criminal and civil cases.

“Government employees have made extrajudicial statements that are troubling, especially where many of them are exaggerated if not simply inaccurate,” Crenshaw wrote in an opinion Monday.

“These statements made allegations regarding Abrego’s ‘character or reputation’ and expressed government officials’ views on Abrego’s ‘guilt or innocence,’” the judge added.

Among several examples, Crenshaw highlighted Noem describing Abrego Garcia in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) press release as being an “MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,” an assertion that other DHS officials repeated in other public releases.

Crenshaw also noted that Bondi made extrajudicial statements while officially announcing charges against Abrego Garcia in June.

Stopping short of issuing a gag order, Crenshaw instead instructed prosecutors to inform DOJ and DHS employees — including Bondi and Noem — of a local court rule limiting official comments on ongoing criminal cases.

The judge said despite the statements, he was confident Abrego Garcia would ultimately receive a fair trial because media coverage of the case has “gradually subsided” both nationally and in Tennessee.

Earlier this month, Crenshaw found that Abrego Garcia showed there was a “realistic likelihood” that the DOJ is vindictively prosecuting him for asserting his legal rights in his successful civil lawsuit challenging his removal to El Salvador.

The most telling statement, Crenshaw said, came from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said on Fox News in June that the government only started investigating Abrego Garcia after a judge ruled that the Trump administration did not have the authority to remove him from the U.S.

Crenshaw said Abrego Garcia was entitled to discovery against the Trump administration and a hearing in which he can present evidence on why his case should be tossed for vindictive and selective prosecution.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers moved to subpoena Blanche and other senior DOJ officials to testify at the vindictive prosecution hearing, which is set to take place next week. However, the DOJ has asked Crenshaw to quash those subpoenas.

Separately, DOJ attorneys told a U.S. district judge in Maryland that the Trump administration would seek to deport Abrego Garcia to Liberia by the end of the week — even if doing so would collapse the department’s criminal case against him in Tennessee.

Liberia is just the latest in a series of African countries the Trump administration has designated as possible destinations for Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who has lived in the U.S. for years with his wife and children — all of whom are American citizens.

The litigation started shortly after a New York Times article in early 2020 highlighted the company's alleged practices involving facial recognition technology and its growing list of government and private clients. According to the lawsuit, Clearview built an extensive database of face images by scraping photos from publicly available websites and recording individuals' facial features.

The plaintiffs proceeded with claims based on statutes and the common law from Illinois, California, New York, and Virginia, with the strongest claims under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. As the case progressed, it became evident that, although Clearview was a highly valued company, it lacked the liquid assets to pay a large lump-sum settlement or even sustain its ongoing defense. Given these circumstances, the parties devised a novel settlement structure that granted class members a 23 percent stake in Clearview. This settlement stake was valued at approximately $51.75 million, based on Clearview’s January 2024 valuation of $225 million. Four triggering events could activate the payment of the settlement equity stake to the class members:

The occurrence of an initial public offering.

The occurrence of a liquidation event, such as a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of Clearview's assets.

A payment by Clearview of an amount equal to 17 percent of Clearview's recognized revenue for the period beginning on the date of final settlement approval and ending with the election of this option, which will expire on September 30, 2027. The recognized revenue will be determined according to recognized Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

The amount that the Settlement Class will receive if it elects to sell its right to receive the Settlement Stake payment.

The settlement class has the right to choose which payout event they deem most advantageous through their chosen Settlement Master. Through the settlement agreement, the Settlement Master was granted certain powers to protect the class members' interests, including the following:

The right to inspect Clearview's books and records upon providing reasonable notice.

The right to request and receive biannual interviews with Clearview's management team.

The right to receive information regarding the price and terms of any secondary sales of Clearview

The right to sell the equity stake in Clearview if deemed in the best interest of the class.

Although the Court approved the settlement, questions remain. Because of the liquidated damages provisions of the Biometric Information Privacy Act, there are concerns about whether a settlement with an indefinite fund value accurately measures damages for BIPA violations. On the surface, it may appear that equity in a company is not “liquidated damages” within the meaning of the BIPA. However, the court did not address this question. Rather, the court focused on the lack of injunctive relief provided by the settlement and the fairness of the settlement.

Recent BIPA amendments, which limited the liquidated damages available to plaintiffs, seem to have reduced the threat of significant awards that might have prompted a “Clearview-like” settlement. In any event, for parties facing potentially overwhelming damages from BIPA litigation, the Clearview settlement offers a way for plaintiffs to secure compensation while preventing defendants from being overwhelmed by significant class actions.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.9985_1458.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:57:35.609767

The move aims to attract younger recruits but has drawn widespread condemnation for its tone and message.

(Source: X/DHS)

A fresh row erupted on social media after the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted an image comparing undocumented immigrants to the parasitic alien race known as “the Flood” from the popular video game series Halo. The move came just days after the White House shared its own AI-generated Halo meme featuring President Donald Trump as Master Chief, Halo's main protagonist. This angered gamers and human rights advocates alike. The post appeared early Monday morning on DHS’s official X account. The image showed Xbox’s iconic character, Master Chief, standing atop a Warthog vehicle with the Halo ring world in the background. The caption read, “Finishing this fight,” referencing the famous line from Halo 2 and the marketing slogan for Halo 3. Below it, text reading “Destroy the Flood” appeared beside a link to a recruitment page for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. The message was immediately slammed as “dehumanising” for likening immigrants to the Flood, a fictional parasitic species that infects and consumes all intelligent life in the game’s universe. Critics noted that this comparison echoed some of history’s darkest propaganda. As one commentator put it, “Comparing immigrants in the US to a parasitic alien life form… is rooted in the worst of human history.” The Halo row began on Saturday when GameStop shared a humorous post announcing the “end of console wars” after Microsoft revealed that Halo: Combat Evolved would be released on PlayStation 5 next year. The White House then replied to GameStop’s post with an AI-generated image of Trump dressed as Master Chief, captioned “Power to the Players.” GameStop later escalated the exchange by retweeting the White House’s image alongside another meme showing a bloated JD Vance, Trump’s vice president, depicted as Cortana, Master Chief’s AI companion in the game. However, the situation soured after DHS jumped into the meme war with its “Destroy the Flood” post. Social media users accused the administration of using video game imagery to promote anti-immigrant propaganda and normalise cruelty through humour. “It’s ‘the police using The Punisher logo’ levels of media illiteracy,” one user wrote on Reddit. Microsoft, which owns the Halo franchise, has not issued any official comment. One observer summed it up, “It’s a bold strategy for an agency hoping to look heroic, but it seems ICE missed the part where the good guys fight to protect all of humanity.”

Washington, D.C. – Today, Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee Ranking Member Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) demanded answers from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on why their agencies have prioritized checking off the wish lists of oil, timber, and mining companies during the ongoing Republican government shutdown while halting critical public safety, wildfire prevention, and disaster preparedness work.

The members wrote that while millions of working people face a loss of services because of “Congressional Republicans’ inability to garner the votes to open the government even when they control both houses of Congress,” the Trump administration has kept operations for oil, timber, and mining running at full speed.

The letter follows reports that, under the Trump administration’s orders, Interior and Agriculture have kept permitting offices open for drilling, mining, and logging while furloughing staff who support wildfire response, park operations, and disaster preparedness.

The lawmakers detail how the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture have continued issuing new oil and gas drilling permits—more than 300 since the shutdown began—while advancing controversial mining projects such as the Ambler Road in Alaska and the Libby Mine in Montana. At the same time, the agencies have held coal lease sales, closed visitor centers, paused prescribed burns, and furloughed critical wildfire support staff.

They have cited a so-called “national energy emergency” to justify keeping fossil fuel operations running, even as they halted major renewable energy projects like Nevada’s 6.2-gigawatt solar development.

The members warn that “continuing to prioritize activities benefitting extractive industries over activities supporting the protection of life and property represents an abandonment of basic agency responsibilities and potentially violates the Antideficiency Act.” That law, they explain, “prohibits federal agencies from incurring obligations or accepting voluntary services during a lapse in appropriations except in narrowly defined emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.”

The members also raised concerns about risks to public safety, noting that the shutdown has “impeded your agencies’ ability to fight wildfire, respond to other natural disasters, and protect our national parks.”

They warned that by directing personnel to continue routine fossil fuel activities, “your agencies have expanded the emergency exception beyond its intent to cover ‘ongoing, regular functions’ of government administration,” which “GAO precedent emphasizes agencies cannot lawfully direct staff to perform in the absence of appropriations or authorization.”

The lawmakers requested documents describing which activities and services have continued during the shutdown, the criteria used to make those determinations, and all communications regarding the designation of oil, mining, and timber production from public lands as “emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.”

Zoom out: Fox News reported that the leadership changes come as there's a split between Trump administration officials.

Sources told Fox that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wants broader arrest priorities, while White House border czar Tom Homan and ICE acting Director Todd Lyons prefer to prioritize arrests of undocumented people with criminal records.

But Noem's media interviews and public statements have often focused on targeting the ""worst of the worst"" and people with criminal records.

Homan has said in several interviews that ""if you're in the country illegally, you're on the table"" for arrest and deportation. One source said Lyons is also equally committed to broad enforcement.

What they're saying: ICE's deputy director Madison Sheahan told Fox News on Tuesday that there's ""not a split in leadership.""

""Sec. Noem, President Trump, Director Todd Lyons are all in lock step to be able to deliver for the American people,"" Sheahan said. ""Our job is to go out and target criminal illegal aliens... We are one team and this is one fight to deliver for the American people.

The intrigue: Replacing ICE leadership with Border Patrol is expected to increase the number of arrests in part because ICE's arrests are typically targeted.

Border Patrol has been behind more indiscriminate operations, including raids at Home Depots or other work sites.

Targeted arrests require more surveillance and planning.

Flashback: In May, roughly a week after White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller set a 3,000 arrest goal target, ICE swapped out two of its top leaders in Washington — ousting the heads of Enforcement and Removal Operations and Homeland Security Investigations.

In February, reportedly due to lagging daily arrest totals, ICE's acting director and deputy director were also both replaced.",https://images.axios.com/cQk4LRM59fcmzeIredtNtW-b_2k=/0x238:4000x2488/1366x768/2025/10/28/1761671178142.jpeg,N,,2025-10-28 13:58:01.999920

In just two days, more than 26,000 people have been forced to flee the city following intense fighting, according to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM).

IOM is dispatching emergency shelter items, including kits and tents, which are scheduled to arrive within a few days to Tawila village, a major centre in Darfur receiving displaced persons from El Fasher.

Reports of violations of international humanitarian law and abuses of human rights in El Fasher are deeply concerning, including indiscriminate attacks, targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, gender-based violence, and ethnically motivated attacks against displaced populations.

Scenes emerging from El Fasher are horrific. Thousands of families are once again displaced due to violence and forced to walk for days under the scorching sun. Mothers are carrying infants, and children are helping elderly relatives who can barely stand.

They are facing high insecurity, movement restrictions, protection risks, theft and assaults with most having nothing left: no food, no shelter, no medicine, and no certainty of where they will be safe next. People arrive in small villages around El Fasher exhausted, hungry, and terrified.

This surge in displacement is amplifying the already dire needs. Shelter, food, health care, clean water, and protection are urgently needed. IOM’s DTM programme continues to provide critical information and relevant data on needs and displacement trends to help humanitarian actors deliver evidence-based responses. Yet access remains extremely limited, and needs are rising faster than aid can reach people.

Deportation could moot the criminal proceedings.
Whether and when the administration can remove him again is the subject of separate pending litigation in Maryland.
The rebuke came Monday in one of two rulings issued by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in the Middle District of Tennessee.
(Schrader’s resignation was reportedly prompted by the case being pursued for political reasons.)","Litigation over Kilmar Abrego Garcia continues to dog the Trump administration, which illegally sent him to El Salvador in March, then said it would never bring him back him to the U.S., then returned him to the U.S. and now has to prove that the criminal case it had waiting for him upon his return isn’t unconstitutionally vindictive. All the while, the administration is working to remove him from the country again, possibly to the West African nation of Liberia, to which he has no apparent ties.

Deportation could moot the criminal proceedings. Whether and when the administration can remove him again is the subject of separate pending litigation in Maryland.

But so long as Abrego remains in the U.S., the Trump Justice Department is stuck having to prove the Tennessee criminal case, which the government seemed to develop in an effort to save face when it finally complied with court orders for his return in June. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Abrego “has landed in the United States to face justice.” She said, “This is what American justice looks like.”

Now, remarks from Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have drawn a rebuke from the judge presiding over the criminal case, in which federal prosecutors allege that Abrego illegally transported undocumented immigrants. He has pleaded not guilty. The rebuke came Monday in one of two rulings issued by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in the Middle District of Tennessee. In granting Abrego’s motion to require DOJ and DHS officials to refrain from making “prejudicial extrajudicial statements,” Crenshaw wrote that “government employees have made extrajudicial statements that are troubling, especially where many of them are exaggerated if not simply inaccurate.”

The Barack Obama appointee highlighted statements from Bondi and Noem that he said appeared to violate a court rule prohibiting extrajudicial statements (that is, those made outside of court) that have a “substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing” the defendant’s right to a fair trial. He cited Noem’s statement that Abrego is an “MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,” and Bondi’s statement that Abrego played “a significant role in an alien smuggling ring” that “was his full-time job,” and that he “was a smuggler of humans and children and women.”

Crenshaw issued an order accompanying his ruling that puts DOJ and DHS employees “on notice” of the court rule against making such statements. He warned that any violations “may be subject to sanctions.” So unless Bondi, Noem or any other officials make it a point to test the judge’s order, nothing more may come of it.

‘Not an ordinary case’

The judge’s other order Monday gets closer to the substance of the case and how it will proceed, specifically concerning Abrego’s bid to dismiss the charges on the grounds that they’re unconstitutionally vindictive. Ahead of a hearing on the subject set for next week, Crenshaw noted that the defendant has “established a reasonable likelihood that his prosecution was motivated, at least in part, in retaliation for him exercising his constitutional rights in his Maryland immigration case.”

The judge conceded that in an “ordinary case,” the government would be right to shield documents that reveal internal motivations behind prosecutions. But he wrote that this “is not an ordinary case.”

The judge issued an order accompanying that ruling to say that he’ll review certain materials himself before deciding what exactly Abrego can use in his attempt to prove vindictiveness. Crenshaw gave the government until noon Wednesday to give him evidence including, among other things, all documents reflecting government motivations behind the charging decision, as well as documents related to Ben Schrader, the former chief of the criminal division of the Tennessee office that brought the case. (Schrader’s resignation was reportedly prompted by the case being pursued for political reasons.) In a previous filing, the DOJ said Schrader had drafted a memo detailing why he wouldn’t bring the case, but the DOJ has argued that such evidence is “not properly subject to disclosure.”

Among the officials whom Abrego wants to subpoena for the upcoming hearing is Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the government’s attempt to quash the subpoena is being litigated this week.

These motions are generally difficult for defendants to win, though, as Crenshaw observed, this isn’t an “ordinary case.” But what “American justice looks like” at the moment is the administration having to justify how it brought it in the first place.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251028-pam-bondi-abrego-garcia-zz-568555.jpg",N,,2025-10-28 14:57:41.297478

Tuesday morning, the school district sent a message to all staff and families to offer counseling services, Sluis said.","Dozens of protesters remained outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Durango on Tuesday morning, after demonstrating through the night over reports that federal agents had detained two children and their father on the way to school.

The children, ages 12 and 15, and their father were taken Monday morning by ICE agents who pulled them over near a mobile home park at the edge of town, said Enrique Orozco-Perez, executive director of Compañeros, Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center.

A legal representative is working with the family on their asylum case and it remains active, Orozco-Perez said.

“Our legal representative went to the ICE office and presented the paperwork. ICE refused the paperwork and refused to give up the kids,” he said. “At a minimum, we were asking for the children and to be reunited with their mother.”

Fernando Jaramillo Solano, his 12-year-old daughter, Jana Michel Jaramillo Patiño and 15-year-old son Kewin Daniel Patiño Bustamante are asylum seekers from Colombia who have lived in Colorado for more than 18 months, Compañeros said in a letter to Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper posted on social media Tuesday morning.

None of the detained family members have a criminal record or history of non-compliance with ICE reporting requirements, the center said.

“We respectfully request that your offices contact ICE immediately to advocate for the release of Mr. Jaramillo and his two minor children while their asylum case proceeds. The family poses no flight risk and has substantial community support and housing in place,” the center said.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment when asked about the reported arrests on the phone Tuesday morning. An email with questions was not immediately returned.

About 60 to 70 demonstrators remained outside the building, at 32 Sheppard Dr., chanting “Let the kids go!” Orozco-Perez said. Orozco-Perez, who works directly with immigrant communities in Durango, is in Minneapolis for personal business, but is receiving live updates from people at the protest, he said.

“Causing good trouble,” he said. “Everything legal, everything followed by the Constitution, freedom of speech.”

About 7 a.m. Monday, Compañeros received a report that one of its members was pulled over on the side of the road by masked people wearing police vests, he said. Two people from the center’s Rapid Response Network went to the area to document ICE activity.

“They were detaining a gentleman who kept screaming in Spanish that his kids are in the back of the car. When our volunteers started asking about the kids, they were able to find out that their mother lived near there and that because of the mother’s status, she too was afraid to go over there,” Orozco-Perez said.

ICE refused to let the children go with the representatives from the resource center and instead handcuffed them and placed them inside the back of the car with their father, he said.

Protesters gathered outside the building at 11 a.m. Monday and swelled to 200, he said. People took shifts, in groups of at least 50, to keep vigil through the night.

On Monday night, a legal representative from Compañeros received a call from the children’s mother, who said she heard from one of her children saying that ICE was sending them to Texas and their father to the detention center in Aurora.

“The point is to get this as far and wide as possible, so people can see the cruelty that’s happening in real time and see that kids who are just trying to get an education, which is their their right for living in this country that’s being trampled on,” Orozco-Perez said. “We’re literally taking away kids being kids.”

Perlmutter is the latest official whose firing has reached the Supreme Court.","The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to let President Trump refire the director of the U.S. Copyright Office, after a divided federal appeals court panel allowed her to remain in her post.

The Justice Department filed an emergency application at the high court Monday asking the justices to pause the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s decision blocking Trump’s termination of Shira Perlmutter as the case proceeds.

“This application involves another case of improper judicial interference with the President’s power to remove executive officers — here, the Register of Copyrights,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the administration’s request.

Perlmutter was fired in May after releasing a report that questioned whether companies can legally train artificial intelligence models using copyrighted materials.

As Trump sought to remove her, he also fired the Librarian of Congress, to whom Perlmutter reported, and installed Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to take the helm.

Though Perlmutter lost before a district judge, the appeals panel ruled 2-1 that her firing was likely unlawful and blocked it until the court resolves the case. The majority argued that the executive branch has “no authority to punish a legislative branch official for the advice that she provides to Congress.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Justin Walker, a Trump appointee, wrote in a dissenting opinion that he would not have allowed Perlmutter to remain in her position while she challenges the legality of her removal because the Register of Copyrights exercises executive power. He noted that the Supreme Court has “repeatedly and unequivocally” stayed lower court injunctions barring Trump from firing officers exercising executive power.

The justices requested a response from Perlmutter by Nov. 10.

Sauer argued that the appeals court’s ruling marked a “startling about-face” of its previous determinations that the Library of Congress and librarian fall within the executive branch.

“As in past cases where lower courts have impaired the President’s constitutional authority to oversee executive agencies, this Court should grant a stay: the case is certworthy, the President had authority to direct respondent’s removal, the D.C. Circuit lacked equitable authority to reinstate her, and the balance of equities favors the government,” he wrote.

Perlmutter contends in the lawsuit challenging her firing that Trump had no power to fire her and Blanche was unlawfully installed, meaning he had no authority to effectuate her removal either.

She’s represented by Democracy Forward, a prolific challenger of Trump administration actions. The Hill requested comment.

Perlmutter is the latest official whose firing has reached the Supreme Court. The justices are slated to hear arguments in two such cases in coming weeks: Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter’s removal will be weighed in December, and Federal Reserve board of governors member Lisa Cook’s firing will be heard in January.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/AP24318853676620-e1761591195174.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-28 15:57:25.147166

A Muslim civil rights group said his arrest was retaliation for his criticism of Israel.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, announced on social media that Hamdi’s visa had been revoked, that he was being held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement until he could be removed. In her post, she also made unsubstantiated claims that Hamdi supported terrorism.

“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin wrote in her Sunday social media post.

Hamdi, who is based in London, had been on a speaking tour in the United States, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights advocacy group. His visitor visa was supposed to last for several months, a leader at the organization said.

The group said in a statement that Hamdi had been detained “because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide” while on his tour, and called his detention “a blatant affront to free speech.”

Hamdi had attended the organization’s annual gala on Friday night in Sacramento and was scheduled to speak at an event in Florida on Sunday night.

Hamdi is a journalist and commentator who appears on British television networks to analyze developments in the Middle East, as well as domestic U.K. politics. According to his LinkedIn page, he is the managing director and editor in chief of International Interest, which “advises on political environments across the globe.”

Hamdi appears to be the latest of several immigrants and international travelers to have a U.S. visa revoked over political speech. The Trump administration was rebuked in September by a federal judge, who ruled that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had unconstitutionally targeted noncitizens for their pro-Palestinian advocacy in order to suppress critiques of Israel and the war it has waged in Gaza for two years with backing from the U.S.

Hussam Ayloush, chief executive of CAIR’s California chapter, said he attended the Sacramento gala with Hamdi and was shocked to receive a text from him Sunday around 7 a.m. informing him that Hamdi had been stopped by federal agents who told him he had to come with them.

Ayloush visited Hamdi along with two attorneys on Monday afternoon at the Golden State Annex, an ICE detention center in McFarland, where he is being held.

“When I went inside to meet him and check on him, I felt embarrassed that my country treated him that way,” Ayloush said. “He hasn’t caused or instigated any harm to our country.”

Ayloush said Hamdi was only guilty of “being critical of what Israel is doing to Palestinians, and the complicit role the U.S. government has played.”

CAIR said that its legal team as well as attorneys from the Muslim Legal Fund of America were working toward Hamdi’s release.

The organization said Hamdi’s arrest came after pressure from right-wing activist Laura Loomer, who publicly took credit for his detention. She said on social media that ICE acted in response to her “relentless pressure.” Loomer had smeared Hamdi with anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, the organization said.

Loomer has said she successfully lobbied the U.S. government to bar Palestinian children injured by American weapons in Israel’s war from seeking medical care in the U.S. In August, the Trump administration announced it had stopped approving visitor visas for Palestinians from Gaza, including young children in need of serious medical care.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0810fa7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4928x2587+0+346/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F43%2Fae%2F6a7bc40b40059a5565a976580c43%2Fgettyimages-2187203810.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:03:11.031730

Vijandre has DACA status through May 2026 and hasn’t been charged with a crime in the United States or elsewhere, according to the filing.
Vijandre came legally to the US in 2001 at age 14 under his father’s H-4 non-immigrant visa, which expired in 2004, the filing says.
He was granted DACA status in February 2013, and it was again granted on May 3, 2024, after he reapplied.
His team alleges that his detainment is, in part, retaliation for not agreeing to work with the FBI.","A 38-year-old man who has been protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program for the past 12 years was detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this month, with the agency citing his social media posts as the reason for terminating his DACA status.

Yaa’kub Ira Vijandre, whose legal name is Jacob Ira Azurin Vijandre, is a Filipino immigrant, freelance journalist and activist in the Dallas area who was detained October 7, 2025, while leaving his home for work.

Vijandre is one of several immigrants who have been detained this year after speaking out against the war in Gaza, including students Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, and British commentator Sami Hamdi, who was detained over the weekend while on a speaking tour.

In addition to opposing the war in Gaza, Vijandre also spoke out against human rights abuses at ICE facilities and “the US government’s inhumane and illegal treatment of those it accuses of terrorism,” his attorneys said in a statement.

His detainment came a day after he recorded and participated in a local city council meeting in the Dallas suburb of Richardson, Texas, where he gave vocal support for a local community leader who was detained by ICE, according to a court filing from his legal team Monday.

His attorneys filed a habeas corpus petition Monday, arguing their client is being unlawfully detained and asking the court for his release.

Vijandre has DACA status through May 2026 and hasn’t been charged with a crime in the United States or elsewhere, according to the filing. Vijandre came legally to the US in 2001 at age 14 under his father’s H-4 non-immigrant visa, which expired in 2004, the filing says. He was granted DACA status in February 2013, and it was again granted on May 3, 2024, after he reapplied.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement shared with CNN Monday that Vijandre posted content on his social media “glorifying terrorism,” and said he supported groups such as the Holy Land Foundation, a former US-based Muslim charity where five members were convicted in a contested series of trials on charges of conspiring to support terrorism and launder money for Hamas.

Monday’s filing denies Vijandre has supported terrorism, and argues his First and Fifth amendment rights have been violated and the court should order his release and provide injunctive relief to prevent “further unlawful detention.”

Speech is “plainly protected by the First Amendment”

On the morning of October 7, Vijandre was leaving his home in Arlington, Texas, when ICE agents arrested him while at least one officer pointed a handgun at him, Monday’s filing said.

A Notice of Intent to Terminate DACA dated September 22 was sent to Vijandre and found in his mailbox several days after he was detained by ICE, according to the filing.

The notice alleges Vijandre supported “organizations and individuals who are known to engage in acts of terrorism,” which “presents public safety, national security concerns, and is a significant negative discretionary factor under the totality of the circumstances analysis,” Monday’s habeas filing said.

His legal team argues DHS is conflating supporting terrorism with Vijandre’s “opposition to U.S. foreign policy, the policies of the Israeli government, and abuse of prisoners with support for terrorism,” the filing says.

“In each of the three cases listed above, what Respondents characterize as support for terrorism actually consists of opposing perceived violation of detainee rights, including at black site prisons like Guantanamo Bay and Bagram Air Force Base,” the habeas petition says. “Equating such speech to ‘terrorism’ to justify detention would risk criminalizing a broad array of protected speech critical of U.S. government policy engaged in by citizens and non-citizens alike.”

Even if the speech did support terrorism, “such speech is plainly protected by the First Amendment,” the filing says, and the speech referenced by DHS “unquestionably fails this test regardless of whatever grounds of removability Respondents ultimately charge Mr. Vijandre in his Notice to Appear.”

Vijandre is not charged or convicted of any crime, his attorneys said.

Attempted recruitment by FBI

His detainment also comes after he was approached by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigations and asked to act as a confidential informant shortly after the Israel-Gaza conflict started in 2023, the filing says.

On or around November 30, 2023, agents approached Vijandre, indicating they wanted to recruit him as a confidential informant, and allegedly said he was “a poster child for the way you’re supposed to do it” in an apparent reference to immigration status, the filing says. He declined the offer, according to the filing.

A form called a Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien provided to Vijandre’s attorneys said that he was a “subject of interest to the [FBI’s] Dallas Join (sic) Terrorism Task Force” at an unspecified time, and the FBI initiated a review of his immigration record, the filing says.

His team alleges that his detainment is, in part, retaliation for not agreeing to work with the FBI.

Vijandre’s attorneys ring alarm bells

Attorneys representing Vijandre raised alarm bells about the implications of their client’s detainment, saying in Monday’s filing that “important democratic principles are at stake.”

This is another example in a string of cases this year in which the Trump administration is aiming to root out any immigrants it views as unpatriotic, and specifically associate those who are pro-Palestinian as being anti-American, said Marium Uddin, an attorney representing Vijandre and Legal Director of the Muslim Legal Fund of America.

They appear to target people expressing dissent, which is disturbing from a legal perspective but also “incredibly scary as a country,” she said, adding that is testing whether our legal systems will stay intact and follow decades of legal precedent.

Eric Lee, another attorney representing Vijandre, said his legal team meticulously analyzed their client’s social media presence and believe the government has failed to come close to satisfying imminent incitement, a legal precedent used to decide if speech is protected under the first amendment.

The legal team is confident based on their review, and believe the Trump administration is looking to expand the definition of domestic terrorism despite their client’s protected speech about things like ICE enforcement and inhumane detention at places like Guantanamo Bay.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2195569262-20251028020915858.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-28 13:03:15.093098

DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Protection did not confirm or deny the personnel changes.","EXCLUSIVE — The Trump administration has begun to purge Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in offices in five major U.S. cities and fill some of those top posts with senior Border Patrol agents who will take over interior immigration enforcement in those regions, according to five sources familiar with the plans.

ICE leaders in Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and San Diego were relieved of their jobs and moved to other posts within the federal agency last Friday, the Washington Examiner has learned.

Over the weekend, the Department of Homeland Security quietly started overhauling how it carries out its mass deportation operation in hopes of netting more arrests and ratcheting up its flashy, high-profile deportation campaign. The five cities are believed to be the first of more to come across ICE’s 24 field offices nationwide, according to three officials.

One official with firsthand knowledge of the plans, who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity, said the plan goes far beyond the five cities.

“It’s a lot more,” the official said.

A total of five sources said the five field office directors had been relieved of their duties and sent to other parts of the country to work. That included Denver Field Office Director Robert Guadian.

Guadian was told over the weekend that he would be reassigned from his duties, according to an informed source who wished not to be identified for fear of losing his job. The source said that Guidien informed his staff of the development on Monday.

The DHS had plotted to fire all five field office directors but relented amid pushback from acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, who pleaded that they not be terminated.

“The administration wanted all these guys fired and Todd stepped in and said, ‘Let’s move them all to headquarters,'” the second official said. Lyons did not respond to a request for comment.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem would have the final say in personnel matters at ICE and Border Patrol. The DHS did not comment on Noem’s role in the personnel changes.

“I personally think this is being pushed by Noem and [DHS senior adviser Corey Lewandowski] because they don’t like [White House border czar Tom Homan]. I think Tom would have said, ‘No way,'” the second official said.

The decision to replace top federal employees from one agency with employees from an entirely different agency is unprecedented.

The DHS had initially dispatched Gregory Bovino, who oversees the Border Patrol’s El Centro, California, region, to help with immigration arrests in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland since the start of summer.

Bovino has become the face of the Trump administration’s crackdown on crime for his aggressive style, leading Border Patrol agents in a parade down the streets of Chicago’s business district and standing face to face with fiery rioters and protesters. He has also brought in Border Patrol agents to supplement ICE efforts.

Now, the second official explained, Bovino is not viewed as the exception to the norm, but the new standard for what is to come at ICE.

The other four officials pushed out from their posts besides Guadian were San Diego Field Office Director Patrick Divver, Phoenix Field Office Director John Cantu, Los Angeles Field Office Director Ernesto Santacruz, and Philadelphia’s acting Field Office Director Brian McShane. All five did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson from the Denver ICE office did not respond for comment as if this story’s publication.

Guidian came to Denver from Chicago, where he held the same position leading operations for Enforcement and Removal operations.

During his short tenure in Denver, he led an ICE operation in July which ended up in 243 arrests of undocumented immigrants in the Denver metro area. Of those arrested, ICE said that nine were members of violent gangs including Tren de Aragua and their crimes ranged from murder to human trafficking and drug offenses.

At the time, Guidian claimed that many of those who were detained had been previously released into the Denver metro area by the local county jails “because of Colorado’s sanctuary laws that prevent sheriffs from cooperating with ICE.”

Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration has pushed for a high level of arrests and deportations. At present, the Trump administration anticipates hitting 600,000 deportations by January 2026.

In May, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller pushed ICE to arrest 3,000 illegal immigrants per day, which would work out to more than 1 million arrests in a year.

In a heated exchange at ICE’s Washington headquarters between Miller, Noem, and ICE leadership in May, the administration officials berated ICE for not doing more to arrest illegal immigrants.

But those high figures have been impossible to achieve as ICE has simultaneously focused on arresting the “worst of the worst,” often a one-by-one process.

Now, DHS is bringing in regional chiefs and supervisors normally stationed at the nation’s borders to carry out immigration arrests inside the country. Normally, Border Patrol’s authority only extends 100 miles into the U.S. from the border, though it is not clear what jurisdiction agents have to be enforcing immigration law in cities.

In mid-October, Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks told the Washington Examiner that agents were already assisting ICE in 27 cities nationwide, far beyond the two where agents have mostly been seen this fall: Chicago and Portland.

DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Protection did not confirm or deny the personnel changes.

“While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in an email Monday.

Only the worst?” one agent told Fox News.","A mass shakeup of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership is underway amid growing friction inside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over deportation tactics and priorities, according to four senior DHS officials.

The overhaul affects ICE field offices in at least eight cities and will replace many senior leaders with Border Patrol officials, marking an unprecedented power shift inside DHS and exposing sharp divisions over how far to go in ramping up deportations, the officials told Fox News.

The changes are being driven by competing camps inside DHS.

On one side are Border Czar Tom Homan and ICE Director Todd Lyons, who have advocated focusing on criminal aliens and those with final deportation orders.

On the other side are DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, senior adviser Corey Lewandowski and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who have pushed for a broader and more aggressive approach, targeting anyone in the US illegally to boost deportation numbers.

Two senior officials described the mood inside DHS as “tense” and “combative,” with some ICE leaders warning the new approach could erode public support and blur the line between ICE and Border Patrol operations.

“ICE started off with the worst of the worst, knowing every target they are hitting, but since Border Patrol came to LA in June, we’ve lost our focus, going too hard, too fast, with limited prioritization,” one senior DHS official told Fox. “It’s getting numbers, but at what cost?”

Another senior official put it bluntly, “ICE is arresting criminal aliens. They [Border Patrol] are hitting Home Depots and car washes.”

Border Patrol agents have defended the new strategy.

“What did everyone think mass deportations meant? Only the worst?” one agent told Fox News. “Tom Homan has said it himself — anyone in the US illegally is on the table.”

The internal friction comes as deportation totals remain below targets set by the administration earlier this year. Officials told Fox News that the latest round of reassignments impacts ICE field chiefs in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Denver, Portland, Philadelphia, El Paso and New Orleans — positions expected to be filled by Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.

A separate DHS official confirmed the personnel changes, describing them as “performance-based” and designed “to move people around for the best results.”

Dive Brief:

The Iowa Department of Education and the state’s Board of Educational Examiners are being audited after U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement took former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts into custody last month for allegedly staying and working in the country illegally.

The state auditor will review the entities’ licensing and background check procedures, as well as audit Iowa’s Des Moines Public Schools, according to information shared with K-12 Dive by the state auditor’s office.

Meanwhile, the state’s largest school district announced earlier this month that it is suing JG Consulting, the search firm that Des Moines School Board tapped to help with its superintendent search in 2022-23 and facilitated the hiring of Roberts in 2023.

Dive Insight:

Roberts’ arrest by ICE on Sept. 26 is one of the most high-profile apprehensions in the K-12 sector to result from the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, which has impacted school communities nationwide and has even changed schools’ daily operations in some places like Chicago. Roberts has served in educator and school leadership positions for over two decades in the U.S., according to the Des Moines school district.

His apprehension by immigration enforcement officials raised questions about the hiring and vetting processes in place at the state and district levels.

The Iowa state department of education audit was launched after a request by state Sen. Tony Bisignano from Des Moines, who said in an Oct. 22 letter to state auditor Rob Sand that the arrest of Roberts “raise[s] serious concerns about the integrity and effectiveness of the Board’s licensing processes.

“This incident represents a glaring oversight and suggests a potential failure in either the background check protocol itself or in the implementation and review process,” said Bisignano, adding that “public trust” is on the line.

Bisignano also requested that the use of third-party contracts by the board be reviewed.

Since 2001, Roberts filed repeated green card applications, which is also known as a Permanent Resident Card, which the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services rejected, according to ICE. In 2019, he filed for employment authorization documents, which was approved with an expiration date of Dec. 18, 2020. By 2024, an immigration judge had ordered Roberts to be deported.

Des Moines Public School district said in a Sept. 30 statement that Roberts wrote he was a U.S. citizen on his I-9 employment form and that he provided a driver’s license and Social Security card as two forms of identification. His arrest also raised concerns about his qualifications, including his doctorate degree from Morgan State University in Maryland.

Following his arrest, Roberts submitted a letter of resignation to the district through his attorney, which the Des Moines School Board accepted. His license allowing him to practice as superintendent was revoked by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners in the days following his arrest.

The district maintained in an Oct. 1 statement that it was a “victim of deception” by Roberts.

The district’s lawsuit against JG Consulting claims the firm failed to properly vet Roberts in violation of their contract and was negligent when it represented Roberts as a suitable candidate for the superintendency. The district is seeking an undetermined amount of damages, including the costs of superintendent pay.

In 2023, the Des Moines school system paid Roberts a base salary of $270,000, according to district documentation.

“We had a little bit of a reprieve from ICE’s illegal activities over the last few weeks, but they have been back in force in Orange County again violating people’s constitutional rights – regardless of citizenship status under the law,” said USC professor and local immigrant advocacy volunteer Jody Vallejo.

In a Thursday phone interview, she said her volunteer colleagues at the OC Rapid Response Network – an immigrant advocacy group that tracks federal deportation efforts – are seeing people’s constitutional rights being violated by federal agents.

“They are acting in ways that are inhumane, they are violating due process rights that people have and because they are so rogue and relying on stereotypes,” Vallejo said. “They are casting these nets that ensnare legal residents and United States citizens.”

The ramp up comes after President Donald Trump’s administration began focusing deportation efforts elsewhere in the country – like Chicago and New York City.

Citizens Caught up in Car Wash Raid

Officials in Anaheim have also noticed an uptick, noting a recent raid at the Euclid Car Wash – a spot that federal agents have been to multiple times.

“Last week, Anaheim saw what appeared to be broader, roving enforcement at a restaurant and car wash by Border Patrol and other agencies, part of stepped-up enforcement throughout Orange County. Since mid-August, Anaheim has mostly seen targeted enforcement operations focused on individuals, rather than broader operations at Home Depots, car washes and other public places,” reads an Oct. 22 update on Anaheim’s city website.

Sandra De Anda, director of policy and legal strategy for the OC Rapid Response Network, said federal agents showed up to the Euclid Car Wash in West Anaheim on Oct. 16.

“One of our ICE watchers was there, she got there minutes before the enforcement began,” De Anda said, adding that the volunteer warned the car wash employees.

Bethany Anderson, who heads up Camino Immigration Services, said two citizens were caught up in the car wash raid – where she was serving as a legal observer.

“They let one of the guys go they tackled to the ground and the second guy that they tackled, they put him in a car then the other guys were trying to advocate for him, saying he’s a US citizen,” Anderson said in a Friday phone interview. “He was released about an hour later.”

Mayor Ashleigh Aitken said the city doesn’t know when deportation activities are going to happen.

“We rely on a collaboration between public safety, dedicated activists, neighborhood leaders and social media. While we have seen continuing enforcement, we have not seen a rise as compared to neighboring cities and counties. Our focus remains on helping our neighbors, with dedicated information and resources available to our residents in their time of need,” Aitken said in a Thursday text message.

Anaheim City staff provide regular updates on the website, noting a recent uptick in ICE sweeps – especially in nearby Santa Ana, where officials don’t provide daily public updates.

“We are tracking stepped-up enforcement in Santa Ana and throughout the region over the past few days. Anaheim has not seen major enforcement activity since Oct. 16,” reads the Anaheim Thursday update.

Over the summer, Anaheim City Council members voted to join a federal lawsuit – stemming out of Los Angeles – against the federal government in a case alleging that roving patrols and unwarranted stops amount to racial profiling and violate people’s constitutional rights.

[Read: Orange County’s Largest Cities Take a Stand Against ICE Sweeps]

“We condemn how some federal immigration enforcement has played out in our city and do not support any excessive enforcement activity that destabilizes families, neighborhoods and our economy. As of Oct. 2, Anaheim has been admitted to and has officially joined a federal lawsuit, known as Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, et al., v. Kristi Noem, et al., challenging some enforcement tactics,” reads Anaheim’s website.

Last week, Fullerton City Councilwoman Shana Charles also publicly raised concerns on how immigration enforcement is being done after a resident read the 5th Amendment’s due process protections during public comment at Tuesday’s city council meeting.

“I really appreciate that somebody took out the (U.S.) Constitution and read the 5th Amendment,” Charles said, adding that the founding fathers didn’t use the word “citizen” in due process rights.

“Just above that was Amendment number four which is also prohibiting illegal search or seizure and it explicitly says ‘no persons,” she said. “No person should be denied any of those protections and everyone should get due process no matter what.”

The Department of Homeland Security didn’t answer specific questions about roving enforcement efforts, but provided an overview of how many people have been arrested since June.

“Since June 6, 2025, ICE and CBP arrested more than 7,100 illegal aliens in the Los Angeles area,” reads an Oct. 22 email from an unnamed spokesperson. “Illegal aliens have a choice: they can either leave now voluntarily and receive a $1,000 or they can arrested, detained, and removed without the ability to return the right legal way.”

Are Policy Shifts Creating Undocumented Immigrants?

Anderson – who heads up Camino Immigration Services – said shifts in federal immigration policies are making people undocumented.

“There is an intentional dismantling of the immigration legal system,” Anderson said. “They’re creating undocumented immigrants, they’re creating people without status.”

Anderson also noted federal officials are revoking people’s temporary protected status and putting them in deportation proceedings.

“It’s not criminals, it’s the most vulnerable of the immigrant population that are being made undocumented. Immigration has their information because they’re applying, they’re trying to do it the right way and they’re being targeted,” she said.

De Anda and Vallejo also echoed what Anderson said, adding it’s not just the Latino community that’s being impacted.

“We’re getting calls from every single community out here in Orange County,” De Anda said.

“Last night we had two Vietnamese families join our community space – both of their loved ones got taken at their ICE check-in and actually my friend’s dad just got taken at his ICE check-in, he’s Vietnamese too,” De Anda said in a Oct. 23 phone interview.

Vallejo said the deportation efforts are impacting all immigrants.

“This is an issue that touches a broad swath of our community. ICE is publicly targeting Latinos, but there’s constant actions against Middle Eastern immigrants in Orange County, Asian immigrants in Orange county, Black immigrants – they’re not as public as the attacks on Latinos,” she said.

Vallejo said the situation is going to have a lasting impact on various communities.

“We are a county with a diverse set of immigrants and these kinds of effects ripple within communities and across generations.”

The screenshot also lists contact information for reporting ICE activity and connecting with other resources through the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights hotline.

""Just as we have witnessed in neighborhoods across our city, ICE is conducting their unlawful and undemocratic actions in the 12th House district, including the very block I reside on,"" the screenshot reads.

It further encouraged people to record ICE detentions or use of force, as well as to run errands on behalf of individuals who are afraid to leave their homes due to ICE presence.

Capitol News Illinois confirmed that the email came from Croke's office. A post on Croke's Instagram shared some of the same language regarding ICE activity, hotlines and ""Know Your Rights"" resources but without the list of vehicles.

""I'm just doing what I think is right for my district,"" Croke said in an interview with Capitol News Illinois. ""I'm always going to keep fighting for my district. I'm always going to make sure that I'm doing the right thing, and I believe I'm on the right side of history.""

Another state legislator, Rep. Hoan Huynh, D-Chicago, recently said U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents pulled a gun on him after acting on a tip about ICE activity in Chicago's Northwest Side.

Huynh said he was in the area to educate residents about their rights. He said agents immediately surrounded and harassed him. One of the agents pointed a gun at him, he said, though it was not caught on the cellphone footage he shared.

According to the Illinois Civil Liability for Doxing Act, doxing refers to intentionally publishing another person's personally identifiable information without consent and with the intent to harm or harass with reckless disregard for the person's safety.

Publishing information to report conduct ""reasonably believed to be unlawful"" is not considered doxing under the law.

Croke's office sent the email out after recent actions by Gov. JB Pritzker and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias to create official channels for the public to report and document ICE activity they say is unlawful.

Recording government officials when they are performing their duties in public is protected by the First Amendment, according to Edwin Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at the ACLU of Illinois. Attempts to criminalize such expression, Yohnka said, raise serious constitutional concerns.

""Government accountability is a cornerstone of democracy,"" Yohnka said. ""Photographs and videos - including those capturing license plates or identifying details of federal agents - can be vital tools for transparency and for families trying to locate detained loved ones.""

Posts online sharing the screenshot claimed that the Department of Homeland Security had referred the case to the DOJ for review, citing DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a post on X.

""Heinous. We will prosecute those who dox ICE law enforcement to the fullest extent of the law - State Rep Croke is no exception,"" says the quote attributed to McLaughlin.

DHS confirmed the statement was made by McLaughlin. Anthony Coley, who heads DOJ's Office of Public Affairs, says the Department is tracking cases such as this and issued a warning to public officials involved.

""The Department is actively tracking these targeted assaults against our law enforcement and will hold offenders accountable to the fullest extent of the law,"" Coley said. ""Any official encouraging reckless behavior should think twice before inciting further violence and putting federal agents in harm's way.""

License plate hotline

The calls for charges against Croke came the same week as Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias said federal agents may be subject to legal penalties for modifying and hiding state-issued license plates.

Giannoulias called on the public to help identify potential violations by making reports to a new ""Plate Watch Hotline.""

The move follows public accounts and past reporting that federal immigration agents have been driving unmarked cars and vehicles without proper license plates.

""Swapping out Illinois license plates on Illinois registered vehicles is illegal,"" Giannoulias said in a video posted to YouTube. ""As secretary of state, I have zero tolerance for this type of illegal activity.""

With the exception of motorcycles, trailers and some trucks, Illinois law requires all licensed vehicles to display two plates, on the front and back of the vehicle.

Giannoulias said his office was actively investigating alleged violations, including a video circulated on social media that appears to show an ICE officer saying, ""You can record all you want. We change the plates out every day.""

Penalties for putting a license plate on a vehicle other than the one to which it was issued, obscuring or otherwise modifying plates include fines or potential jail time, according to a news release issued with the hotline announcement video.

The office also said it has the authority to suspend or revoke the vehicles' license plates.

""Flipping license plates or altering them in any way to avoid detection is strictly prohibited in Illinois,"" Giannoulias said. ""No one, including a federal agent, is above the law.""

Individuals seeking to make reports of license plate violations can contact the Secretary of State's Plate Watch Hotline at (312) 814-1730 or email platewatch@ilsos.gov.

ICE accountability actions

The day after Giannoulias' announcement, Pritzker signed an executive order forming a commission to document and investigate misconduct by federal agents.

State officials argue these steps are necessary to hold federal agents accountable after U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and ICE officials told U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis earlier this month that no agents had been disciplined for use of force while applying aggressive crowd control tactics on protesters.

Ellis extended a temporary restraining order earlier this month prohibiting immigration agents from using those tactics, including the use of chemical irritants, until Nov. 6.

A group of journalists and activists that sought the restraining order filed a notice to Ellis on Oct. 23 accusing Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino of violating the restraining order.

The notice alleges that Bovino that morning threw a tear gas canister ""without justification"" at protesters in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood. The filing cites video footage of the incident livestreamed on Facebook.

A federal judge last week ordered Bovino to testify in person about the incident in federal court on Tuesday.

In an interview with CBS News, Bovino defended the use of force at the Broadview facility, accusing protesters of attacking federal agents and calling agents' actions ""exemplary.""

""If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them,"" Bovino said. ""Don't protest and don't trespass.""

That includes people applying for visas that are available to crime victims who cooperate with law enforcement.

“It is a policy of arrest first, ask questions later,” said Rebecca Brown, an attorney who helped file the lawsuit through the nonprofit Public Counsel.","A former Milwaukee teacher’s aide is among the people suing over a change in federal immigration policy.

The lawsuit filed this month accuses Immigration and Customs Enforcement of breaking federal laws and policies that are intended to protect crime victims.

For years, ICE has generally refrained from deporting people with certain types of pending applications for legal status. That includes people applying for visas that are available to crime victims who cooperate with law enforcement.

But, according to the lawsuit, that changed under a 2025 policy.

Now, ICE is routinely arresting, jailing and deporting people under a “blind removal policy” — without first considering the validity of their requests for protected status as a crime victim, the lawsuit says.

“It is a policy of arrest first, ask questions later,” said Rebecca Brown, an attorney who helped file the lawsuit through the nonprofit Public Counsel. “In some cases, the government is sending these survivors straight back into the hands of their abusers.”

ICE is also deporting and detaining crime victims who have been granted formal legal permission to remain temporarily in the U.S through what’s known as “deferred action,” according to the lawsuit. In doing so, ICE has been “treating its enforcement actions as a de facto revocation of deferred action status without prior notice or opportunity to be heard,” the lawsuit says.

Those policy shifts are making everyone less safe, said Erika Cervantes, an attorney with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law.

The center is one of the groups that filed that lawsuit in a California U.S. district court.

“Folks don’t want to speak to police anymore, and there’s no trust in the criminal justice system,” Cervantes told WPR. “The consequence of that is that there’s going to be more unreported crime.”

According to the lawsuit, the changes are affecting people who self-petition for visas under a process established from the federal Violence Against Women Act. That avenue allows domestic abuse survivors to apply for visas on their own in lieu of having to rely on an abusive family member who is a U.S. citizen.

It’s also affecting people applying for T-visas, which are available to victims of human trafficking, and for U-visas, which are intended for victims of serious crimes, including domestic violence and sexual assault.

The groups filing the lawsuit are asking for class action status, arguing that the new policy has harmed “tens of thousands” of people.

One of the plaintiffs is 38-year-old Yessenia Ruano. She crossed the southern border in 2011 to flee violence in her native El Salvador, the lawsuit says. During that journey, the lawsuit says she became a victim of trafficking.

After being detained by Border Patrol, Ruano applied for legal protection and passed a “credible fear” interview, indicating that she had a legitimate fear of violence or persecution if she were forced to return to her home country, according to the lawsuit.

“She was released and placed into immigration court proceedings on a non-detained immigration court docket, which moves extremely slowly,” the lawsuit says. “Over the next fourteen years, Ms. Ruano attended all immigration court hearings and ICE check-ins.”

While she was in the U.S., Ruano married and had a pair of twin daughters. Ruano also worked at Academia de Lenguaje y Bellas Artes, a bilingual school in Milwaukee.

In 2023, an immigration court dismissed Ruano’s application for what’s known as “withholding of removal.” That prompted Ruano to hire new legal counsel and to apply for a T-visa as a trafficking victim.

Earlier this year, Ruano got a notice of deportation informing her she had to leave the country.

Her attorney requested an emergency stay, arguing that Ruano should be allowed to remain in the U.S. while her T-visa application was being considered. ICE denied that request.

In June, Ruano boarded a plane to El Salvador, with her 10-year-old daughters by her side.

“Ultimately, Yessenia decided to self-deport with her daughters rather than put them through the trauma of seeing her arrested and imprisoned,” the lawsuit says. “For weeks, they cried constantly. They remain in El Salvador at significant risk of harm.”

Along with breaking federal laws and directives, the lawsuit accuses immigration enforcement of violating constitutional rights to due process and to protection against unreasonable seizure.

In an email to WPR, a federal official disputed those allegations. The lawsuit names Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and ICE as defendants.

“This is yet another clickbait headline,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Every illegal alien ICE removes has had due process and has a final order of removal—meaning they have no legal right to be in the country.”",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2014/03/courtroom-scales-jury.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 11:59:49.484018

The administration has grown increasingly frustrated with ICE’s failure to meet White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller’s target of 3,000 arrests of undocumented migrants per day, The New York Times reports.

The latest figures available, compiled prior to the government shutdown, recorded an average arrest rate of 1,178 per day in September, well below Miller’s expectations.

The development came as California Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal took to X to announce the latest death of a detainee in ICE custody, placing further pressure on the much-criticized immigration enforcement agency.

“That is 22 immigrants who have died in custody since Trump came to office,” the congresswoman wrote. “This is beyond outrageous. ICE is responsible for the well-being of people in immigration detention and it is failing miserably.”

The Trump administration’s decision to swap out ICE field directors with replacements from Customs and Border Patrol was inspired by the president’s top aides being impressed by the latter’s “more aggressive tactics to secure arrests,” NBC reports, “such as rappelling into apartment buildings from Black Hawk helicopters and jumping out of rental trucks in Home Depot parking lots.”

“The mentality is CBP does what they’re told, and the administration thinks ICE isn’t getting the job done,” a DHS official told NBC. “So CBP will do it.”

The network reports that the White House has signed off on a list of at least a dozen directors of ICE field offices it intends to remove imminently, half of whom would be replaced by CBP personnel.

Given that there are only 25 ICE field offices across the U.S., the substitutions would mean almost half of its leadership being benched.

The list of replacements, who have not been named, was reportedly drawn up by DHS adviser Corey Lewandowski and CBP chief Greg Bovino, who has overseen his agents’ operations in Los Angeles and Chicago.

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin did not address Rep. Jayapal’s concern about the treatment of detainees but told The Independent: “This is one team, one fight. President Trump has a brilliant, tenacious team led by Secretary [Kristi] Noem to deliver on the American people’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from this country.

“Stephen Miller, Tom Homan, Todd Lyons, Gregory Bovino, Corey Lewandowski, and Madison Sheahan are patriots who wake up every day to make this country and its people safer... We have no personnel changes to announce right now but we remain laser focused on RESULTS and we will deliver.”

The reported dissatisfaction with ICE comes after it was revealed that the agency had spent $70 million on weapons in the first nine months of Trump’s second term, a 700 percent increase on the amount spent in Joe Biden’s final year in office, as its role has dramatically increased to help deliver the “largest mass deportation program in history” as the president promised on the campaign trail.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/28/9/22/GettyImages-2243636496.jpg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-28 13:03:28.842821

The death of Josué Castro Rivera follows recent incidents in which three other immigrants in Chicago and California were killed during immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration’s crackdown.

Castro Rivera was headed to a gardening job Thursday when his vehicle was pulled over by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, brother Henry Castro said.

Agents tried to detain Castro Rivera and the three other passengers, and he fled on foot, tried to cross Interstate 264 in Norfolk and was fatally struck, according to state and federal authorities.

Castro Rivera came to the United States four years ago and was working to send money to family in Honduras, according to his brother.

“He had a very good heart,” Castro said Sunday.

The Department of Homeland Security said Castro Rivera’s vehicle was stopped by ICE as part of a “targeted, intelligence-based” operation and passengers were detained for allegedly living in the country without legal permission.

DHS said in a statement that Castro Rivera “resisted heavily and fled” and died after a passing vehicle struck him. DHS officials did not respond Sunday to requests for further comment.

Virginia State Police said officers responded to a report of a vehicle-pedestrian crash around 11 a.m. Thursday on eastbound I-264 at the Military Highway interchange. Police said Rivera was hit by a 2002 Ford pickup and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The crash remains under investigation.

Federal authorities and state police gave his first name as Jose, but family members said it was Josué. DHS and state police did not explain the discrepancy.

Castro called his brother’s death an injustice and said he is raising money to transport the body back to Honduras for funeral.

“He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him,” Castro said.

DHS blamed Castro Rivera’s death on “a direct result of every politician, activist and reporter who continue to spread propaganda and misinformation about ICE’s mission and ways to avoid detention.”

Similar deaths amid immigration operations elsewhere have triggered protests, lawsuits and calls for investigation amid claims that the Trump administration’s initial accounts are misleading.

Last month in suburban Chicago, federal immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican man during a traffic stop. DHS initially said a federal officer was “seriously injured,” but police body camera video showed the federal officer walking around and describing his own injuries as “ nothing major.”

In July a farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic ICE raid at a California cannabis facility died of his injuries. And in August a man ran away from federal agents onto a freeway in the same state and was fatally struck by a vehicle.

Melissa's life-threatening winds and rain hit Jamaica

Hurricane Melissa approached Jamaica as a powerful Category 5 storm as forecasters warned it would cause catastrophic flash flooding, life-threatening landslides and extremely strong winds across the Caribbean. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami warned people in Jamaica to go to shelters and stay there during the storm.

Melissa is set to make landfall in Jamaica this morning, before moving across southeastern Cuba tonight as a Category 3 storm and across the southeastern Bahamas tomorrow.

Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned residents to take the storm seriously, particularly young people who may be unaware of what a strong hurricane can do.

The most powerful storm to hit the region since Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, Melissa will bring between 15 and 30 inches — and potentially up to 40 inches — of rain to Jamaica, as well as extreme winds, extensive infrastructure damage and life-threatening storm surge along its southern coast, the hurricane center said.

It's the third Category 5 storm of the 2025 season. The last time a single storm season saw more than two storms of this strength was 20 years ago.

Freddie Freeman (again) enters World Series lore

One year after hitting the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history, Freddie Freeman came through again for the Dodgers with a hit for the ages.

Freeman’s solo home run in the 18th inning against the Toronto Blue Jays ended a game tied for the longest in World Series history, propelling Los Angeles to a 6-5 win and a 2-1 series lead.

While Freeman deserves credit for the decisive blow, his teammate Shohei Ohtani was equally crucial in the victory for the defending champions. The Japanese superstar hit two home runs and two doubles early in the game — and then was intentionally walked four straight times by the Blue Jays, who preferred to face Mookie Betts and Freeman than Ohtani’s hot bat.

Border Patrol officials to lead a more aggressive migrant crackdown

The Trump administration is planning to replace some regional leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement with Border Patrol officials in an attempt to intensify its mass deportation effort amid growing frustration with the pace of daily arrests, according to two Homeland Security Department officials, one former DHS official and one federal law enforcement official.

President Donald Trump's top aides have welcomed Border Patrol’s more aggressive tactics to secure arrests, such as rappelling into apartment buildings from Black Hawk helicopters and jumping out of rental trucks in Home Depot parking lots, as they've become disappointed with ICE, the officials said.

The White House has signed off on a list of at least a dozen directors of ICE field officers who are set to be reassigned in coming days, the sources said. They said that at least half of them would be replaced with Border Patrol officials. ICE has 25 field offices around the country, so the move could replace nearly half of the agency’s leaders.

Messi doesn't rule out 2026 World Cup

Lionel Messi is hopeful he'll be playing for Argentina to help defend the World Cup when soccer's biggest event comes to North America next summer. Speaking with NBC News' Tom Llamas, Messi said he will see how his body feels next year before choosing whether to play.

Messi has been playing professionally since 2004. He debuted in La Liga with Barcelona at just 17 years old, becoming, at the time, the youngest player to play for the Spanish club. In 2021, Messi left Barcelona in the wake of the club's financial issues, moving to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain. After two years with PSG, Messi brought his talents to the United States, signing with MLS' Inter Miami.

While he enjoyed a decorated individual and club career, international success eluded Messi until the 2022 World Cup, when Argentina defeated France 4-2 on penalties to win the final. Messi won his second Golden Ball and was voted the tournament's best player. The World Cup victory was Argentina's first since 1986. Messi has appeared in 195 matches for his country since 2005, scoring 114 goals.

The administration’s newest emergency appeal to the high court was filed a month and a half after a federal appeals court in Washington held that the official, Shira Perlmutter, could not be unilaterally fired.

Nearly four weeks ago, the full District of Columbia circuit court of appeals refused to reconsider that ruling.

The case is the latest that relates to Donald Trump’s authority to install his own people at the head of federal agencies. The supreme court has largely allowed Trump to fire officials, even as court challenges proceed.

But this case concerns an office that is within the Library of Congress. Perlmutter is the register of copyrights and also advises Congress on copyright issues.

Solicitor general D John Sauer wrote in his filing on Monday that despite the ties to Congress, the register “wields executive power” in regulating copyrights.

Perlmutter claims Trump fired her in May because he disapproved of advice she gave to Congress in a report related to artificial intelligence. Perlmutter had received an email from the White House notifying her that “your position as the Register of Copyrights and Director at the US Copyright Office is terminated effective immediately”, her office said.

A divided appellate panel ruled that Perlmutter could keep her job while the case moves forward.

“The executive’s alleged blatant interference with the work of a legislative branch official, as she performs statutorily authorized duties to advise Congress, strikes us as a violation of the separation of powers that is significantly different in kind and in degree from the cases that have come before,” Judge Florence Pan wrote for the appeals court. Judge J Michelle Childs joined the opinion. Democratic president Joe Biden appointed both judges to the appeals court.

Judge Justin Walker, a Trump appointee, wrote in dissent that Perlmutter “exercises executive power in a host of ways”.

Multiple news outlets have reported that the government intends to reassign multiple directors of ICE field offices in the coming days, potentially replacing them with border patrol officials.

It comes as the government is falling well short of its targets on immigration. Earlier this year, Stephen Miller – Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff – set ICE a target of arresting 3,000 people every day. But as of late September, the agency on average was arresting 1,178 daily, NBC reported.

The New York Times reported that the proposed changes stem from the White House becoming frustrated at the pace of deportations, which currently lags behind Trump’s goal of removing 1 million immigrants in his first year in office.

The administration is seeking to replace “at least a dozen” directors of ICE field offices, NBC reported. The move would represent a major shake-up, given ICE only has 25 field offices across the country.

Officials told NBC that several of the ICE directors would be replaced by border patrol agents.

The border patrol has been criticized after conducting aggressive, large-scale arrests in Chicago and Los Angeles. The agency is ostensibly supposed to operate along the US borders with Mexico and Canada.

In August, border patrol agents jumped out of a rental truck and raided a Home Depot parking lot in LA, arresting more than a dozen people. Earlier in October, a border patrol agent shot a woman five times in Chicago. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the woman, a US citizen, drove into a border patrol vehicle.

The DHS, which oversees ICE and the border patrol, said in a statement:","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe60fe953494dc2dbe4e41c442933cc7d10417be/374_0_2870_2297/master/2870.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b11cdb539a730c753d785d55749430bc",N,,2025-10-28 10:56:54.169813

The deportees were returned through the Spin Boldak and Bahramcha border crossings, with both forced and voluntary returns reported. The expulsions come amid an escalating crackdown on undocumented Afghan nationals living in Pakistan, particularly following eight days of border clashes between the Taliban and Pakistani forces earlier this month.

This wave of deportations follows a similarly high number the previous day — Sunday — when 7,996 Afghans were expelled. The increasing pace of removals follows a directive by Pakistan’s caretaker Prime Minister, who ordered the eviction of undocumented migrants by the end of October.

Tehran recently announced stricter rules for Afghan labor migration. Majid Ahmadi, the director-general of Iran’s Bureau for Aliens and Foreign Immigrants Affairs, stated that Afghan workers will now only be allowed to enter the country through official work visas issued via the Iranian Embassy in Kabul and under the sponsorship of an Iranian employer.

Iranian officials have introduced a new “Kafeel” (sponsorship) program, modeled on Gulf labor systems, claiming it benefits not only Afghan workers but also Iranian employers and society. Under the plan, employers must apply online through the Ministry of Labor, submitting documentation for approval to hire Afghan nationals in physically demanding or hazardous jobs.

The Donald Trump administration has begun removing senior US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials as his top aides push for faster deportations, according to reports from NBC News and Fox News.

NBC News reported on Monday that the administration “is planning to replace some regional leaders” at ICE with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials, while Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin said US social media company X that the shake-up is already “underway.”

Two Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials told NBC that the White House has grown increasingly satisfied with CBP’s aggressive enforcement tactics, citing examples such as agents “rappelling into apartment buildings from Black Hawk helicopters and jumping out of rental trucks in Home Depot parking lots.”

“The mentality is CBP does what they’re told, and the administration thinks ICE isn’t getting the job done,” one DHS official said. “So CBP will do it.”

Melugin reported that ICE field office directors in at least eight major cities — including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and New Orleans — are being replaced. He said there is “significant friction in Homeland Security as to how to best to achieve more deportations.”

A Border Patrol agent quoted by Melugin defended the tougher approach: “What did everyone think mass deportations meant? Only the worst? (US border czar) Tom Homan has said it himself, anyone in the US illegally is on the table.”

They said evidence obtained in discovery indicated that the number of FPS officers in Portland never surpassed 31 at any time.
Bernie said the discrepancies should not influence the panel’s ruling upholding Trump’s deployment because the number of FPS officers in Portland didn’t form the basis of its decision.
The panel’s expansive ruling, which alarmed several legal experts, stayed a district court order blocking Trump’s deployment.","The Department of Justice (DOJ) Monday corrected a key piece of evidence it repeatedly cited in defense of President Donald Trump’s attempted military deployment in Portland, Oregon, last month.

In a letter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Andrew Bernie, a DOJ attorney, said the Trump administration made several “errors” in describing how many special law enforcement officers it sent to Portland in response to protests outside of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the city.

The disclosure, which came in Portland and Oregon’s lawsuit against the deployment, marks a rare walkback from the DOJ that may damage its legal defense of Trump’s military intervention in the City of Roses.

Attempting to prove that Trump had the authority to send troops into the city, government officials claimed 115 Federal Protection Service (FPS) officers were ordered to the city between June and September. The number represented nearly a “quarter” of the whole FPS force that protects federal facilities and employees, the government claimed in court filings.

In oral arguments and court filings, the DOJ repeatedly argued that this major reallocation of FPS officers indicated that Trump was unable to enforce federal law in Portland with regular forces and was therefore justified in calling up around 200 Oregon National Guard troops in September.

The number of FPS officials allegedly sent to Portland was a key piece that a Ninth Circuit panel relied on in determining last week that Trump had the authority to federalize and deploy Guard troops to the city.

Oregon and Portland asserted in a letter to the panel last week that the Trump administration greatly misrepresented how many FPS officers it sent. They said evidence obtained in discovery indicated that the number of FPS officers in Portland never surpassed 31 at any time.

In the department’s response letter Monday, Bernie acknowledged that, based on a review by the Department of Homeland Security, the government only sent 86 FPS officials to Portland over the summer.

Bernie added that the DOJ also incorrectly stated that a “quarter” of the entire FPS force was sent to the city.

“We stated in our supplemental brief that ‘it is undisputed that nearly a quarter of the agency’s entire FPS capacity had to be redirected over a relatively short period to a single location in one medium-sized American city due to the unrest there,’” Bernie wrote. “This statement was incorrect.”

Instead, Bernie claimed that the statement was meant to refer to the percentage of FPS “inspectors” who were sent to Portland. Rather than a quarter, the amount was only around 13% of all FPS inspectors, Bernie wrote.

“We deeply regret these errors,” he added.

Bernie said the discrepancies should not influence the panel’s ruling upholding Trump’s deployment because the number of FPS officers in Portland didn’t form the basis of its decision.

However, in the ruling, the panel’s majority repeatedly cited the amount of FPS officers in the city, at one point saying that the president may in part rely on FPS deployments to measure whether he is unable to execute the law with regular forces and needs to mobilize the National Guard.

The panel’s expansive ruling, which alarmed several legal experts, stayed a district court order blocking Trump’s deployment.

The Ninth Circuit stayed the ruling last week to hold a vote on whether a larger panel should take up Trump’s appeal of the district court order.

A district court judge is set to preside over a three-day trial starting Wednesday to consider the merits of Trump’s military intervention in Portland. Following the trial, the judge could block the deployment again.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239241957-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 12:00:00.053283

President Trump’s Coal Fantasy Since taking office in 2017, President Trump has promised to bring back the coal industry.
The Trump administration is doing all it can to resuscitate the struggling coal industry, but both the market and environmental advocates have other plans.","The Trump administration and its allies in Congress are doing all they can to prop up the struggling coal industry. The administration has held press conferences with coal miners lined as a backdrop to tout its “mine, baby, mine” agenda while flooding the industry with subsidies to try to keep it afloat.

But three recent mining lease sales of public land — including two in the Powder River Basin, the largest coal producing region in the United States — have completely flopped.

Even conservative voices in the Northern Rockies are now publicly questioning whether elected officials’ wishful thinking on coal is dooming state economies for years to come.

Americans Will Pay More for Trump’s Coal Agenda

The administration’s policies ask the American taxpayer to pick up the tab for a dangerous and polluting industry with a failing market, while they simultaneously attack affordable and reliable clean energy. Removing pollution control requirements, forcing outdated coal power plants to operate past their retirement dates, and offering up our public lands to industry will not only harm our health and environment: it will hurt our pocketbooks through higher energy prices at a time when so many of us are already struggling. The administration’s use of sham emergency orders to stop a Michigan coal-fired plant from retiring cost customers $29 million in just the first five weeks it was forced to keep burning coal.

While the administration and Republicans in Congress remove incentives for and block clean energy development, they are also increasingly subsidizing the fossil fuel industry at our expense. The Department of Energy recently announced that it will provide $625 million to subsidize aging, polluting coal-fired power plants. And earlier this year, the Republicans passed a budget bill that cut the coal royalty rate from a 12.5% floor to a 7% ceiling, providing the industry a handout at the expense of a critical funding stream for state and local governments that goes toward schools and colleges, highway and road construction, and city and town budgets.

Clean energy is now cheaper than coal in many places and investing in it helps to keep down electricity costs for Americans. So why is the Trump administration selling out our communities by propping up this costly and polluting fuel source while attacking clean energy?

The MAGA Agenda Lets Other Countries Lead on Clean Energy

In addition to raising energy prices, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress have given a competitive edge to other countries that continue to grow their clean energy industries. According to the New York Times, Chinese companies now produce 60% of the world’s wind turbines and 80% of solar panels. America has a rich history of progress and leadership on emerging industries, but the MAGA movement now seems hellbent on rejecting these new opportunities to allow other countries to win the clean energy space.

Despite Trump’s attacks on clean energy, other countries around the world continue to move toward renewables. In fact, renewables have now overtaken coal as the primary source of electricity around the world for the first time. Trump and congressional Republicans are holding us back from competing on the global stage.

A Fake Energy Emergency at Our Expense

Upon taking office, the Trump administration immediately declared an energy emergency, but this is completely fabricated. Even before Trump took office, the U.S. was producing more oil and gas than any nation on the planet has in the history of human civilization. If the purpose of Trump’s actions was to address an actual energy emergency, it would be nonsensical to simultaneously adopt policies that inhibit wind and solar energy development and promote coal exports to other countries. President Trump’s manufactured emergency is meant to line the pockets of wealthy fossil fuel CEOs at the expense of our communities.

Much of the administration’s push for fossil fuels is ostensibly about fueling large-load data center development and the massive energy requirements that come with it, rather than providing power for American families. Communities are being forced (oftentimes without their knowledge) to take on both the cost and environmental risks of the AI boom. These data centers require enormous amounts of electricity, generate an excessive amount of waste, noise pollution, and require vast amounts of water. They often end up raising electricity rates for customers and are keeping fossil fuel-burning power plants online, disrupting the transition to clean energy and rolling back progress on fossil fuels. The administration’s actions on coal further exacerbate this growing threat to our communities and utility customers. Earthjustice attorneys represent local communities before state utility regulators to protect customers from subsidizing data centers.

Opening Up National Public Lands

Trump isn’t just pushing to burn more coal — he also wants to mine more of it. The administration recently announced that it was opening 13.1 million acres of our national public lands to coal leasing. But even with the subsidies from the administration and Congress, three recent lease sales in the Powder River Basin and Utah have fallen flat, illustrating the market’s continued shift away from coal. Companies don’t want this coal even when it’s on the clearance rack.

The American people also don’t want to turn over our national public lands to industry. According to the 2025 Conservation in the West poll, Western voters want their members of Congress to prioritize conservation over energy development on our national public lands by the widest margin to date — a whopping 72%. Americans want our elected officials to protect our public lands for recreation opportunities, wildlife, and economic benefits for local communities.

President Trump’s Coal Fantasy

Since taking office in 2017, President Trump has promised to bring back the coal industry. It didn’t happen in his first term and it will not happen now. While the U.S. may see a temporary bump in coal production, it will not last as the market continues to move toward cheaper and cleaner energy. The Trump administration and its allies in Congress are selling coal communities and states a bill of goods — and even longtime coal supporters in those states are starting to recognize it. By doubling down on an industry that continues to decline even with heavy subsidies behind it, and refusing to support transition plans, elected officials are dooming communities and workers with false hope.

Even while the administration moves forward with its coal industry bailout, it is leaving behind the same workers who have been asked to line up behind members of the administration at press conferences. Recently, coal miners from across the country protested at the Department of Labor over the administration’s failure to enforce limits on silica dust — a carcinogen that has led to a spike in black lung disease. The administration is ignoring worker health while helping its industry executive friends get even richer.

Earthjustice Continues to Fight Back

In Michigan, Earthjustice has active litigation to shut down the coal plant that Trump’s fake energy emergency has kept running past its scheduled retirement. In the coming months, we will fight more mandates like this one across the country.

Earlier this year we also sued the Trump administration for its unlawful decision to exempt dozens of coal-fired power plants, including Montana’s Colstrip plant, from stronger pollution limits set in the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.

Earthjustice has also fought expansions of some of the country’s largest coal mines for years and will continue to protect communities against Trump’s plans to authorize reckless new mining in the Northern Rockies region. Even though the coal industry’s allies in Congress recently passed an unprecedented Congressional Review Act resolution to reopen the Powder River Basin to new coal leasing, we are continuing to challenge mine expansions at the Rosebud and Bull Mountains coal mines and will take on the administration whenever it tries to sell off more of our public lands. Thankfully, as the recent failed lease sales show, the market is already rejecting the Trump administration’s coal fantasy.

Wherever the Trump administration and its allies in Congress attempt to illegally turn back progress on coal, we will meet them in court. We have come too far on the fight for clean energy and regulations to protect our health and environment from coal pollution to turn back now.

The Trump administration is doing all it can to resuscitate the struggling coal industry, but both the market and environmental advocates have other plans.

Human rights groups have criticised the deal, which is expected to cost A$2.5bn (£1.64bn; $1.23bn).
""People are secretly being sent to Nauru, with key aspects of the deal still kept from the Australian public"", immigration spokesperson for the Greens party, David Shoebridge, told Australian media.
This deal is separate to the arrangement for Nauru to run Australia's offshore immigration processing regime.
That system was scaled back following international condemnation on how the detainees were treated and housed.","Australia has started to deport foreign detainees to Nauru, marking the start of a controversial deal with the tiny Pacific island nation.

In a statement on Tuesday, Australian Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke confirmed that ""the first transfer had occurred"" last Friday, although how many people were deported is unknown.

The deal was struck after Australia's top court ruled that it could not indefinitely detain about 358 people, the bulk of whom have been convicted of crimes, forcing their release into the community.

Human rights groups have criticised the deal, which is expected to cost A$2.5bn (£1.64bn; $1.23bn).

The Australian government has repeatedly refused to release details of the agreement for the so-called NZYQ cohort, and refugee advocates says it goes against the country's human rights obligations.

Laura John, from the Human Rights Law Centre told SBS News the plans have been ""shrouded in secrecy from the outset"".

""We do not know if the person who has been exiled has left family behind in Australia, whether they need medical care that is unavailable in Nauru, or even if they still had visa appeal options in Australia.""

The NZYQ cohort refers to a group of detainees who were released into the Australian community after a landmark High Court decision in 2023 found that the government's power to hold them indefinitely in immigration detention was unlawful.

Many of them had been convicted of serious crimes including assault, drug smuggling and murder, leading to their Australian visas being cancelled.

The Australian government found itself in a difficult situation - unable to send the former-detainees back to their home countries for fear of persecution or because their government wouldn't accept them - but also facing severe backlash from the public for their release into the community.

Last year, the government, under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, made changes to Migration Act, bolstering its powers to deport non-citizens, in a move critics described as ""brutal"".

It included paying third-countries to take Australia's deportees.

Australia turned to Nauru, and under the agreement which was finalised earlier this year, the deportees are given a 30-year visa that allows them to work on the island and mix freely with its 12,500 inhabitants.

The first transfer triggers an upfront payment of A$408m to resettle the group in Nauru.

Aside from these details, little is known about the agreement.

""People are secretly being sent to Nauru, with key aspects of the deal still kept from the Australian public"", immigration spokesperson for the Greens party, David Shoebridge, told Australian media.

Criticising the lack of transparency in the plan and ""contemptuous silence"" from Minister Tony Burke, Shoebridge also expressed concern that once the deportees arrive in Nauru, they could then be sent back to their home countries.

""No matter who you are or where you were born, governments should not be able to disappear you, send you off against your will to a country that you have zero connection to,"" he said.

Burke has defended the arrangement, telling the Australian Broadcasting Corporation he has inspected the accommodation and health facilities on Nauru and ""the standard there is good"".

""When somebody has come and treated Australians in a way that shows an appalling character, their visas do get cancelled and when their visas are cancelled, they should leave,"" Burke has previously said.

ICE officials have not met that target.
In less than a year, the Trump administration has shuffled ICE's leadership several times.","The Trump administration is staging a major shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with plans to reassign senior leaders in agency offices across the country amid frustrations over current arrest and deportation levels, two sources familiar with the changes told CBS News on Monday.

One U.S. official, who requested anonymity to talk about internal matters, said as many as roughly a dozen local ICE leaders could be reassigned, with some expected to be replaced by current or former officials at Customs and Border Protection, its sister Department of Homeland Security agency. Some of those ICE officials have already been informed of their reassignments, the official added.

The planned shake-up at ICE would be a major leadership overhaul, affecting roughly half of the agency's 25 field offices.

In most cases, the field office directors won't be demoted or fired, said two U.S. officials, who described the plan as a way to give certain ICE offices additional support.

The Trump administration has increasingly turned to CBP and Border Patrol officials like Commander Gregory Bovino to expand its government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, deploying them to apprehend unauthorized immigrants far away from the U.S.-Mexico border, in Democratic-led cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.

Operations by green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in those cities — including arrests at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes — have triggered significant local backlash, with critics accusing the agents of being heavy-handed and arresting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but without criminal records.

In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, ""While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump Administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country.""

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, ""The President's entire team is working in lockstep to implement the President's policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.""

The Washington Examiner reported on the reassignments earlier Monday.

Internally, U.S. officials tell CBS News, some ICE leaders have been frustrated with Border Patrol's operations in cities — and the opposition they have garnered from local residents. While the Trump administration has made anyone in the U.S. illegally who is encountered by federal officials subject to arrest, ICE says its operations have continued to primarily target immigrants who have committed crimes in addition to being in the country unlawfully.

""We're arresting criminals, while they are going to Home Depots and car washes,"" one U.S. official told CBS News, referring to Border Patrol agents.

Some inside the Trump administration, however, see Border Patrol officials as better equipped to carry out the aggressive and expansive operations needed to reach the ambitious arrest targets set by the White House.

In the spring, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump's mass deportation plans, suggested on Fox News that ICE should be carrying out ""a minimum"" of 3,000 arrests per day. ICE officials have not met that target. While they have peaked above 2,000 on some days, arrests by the agency typically hover over 1,000 each day.

As of this week, ICE had carried out more than 260,000 arrests under the second Trump administration, or an average of approximately 900 per day, according to internal agency data obtained by CBS News.

In less than a year, the Trump administration has shuffled ICE's leadership several times.

Caleb Vitello, the first official tapped to lead ICE under the second Trump administration, was reassigned in February and replaced by longtime agency veteran Todd Lyons, who continues to serve as acting director. Previous heads of ICE's deportation unit, Enforcement and Removal Operations, and its investigative branch, Homeland Security Investigations, have also been replaced in recent months.

ICE has not had a Senate-confirmed director since early 2017, under the Obama administration.

Dozens of protesters gathered Monday outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Durango after reports spread that federal agents detained two minors and a parent on their way to school.

The minors are believed to be Durango School District students, and the adult is their parent, according to a representative from Compañeros: Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center, who asked not to be identified by name.

All three were taken to the ICE field office in Bodo Industrial Park.

The Compañeros official said she has worked with the family on an active asylum case since December 2024.

A work permit request was submitted in September and denied in early October. However, the Compañeros official received an email Monday from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services saying the denial was an error and the case remains active.

“They have a strong asylum case,” the Compañeros employee said. “(It meets) all the requirements and criteria (needed).”

The advocate said she showed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services email to a field office employee and was told the family would be released if the case could be confirmed as active.

Community members, legal advocates and representatives from Compañeros and the immigrant rights group Apoyo began to gather around 8 a.m. Monday across the street from the ICE field office where the family was held.

By Monday afternoon, the number had grown to about 100 people. Durango Police Department patrolled the scene.

Several protesters said the children were brought to the Center in handcuffs.

“I’m here to support these people that are literally being kidnapped off our streets,” said community member and protester Lisa Owens. “I am absolutely appalled that they (detained) two young children on their way to school – which is where they belong – and that they have them in this ICE building. It breaks my heart what’s happening. ... They must be terrified – traumatized.”

Local family law attorney Angie Buchanan went to the Center to support the detained family.

Buchanan said an ICE official told her any request to speak with the children must go through a juvenile coordinator with ICE. But when she called the number provided, she was told no such office or position exists.

According to the National Immigration Forum, the Flores Settlement requires each ICE field office to have a juvenile coordinator – an expert on children and families – and a compliance officer to address issues.

A Denver-based attorney from Meyer Law Office is consulting with the family, according to an employee with the firm.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

Raye, a member of the Southwest Rapid Response Network who requested their last name remain anonymous, said that while every ICE detainment comes with heavy feelings, the involvement of children has made this one feel especially difficult.

“This time it involves kids,” they said. “The cruelty of that is really apparent to our community.”

Community member and protester Natalia Anzola, who immigrated from Columbia in 1989, called the detainment of the children “the first step in erosion of public liberty.”

Anzola arrived to the protest around 9:30 a.m. Monday and remained as of 6 p.m., with no plans to leave.

She said she joined the protest to let the detained family and immigrant community know she stands with them.

“I just want them to know they’re not alone,” she said.

Enrique Orozco, co-executive director of Compañeros, told The Durango Herald that the children and their parent were still being held in the ICE field office in Durango as of Monday evening. Protesters intend to remain outside of the office until the children are released, he said – even if it takes all night.

“Part of the message is, if you believe in dignity and you believe in kids not (being) subject to this fascist administration, join us out there,” Orozco said. “We’re looking for people to be out there through the night with anything – coffee, hot chocolate, blankets, generators, noisemakers. We don’t want those kids to go to Denver.”

Orozco said the children’s mother is not being detained, and that ICE should release the minors to her.

After remaining outside the facility, singing hymns and platforming speakers, the Eucharistic protest disbanded peacefully.
The Catholic press broadly rallied behind the protestors, demanding that the religious rights of illegal immigrants be respected, many of whom are Catholic.
Although the right to do so has been challenged at specific sites, Catholic priests have worked to establish consistent chaplaincies at detention facilities.
The struggle over immigration is an ongoing one and will remain a constant source of friction between conservative politics and the social witness of the Catholic Church.","Earlier this month, hundreds of Catholic laypeople, nuns, and clergy processed from St. Eulalia Church in Maywood, IL, to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in nearby Broadview. The clergy donned their vestments and processed the Eucharist from the church to the outside of the ICE facility to provide the sacrament for detained immigrants. After an exchange with local police stationed there, the procession was denied entry into the facility. After remaining outside the facility, singing hymns and platforming speakers, the Eucharistic protest disbanded peacefully.

The Catholic press broadly rallied behind the protestors, demanding that the religious rights of illegal immigrants be respected, many of whom are Catholic. This sentiment also derives from the spirit of Pope Leo’s recent letter, Dilexi te, which offers that “in every rejected migrant, it is Christ himself who knocks at the door of the community.”

Much of the American Catholic mainstream saw ICE’s refusal to admit the procession on October 11 as a sign of callousness, following the words of one of the event’s organizers, that “Jesus was knocking at the federal agents’ door, and they would not let him in.”

Despite this polemic, ICE agents regularly invite Catholic priests to serve migrant communities. Although the right to do so has been challenged at specific sites, Catholic priests have worked to establish consistent chaplaincies at detention facilities. Even at the South Florida Detention Center, or as the President prefers, “Alligator Alcatraz,” a team of four to five priests visits the site to hear confessions and offer Mass weekly. This model has been replicated at several other ICE installations nationwide, which often rely on volunteers to provide religious services for staff and detainees alike.

At Broadview, the priests involved did not clear the event with ICE in advance, as chaplaincies regularly do, and could not have reasonably expected to gain access to the facility. The liturgical stunt pulled by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL), the progressive organizers of the event, not only cheapens the Eucharist but also does a disservice to the migrants interred at Broadview. This demonstration still left them without access to the Eucharist, as going through the work to establish a permanent chaplaincy would be far less provocative than what the CSPL seems to prefer.

Even more unlike other Catholic outreach efforts to ICE detainees, this initiative lacked any attention to Confession. At Alligator Alcatraz, the priests there have heard thousands of confessions from detainees, many of whom are indeed criminals of various stripes beyond their immigration status. Providing the Mass and the opportunity to atone for one’s sins is the way to treat illegal immigrants as spiritually mature souls in need of saving, not just as political props. To exercise a genuine Christian love for migrants, the idea that the consequence of their immigration status expunges their sins must be wholly dismissed.

This erroneous perspective on immigration has infected much of the Catholic and Protestant churches. As the Catechism states, the virtue of hospitality obliges nations to accept foreigners in search of security or the means of living. Still, the migrant must also “obey its laws and to assist in carrying civic burdens,” subject to the juridical qualifications set by their host country. This mutual relationship, grounded in Christian affection for the downtrodden, requires a heart of generosity in the nation and a bond of gratitude on behalf of the migrant.

Yet the Church’s advocacy in this regard often fails to capture this sentiment.

Priests for Justice for Immigrants, a pro-migration installation in the Diocese of Chicago, lists its mission as “to influence the public conversation regarding immigration policy and to promote the basic human rights and well-being of immigrants and their families living in our communities.”

This formulation, befitting a secular NGO, makes no mention of the spiritual needs of migrants. It does not take seriously the fact that migrants are sinners like the rest of us and require opportunities to repent and come closer to Christ. This progressive mindset only conceives of migrants as victims of state violence and fails to capture the ensouled dimension of their humanity, fixating on their utility as a political lever.

The struggle over immigration is an ongoing one and will remain a constant source of friction between conservative politics and the social witness of the Catholic Church. Regardless of the state’s immigration policy, the Church’s mission remains fixed, to accompany the migrant as an icon of Christ’s hospitality, and bring them to the fullness of the faith. Anything else would see the Church reduced to one of dozens of other pro-migration secular organizations.

But it would perhaps facilitate deportations when combined with other measures, some draconian and themselves arguably (and they will be passionately argued) in breach of human rights.

Leaving the EHCR and its European court, the Strasbourg Court, is now Conservative Party policy as well as that of Nigel Farage and his stooge party, Reform UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said that the government is examining the way the courts interpret Articles 3&8 of the ECHR, dealing with torture & inhuman treatment, and privacy, respectively, though he has said the government will not leave the Convention, which has been written into UK law since the Human Rights Act (HRA) 1998.

Farage announced in a speech in Oxford in August that the UK would leave the ECHR if his party were in power. Reform sees the Convention as a barrier to its planned mass deportation of people who have entered Britain illegally and remain in the country at the expense of taxpayers. Reform UK wants to deport 600,000 people over five years but has given hardly any details how this would be achieved apart from through negotiating returns agreements with other countries. Good luck with that.

The Tory plan

The Conservatives, in a probably vain attempt to pander to Reform supporters, announced at their annual conference in early October, that they too would depart the ECHR and deport 750,000 people. But their leader Kemi Badenoch at least recognised that quitting the Convention would not be an immigration silver bullet and set out a plan of other measures. The Tories would:

Rebrand the Home Office’s immigration enforcement unit as a “Removals Force” with new powers, and double its budget by an extra £820mn per year, which they say could be unlocked by closing asylum hotels

Mandate the new Force to remove 150,000 people a year for five years, including people currently living in the UK illegally, future illegal arrivals and all foreign nationals convicted of an offence more serious than minor parking or speeding offences

Ban people who enter the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum

Negotiate returns agreements with other nations, and threaten to withhold aid spending and visas from countries that decline to co-operate

Instruct police forces to check the details of everyone they arrest against biometric borders data and allow the use of facial recognition without informing the public it is in use. This is likely to be fiercely contested under the Data Protection Act 2018 as well as the HRA, and is contrary to guidance from both the Information Commissioner’s Office and the College of Policing

Expand an unspecified “existing facility” to detain migrants before they are removed, with a capacity for between 1,000 and 2,000 people

Restrict the grounds for claiming asylum to those facing a threat from the government in their home country, excluding claims from those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality

Abolish the Immigration Tribunal, which hears challenges to failed asylum claims, handing the appeals process instead to a team of officials within the Home Office

Abolish taxpayer-funded legal aid in immigration cases, with a document on the proposals arguing there “will be no need for lawyers” because claims would be “fairly assessed against the criteria”

At least this is a plan. But as a layman, I can only imagine with alarm the flood of human rights abuse claims likely to flood our courts if these measures were implemented – and not just from asylum seekers. Will British citizens not be among those challenging the new powers for the Removals Force? And what about allowing the use of facial recognition without informing the public?

The threat to the Human Rights Act

Indeed, it is mainly rights other than those directly connected (if at all) with immigration and asylum that would be at risk if the UK left the ECHR. This is plain to see in a piece referring to “the threat to the HRA”. written by Professor Conor Gearty KC of the London School of Economics before his recent death and newly published in the London Review of Books. In arguing that rights are already being eroded by the UK Supreme Court, he cites cases not related to immigration, but to trans people, the rehabilitation of offenders, the two-child benefit cap, compensation for victims of miscarriages of justice, and the release of information about end-of-life decisions related to young children (including a Newcastle Hospitals case), “The Supreme Court is quietly editing the HRA out of existence,” writes Gearty.

And think about the foreign policy repercussions. How and with which nations would the government negotiate returns agreements? What would be the effect on our global reputation if we started using Trumpian bully tactics by withdrawing spending and visas from countries that refuse to co-operate?

Starmer’s announcement of a well-intentioned attempt to find a compromise by reviewing the way Sections 3&8 of the ECHR are interpreted by the courts faces equally high hurdles. Starmer must mean amending the Convention as written into the HRA, which it is within the power of the UK Parliament to do. Re-writing the identical document for the Strasbourg court, however, would require the agreement of all 45 other signatory nations, a virtually impossible task.

Any such attempted negotiation would focus on withdrawing the UK from the right of individual petition to Strasbourg and from Article 46 of the Convention, which requires compliance with judgements of the court, suggest two eminent supporters of leaving the ECHR, the KCs Professor Richard Ekins of Oxford University and Sir Stephen Laws, in a recent report for the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange.

If negotiations did fail, leaving the Convention as applied by Strasbourg as it is but the version used in UK law amended to make deportations easier, it seems inevitable that there would be a flood of new appeals to the Strasbourg court by those who have been turned down in the UK.

The number of successful appeals to Strasbourg could easily rise from negligible to significant – exactly the outcome that politicians of all parties want to avoid and increasing the pressure to leave the ECHR altogether. Alternatively, appellants might pursue their cases through other UK laws, including their common law rights, as Ekins and Laws also point out.

What the ECHR says

It is worth at this point reminding ourselves exactly what the two relevant Sections of the ECHR say. Section 3 states:

“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”

This right is non-derogable – it cannot be limited or suspended even in times of war or emergency. The Strasbourg court has interpreted inhuman treatment as causing intense physical or mental suffering, and degrading treatment or punishment as debasing the individual, showing lack of respect for human dignity.

Section 8 says:

“Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.

“There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” This is a wide range of exceptions and one can certainly imagine why the UK government would want to ensure the courts take greater account of them, using them to reject more applications.

So, if the Tory plan would fail because it would have a negligible effect on immigration and asylum numbers while leading to more human rights abuses in other fields such as secret public surveillance; Labour’s because it would tend to shift the balance of final asylum decisions back to Strasbourg; and Reform’s because it has no plan, what can be done?

Ekins and Laws do set out a coherent case for the UK leaving the ECHR. Argued out in their 80-page report, in essence it is the quite commonplace one that in a democracy like the UK it is the elected parliament, not courts, wherever they may be, that should decide within the bounds of humanity what rights people have (No responsible person is suggesting that immigrants and asylum seekers should be exposed to execution, torture on inhuman treatment by being deported to a country under a murderous regime – at least, one hopes not, though one fears Farage might not care).

Farage is mistaken if he believes the British people are with him on this. Opinion polls by YouGov since 2013 and analysed by The Independent show that more people consistently favour remaining in the Convention than leaving. The most recent poll this month (October) found 46% opposed to leaving and 29% in favour.

The case for leaving the ECHR

Human rights law (whether British or European), believe Ekins and Laws, is not the same as human rights, which should be compatible with our laws in any case: “The HRA and the ECHR, taken together, upend the traditional balance of the Westminster constitution, compromising both effective government and parliamentary democracy, as well as creating unacceptable risks for the reputation of the judiciary for political impartiality,” they write. They see the ECHR as interpreted by the Strasbourg court as a moving target constantly inhibiting the ability of governments to legislate in all sorts of fields which should be matters for them alone, subject to parliamentary approval.

They agree with Gearty at least to the extent that all believe withdrawal from the ECHR would have wider implications than in the field of asylum and immigration: “Unhappiness about European human rights law may seem largely focused on immigration, asylum and deportation; but the reason for this is that those topics are, at present, the most politically salient examples of where the law and practical politics collide and diverge,” they write. “There can be little doubt that, if other topics developed greater political salience (say, climate change or welfare reform), judicial intervention in practical policymaking and administrative decision-making on those topics would attract similar unhappiness (as was seen, in the not so recent past, in relation to lawfare against UK forces).”

Pandora’s Box

So, all the options for leaving the ECHR have serious drawbacks:

Leaving the Strasbourg court and repealing the HRA would open a Pandora’s Box of claims of abuse in a wide range of areas

Leaving the ECHR but keeping the HRA unamended would result in a negligible reduction in successful asylum claims, as the number of cases rejected in the UK that go on to be successful in Strasbourg is already very small

Leaving the ECHR and amending the HRA would certainly make it more difficult for successful asylum claims to be made on grounds of human rights law; but applicants would doubtless seek other legal avenues, such as common law rights

Remaining in the ECHR but amending the HRA to make successful claims more difficult (the Starmer plan) would likely encourage more applicants unsuccessful in the UK courts to appeal to Strasbourg – just the outcome no political party wants – unless a way could be found to prevent them.

While leaving the ECHR as applied by Strasbourg would on its own have a negligible effect on the numbers, it would be a highly significant symbol of sovereignty, satisfying the instincts of some voters by whom it would be seen as “doing something” – but nothing effective, as we have seen. Anyway, it’s not what most people want, as we have also seen.

Conclusion

There’s no reason in principle why a liberal democratic country like the UK should not have its own human rights laws determined by its own parliament, but the benefits of leaving the ECHR would be so slight and uncertain in terms of immigration and asylum and the potential disadvantages significant enough in terms of counter-productivity and damage to our international reputation that leaving the Convention as advocated by the Tories and Reform UK would be unwise as well as inhumane and unethical in the eyes of many.

Ultimately this is a question of trust and empathy. Who do voters trust – or rather, who should they be able to trust – to strike a fair balance between the human rights of asylum seekers and immigrants and the legitimate interests and concerns of the British people: Parliament, ministers (effectively Home Office civil servants acting at the behest of ministers in accordance with UK law), UK courts and tribunals, or the ECHR as implemented by the Strasbourg court? And do these voters have sufficient regard for the rights of asylum seekers to care? The polling evidence suggests they do.

This is good news as far as it goes. But given that it is possible the UK will have a Reform government by 2029, and if Gearty is correct that the HRA is already being eroded, it would be reckless to cast aside the backstop of the ECHR and the Strasbourg Court.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSNCRcNFBlA4Mnts/2da880ab54ad0cd02724d881bafff3a44a0057ec7952013f67246a7feccf1351/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=basic-6&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2023%252F10%252Fnwb0.png%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F10%252Fdreamstime_l_308296276-1.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Human%2520rights%2520%2528Part%2520Three%2529%253A%2520The%2520UK%25E2%2580%2599s%2520ECHR%2520debate%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Fhuman-rights-part-three-the-uks-echr-debate-2,N,,2025-10-28 08:00:30.467018

Despite the last-minute failure this summer of his controversial litigation finance bill that would’ve added a 41% tax on investors, Tillis will continue to push for a new version.

“We’re going to go after it,” he said during a Bloomberg Government roundtable on Monday.

In April, Tillis introduced the Tackling Predatory Litigation Funding Act, which would impose the tax on profits earned by third-party entities that finance civil litigation. The bill describes the tax as being equal to the highest individual rate, 37%, plus an additional 3.8%. The bill was included in Senate Republicans’ version of President Trump’s “big, beautiful” bill in June. The tax was eventually removed from the bill by the senate parliamentarian.

Tillis, who is not seeking reelection and will end his term next year, said the reason for the bill is that there needs to be equitable tax treatment across the board and because it’s “silly” that investors in lawsuits have better tax treatment than the victims who receive an award.

The suggested inclusion of the bill in the reconciliation package caused an uproar in the funding space and prompted a blitz of lobbying from the industry trade group the International Legal Finance Association and funders. Tillis said he took notice and was surprised by how they mobilized.

“I think some of the players that didn’t want to see a change in the tax treatment did an extraordinarily good job of walking all over the Hill over the past couple of months,” he said.

“I was impressed with the sheer amount of money,” he added. “You couldn’t throw a rock and not hit a contract lobbyist who hadn’t been engaged to fight this evil, equitable tax treatment bill that Tillis had.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/7503f64/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F40%2Ff3da06f747dcbce7d4da5f2f640d%2Ftillisag-007.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 13:04:23.130397

Jackie Merlos and her four U.S. citizen children were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in late June.
Agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained Merlos as the sisters were saying goodbye, a close family friend told KGW.
""My heart goes out to the entire Merlos family and to all of the families who are continuing to fight to be with their loved ones again.""
The spokesperson said the children initially remained with their mother at her request in Border Patrol custody.","PORTLAND, Ore. — A Portland mother has been released following months in federal custody, according to Congresswoman Maxine Dexter. Dexter, who advocated for the woman's release, announced the update Monday alongside Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici.

Jackie Merlos and her four U.S. citizen children were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in late June. Merlos was visiting her sister, a Canadian citizen, at Peace Arch Park along the U.S.-Canadian border. Agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained Merlos as the sisters were saying goodbye, a close family friend told KGW.

""I'm so grateful to have my freedom today. So many people have been by my side in this long journey. I'm so appreciative. I can't wait to hug my babies. And then I will get to work for others like me,"" Merlos said in a statement provided by Dexter's office.

Her release came hours after Dexter announced that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed on Merlos' behalf, challenging the legality of her continued detention in federal court.

Merlos, originally from Honduras, is not a U.S. citizen but has a pending U-visa, according to court filings in the case. A federal judge terminated removal proceedings against her in mid-October.

""Jackie's freedom is proof that the power of the people is greater than the people in power,"" Dexter said. ""Oregonians refused to be silent, and because of that, Jackie is free and will be home with her children. This is a moment for celebration, but it's also a painful reminder that justice was long delayed and actively undermined by the federal government.""

Mimi Lettunich and her husband Kris Wigger, who cared for Merlos' children since July, said they were relieved that she was finally being released.

""Today is an important day. We picked up our dear friend after four months of cruelty and wrongful detention,"" Lettunich and Wigger said. ""Tenacity, heart and justice prevailed over the Trump administration's egregious immigration policies. It took countless lawyers, members of Congress, national advocacy groups, friends and family from all political affiliations to make this possible.""

Wyden said the delegation's teamwork helped free Merlos and reunite her with her children.

""Jackie Merlos should never have been cruelly separated from her kids and illegally imprisoned thanks to Donald Trump's scattershot immigration schemes,"" Wyden said. ""I'll never stop pushing back against this Trump madness so that due process and civil rights are upheld for everyone in America.""

Merkley said Merlos' detention lasted more than 100 days.

""If we allow families to be torn apart and our neighbors to be detained by their government indefinitely without due process, we surrender the values that define our great republic,"" Merkley said. ""Trump continues to shred our Constitution, allowing due process to be illegally denied and using ICE to stoke fear and uncertainty in our communities.""

Bonamici said ICE should not have separated the family.

""Many families, like Jackie's, are being ripped apart by an out-of-control federal agency using cruel, violent, and often illegal enforcement tactics,"" Bonamici said. ""My heart goes out to the entire Merlos family and to all of the families who are continuing to fight to be with their loved ones again.""

According to a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson, Merlos was arrested by Border Patrol agents in Peace Arch Park on June 28. The spokesperson said at the time that Merlos was ""attempting to smuggle illegal aliens into the U.S."" and that ""removal proceedings have been initiated."" The spokesperson said the children initially remained with their mother at her request in Border Patrol custody.

Dexter said it took around 12 days to locate the family after the arrest.

Burke said Nauruan authorities had confirmed the arrival on Friday, as reported by the ABC, triggering the first yearly instalment of $408m.
Nauru’s trust fund will receive a further $70m each year from Australia as part of the deal, totalling more than $2.5bn across the three decades.
The deal’s fine print allows Australia to “claw back” any funds provided to the trust should Nauru fail to deliver on the deal.
“Some of the people facing deportation to Nauru have lived in Australia for most of their lives.","Australia has commenced its $2.5bn deal with Nauru to offload more than 350 people from the NZYQ cohort after the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, confirmed the first arrival had landed on the tiny Pacific island last week.

Burke said Nauruan authorities had confirmed the arrival on Friday, as reported by the ABC, triggering the first yearly instalment of $408m.

“When someone’s visa is cancelled they should leave,” Burke said in a statement.

No further information is known about the man’s case or circumstances at this stage.

The deal between Australia and Nauru is expected to last 30 years and will allow Australia to apply for 30-year long-term visas on behalf of the cohort to enable their deportation from the country.

Around $20m of the first instalment will become immediately available for the Nauruan government to “facilitate the settlement”, while the remaining $388m will go into a sovereign trust fund, which is expected to include board members from both the Nauruan and Australian governments.

Nauru’s trust fund will receive a further $70m each year from Australia as part of the deal, totalling more than $2.5bn across the three decades.

Details of the agreement remain a secret, subject to a public interest immunity claim. But home affairs department officials claim those sent to Nauru, many of whom have been found to be refugees, will be able to live freely within the community and cannot be sent to another country, where they could face persecution in a situation known as chain refoulement.

Department officials indicated earlier this year a former regional processing centre, handed to Nauru by Australia, could be used as temporary accommodation while the cohort is settled in. It’s not known what state the centre is in.

The deal’s fine print allows Australia to “claw back” any funds provided to the trust should Nauru fail to deliver on the deal.

Burke has suggested around two dozen people released under the high court’s NZYQ ruling against indefinite detention have been granted visas so far. Guardian Australia is aware of at least eight who have been redetained awaiting deportation.

Adnan*, a man within the NZYQ cohort, told Guardian Australia he hadn’t heard of Nauru prior to being redetained earlier this year by Australian Border Force officials in a night-time raid.

“I thought there had been a mistake. I hadn’t had a lawyer for years, and I had never really understood what was happening in my case,” he said through his lawyer.

“These days are like living in a nightmare. I made mistakes since I came to Australia – I have been punished for those mistakes. I have tried everything to put my life back on track. I am not a young man – I cannot keep rebuilding my life. I do not know why Australia has selected me for this terrible punishment.”

The associate legal director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Laura John, accused the federal government of being “willing to completely disregard the basic rights of migrants and refugees” in a process shrouded in secrecy.

“We do not know if the person who has been exiled has left family behind in Australia, whether they need medical care that is unavailable in Nauru, or even if they still had visa appeal options in Australia,” she said.

“This secrecy is not an accident. It is a deliberate tool wielded by the Albanese government to ensure that it does not have to grapple with the real, human consequences of its actions.

“Some of the people facing deportation to Nauru have lived in Australia for most of their lives. Others are stateless and have no other home. Some have serious health conditions and will likely die in Nauru. All of them have already been doubly, or triply punished by the government. They should not be subjected to lifelong suffering.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715baff02a40a7de11f69569f912670be17dcb05/89_0_1500_1200/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9a1b06dcf7c322a60844f634df3ae2ce",N,,2025-10-28 04:57:17.515943

The hearing comes after a judge earlier this month ordered uniformed immigration agents to wear body cameras, the latest step in a lawsuit by news outlets and protesters who say federal agents used excessive force, including using tear gas, during protests against immigration operations.

Greg Bovino, chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, one of nine sectors on the Mexican border, is himself accused of throwing tear gas canisters at protesters.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis initially said agents must wear badges, and she banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She later said she was concerned agents were not following her order after seeing footage of street confrontations involving tear gas during the administration’s Operation Midway Blitz, and she modified the order to also require body cameras.

Ellis last week extended questioning of Bovino from two hours to five because she wants to hear about agents’ recent use of force in the city’s Mexican enclave of Little Village. During an enforcement operation last week in Little Village and the adjacent suburb of Cicero, at least eight people, including four U.S. citizens, were detained before protesters gathered at the scene, local officials said.

The attorneys representing a coalition of news outlets and protesters claim Bovino himself violated the order in Little Village and filed a still image of video footage where he was allegedly “throwing tear gas into a crowd without justification.”

Over the weekend, masked federal agents and unmarked SUVs were spotted on the city’s wealthier, predominantly white North side neighborhoods of Lakeview and Lincoln Park, where footage showed chemical agents deployed on a residential street. Federal agents have been seen and videotaped deploying tear gas in residential streets a number of times over the past few weeks.

Bovino also led the immigration operation is Los Angeles in recent months, leading to thousands of arrests. Agents smashed car windows, blew open a door to a house and patrolled MacArthur Park on horseback. In Chicago, similar Border Patrol operations have led to viral footage of tense confrontations with protesters.

At a previous hearing, Ellis questioned Kyle Harvick, deputy incident commander with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Shawn Byers, deputy field office director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, about their agencies' use of force policies and the distribution of body cameras. Harvick said there are about 200 Border Patrol employees in the Chicago area, and those who are part of Operation Midway Blitz have cameras. But Byers said more money from Congress would be needed to expand camera use beyond two of that agency’s field offices.

And despite ramping up arrests, ICE has largely fallen short of that goal.

There are more than 1,500 Border Patrol agents assisting ICE with immigration enforcement in the interior of the US.","The Trump administration is planning another shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement amid frustrations over lagging immigration arrests, according to four sources familiar with the discussions.

The White House set a lofty goal of 3,000 daily arrests earlier this year — a high bar for an agency that’s historically been strained for resources and personnel. And despite ramping up arrests, ICE has largely fallen short of that goal.

That’s fueled tensions between the White House and ICE. Planning has been underway to reassign at least a dozen directors of ICE offices nationwide who senior officials believe are underperforming, the sources said. ICE has 25 field offices.

“While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump Administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country,” said Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.

Since receiving its mass deportation edict after President Donald Trump took office in January, ICE has fielded criticism from people inside the administration who think they aren’t doing enough, lawmakers and advocates who think they are doing too much, and an incensed public that in some cases is taking drastic action to impede immigration enforcement.

To bolster immigration arrests, DHS tapped US Border Patrol agents to fan out across the country. They’ve have been involved in high-profile confrontations with protesters and at the center of some of the administration’s most controversial and aggressive enforcement actions.

Part of the discussions have involved replacing heads of certain ICE field offices with Border Patrol officials, the sources said, stressing that plans have not been finalized.

At the helm of the immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities is Gregory Bovino, who holds the title of chief patrol agent of the El Centro sector and has been the lead on the administration’s crackdown in cities — now, in Chicago.

Leadership at the Department of Homeland Security and the White House have touted the work of Bovino and the Border Patrol publicly and privately. There are more than 1,500 Border Patrol agents assisting ICE with immigration enforcement in the interior of the US.

But while ICE and CBP both fall under the Department of Homeland Security and are involved in immigration enforcement, they also execute different functions, raising concerns about potentially replacing some ICE leadership with Border Patrol officials.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2230972796.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-28 13:04:08.797730

While Immigration and Customs Enforcement is moving forward with widespread raids across the country, the agency says it doesn’t have the staff necessary to coordinate the congressional visits, as Politico first reported Monday.

One Democrat says it’s an excuse to block oversight.

“ICE wants to operate in the dark, and this president wants to let them,” Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, said in a statement first shared with NOTUS.

“Trump and Republicans are using the shutdown that they caused as an excuse to give ICE coverage to operate without oversight,” she continued. “It’s wrong and it’s not what happens in a democracy.”

McIver is facing federal charges following a scuffle with officers outside a New Jersey detention facility in May. She has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. She faces several years in prison if convicted of the three charges of assaulting federal officers.

Congressional visits have become some of the only ways to conduct oversight of the detention centers that have faced scrutiny over how detainees are treated. The Department of Homeland Security earlier this year made cuts to staff working on oversight of immigration operations.

But Department of Justice officials notified a federal judge on Oct. 21 that the funding for detention centers was coming from the tax cut and spending package lawmakers passed earlier this year, and not with funds subject to the oversight authority for members of Congress.

Lawmakers attempting to visit detention centers during the shutdown are getting denials or auto-responses saying that congressional liaisons for ICE are out of the office because of the shutdown, according to Politico.

The 2025 fiscal year was one of the deadliest for ICE detainees, with 21 immigrants dying in custody.

Lawmakers who attempted last week to visit places where the federal government holds immigrants were denied entry. Rep.

A mass shakeup of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership is underway amid growing friction inside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over deportation tactics and priorities, according to four senior DHS officials.

The overhaul affects ICE field offices in at least eight cities and will replace many senior leaders with Border Patrol officials, marking an unprecedented power shift inside DHS and exposing sharp divisions over how far to go in ramping up deportations, the officials told Fox News.

The changes are being driven by competing camps inside DHS.

On one side are Border Czar Tom Homan and ICE Director Todd Lyons, who have advocated focusing on criminal aliens and those with final deportation orders.

On the other side are DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, senior adviser Corey Lewandowski and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who have pushed for a broader and more aggressive approach, targeting anyone in the U.S. illegally to boost deportation numbers.

Two senior officials described the mood inside DHS as ""tense"" and ""combative,"" with some ICE leaders warning the new approach could erode public support and blur the line between ICE and Border Patrol operations.

""ICE started off with the worst of the worst, knowing every target they are hitting, but since Border Patrol came to LA in June, we’ve lost our focus, going too hard, too fast, with limited prioritization,"" one senior DHS official told Fox. ""It’s getting numbers, but at what cost?""

Another senior official put it bluntly, ""ICE is arresting criminal aliens. They [Border Patrol] are hitting Home Depots and car washes.""

Border Patrol agents have defended the new strategy.

""What did everyone think mass deportations meant? Only the worst?"" one agent told Fox News. ""Tom Homan has said it himself — anyone in the U.S. illegally is on the table.""

The internal friction comes as deportation totals remain below targets set by the administration earlier this year. Officials told Fox News that the latest round of reassignments impacts ICE field chiefs in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Denver, Portland, Philadelphia, El Paso and New Orleans — positions expected to be filled by Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.

A separate DHS official confirmed the personnel changes, describing them as ""performance-based"" and designed ""to move people around for the best results.""

Nauruan President David Adeang told his parliament on Friday that the first person had arrived under the new deal.

It comes about eight months after the Australian government announced Nauru had agreed to take the hundreds of former detainees released in the wake of a landmark High Court ruling that found indefinite detention was unlawful.

This third-country resettlement agreement — which the government has repeatedly refused to release publicly — is separate to a pre-existing and ongoing arrangement for Nauru to run Australia's offshore processing regime.

""Nauru confirmed last Friday that the first transfer has occurred,"" Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told the ABC on Tuesday.

NZYQ cohort's visas cancelled

About 358 former detainees have been released into the Australian community since the High Court ruling in 2023, the bulk of whom have been convicted of crimes or had their visas cancelled on character grounds.

More than a dozen have since been re-detained in Australia after being issued visas by Nauru, but deportations have been delayed by legal challenges.

Under the deal, members of the group are expected to be granted a 30-year visa that allows them to live and work in the community among Nauru's 12,000 or so residents, and to leave and re-enter the country.

Mr Burke said he had ""personally"" inspected the accommodation and health facilities that would be available to the deportees.

But human rights lawyers, advocates, and the Greens have loudly criticised the government's deportation plan, warning it may breach Australia's human rights obligations.

Payment due upon first arrival

Australia agreed to pay Nauru $408 million when the first deportee arrived on the island under a memorandum of understanding signed by officials last Tuesday.

That included $20 million to be paid directly to the government to cover set-up costs, and $388 million to be deposited into a long-term trust to be jointly managed by Nauru and Australia.

Australia will also pay an additional yearly sum of up to $70 million depending on how many people have been transferred to the island.

If the deal is upheld in full and all members of the cohort are transferred, it means Australia will end up spending more than $2.5 billion over the 30 year its lifetime — or more than $7 million per person.

But the value for Nauru will be greater, as the government will be able to immediately access interest generated by the trust.

In a statement last week, a Nauruan government spokesperson said the agreement reaffirmed ""Nauru and Australia's shared commitment to humane, lawful, and mutually respectful management of migration and settlement"".

Mr Burke defended the arrangement on ABC's Insiders earlier this month, highlighting that members of the NZYQ cohort had no right to remain in Australia given their visas had been cancelled.

""Cancelling a visa has to have meaning,"" he said.

""And until we landed this agreement with Nauru … we had a situation where for some people, no matter what laws they'd broken, cancelling a visa was meaningless.""

The Nauru agreement is the government's latest attempt to deal with the cohort after it was found scrambling for a solution in the wake of the High Court ruling, which centred on the case of one man known only as NZYQ.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6dd48baf75c2a51fa3d6f9743c972d47?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-10-27 22:56:59.562780

The Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition and other community partners say they have struggled to respond as more and more people are reporting ICE and Border Patrol sightings, many of which they say are hard to verify and create fear in immigrant communities.

During a news conference last week, advocates said they hope the hotline will create an accurate accounting of where immigration officials are working and what they’re doing in Maine “during a time of heightened enforcement and targeting of immigrants and refugees.”

“Agents are showing up at people’s homes without warrants, targeting day laborers, and using surveillance to track and intimidate our communities,” Presente! Maine executive director Crystal Cron said at a news conference Thursday, according to a copy of her remarks provided by the group. “This isn’t about public safety — it’s about control and fear.”

The coalition also launched a resource hub online with information on legal services and relief funds for families whose breadwinners were arrested by ICE.

Anna Welch, director of the Refugee and Human Rights Clinic at the University of Maine School of Law, said she hopes the hotline will combat the fear and confusion that immigrants in the state are experiencing. Welch said the clinic has held more than 300 legal consultations with ICE detainees in Maine jails and that clients often have questions about their basic rights and what will happen to their families.

“There’s just so much confusion, there’s just so much misinformation,” Welch said Monday.

Aside from news reports and rumors, such arrests have been a struggle to track. Dozens of incidents in Maine have come to light only because they involved local law enforcement agencies.

Family and loved ones of those arrested by ICE have also had a hard time finding people during the government shutdown, according to reporting from the Boston Globe.

U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, said her office has been trying to help some of these families for months and that U.S. Customs and Border Protection — whose agents carry out many immigration arrests in Maine — has refused to create its own locator service to report where it is holding people in its custody, unlike ICE.

“In the wake of the Administration’s sweeping edict to dramatically ramp up enforcement and detainment operations, some of these tools — including ICE’s own detainee locator system — have become unreliable,” Pingree said in a written statement Monday.

At the news conference, Cron said the organizations involved in the hotline hope it will help inform immigrant families who are trying to locate their loved ones after they’ve been detained or who worry they might be arrested.

The groups said they have more than 100 trained volunteers who will take calls from people who believe they’ve seen ICE or Border Patrol, and who will then confirm whether the reports are true.

A spokesperson for the ICE field office serving Maine referred a reporter to previous statements that the Department of Homeland Security’s leaders have made regarding hotlines in other states, some of which Secretary Kristi Noem has suggested “looks like obstruction of justice.”

Noem was not commenting specifically on the Maine program. Volunteers are only expected to document what they see, the groups said, not to intervene.

The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, which offers legal help and advocacy to immigrants in Maine, says it has been trying to keep up with arrests involving local law enforcement officers.

Spokesperson and attorney Lisa Parisio said ILAP is not involved in the hotline, nor could she comment yet on what impact it might have.

But Parisio said ILAP can also attest to the lack of information. Not only is there no centralized tracking system for ICE arrests, Parisio said, but fear among immigrants and ICE’s practice of arresting people and sending them out of state has also made getting information harder.

ILAP is aware of 22 incidents in Maine involving state and local police in which more than 50 people have been taken by immigration officials. Parisio said ILAP has received but not been able to verify several other reports.

“What is known shows a concerning and broad pattern of Maine law enforcement agencies across the state stepping outside of their roles and voluntarily diverting Maine’s resources to assist the federal administration with indiscriminate immigration enforcement, threatening the rights and safety of some of Maine’s most vulnerable residents,” Parisio said.",https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/ICE-Impersonator_66272.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-10-27 19:01:16.642034

More than 2 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. including 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and over 527,000 deportations,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This is just the beginning. President Trump and Secretary Noem have jumpstarted an agency that was hamstrung and barred from doing its job for the last four years. In the face of a historic number of injunctions from activist judges and threats to law enforcement, DHS, ICE and CBP, have not just closed the border, but made historic strides to carry out President Trump’s promise of arresting and deporting illegal aliens who have invaded our country. Illegal aliens are hearing our message to leave now or face the consequence: Migrants are now turning back before they even reach our borders. Migration through Panama’s Darien Gap is down 99.99%.""

Rioters and sanctuary politicians have not deterred ICE or CBP in their mission to protect the homeland from those who have no right to be in America. Day-in and day-out, DHS law enforcement is removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from American communities, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, drug dealers, and more. 70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens charged with or convicted of a crime in the U.S.",https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/24_0206_opa_og-image-dhs.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 18:16:41.530981

The result has been mounting frustration for congressional Democrats, who had already been suing the Trump administration for curtailing or limiting access to detention facilities prior to the shutdown. They said even when the requirement was on the books, ICE had thrown up roadblocks to their visits.

“Members and staff were informed that the denials were due to the ongoing government shutdown and a lack of available funding or personnel to facilitate the visits,” said an aide to one congressional office affected by the policy change, requesting anonymity due to the ongoing litigation.

Now, their emails requesting visits are either being denied or met with auto-replies.

“Due to the current hiatus in federal funding, ICE Office of Congressional Relations staff are currently out of the office and unable to respond to emails, phone calls, or perform other work-related duties. Once funding is restored, normal operations will resume,” read one recent auto-reply to a lawmaker’s office, reviewed by POLITICO.

Cobb is weighing whether to pause the ongoing lawsuit until the shutdown ends.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, acknowledged the shutdown’s impact on lawmaker visits and said the lawmakers themselves were to blame.

“While the Democrats may not care about shutting down the government and making millions of public servants go without a paycheck, maybe they will get back to work now that they have lost the precious appropriations rider they rely on to try to storm ICE facilities,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

McLaughlin’s comment appears to reference the scrum that broke out when Rep. LaMonica McIver and two other Democratic lawmakers visited a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, earlier this year. Federal prosecutors charged McIver with assaulting a security official after she and others intervened to prevent the arrest of Newark’s Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka. McIver has pleaded not guilty and has accused the Trump administration of “political intimidation.”

The Trump administration has attempted to punish Democrats during the shutdown by pinning the fallout on the left while ensuring the president’s own priorities continue uninterrupted.

General Rob Bonta said Monday that he anticipates the Trump administration, which last week announced plans to use federal election monitors in California, will use false reports of voting irregularities to challenge the results of the Nov. 4 special election.

Bonta, California’s top law enforcement officer, said on a call with reporters that he is “100%” concerned about false accusations of wrongdoing at the polling places.

Bonta said it would be “naive” to assume Trump would accept the results of the Nov. 4 election given his history of lying about election outcomes, including his loss to President Biden in 2020.

The attorney general also warned that Trump’s tactics may be a preview of what the country might see in the 2026 election, when control of the U.S. House of Representatives — and the fate of Trump’s controversial political agenda — will be at stake.

“All indications, all arrows, show that this is a tee-up for something more dangerous in the 2026, midterms and maybe beyond,” Bonta said.

The U.S. Department of Justice last week announced it would send election monitors to five California counties where voters are casting ballots in the Proposition 50 election to decide whether to redraw state’s congressional boundaries.

Federal election monitors will visit sites across Southern California and in the Central Valley, in Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties, the Justice Department said last week.

Gov. Gavin Newsom called the move an “intimidation tactic” aimed at suppressing support for Proposition 50 and inappropriate federal interference in a state election.

While federal monitoring is routine, particularly in federal elections, it recently has been viewed with heightened skepticism from both parties. When the Justice Department under President Biden announced monitoring in 86 jurisdictions across 27 states during last November’s presidential election, some Republican-led states balked and sought to block the effort.

Democrats have been highly suspect of the Trump administration’s plans for monitoring elections, in part because of Trump’s relentless denial of past election losses — including his own to Biden in 2020 — and his appointment of fellow election deniers to high-ranking positions in his administration, including in the Justice Department.

The California Republican Party requested the election monitors and cited several concerns about voting patterns and issues in several counties, according to a letter it sent to the Dept. of Justice.

Bonta, in his remarks Monday questioned the GOP claims, and denied the existence of any widespread fraud that would require federal election monitors. He compared the monitors to Trump’s decision to dispatch the National Guard to Democratic-led cities, despite an outcry from local politicians who said the troops were not necessary.

More broadly, Bonta told reporters that the Trump administration appears to be ready to fight the Nov. 4 results if Prop. 50 passes.

“People vote and you accept the will of the voters -- that’s what democracy is. But that’s not what they’re teeing themselves up to do based on everything that we’ve seen, everything that’s been said,” said Bonta, describing Trump’s recent call on social media for Republicans to “wake up.”

Bonta also said that the state would dispatch observers — potentially from his office, the secretary of state and county registrars — to watch the federal monitors at polling places.

Early voting has already started in California, with voters deciding whether to temporarily reconfigure the state’s congressional district boundaries. The Democratic-led California Legislature placed the measure on the Nov. 4 ballot in an effort to increase their party’s numbers in the U.S. House of Representatives .

Gov. Gavin Newsom and other backers of the measure have said they generally support independent redistricting processes and will push for nonpartisan commissions nationwide, but argued that Democrats must fight back against Trump’s current efforts to have Republican states reconfigure their congressional districts to ensure the GOP retains control of Congress after the 2026 election.

Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the U.S. Dept. of Justice, declined to comment on Bonta’s remarks. Baldassarre also declined to say how many election monitors would work in California.

Federal election monitors observe polling places to ensure compliance with the federal voting rights laws, and are trained to observe and act as “flies on the wall,” said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan and nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research, in an interview last week.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1158c1f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2F7e%2Fa6cc3ad64f73b5ed5a8e86ac6c19%2F1515347-me-0723-rob-bonta-juvenile-halls-gem-002.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 18:00:54.906380

Shackled and chained while miscarrying, denied prenatal care, given inadequate food and water—these are the conditions that pregnant women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention must endure.

Despite its own directive advising against detaining pregnant individuals, ICE has increasingly held pregnant immigrants in facilities across the country, where abuse and medical neglect go unchecked. Over the past nine months, the ACLU and partner immigrant rights groups, including the National Immigration Project, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, Sanctuary of the South, and SNAP, interviewed more than a dozen pregnant women who described horrific treatment at ICE facilities. We found widespread neglect and repeated violations of federal policy.

“Immigration detention is known for medical neglect, abusive conditions, and utter disregard for the dignity of people in ICE’s custody,” says Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, who co-authored a letter to ICE documenting these conditions. “Still, what we heard from the pregnant women we interviewed are some of the most horrifying stories I’ve heard about detention.”

Although ICE has stopped publicly reporting the number of pregnant individuals it detains, and has refused to provide this information to Congress, ICE acknowledged that Basile, a detention center in south Louisiana, was holding 14 pregnant women as of April 2025. That number reflects a broader trend of detaining people who should qualify for release under federal regulations, which require the release of women “medically certified as pregnant.”

Interviews with detained women reveal that ICE officers have arrested pregnant individuals even after they informed staff of their pregnancies, including survivors of domestic violence, who are at heightened risk.

In April 2025, Alicia* arrived for her routine ICE check-in in Louisiana and was detained without warning, sent to Basile. She soon discovered she was pregnant. She was taken to a local hospital for a blood test, but no one explained her medical treatment or provided interpretation. In detention, she received small portions of poor-quality food that left her feeling weak and hungry. By May, Alicia began experiencing severe abdominal pain, cramping, and bleeding. She reported her symptoms to facility staff, who transported her to an emergency room, where medical personnel performed an invasive uterine test without her consent, injected her with an unknown medication, and later informed her that she had miscarried.

Despite this miscarriage, ICE returned her to Basile that night and detained her for two more months. She continued to experience heavy bleeding, swelling, fever, and severe uterine pain, submitting repeated sick call requests that went unanswered. In July 2025, ICE deported Alicia, separating her from her children, and she later sought hospital care for a severe infection acquired while in custody.

Alicia’s experience is far from unique. Marie,* a graduate student and lawful visitor to the United States, was detained for more than 20 weeks at Basile during her high-risk pregnancy. Although she had informed ICE officers that she was pregnant, officers placed in solitary confinement after transferring her thousands of miles from the U.S-Canada border to Basile. She was not sent for medical treatment until other detained women advocated for her. Inside the facility, Marie said the food was often inedible and when she asked about missing prenatal vitamins, a nurse told her, “You won’t die if you don’t take them.”

Marie was released only after legal advocates intervened, but after her detention she developed eclampsia, endured a difficult delivery, and continues to struggle with postpartum depression linked to her detention trauma.

Other women’s stories mirror these experiences. Lucia,* who was detained after appearing for a regular check-in appointment with ICE, began to experience heavy vaginal bleeding in the middle of the night when she was two months pregnant. She requested immediate medical attention, but was not taken to see medical staff for several hours. Instead, medical staff took her to a small room and left her bleeding alone without providing her any food, water, or pain medication. Later that evening, after a significant loss of blood, she was taken to the emergency room, with her arms and legs shackled as she was actively miscarrying. When she arrived at the hospital, she required a blood transfusion because she had suffered a miscarriage.

Julieta,* detained for two months despite having a valid visa, was shackled at the ankles, hands, and waist during cross-country transport and feared that poor nutrition and stress could endanger her pregnancy. Ana,* six months pregnant and still in detention, was denied prenatal vitamins and meaningful medical care. Jenny,* visibly pregnant when detained in February 2025, was restrained during transport, suffered vomiting, diarrhea, and vaginal bleeding, and had limited access to drinking water.

Together, these accounts depict a systemic pattern of cruelty and medical neglect toward pregnant women in ICE custody, in direct violation of agency prohibitions on detaining and restraining pregnant individuals.

“The stories that are represented in this letter are just the tip of the iceberg,” Cho told NBC News earlier this month. “You have women who are talking about being shackled and restrained while they’re actively miscarrying; you have women begging and pleading for things as basic as prenatal vitamins and being denied.”

The ACLU and partners are calling on ICE to act immediately to address this systemic abuse. In a letter to Congress, advocates urged the agency to identify and release all pregnant, postpartum, and nursing individuals and to follow its own directives prohibiting detention except in rare circumstances. They also recommended establishing a clear process for pregnant detainees to request timely release, ensuring access to medical care that meets community standards, investigating neglect and abuse at Basile, and closing facilities that have repeatedly violated detention standards designed to protect pregnant and postpartum individuals.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/10/shame-on-ice-s.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 18:01:02.045813

“Sami has been a strong and outspoken voice against Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza and the dehumanization of the Palestinian people. It is clear that his unjust detention is nothing less than an attempt to undermine our Constitution and punish journalists for speaking the truth in order to shield Israel from accountability for its laundry list of war crimes and human rights violations.

“Our legal team is working towards his immediate release and aiming to hold ICE accountable for bowing to the whims of Islamophobes and supporters of the Israeli government.”

“You can’t have a trial if there’s no defendant,” Xinis said, finding it surprising the government had apparently not considered that fact, or had merely ignored it in favor of quickly deporting Ábrego García.
In his response, Ábrego García’s attorney, Jonathan Cooper of Quinn Emanuel, slammed the Liberia designation as an unrealistic removal destination and another effort to punish Ábrego García rather than abide by his request to be removed to Costa Rica.
As the hearing began, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Ábrego García’s attorney of Murray Osorio, informed Xinis that U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services officials were about to conduct a “credible fear interview” with his client regarding the Liberia designation.","GREENBELT, Md. (CN) — The Justice Department walked back a plan to deport Kilmar Ábrego García to Liberia as soon as Oct. 31 at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis Monday, after a reminder that such a removal would violate her court order blocking the Maryland man’s removal.

Xinis scheduled Monday’s hearing to address the government’s notice filed late Friday night stating it had selected Liberia as the fourth African country it would try to deport Ábrego García to after he was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March.

“Federal defendants have received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third-country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for petitioner’s arrival,” the Justice Department said in the Friday filing. “Defendants expect to be able to effectuate removal as soon as Oct. 31.”

The Barack Obama appointed judge appeared perplexed by the designation, as Ábrego García has repeatedly listed Costa Rica as a destination he would not challenge as he does not have the same fear of persecution that he’s stated regarding El Salvador and the Justice Department’s three prior African destinations.

Further, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in the Middle District of Tennessee, the Obama appointee presiding over Ábrego García’s criminal case brought after he was returned from El Salvador in June, has scheduled an evidentiary hearing Nov. 4.

The evidentiary hearing, Xinis noted, is meant to address pretrial motions in preparation for a looming January trial over Ábrego García’s immigration-related human trafficking charges.

“You can’t have a trial if there’s no defendant,” Xinis said, finding it surprising the government had apparently not considered that fact, or had merely ignored it in favor of quickly deporting Ábrego García.

Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign acknowledged that removing Ábrego García to Liberia on Oct. 31 would violate Xinis’ injunction barring his removal from the continental United States and stated the government would continue to abide by it.

Justice Department officials previously listed Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana as potential destinations, based on apparent assurances from the nations that any immigrant sent there would not be subject to persecution while there and will not be handed over to their home country if they have a reasonable fear of persecution there.

Ghana’s foreign minister Sam Okudzeto Ablawka rejected the idea that Ábrego García could be deported there, stating on Oct. 10 that the nation made clear to the U.S. government that Ghana would only accept West African migrants, “purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles.”

Liberia announced Saturday that it would accept Ábrego García “on a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis, following a formal request from the government of the United States,” its government said in a statement.

In his response, Ábrego García’s attorney, Jonathan Cooper of Quinn Emanuel, slammed the Liberia designation as an unrealistic removal destination and another effort to punish Ábrego García rather than abide by his request to be removed to Costa Rica.

“Simply put, the statute creates an order of operations that allows the government to lawfully remove petitioner only to Costa Rica,” Cooper said. “If it is not removing him there, then it cannot lawfully remove him at all.”

Cooper said he and his colleagues have not received any indications or evidence from the government that it has made any effort to effectuate removal to Costa Rica, the only thing it had provided was Friday’s notice of Liberia’s designation.

“This confirms that another country designation does not demonstrate good faith efforts to effectuate removal or any realistic prospect thereof,” Cooper wrote.

As the hearing began, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Ábrego García’s attorney of Murray Osorio, informed Xinis that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials were about to conduct a “credible fear interview” with his client regarding the Liberia designation.

Xinis quickly instructed Ensign to send word to USCIS that the interview cannot occur while Ábrego García’s attorneys were tied up in the proceeding, and to either delay the interview or the hearing.

She called the questionable timing “completely unacceptable” and “not fair play,” expressing frustration with the Justice Department and a lack of faith that the interview would be moved without a clear confirmation from Ensign.

Xinis ordered the parties to file a joint status update to determine further proceedings in the case, noting that she has yet to address Ábrego García’s claims that his due process rights have been violated throughout his ordeal.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/10/ap-kilmar-abrego-garcia-oct-10.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-27 18:01:06.141198

Hamdi, who is in the United States on a speaking tour, was detained on Sun., Oct. 26 at San Francisco International Airport apparently in response to his criticism of the Israeli government.

“Sami Hamdi’s detention is not the conduct of a confident democracy, but the hallmark of a government afraid of open debate. Revoking a journalist’s visa for views that challenge the administration’s preferred narrative sends a chilling message that foreign nationals who speak critically risk expulsion through political retaliation,” said Tim Richardson, director of PEN America’s Journalism and Disinformation Program. “Federal courts have already rebuked the administration for using deportations and visa revocations to silence dissent, making clear that targeting noncitizens for political speech is unconstitutional. Yet the government continues to wield immigration enforcement as a tool to censor, intimidate, and silence. Hamdi must be immediately released and allowed to resume his speaking tour without interference.”

We’ve got to come back next month.” Schramm said public pressure was one of the strongest tools available to share opposition to the Marana prison becoming an immigration detention center.","On a quiet patch of land surrounded by miles of cotton fields, and not far from the blinking lights of Marana’s regional airport, the turn-off to a vacant prison building is marked by an empty frame of a sign and a dead cactus, reduced to its ribs but still reaching to the sky. Outside the facility itself, cracked asphalt leads to low-lying gray buildings, some topped with barbed wire. The basketball court stands empty and lit.

The facility could soon be the site of an immigration detention center after private prison operator Management and Training Corp. (MTC) bought it from the state this summer, despite what appears to be growing community opposition and no opportunity for a vote from local officials.

A packed community forum turned impromptu organizing meeting, held Oct. 23, offered a first look for many into the reality of the detention center, what community members want to know about the project moving ahead, and how some of them may try to stop it.

MTC did not respond to a request for comment.

The meeting was convened by District 3 Supervisor Jen Allen, with panelists from the ACLU of Arizona, Just Communities Arizona and the Florence Project. Attendees took green question cards, discussed with others at their table, and formed a line to ask the panelists questions. They held Abolish ICE and Defund ICE posters, and often jeered or booed at the mere mention of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, moving into town.

Allen noted the potential “ripple effects” of opening a detention center, including the fear of local community members. “It affects our families, it affects our neighbors, our schools. It affects businesses. It affects every facet of our community,” said Allen. “Getting engaged now is the right time to be doing it.”

As Trump’s immigration crackdown continues to surge in many parts of the country, recent data point to an unprecedented number of people locked up in immigration detention centers. As of Sept. 21, about 60,000 people were detained, according to a data research center at Syracuse University. A 2022 study showed that “immigrants in counties with more detention space are significantly more likely to be arrested and detained by ICE.” That fear seems to have been one of the main reasons so many people turned out against the possible facility in Marana.

Among the 300-plus people who showed up Thursday night was Marana resident Evy McDonald.

She told Arizona Luminaria she wasn’t sure what to expect from the forum. But when she walked in to see those hundreds of people, “I felt like I walked into a sea of hope,” she said.

McDonald said she’s been an activist and protester for a half a century, and that the younger generations taking up social justice now have a lot to learn from their elders. “We were the young adults who burned draft cards, who burned bras,” she said. “If the center opens, there’s a lot we can still do to disrupt things. You have to be willing to put your privilege and your life on the line.”

She was one of many people that night who were making a call to action.

Here’s what people asked at the forum, and the key points of information to catch up on the status of a possible immigration detention center in southern Arizona.

How did we get here?

A key question attendees asked was how we got here, and who approved a plan to turn the shuttered prison into an immigration detention facility.

This summer, Congress approved $45 billion for new detention centers, part of an increase in spending for immigration enforcement that experts say would significantly grow America’s immigration enforcement apparatus. That would be a 256% annual budget increase to ICE’s current detention budget, according to the American Immigration Council.

MTC runs five immigration detention centers across the country, and one in Australia; the Marana facility would be the sixth in the U.S.

The Arizona Department of Administration, a state agency that acts as the administrative hub for state government, sold the building back to MTC in July for $15 million. MTC had previously operated a minimum security prison in the building until 2023, when the state ended the contract because the facility was operating at less than half capacity, according to a news release from Gov. Katie Hobbs’ office.

“MTC operates the Arizona State Prison — Marana, a minimum security prison with capacity for 500 male inmates. Over the last several years however, the facility has averaged an inmate population of 225,” the release said. “Despite the reduced population, ADCRR is required by contract to pay for nearly 475 beds. By ending the contract, the State will save an estimated $5 million in FY24, and nearly $10 million in FY25.”

The capacity of the Marana detention center is 500 people. In 2017, when the population of the private prison was near capacity at 487, the prison employed 119 people, according to a state audit of the facility.

As the state owned the facility, and it was already zoned for a prison, there was no local approval required for the sale to move ahead, said speakers on Thursday.

“I just want to point out that the state of Arizona did sell this to MTC. They didn’t have to,” said Noah Schramm, the Immigrants’ Rights and Border Policy Strategist at the ACLU of Arizona.

When the facility may open is uncertain. Liz Casey, of the Florence Project, said she’s been looking for job postings online as one way to see if they’re hoping to begin operations soon.

In an August statement to Arizona Luminaria, the Town of Marana said it had not been involved in the procurement process, and therefore did not track local reactions or concerns.

“As a municipality, we have always been in favor of a facility use that would generate local employment and create opportunities for collaboration on essential public services, such as road and street cleaning that could be performed by inmates,” the statement said.

Only one member of the Marana town council, Patrick Cavanaugh, attended Thursday’s meeting. He said it was frustrating to watch a detention center moving ahead without any clear levers to step in. “We’re not paying their bills, so there’s really nothing we can do,” he said. “In everything we’re seeing across this country, they’re not giving any due process. These are our neighbors, you know? That’s the problem here.”

What is the experience of people detained in private prisons, or other MTC facilities?

Conditions in immigration detention are stark, punishing and sometimes deadly, said Thursday’s panel.

Casey, a social worker with the Florence Project who helps document conditions in Arizona detention centers said that water and power outages, issues with access to hygiene, and medical neglect are common in immigration detention centers. Two people have died in Arizona immigration detention this year — one in Eloy and one in Florence.

Schramm, of the ACLU, echoed the critiques. “ICE detention centers across the country have consistently been places where people’s most basic and fundamental rights and dignity are violated,” he said.

“It is worth remembering that the people who are detained in these places often have not had a judge consider their case, have not had their day in court, have not been convicted of a crime,” Schramm said. “This is civil detention. It’s not supposed to be punitive, and yet, for years, we have heard so many stories of physical and verbal abuse by detention staff, of people being subjected to solitary confinement for the most minor infractions.”

Isaacson said that the push to cut costs was especially strong for private prison providers who made a profit by using less money than they were paid to run the facility.

“They’re competing for contracts with the government. That’s a competitive process,” she said. “They’ve got to come in as the lowest bidder, and then they’re going to make a profit on top of that. How do they do that? They do that by cutting corners.”

Watchdog groups have raised concerns about conditions at most of MTC’s immigration detention facilities

The MTC-owned and operated Imperial Regional Detention Facility in California did not have a nebulizer to help a detained person who eventually died of bronchopneumonia; at the time, the company had a policy to reorder medical supplies every two months regardless of whether they ran out earlier, according to a 2018 Human Rights Watch report.

At Otero County Processing Center a report from immigrant rights group Freedom for Immigrants found over 200 complaints of abuse between 2015 and 2018 that included inadequate food and medical attention, limited access to hygiene supplies and harassment by guards.

A lack of access to clean water, medication, along with freezing temperatures and lack of access to legal services were identified by Amnesty International from an April 2025 visit to the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Texas.

The El Valle Detention Facility in Texas was formerly the Willacy Detention Center, where advocates identified poor medical care, sexual abuse and overuse of solitary confinement.

IAH in Texas has had at least one detained person die following their detention; the ACLU of Texas has called for the facility to be shut down due to inadequate medical care and extensive use of solitary confinement.

A member of the audience also spoke about their decade of experience as a former correctional officer. Detainees faced abuse and violence, but so did staff, she said. “It is not good for anyone.”

Have immigration detention centers been stopped before?

While detention centers have been opened around the country, community organizers have stopped or slowed down efforts to open new facilities.

In Leavenworth, Kansas, a conservative community in an area full of federal and state prisons, some local officials and residents have used the permitting process as a public way to register their concern about a detention center in the area. Most recently, city leaders filed two lawsuits against CoreCivic, the company proposing to run the facility.

In 2011 in Florida’s Southwest Ranches, CoreCivic (formerly CCA) wanted to build a detention facility with a capacity of 1,500 people. But as residents in the neighboring town of Pembroke Pines were worried about dipping property values and were generally against the project, the city of Pembroke decided to cancel a contract supplying sewage, water, and fire-rescue services to Southwest Ranches. That was enough of a headache to scare away CoreCivic, which pulled out of plans to build in Southwest Ranches.

SouthWest Ranches sued Pembroke for damages — lost revenue. After a decade-long fight, they lost in court, and Southwest Ranches was billed with $2 million in legal fees.

Allen also said that localities have considered revoking permits or opening up a conversation about zoning again. She also suggested talking to the farmers around the heavily agricultural surrounding area about how this would impact them.

How will a new immigration detention center impact enforcement in communities?

Another Marana resident, Clement DeLarge, asked at the forum: “Is ICE going to be hanging out at churches and schools and things like that?”

Cities across the country have seen an uptick in immigration enforcement with the Trump administration’s mandate to increase deportation numbers.

In some communities, including most recently an aggressive blitz in Chicago, that has meant hostile stops by masked agents that leave people out of communication for days. More than 170 U.S. citizens have been held by immigration agents in recent months, ProPublica found.

Having an immigration detention facility in the region with capacity for at least 500 people would almost certainly lead to increased enforcement in Southern Arizona, the panelists said.

Detention center contracts sometimes include a minimum number of people that have to be detained, said Casey. “They will fill it,” she said. “If that means filling it with people from the neighborhood, that potentially could happen.”

Mo Goldman, an immigration attorney who has practiced law in Arizona since 2000, said he had witnessed “so much pain and hardship” in detention centers. He also reminded the crowd that the funding for the Marana private detention center would be provided by public dollars. “It’s not money that just comes out of nowhere,” he said.

Isaacson also noted that immigration detention centers, even as companies promised jobs, actually depressed property values and drained resources like water and electricity. “When is the last time y’all went shopping in Florence? Anybody looking at houses in Eloy on Zillow?” she asked. “You’re popping down a small city in the middle of your city, and again, you’re paying for that.”

The panelists also warned about the detention-related safeguards that have been eroded since the Trump administration took office, which will make it more difficult to fight against abuses. The administration shuttered the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, as well as the independent ombudsman office that monitored immigration detention..

Casey said that wrongful death lawsuits were one tool that remained, along with efforts by elected officials to attempt to get access to detention facilities as one means of oversight, even if those visits were no longer possible to conduct unannounced. Rep. Yassamin Ansari recently visited a detention center in Eloy to draw attention to what she says are abusive conditions faced by immigrants.

What’s next?

Multiple attendees called for Thursday’s meeting to be the first step in a campaign to block the possible immigration detention center.

Jeanne Lukasko said they wanted to see everyone in the same place next month to continue working together. “I’m seeing the energy here tonight. We’ve got to keep it going. We’ve got to come back next month.”

Schramm said public pressure was one of the strongest tools available to share opposition to the Marana prison becoming an immigration detention center. “As a private sale right now. I think the best thing, the most powerful thing, is to build clear public opposition,” he said. “Make it clear not only to MTC, but also to your local elected representatives, representatives in the House and the Senate, that this is intolerable, that this is a priority issue, that this is something that you will not stop bothering them about.”

William Joseph, a Marana resident, told Arizona Luminaria that he was “totally opposed” to the detention center. “I don’t trust ICE at all. They’re snatching people left and right.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed a notice late last week of their plan to deport him to the West African nation of Liberia as early as Friday. It's the latest in a series of African countries the agency has designated as possible destinations for the Salvadoran national.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a “well-founded fear” of violence from a gang that targeted his family. Earlier this year, his mistaken deportation to El Salvador, where he was held in a notoriously brutal prison despite having no criminal record, galvanized opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June.

During a status conference on Monday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned why the government does not simply deport Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica — a country he has said he is willing to go to because the government has promised he would welcomed as a legal immigrant and not re-deported to El Salvador.

“Any insight you can shed on why we're continuing this hearing when you could deport him to a third country tomorrow?” Xinis asked government attorneys. She noted that both the government and Abrego Garcia were “about to burn significant resources” in fighting over whether he can legally be deported to Liberia.

Government attorneys, including Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew C Ensign and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Guynn, didn't immediately have an answer but suggested it could be part of an upcoming court filing.

In the meantime, the attorneys said ICE is preparing to interview Abrego Garcia after he filed an official notice expressing fear of deportation to Liberia. His attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told the judge they have received some confidential documents pertaining to assurances from the Liberian government about how Abrego Garcia would be treated there. However, they are not satisfied by what they have received. He hinted that the Liberian government has only agreed to take Abrego Garcia for a limited time.

The administration’s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, who have argued that they violate due process rights and that immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.

When Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June, he was charged in Tennessee with human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss that case. A hearing on the motion to dismiss is set for next week, and Xinis noted the fact that the government seems ready to deport him just prior to that, saying his removal would be the end of the criminal case.

“It doesn’t pass the sniff test that there hasn’t been some coordination” Xinis said, noting that the hearing in the criminal case was “common knowledge.""

President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in Chicago has impacted people across the city and the surrounding suburbs.

Recently, federal agents tear-gassed a residential street on the North Side on Oct. 24, after detaining people in the predominantly White neighborhoods of Lake View and Lincoln Park, according to Block Club Chicago.

The Department of Homeland Security says it has arrested more than 1,500 people as of the beginning of October, though USA TODAY has not been able to independently verify their count.

Some immigration advocates call the arrests ""abductions."" Federal agents and agencies face lawsuits, including from a Chicago City Council member following her brief detainment at a hospital, and an ongoing case over accusations that agents have violated limits on how ICE can make arrests without warrants and during traffic stops.

Whether a U.S. citizen or not, here is what you should know about encountering a federal immigration officer:

If immigration officers approach or engage in public

Chicago's Office of Immigration, Migrant and Refugee Rights released a guide titled ""Know Your Rights & Resources: Upholding Justice and Rights for Every Chicagoan.""

A section by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant & Refugee Rights offers the following about rights when engaging with immigration agents in any location:

You have the right to remain silent.

You do not have to disclose your immigration status.

You do not have to sign anything you don't understand.

You can ask to speak with an attorney.

It also advises that people should remain calm and keep hands in sight.

If immigration officers come to your home

ICE agents do not have the legal right to enter your home without a warrant signed by a judge, according to ICIRR, which also explains that some ICE warrants are signed by other officers within the agency and do not give the same legal authority as those signed by a judge.

The National Immigrant Justice Center has sample images to spot the difference between the two kinds of warrants on its website.

Are you allowed to film immigration interactions?

Legal precedent indicates yes, filming a law enforcement officer conducting their official business in public is covered by the First Amendment. A column published by the Cato Institute said the Supreme Court hasn't ruled on it explicitly, but it has been upheld by seven federal circuits.

However, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in July, according to CBS12, that videotaping agents and posting it online could be considered ""doxing"" and therefore violence against officers.

The National Immigrant Justice Center says, if filming or taking notes of what's happening, take care not to interfere or obstruct the operation.

ICIRR also has a hotline for witnessing ICE activity: 855-HELP-MY-FAMILY (855-435-7693).

“You know how I feel, I was very much opposed,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to Japan.

“You can’t expect them to make unbelievably complex chips and computers and other things and pick people off the unemployment line that haven’t worked in five years.”

The president said factories that churn out “very, very complex, very highly sophisticated equipment” – like Hyundai’s new EV battery plant in Ellabell, Ga. – need to bring in specialized workers.

While such foreign laborers should focus on teaching their American counterparts, it’s a process that takes time, Trump added.

ICE officials rounded up 475 workers at the Hyundai plant on Sept. 4 in the largest single-site operation in the department’s history.

Video footage released by authorities showed some workers being shackled with chains around their hands, ankles and wrists – putting strain on the US’ relationship with South Korea.

Hyundai CEO José Muñoz said the battery plant – one of the largest economic development projects in the state’s history – will face a two- to three-month startup delay because of the raid.

Many engineers, equipment installers and other specialized workers were among those deported, attorney Charles Kuck, who represents some of the South Korean nationals, told the Associated Press.

Trump said Monday the White House is working on a “whole new” visa plan for specialized foreign workers.

“They’ll teach our people how to do it. Our people will be just as good as they are within a period of time and it’ll be a phase out, but we want them to bring in experts and that’s the way it is,” he stated.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/trump-says-very-much-opposed-114303571.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-10-27 18:01:29.643745

His administration has already canceled or threatened to cancel billions of dollars of previously approved federal spending and now wants to go after even more funding during the government shutdown.

States, cities, nonprofits and other groups have responded with more than 150 lawsuits accusing the Republican administration of an unlawful power grab.

An Associated Press analysis shows that so far, those suits are mostly succeeding in blocking the Republican president’s spending moves, at least temporarily. But most of the legal battles are far from over, and the Supreme Court, where Trump so far has been more successful, could have the final word on at least some of them.

The court’s conservative majority has been receptive at least in preliminary rulings to many emergency appeals from the administration. Legal experts say a pair of recent decisions by the court may bode well for the administration’s push to gain more control over government spending. Here’s a look at the current legal score and what could lie ahead:

Courts have mostly ruled against the administration so far

As of early October, court orders were at least temporarily blocking the Trump administration’s decisions in 66 of 152 lawsuits over federal spending, an AP analysis shows. In 37 of those cases, courts had allowed the administration to proceed. In 26 of the cases, a judge had yet to rule on the matter. The remaining 23 had either been dropped or consolidated.

The count reflects decisions by district courts, appeals courts and the U.S. Supreme Court and will almost certainly change as the cases progress.

WATCH: A look at Russell Vought’s influence and his push to reshape the government

The flurry of litigation reflects not only the administration’s aggressive effort to wrest control of spending, but the Republican-controlled Congress’ unwillingness to push back, said Zachary Price, a constitutional law professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.

“Congress seems to be following its partisan interests more than its institutional interests, and that puts a lot of pressure on courts,” he said.

It’s hard to say how much money the administration has withheld

Government watchdogs say the administration is blatantly ignoring a requirement in the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to report funding freezes to Congress.

Research by Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees estimated the administration was freezing, canceling or seeking to block a total of $410 billion as of early September. That’s equivalent to about 6% of the federal budget for the year that ended on Sept. 30.

The administration has disputed that number.

Since the shutdown started this month, the administration has targeted even more funding, primarily in places represented by Democrats.

The Trump administration is taking a page from Nixon

Legal scholars say no president has attempted massive, unilateral cuts like these since Richard Nixon. The moves reflect an expansive view of executive power that is at odds with the Impoundment Control Act, court rulings and the Constitution, which grants Congress supremacy over spending, experts say.

“The power they’ve claimed is the power to delay and withhold funds throughout the year without input from Congress,” said Cerin Lindgrensavage, counsel with Protect Democracy, which is involved in multiple lawsuits against the administration. “That’s a theft of Congress’ power of the purse.”

In a message to Congress earlier this year, the White House said it was “committed to getting America’s fiscal house in order by cutting government spending that is woke, weaponized, and wasteful.”

White House budget director Russ Vought, a proponent of withholding federal funds, has argued presidents long had the power to spend less money than Congress appropriated if they could cut waste or be more efficient, and that power is needed to address the country’s massive debt.

The government shutdown opened up a new opportunity to cut spending, he said this month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.”

“If I can only work on saving money, then I’m going to do everything I can to look for opportunities to downsize in areas where this administration has thought, ‘This is our way towards a balanced budget.’”

The administration has cut entire agencies

The 152 cases the AP identified challenge the closure of government agencies and offices, the cancellation of grants and other assistance and the attachment of new conditions on federal funding.

The administration has used the cuts, or threat of cuts, to try to impose its policies on gender, race, immigration and other issues.

But it’s not just money on the line. The funds supported jobs, school lunches, health programs, scientific research, infrastructure projects, foreign assistance, disaster preparedness, education initiatives and other programs.

Some notable rulings against the administration include the restoration of funding to 14 states that filed suit over nearly $2 billion withheld for electric car chargers and a block on potentially broad funding cuts to some of the country’s largest cities over their “sanctuary” immigration policies.

Judges have raised constitutional concerns

Judges who have ruled against the administration have often found strong reason to conclude the cuts, or threat of cuts, would violate the Constitution’s separation of powers by usurping Congress’ authority over spending.

They have also ruled the moves were most likely arbitrary under the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.

Judges who have sided with the administration have likened at least some of the legal claims before them to contract disputes that belong in a different court: the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

That court, which traces its origins to the mid-1800s, handles lawsuits by citizens seeking money from the federal government. Referred to as “the People’s Court,” it is separate from the district courts that are handling most of the high-profile litigation against the administration.

The Supreme Court has often sided with the White House

The high court’s conservative justices have allowed the administration to move ahead for now with plans to shutter the Education Department, freeze $5 billion in foreign aid and cut hundreds of millions of dollars for teacher training and research supported by the National Institutes of Health.

Those decisions may make it harder to challenge the administration’s spending cuts, though the high court has not yet considered their ultimate legality or overturned lower court rulings.

In the National Institutes of Health case, the high court ruled 5-4 in August that lawsuits over the cancellation of grant funding generally cannot be handled entirely by federal district courts. Instead, plaintiffs must sue in federal claims court for any money and turn to the district courts if they want to challenge the guidance that led to the grant terminations.

The impact of the Supreme Court’s decision is still unfolding, but it could force plaintiffs in the grant funding cases to start over in a new courtroom. In some cases, plaintiffs might have to decide if they want to sue on two fronts.

In the foreign aid case, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision in September suggested the Impoundment Control Act did not give private parties the right to sue over so-called pocket rescissions.

That’s when the president submits a request to Congress not to spend approved money, but does it so late in the fiscal year that Congress doesn’t have time to act and the funds go unspent.

Trump notified House Speaker Mike Johnson in August of a pocket rescission for the $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

Though the Supreme Court stressed its decision was preliminary, legal experts say it could make it easier for the Trump administration to use the tactic again.

The panel made its recommendation just days after President Donald Trump backed down from his earlier plans to send federal immigration agents to the city.

Jessy Ruiz Navarro was one of two people to apply to the commission, on which she is already serving, for a term ending June 6, 2026. Gay Board of Supervisors President Rafael Mandelman said it’s important she continue serving at “a time trans folks and people from Latin America in particular are experiencing extreme hate and oppression in this country … from the federal government.”

Mandelman moved to forward Navarro’s nomination to the full board as a committee report Monday, with Rules Committee colleagues Supervisors Matt Dorsey, a gay man who represents District 6, and Stephen Sherrill, who represents District 2, voting yes. Dorsey was filling in for District 10 Supervisor Shamann Walton, who was excused.

The full board is expected to vote on the matter Tuesday.

Navarro, who has been living in San Francisco since 2017, has been serving on the commission since 2019. She is one of a handful of trans city commissioners.

“For me, remaining in this position is not only important but necessary, in particular representing the immigrant community and my trans community,” Navarro said, speaking in Spanish that was translated by an interpreter. “In the current political context, our voices, those of trans women, are often unheard or ignored. It is therefore essential we continue to fight for fair policies and representation.""

Since returning to office in January, Trump has made it a point to sign executive orders attempting to delegitimize the transgender community. The Biden administration had interpreted federal civil rights statutes referring to sex as inclusive of gender identity, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock vs. Clayton County, but Trump has rejected that.

Trump has also sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents, as well as federalized National Guard troops, to several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago. San Francisco was about to be added to that list, with border patrol agents showing up to the Alameda Coast Guard facility last week shortly before Trump called off a planned “surge” in the Bay Area.

As the Bay Area Reporter reported, Mayor Daniel Lurie stated Trump phoned him last week and called off the operation after he told Trump the city’s economy was recovering and public safety had been improved.

“We appreciate that the president understands that we are the global hub for technology, and when San Francisco is strong, our country is strong,” Lurie stated.

Trump wrote on social media that “friends of mine who live in the area” were key to the decision, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who he said spoke highly of Lurie and of the city’s efforts to turn the corner on crime. (Benioff had previously told reporters he welcomed National Guard troops to the city before backtracking amid fierce criticism from local leaders.)

Trump stated October 23, “I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it [San Francisco] around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the law does not permit him to remove. I told him, ‘It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?’ The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject.”

Even before Benioff’s comments, Trump had referenced sending National Guard troops to San Francisco on more than one occasion. The operation that was expected to begin last week did not include Guard troops, though San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins told the B.A.R. city leaders thought an immigration enforcement surge was a pretext to do so later on.

Navarro, who works for the Mission Neighborhood Health Center, said her asylum claim was recently accepted.

4 trans commissioners

Navarro is one of four trans-identified commissioners on the city’s oversight bodies – the others being Monroe Lace of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission, Joaquin Guerrero of the Homeless Oversight Commission, and Cecilia Chung of the Commission on the Status of Women.

In late September, Lurie took some heat for opting not to reappoint Jane Natoli, a trans woman, to the airport commission.

Navarro had a competitor for the seat in city resident Samim B. Shaikh, who is a co-chair for the Yaseen Women's Committee, an Islamic community association in Burlingame.

Shaikh said she has a degree in international relations and did “research centering on the factors driving global migration.”

In her application seeking appointment, Shaikh said, “As an immigrant myself I believe it is important to recognize and understand the diversity in immigrant communities, the diversity within countries of origin, and the reasons for immigration as well as the immense challenges that immigrant communities face.”

Mandelman said that ultimately, “It’s not great when you have two folks who you want to see both on the body come forward, but I do feel at this particular moment, the balance comes for Jessy Ruiz Navarro.”

But one, boarding around 11:30 a.m., was unlike the others.

The passengers were in handcuffs. They stood on the tarmac, next to three vans and a coach-style bus. Dozens were soon loaded onto an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement flight.

Who the detainees are, or where they are from, is unclear. But they were bound for Alexandria, Louisiana — the Trump administration’s major deportation hub, where immigration lawyers warn due process rights disappear.

The Oct. 24 departure was one of more than four dozen ICE flights that moved through the Indianapolis airport, records show, since early July. In an email, the Indianapolis Airport Authority said ICE is using the runways three times a week. But if you’re flying out, you probably won’t see them.

Detainees on charter flights depart from a private facility tucked away on the north side of the airport, separate from the main buildings. It’s the same area where politicians and professional sports teams fly in and out.

ICE did not answer questions about the flights or respond to requests for comment.

But Mirror Indy witnessed men with badges, including one wearing a black jacket that said “POLICE ICE,” shuffle groups of people with bound wrists onto an Eastern Air Express flight. The airline, headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, is one of three working with the federal government to rapidly transport people between detention centers and out of the country.

The scale of this federal operation is unprecedented, said Savi Arvey, an immigration researcher. She heads the ICE Flight Monitor team, a nationwide project run by a human rights group tracking the planes in real-time. Last month, as the number of ICE flights hit a record high across the country, Indianapolis caught their attention for the first time.

“It’s a new ICE Air destination,” Arvey said.

‘No meaningful due process’

Angela Joseph, an Indianapolis immigration attorney, is used to her clients being moved around the Midwest. But this year, some started popping up in detention centers in Louisiana.

“I didn’t know about the ICE flights,” Joseph told Mirror Indy. “But nothing this administration does surprises me anymore.”

She is among advocates who say the Trump administration is moving immigrants around to isolate them from family and from lawyers trying to defend them. Immigration is generally a civil matter, and non-citizens have constitutional rights to hire legal counsel in deportation cases and receive a fair hearing before a judge. According to federal data from September, people with no criminal record now make up the largest group in ICE detention.

“There’s no meaningful due process,” Joseph said. “Before you can do anything legally, they’re on a plane and back in their home country.”

Local flight data reviewed by Mirror Indy shows planes arriving here from Gary, Minneapolis and most recently, Youngstown, Ohio. At first, according to ICE Flight Monitor, a different airline was taking detainees from the Indy airport: Global X, which was flying regularly to another deportation hub in Harlingen, Texas. By Oct. 8, Eastern Air Express had taken over with weekly flights to Alexandria, Louisiana.

Both airlines did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Neither did Million Air, a fixed-base operator at the Indianapolis airport. The luxury company based in Houston services private planes at locations across the country with fuel, maintenance and ground support. It took care of celebrities and athletes flying in for the Indy 500 and NBA All-Star Weekend.

On Oct. 24, two Mirror Indy journalists observed an Eastern Air Express flight taxiing to Million Air’s facility off of Pierson Drive. They watched from the parking lot as workers set up stairs for boarding and began servicing the Boeing 737.

Before any people boarded, a Million Air employee told Mirror Indy’s reporter and photojournalist to leave.

“So these are ICE flights with detainees?” the reporter asked.

“This is private property,” the employee replied.

Mirror Indy then went to a public road and shot pictures of the flight from about 900 yards away. Photos show detainees lined up, waiting to board. They wore regular clothes — a requirement listed in the 2024 ICE Air Operations Handbook. The manual outlines how detainees must be fully restrained on the planes with handcuffs, shackles and leg irons.

“If the flight goes down, is someone going to unshackle them?” Joseph, the immigration attorney, asked.

Indy airport says it can’t stop ICE flights

The Indianapolis Airport Authority said the federal government does not have to tell them about the ICE flights, including their duration or frequency.

The airport was informed about ICE’s activities in September, a spokesperson said. ICE Flight Monitor tracked the federal agency using the airways in Indianapolis as early as July, though records show flights ramped up in September.

“The Indianapolis International Airport is a federally regulated public use facility,” an airport spokesperson said in an Oct. 22 statement to Mirror Indy. “The IAA must comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations and cannot interfere with or restrict federal and civil aviation activities.”

That answer — along with the silence of the airlines and companies involved — was not satisfying to advocates.

“I don’t think most Indy residents want an airport we really love to be part of a deportation machine,” said Josh Riddick, an organizer with Live Free Indiana. “We have to figure out who is passively sitting by while ICE expands its footprint in our city.”

The group has repeatedly protested the Marion County Sheriff’s Office for working with ICE this year to hold detainees in the local jail. From January through mid-October, records show nearly 800 people have been housed there at some point. The sheriff’s office does not transport detainees to the airport for ICE flights, a spokesperson said.

Two weeks ago, Riddick visited with immigrants inside Indy’s jail. Some, he said, were so defeated they agreed to voluntary departure. Others wanted to fight their cases.

That’s much harder, advocates say, once someone has been moved out of state in a few short hours. Deportation flights were common under the Bush, Obama and Biden administrations. But the scale has grown immensely under Trump 2.0, which is also transferring more people between states.

“These planes are going to Louisiana for a reason,” Riddick told Mirror Indy. “That’s a location where the government wins in court and expedites deportations. Our neighbors and friends are being put in a black box so the Trump administration can force a victory.”

‘Enough resistance’

Other communities across the country are reckoning with their airports becoming a pit-stop in the deportation process.

In Seattle, advocates are monitoring ICE flights with live video feeds and pressing the private airlines and companies involved to stop working with federal agents. In Massachusetts, ICE initially stopped flights at Hanscom Field after public outcry, but resumed them in September. And in New Hampshire, community members are demanding answers from the Pease County Development Authority — though officials there say the airport will lose all federal grants if it defies ICE.

“Ultimately, if all airports took a stand, ICE couldn’t operate,” said Megan Chapman, a human rights lawyer working to stop the flights at Portsmouth International Airport. “If there is enough resistance in enough places to slow things down, that allows more people to actually have their day in court.”

Indianapolis may be the next chapter in the fight.

“The airport has some control over who does business on their property and which companies they allow,” said Riddick, the organizer with Live Free Indiana. “Somebody is aware of this and they’ve been quiet about it.”

Joseph, the local immigration attorney, has her eyes set on the private companies involved in the Indianapolis flights: Eastern Air Express, Global X and Million Air.

To her, the answer is simple.

“We won’t support businesses that are helping tear families apart,” she said.

Fact-Finding Conferences Generally A fact-finding conference is essentially an informal, investigative meeting in which the Department brings the parties together to discuss the allegations in the charge of discrimination.

Rationale Behind the Switch to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences The legislature cited efficiency and backlog reduction as central reasons for eliminating mandatory fact-finding conferences.","On August 15, 2025, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker signed Senate Bill 2487 into law, amending the Illinois Human Rights Act (“IHRA”), 775 ILCS 5/7A-102. Among other reforms going into effect on January 1, 2026, the legislation fundamentally changes how the Illinois Department of Human Rights (“IDHR” or the “Department”) processes charges of discrimination.

Most notably, the law eliminates mandatory fact-finding conferences. For decades, these conferences were a hallmark of the Department’s investigative approach, giving complainants, respondents, and the agency a chance to gather information early, test the strength of claims, and sometimes even prompt informal resolution. Their removal will change how employers, employees, and practitioners must navigate discrimination charges in Illinois.

Fact-Finding Conferences Generally

A fact-finding conference is essentially an informal, investigative meeting in which the Department brings the parties together to discuss the allegations in the charge of discrimination. The investigator can question witnesses, review documentary evidence, and attempt to clarify disputed facts. While not a mediation, these conferences often create opportunities for early settlement discussions. For employers, they also offer a critical chance to gain insight into the complainant’s allegations and to present documents and testimony before the Department issues a determination.

From Mandatory to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

Prior to Senate Bill 2487, fact-finding conferences were mandatory for nearly every charge of discrimination. An employer could only avoid this requirement if the charge was dismissed early, the Director issued a determination of substantial evidence, or the parties voluntarily agreed to waive the conference in writing. Nonattendance without good cause could result in dismissal of the charge or default judgment.

With the passage of the amendment, fact-finding conferences will be optional and occur only in limited circumstances.

If both the complainant and the respondent wish to have a fact-finding conference, they must make that request in writing within ninety (90) days of the charge being filed. Importantly, agreeing to a conference also means agreeing to extend the Department’s investigative deadline by an additional 120 days, giving the Department more time to complete its review. Even if the parties do not request one, the Department still has discretion to convene a conference on its own if it believes doing so would help clarify the case or resolve factual disputes.

The procedural rules surrounding attendance remain in place. If a conference is scheduled, the parties must appear. A complainant who fails to attend without good cause risks dismissal of the charge, while an employer who fails to appear can be held in default.

Rationale Behind the Switch to Discretionary Fact-Finding Conferences

The legislature cited efficiency and backlog reduction as central reasons for eliminating mandatory fact-finding conferences. The Department has long struggled with processing times, and fact-finding conferences have historically been resource-intensive.

The amendment also brings Illinois more in line with federal practice, where charges of discrimination are typically investigated through written position statements, document requests, and interviews.

Impacts on Employers

Position Statements Matter More Than Ever: Without a guaranteed fact-finding conference, employers lose the chance to “fill in the gaps” or clarify their story in person. This means that the position statement and its supporting documentary evidence will likely carry more weight. Employers assume these filings will be the primary record on which the IDHR bases its determination.

Employers Face a Critical Choice: Employers must decide whether a fact-finding conference helps or hurts their case. Opting in would give employers the opportunity to see the complainant’s testimony and test their credibility, the chance to directly explain their defenses to the investigator, and a possible opening for early settlement. On the other hand, opting in extends the IDHR’s timeline by 120 days, prolonging uncertainty, gives the complainant a platform to expand or refine their claims, and increases legal fees and preparation time.

Fewer Early Settlement Opportunities: Employers can no longer count on fact-finding conferences to provide an informal settlement forum. Instead, employers who are open to early resolution should explore the Department’s voluntary mediation program or work with counsel to negotiate directly with the complainant.

The Trump administration has its eyes set on expanding ICE and is specifically targeting local police departments for recruitment.
Attempting to merge two autocratic institutions notorious for brutalizing minorities is a recipe for disaster — and an incredibly strategic move by the Trump administration.
Although the Keep Washington Working Act prohibits police from sharing surveillance data with ICE, SPD has a history of inappropriately using surveillance, including to spy on political groups.
“UW has continually said we can't stop ICE from coming on campus,” Chabaud said.","All over the United States, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been under fire for infringing on the rights of civilians and taking measures that are well beyond its jurisdiction. This ranges from detaining people without due process to detaining citizens, to forced entry into homes and smashing windows to pull suspected undocumented persons out of their cars.

With the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” in July, ICE’s budget has nearly tripled.

The Trump administration has its eyes set on expanding ICE and is specifically targeting local police departments for recruitment. U.S. police departments are infamous for racial profiling, use of excessive force, and abuse of power. Though hardly an outlier, SPD has an especially long history of alleged racism and unnecessary use of violence.

In 2020, a lawsuit was filed against SPD by Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County for its indiscriminate use of rubber bullets, tear gas, batons, and chemical irritants on protestors, medical personnel, journalists, and legal spectators as a means of “crowd control” during the George Floyd protests. SPD was found guilty of violating free speech rights for its actions.

The recent Keep Washington Working Act, passed by the Washington State Legislature, places limitations on how local police cooperate with ICE, but it doesn’t prevent them from joining. Attempting to merge two autocratic institutions notorious for brutalizing minorities is a recipe for disaster — and an incredibly strategic move by the Trump administration.

“It is a tool of authoritarianism, and it's a tool of fear, especially,” Mathieu Chabaud, chair of Students for a Democratic Society’s UW chapter, said. “We're seeing in Chicago, with the deployments of the National Guard, that these appointments are meant to make people feel afraid. They are meant to drive people into their homes, to make them fearful of going to work, to make them fearful of organizing.”

Chabaud also pointed out that Trump’s intimidation tactics disproportionately impact immigrant and Chicano communities.

“Now, ultimately, I think that the larger concern for me is not necessarily if SPD officers are quitting to go work for ICE, but if they're just working with ICE under the table … you have all these surveillance cameras, right? If they’re somehow accessing these surveillance records because they've gone through other agencies to request them,” Chabaud said.

ICE has been known to use surveillance databases to track people with the help of local law enforcement agencies. In 2019, it was revealed that ICE agencies in San Francisco used driver location data provided to them by local police for deportations, in violation of the California Values Act. Seattle is big on police surveillance, with new CCTV cameras and a “Real Time Crime Center” recently being approved despite community pushback about privacy concerns and misuse of the data. Although the Keep Washington Working Act prohibits police from sharing surveillance data with ICE, SPD has a history of inappropriately using surveillance, including to spy on political groups.

“I don't doubt that there are members of SPD, of UWPD, of all these private security officers hired through Seattle's finest that want to work with ICE under the table,” Chabaud said. “Whether that's calling up somebody that they know in ICE saying, ‘Hey, I saw this person today, I don't think that they're a citizen’ … or just outright breaking the law themselves and intimidating students on the basis of their immigration status.”

There are millions of illegal European immigrants in the U.S. Why isn’t ICE cracking down on them? The answer is simple. Obviously, racism plays a role, but when we look at the jobs minority immigrants tend to work — blue-collar, low-pay — it becomes very evident very quickly that the Trump administration is using ICE to scare historically underpaid and overworked communities out of unionizing and rebelling.

The general slanderous narratives that Republicans try to push about immigrants — that they’re rapists, that they’re criminals, that they steal jobs — are yet another tool used by the elite to sow division and to keep the masses from developing class consciousness and organizing against the real criminals: the billionaires, like Trump, who exploit us.

Immigrants are invaluable to our society. They contribute trillions to the GDP and housing wealth, and they keep our food system afloat, in part because their labor is so heavily exploited. They enrich our country with their cultures. But beyond their servitude, immigrants are human beings who deserve to be treated as such. No child should be ripped away from their family. No worker should be afraid that if they advocate for themselves, their bosses will get them thrown out of the country.

It’s going to take a lot of time, effort, and resources to change things on a national scale, but what we can do right now is take a stand on our campus.

“UW has continually said we can't stop ICE from coming on campus,” Chabaud said. “And every other university in Washington state is saying a very different thing: We will not allow ICE to come on campus, we will not provide them any resources.”

Earlier this year, UW hosted Homeland Security agents on campus for their ”Career as a Special Agent” workshop, prompting backlash and protests in response.

Chabaud raised important points about how, in addition to not actively bringing these agents on campus, UW can take many actions to help protect the immigrant student body. They can create and send out alerts if ICE comes to campus, provide training for staff and students about what to do if ICE comes on campus, and make sure they aren’t hiring campus security officers who would collaborate with ICE against UW’s students. He explained how SDS and other student activist groups and unions are pressuring UW to make those changes.

“I actually just happened to run into President [Robert] Jones on Friday, and very quickly it was clear that he wasn't happy with what we're doing,” Chabaud said. “But we wouldn't be doing what we're doing if we saw real action from this administration … it's his choices that mean that students are walking up to him every time that they see him on campus and asking, ‘Why aren't you doing more?’”

International and undocumented students are an important part of our UW community. UW needs to do more to protect them.

FROM THE WILDERNESS: Nearly a year out from the 2024 election, Democrats are still searching for their way out of the wilderness and looking for a unified direction amid concerns over a party brand that lost ground with key voting blocs. And with a little over a year until the midterms, the party’s moderate wing is pitching their way forward.

Among the biggest messaging battles Dems will confront going into next year is President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration agenda — from his pledges to carry out the largest mass deportation program in history to masked ICE agents conducting raids across major Democrat run-cities to the National Guard deployments to protect ICE agents.

First in Playbook: A new memo from centrist think tank Third Way finds an “electorate caught between two unsatisfying extremes: the cruelty of Trump’s policies and the perception that Democrats can’t maintain order at the border.” The latest data, shared exclusively with Playbook, shows that Democrats are still struggling to make inroads on immigration in the wake of a messy border policy under the Biden administration that is sticking in the minds of voters. Read the memo

The GOP dip: Support for Republicans’ handling of immigration slightly dropped from the last polling in March to September, down to 56 percent from 62 percent. But trust for Republicans’ handling of border security held steady at 66 percent.

But Dems aren’t breaking through: Democrats, meanwhile, “made modest but significant gains: their 30-point deficit on trust in immigration shrank to 20 points. Yet, the 40-point deficit on border security persisted. That’s a crucial distinction — because while voters are softening in their views toward Trump and his party on immigration overall, they still don’t trust Democrats to manage the border responsibly.” The report draws from a focus group of 55 swing voters and a national survey of 800 general election voters and 516 voters in battleground House districts.

But but but: The temptation for Democrats to blanket denounce all of the Trump administration’s most extreme measures is strong, but not effective, Third Way’s Sarah Pierce told Playbook. “They shouldn’t be criticizing everything the Trump administration is doing, because some of this is in line with what voters want to see,” she told Playbook. “Democrats really need to be putting themselves forward as joining voters on the ground they’re standing on.”

Who’s doing it right: Pierce pointed to Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), whose campaign in battleground Arizona could serve as a roadmap, she argued. “Ruben Gallego overperformed the entire Democratic ticket in Arizona and across the nation because of how he leaned into talking about immigration,” Chuck Rocha, who worked on Gallego’s campaign, told Playbook. Gallego would “have conversations with people about immigration, working in class economic issues … but the big thing he did was actually show up and listen.”

And Democrats’ challenge to break through on immigration spills into other key issues, per a new report out today.

It’s still the economy, stupid: The report from centrist WelcomePAC outlines how Democrats have to talk more about the economy and less about democracy, pushing a move toward kitchen table issues and moderate stances on immigration and crime, POLITICO’s Lisa Kashinsky reports. It features input from big names in Dem politics like David Axelrod, James Carville and David Plouffe to provide a sweeping analysis that is less an autopsy report and more an “indictment of the party’s leftward shift since the Obama administration.”

A woke-up call: The report, which was scooped by Semafor’s David Weigel, shows that a majority of voters believe Democrats are getting “out of touch” by focusing on LGBTQ+ rights and climate change. In the same vein, it warned elected Democrats to “abandon some of the progressive language about race, abortion, and LGBTQ issues that Democrats began using after the 2012 election — and recommends the nomination of more candidates willing to vote with Republicans on conservative immigration and crime bills.”

TRAIL MIX: We’re almost a week out from Election Day. Early voting in the NYC mayoral race is projecting high turnout for the off-year election, with more than 160,000 voting over the weekend, NYT’s Benjamin Oreskes and Maya King report. In Virginia, Dem candidate Abigail Spanberger maintains a comfortable lead in the race for governor despite an onslaught of attacks from GOP candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, NYT’s Reid Epstein writes.

That said, the middle-of-the-road Dem candidates running in Virginia and New Jersey have been underperforming compared to the ever-growing enthusiasm for Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani in NYC, WSJ’s Joseph De Avila and Anvee Bhutani write. Despite Spanberger and Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s leads, neither race is a lock, with concerns persisting about whether their messaging has broken through with voters.

An eye toward 2026: NYC Comptroller Brad Lander is privately planning a bid to challenge Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) next year, City & State New York’s Peter Sterne reports. … And Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner’s campaign manager, Kevin Brown, is leaving after just days on the job, Axios’ Holly Otterbein scoops.

7 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Hoosier hoopla: Fair Maps Indiana, a project of Defending America’s Comeback Inc., is launching a 501c4 nonprofit organization to back mid-cycle redistricting in the Hoosier State, Playbook’s Adam Wren reports. The effort comes ahead of next week’s special session called today by Gov. Mike Braun and is led by a number of Trump campaign alums, including top advisers and strategists Chris LaCivita, Chip Englander and John Brabender.

“States such as Illinois and California have gerrymandered their Congressional maps for decades,” said Marty Obst, who will serve as chair of Fair Maps Indiana. “The Indiana General Assembly has an opportunity to redraw the lines and play a meaningful role in maintaining our majorities in Congress. Our goal is to strongly support efforts to do so.”

The latest redistricting salvo: New York is joining in the redistricting arms race, as a new lawsuit filed by Elias Law Group today alleges that Rep. Nicole Malliotakis’ (R-N.Y.) district was unfairly drawn to disenfranchise voters of color, NYT’s Grace Ashford and Nick Corasaniti report. “Democrats may face an uphill battle convincing a judge that the current lines are unacceptable: It was just last year that they drew and approved the map, which Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, himself blessed as a modest but meaningful improvement over the previous lines.”

2. SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN: It’s day 27 of the shutdown, with paychecks missing and air travel delayed across the country. The pain has reached an inflection point for many federal workers: their largest union this morning called for an end to the shutdown and for Democrats to join Republicans to pass the “clean” stopgap funding bill, NBC’s Monica Alba scoops. “Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,” the American Federation of Government Employee statement reads.

Republicans are running out of patience as Democrats jam the Senate — once again confronting the thorny issue of the filibuster and whether to get rid of it, WSJ’s Lindsay Wise writes. But Democrats are working in lockstep, and they’re prepared to stick together on their strategy in the near future, CNN’s Sarah Ferris and Ellis Kim report.

This week: Talks abound about how to pay federal workers and air traffic controllers, with potential votes this week on those smaller bills, per Punchbowl. But these talks are still very much a work-in-progress, per Semafor’s Burgess Everett.

3. FED UP: The Federal Reserve’s next meeting kicks off tomorrow, where the central bank is widely expected to once again slash interest rates amid growing concerns on the slowing labor market. We could see a reduction of rates by a quarter of a percentage point come Wednesday, when Chair Jerome Powell makes his announcement, especially as the most recent inflation numbers proved cooler than expected, Reuters’ Ann Saphir reports.

Driving the decision: The Fed meeting comes not only as Trump is in Asia finalizing trade agreements, but also as the government shutdown prolongs the release of key government data that usually helps drive the Fed’s policy changes. The September jobs report wasn’t released and October data hasn’t been collected, the USDA’s export sales report hasn’t come out, key demographic data has been delayed.

The short list: Bessent confirmed the five finalists today being considered to succeed Powell and said Trump will make his final decision by the end of the year, Bloomberg’s Josh Wingrove reports. In the running: current Fed board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and BlackRock exec Rick Rieder. Bessent is doing another round of interviews and will give Trump a “good slate” after Thanksgiving.

4. WHERE’S THE BEEF?: Trump’s frustration with spiking beef prices and his vow to bring prices down have led the White House to lean on beef from Argentina, which “has spurred intense backlash from farm-state Republicans and agriculture industry groups who have felt burned by several Trump administration policies in recent months,” POLITICO’s Myah Ward and Grace Yarrow report. “Ten months in, Trump and his top aides are scrambling to keep the campaign pledge, calculating that in the short-term it’s worth antagonizing ranchers, a loyal GOP constituency that benefits from elevated beef prices, if they can bring down costs for consumers.”

5. WAR AND PEACE: Hungarian PM Viktor Orban said he will meet with Trump in an effort to blunt the effect that U.S. sanctions on Russian oil will have on Hungary, which relies on Moscow for oil and gas imports, Bloomberg’s Zoltan Simon and Marton Kasnyik report. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui to strengthen the countries’ military ties, Bloomberg’s Greg Sullivan reports.

Big read: “Is the U.S. Losing in Vietnam? Russia, North Korea and China Are Gaining,” by NYT’s Damien Cave: “U.S. allies worry that American volatility and Russian outreach and arms sales, in particular, are driving Vietnam into a new phase.”

6. YOU DON’T KNOW JACK: “How Jack Smith’s strongest case against Donald Trump collapsed,” by Aaron Davis and Carol Leonnig for WaPo, adapted from the pair’s forthcoming book, “Injustice: How Politics and Fear Vanquished America’s Justice Department” ($29.76): “This behind-the-scenes account reveals new details about the inner workings of [Jack] Smith’s highly secretive team as he pushed it to complete a historic investigation in record time … it recounts for the first time Smith’s effort to remove [Judge Aileen Cannon] from the case, an idea that a top Justice Department official rejected and that Smith never presented to Attorney General Merrick Garland.”

7. SECURITY DETAILS: “Hundreds of People With ‘Top Secret’ Clearance Exposed by House Democrats’ Website,” by Wired’s Lily Newman and Matt Burgess: “The people’s details were included in a database of more than 7,000 individuals who have applied for jobs over the last two years with Democrats in the [House]. … The researcher found data including applicants’ short written biographies and fields indicating military service, security clearances, and languages spoken, along with details like names, phone numbers, and email addresses. … The data also included information about people’s political affiliations.”

TALK OF THE TOWN

BILL OF HEALTH — Trump said he underwent an MRI scan during his trip to Walter Reed Medical Center, but did not say why or which part of his body was scanned, POLITICO’s Dan Goldberg reports. “It was perfect,” Trump told reporters.

MEDIA MOVES — “CBS Evening News” co-anchor John Dickerson is leaving the network in mid-December, according to an internal announcement scooped by The Guardian’s Jeremy Barr. … Caitlin Valleskey is now an event manager at NOTUS. She previously was at the DNC.

TRANSITIONS — Susan Musser is joining WilmerHale as an antitrust and competition partner. She previously worked at the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. … Amanda Wait is joining Michael Best as partner in the firm’s antitrust and competition practice. She previously worked at DLA Piper, and is an FTC alum. … Will King is now working in government relations at BP America Inc. He previously worked on the House Natural Resources Committee.

The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it.
… The drug war, or the crime war, has typically been dealt with through law enforcement, and so far they have alleged that these people are drug dealers … and we’ve had no evidence presented.","When it comes to fighting America’s drug problem, the Trump administration seems to have traded courtrooms for combat zones. The U.S. military has been carrying out air and sea strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and off the coast of Venezuela.

Officials say these operations are meant to stop “narco-terrorists” before they reach our shores, but here’s the problem: we don’t actually know who’s being killed, or what evidence proves they were drug traffickers in the first place.

According to the administration, at least 43 people have been killed since this campaign began. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the military has conducted its 10th strike so far — and there’s talk of land strikes coming next. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) even told CBS News that he thinks President Trump has decided “it’s time for Maduro to go,” talking about the Venezuelan leader and calling land strikes a “real possibility.”

Graham then doubled down, saying the military will “kill the people that want to poison America.”

But let’s pause. Because while Graham sounds ready to invade and escalate, other lawmakers — even Republicans — are sounding the alarm. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a longtime defender of the Constitution, went on “Fox News Sunday” and said he’s never been invited to any briefing about these attacks.

“A briefing is not enough to overcome the Constitution. The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it. … The drug war, or the crime war, has typically been dealt with through law enforcement, and so far they have alleged that these people are drug dealers … and we’ve had no evidence presented. So at this point we would call them extrajudicial killings.”

Paul didn’t stop there. “At this point,” he said, “this is what China does, this is what Iran does without ever presenting any evidence to the public. So it’s wrong.”

And that’s really the point — America was built on checks and balances. We’re supposed to be the country that demands proof before punishment, not one that bombs suspects at sea without due process.

Yet the White House is openly suggesting it doesn’t need Congress. Trump even told reporters, “We’ll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we are doing … but we don’t have to do that.”

So, let me get this straight. If 43 people were killed in a law enforcement operation, with no evidence shown, no transparency, and no vote from Congress — what exactly do we call that? “The war on drugs” or “the war without rules”?

Because when a government decides it can kill whoever it labels a criminal — without trial, without proof, and without oversight — that’s not a show of strength. That’s a red flag.

At the very least, Americans deserve answers. Who was killed? Why? And under what legal authority? Until we know that, calling these “extrajudicial killings” isn’t radical — it’s reality.

In separate letters sent to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last week, ACE called for an exemption for higher education institutions from the new $100,000 H-1B application fee—now in effect following the launch of DHS’s official payment portal and accompanying guidance from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)—and urged withdrawal of a new rule that would prioritize H-1B visa petitions based on wage levels.

Both policies stemmed from President Trump’s Sept. 19 proclamation, Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers. Together, the groups warned, they would undermine U.S. colleges and universities’ ability to attract global talent and fulfill their role in educating the domestic workforce for high-demand sectors.

Higher Education Calls for Exemption from $100,000 H-1B Fee

ACE and 29 higher education associations are urging DHS to exempt colleges and universities from the new $100,000 fee now being implemented for H-1B visa applications.

In an Oct. 23 letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, the associations said the Sept. 19 presidential proclamation establishing the fee would place an “extraordinary and unnecessary burden” on institutions that rely on H-1B visa holders to teach, conduct research, and provide medical and technical expertise in areas of national need—including health care, engineering, and computer science.

The groups noted that the proclamation allows DHS to issue exemptions in the national interest and called on the department to recognize higher education’s central role in training the U.S. workforce.

They also requested clarification on how DHS will implement the fee, including whether the payment will be refunded for denied petitions, how it will affect changes of status, and what metrics will determine when no U.S. worker is available for a role.

The USCIS guidance released alongside the portal clarified that the fee applies to new petitions for individuals outside the United States and does not appear to cover F-1 students transitioning to H-1B status. However, many other aspects of the policy remain unclear.

Citing data from CUPA-HR showing that more than 70 percent of H-1B faculty hold tenure-track or tenured positions, the letter emphasized that colleges and universities already operate under strict hiring and compliance requirements. The associations asked DHS to ensure higher education is treated consistently with its long-standing exemption from the H-1B lottery cap, granted by Congress in recognition of its national-interest role.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers also sent a letter to President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week warning that the fee is “prohibitively expensive” and could harm small employers and innovation. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a legal challenge, and additional lawsuits are underway.

ACE Opposes DHS Proposal to Prioritize H-1B Visas by Wage Level

ACE and 18 other higher education associations are also urging DHS to withdraw a proposed rule that would prioritize H-1B visa petitions based on wage levels, warning that it would disadvantage international graduates of U.S. colleges and universities and discourage new student enrollment.

In Oct. 24 comments submitted to DHS, the associations said the rule “would dramatically reduce access to the H-1B visa program for early career professionals, including those who have completed master’s or doctoral degrees at U.S. institutions of higher education.” They added that the policy would also harm foreign-born medical residents and other professionals in critical national-need areas.

“America’s colleges and universities are among the finest in the world,” they wrote in the comments. “This proposed rule will limit the ability of our institutions to recruit and retain talented students, especially those who wish to remain in the United States.”

The associations warned that the change could exacerbate an ongoing drop in international student enrollment. A recent NAFSA survey found potential declines of 30–40 percent in international enrollment for the 2025–26 academic year, representing an estimated $7 billion loss to the U.S. economy.

Under current law, 20,000 H-1B visas are reserved annually for foreign professionals with advanced degrees from U.S. institutions. The proposed wage-based selection process would undermine that statutory provision and contradict congressional intent, the groups warned.",https://www.acenet.edu/PublishingImages/Photo-Library/Northwestern-2014-FJG-NW-1611_large.jpg?RenditionID=14,N,,2025-10-27 15:01:32.985039

Gavin Newsom has repeatedly asserted that the Trump administration could send immigration agents to polling places in an attempt to intimidate voters and depress turnout.

The governor’s warnings, while unspecific, speak to what community leaders call real, palpable fears within some Latino communities that immigration agents could show up on Election Day. And ever since the Supreme Court greenlit using racial profiling in immigration stops, even U.S. citizens are scared they could be detained simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

“You’re going to likely see members of our military in and around polling booths and voting places all across this country,” Newsom warned last week during a virtual event with former President Barack Obama in support of Proposition 50. “I would say the same about ICE and Border Patrol, and I say that soberly.”

Newsom has not provided any evidence to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will deploy immigration agents to polling sites. But he pointed to the Los Angeles campaign launch event for Prop. 50, his plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor Democrats, where federal immigration agents blocked supporters from entering the area and detained a nearby strawberry vendor.

A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement wrote in a statement that the agency “is not planning operations targeting polling locations,"" but that if agents are tracking ""a dangerous criminal alien"" who goes near a voting site they could be arrested there. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Patrol did not respond to emailed questions.

The governor argues that the Trump administration’s indiscriminate immigration raids, military and National Guard deployments are intended to suppress Democratic voters and keep Republicans in control of Congress for the duration of Trump’s presidency.

“We know the intention of this administration — to rig next year’s midterms,” Newsom told reporters recently. “It’s absolutely predictable. It’s a script that’s been written for centuries. It’s the authoritarian playbook.”

The Trump administration’s Justice Department announced on Friday that it will deploy personnel to monitor polling sites in five counties: Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside on Election Day. Fresno, Kern and Riverside counties are majority Latino.

The poll monitors will “ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law,” according to the department. The administration has not said whether the agents will be stationed at polling sites in addition to county election offices where ballots are counted.

Democrats denounced the plan.

“Deploying federal forces to ‘monitor’ elections is nothing more than an intimidation tactic meant to suppress the vote,” said Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party. “What Republicans are really afraid of is record voter participation and a clear verdict from the people of California in support of Prop 50.”

‘Alarming’ number of Latinos fear ICE at polls

The vast majority of Californians vote by mail, especially since the state adopted universal mail-in voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Just over 80% of votes cast in the 2024 presidential election were mail-in ballots.

But casting a ballot in-person on Election Day is a point of pride for many American immigrants, especially Latinos, said Yvette Martinez, executive director of the California Democratic Party.

“It’s a cultural thing,” said Martinez. “People want to show up and say, ‘I’m patriotic, here’s my civic duty. I’m here to vote, I’m here to make my voice heard. And when you quell that, it’s dangerous. And it’s actually sad.”

In a September survey of 1,200 registered Latino voters conducted by the Latino Community Foundation, a nonprofit that funds Latino advocacy, 53% said they planned to vote in person. Of those, more than half said they would vote on Election Day.

The same survey also found that two-thirds of the Latino voters surveyed said they were at least somewhat worried that ICE or Border Patrol agents could show up at polling places. The poll had a sampling error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.

“These are citizens of this country. And if they are concerned about immigration or any type of federal presence at in-person voting sites, that is alarming,” said Christian Arana, who leads policy strategy for the foundation.

“If people want to vote in person, it is their fundamental right,” Arana said. “I never want us to buy into the fear that you can't participate in democracy because immigration enforcement may show up.”

Hendricks for CalMatters So far in the race for Prop. 50, only 9% of registered Latino voters have returned their ballots, according to the most recent data available from Political Data Inc., compared to 19% of white voters and 13% of Black voters. California pollster Ben Tulchin, who recently surveyed Latino voters about Prop. 50, said those numbers “are not unusual” since Latino voters tend to lag other ethnic and racial groups in casting ballots.

Sen. Anna Caballero, Democrat of Merced, said U.S. citizens told her they’re afraid to go outside, especially when there have been reports of ICE sightings in the region. Many of her constituents come from mixed-status families in which some family members are citizens and others aren’t. She blames the Trump administration for terrifying those families so much that they don’t want to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary.

“This idea that all you have to do is pull out your driver's license, or pull out some kind of documentation, that's a fantasy,” said Caballero. “U.S. citizens have been detained and taken into custody.”

A recent investigation by ProPublica found that at least 170 U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained by ICE since the second Trump administration took office, prompting intense criticism from opponents. Top Democrats on the House and Senate government oversight committees, Rep. Robert Garcia of California and Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, have opened an investigation.

Assemblymember Esmeralda Soria, another Merced Democrat and the daughter of Mexican immigrants, said ever since the Supreme Court issued its racial profiling ruling earlier this summer, she keeps her passport in her bag at all times.

“Just because you may look like an immigrant — which I don't even know what that really means — you know, I could also be targeted,” Soria said.

‘My voice will be heard’

Opponents of Newsom’s redistricting plan say the governor’s warnings about Election Day intimidation and interference from federal agents are exaggerated.

“People see it for what it is. It’s politics, it’s headline-grabbing,” said Hector Barajas, a spokesperson for the No on 50 campaign.

Barajas denounced Democrats for what he said was intentional disenfranchisement of nonwhite voters, since white college-educated voters are historically far more likely to turn out during off-year elections.

“This is what happens with special elections, is people don't turn out to vote, especially Hispanics, which is a sad tragedy in itself,” Barajas said.

Martinez said Democratic Party volunteers are for the first time urging voters to return their ballots early via mail or drop-off when they go door to door and handing out pamphlets with instructions for how to report any suspicious activity near polling sites.

The party has also trained hundreds of volunteers as poll watchers who will monitor polling sites for signs of intimidation or federal interference starting the weekend before Election Day.

Arana, with the Latino Community Foundation, said he’s choosing to vote in person as an act of defiance.

“I'm seeing this as a form of a declaration that I am a Latino man in the state,” he said. “My voice will be heard on this issue, and no one is ever gonna take that right away from me.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/554a712/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+106/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Feb%2Fac%2F18cc8a284209a36110eec9d08b02%2Felection-primary-ts-0607-07.JPG,N,,2025-10-27 15:01:37.251340

The death of Josué Castro Rivera follows recent incidents in which three other immigrants in Chicago and California were killed during immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration’s crackdown.

Castro Rivera was headed to a gardening job Thursday when his vehicle was pulled over by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, brother Henry Castro said.

Agents tried to detain Castro Rivera and the three other passengers, and he fled on foot, tried to cross Interstate 264 in Norfolk and was fatally struck, according to state and federal authorities.

Castro Rivera came to the United States four years ago and was working to send money to family in Honduras, according to his brother.

“He had a very good heart,” Castro said Sunday.

The Department of Homeland Security said Castro Rivera’s vehicle was stopped by ICE as part of a “targeted, intelligence-based” operation and passengers were detained for allegedly living in the country without legal permission.

DHS said in a statement that Castro Rivera “resisted heavily and fled” and died after a passing vehicle struck him. DHS officials did not respond Sunday to requests for further comment.

Virginia State Police said officers responded to a report of a vehicle-pedestrian crash around 11 a.m. Thursday on eastbound I-264 at the Military Highway interchange. Police said Rivera was hit by a 2002 Ford pickup and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The crash remains under investigation.

Federal authorities and state police gave his first name as Jose, but family members said it was Josué. DHS and state police did not explain the discrepancy.

Castro called his brother’s death an injustice and said he is raising money to transport the body back to Honduras for funeral.

“He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him,” Castro said.

DHS blamed Castro Rivera’s death on “a direct result of every politician, activist and reporter who continue to spread propaganda and misinformation about ICE’s mission and ways to avoid detention.”

Similar deaths amid immigration operations elsewhere have triggered protests, lawsuits and calls for investigation amid claims that the Trump administration’s initial accounts are misleading.

Last month in suburban Chicago, federal immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican man during a traffic stop. DHS initially said a federal officer was “seriously injured,” but police body camera video showed the federal officer walking around and describing his own injuries as “ nothing major.”

In July a farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic ICE raid at a California cannabis facility died of his injuries. And in August a man ran away from federal agents onto a freeway in the same state and was fatally struck by a vehicle.

Jim Pillen’s plans to convert a state prison into a detention center for migrants facing deportation proceedings.
State and federal officials have said they expect to house the first detainees by the end of this week.
“When the Legislature delegates authority, it may place such restrictions and limitations on that authority it chooses,” Heng continued.
Heng also ruled that Nebraska law broadly gives the state the authority to house anyone “committed” to the Corrections Department, including federal detainees.","LINCOLN — A district court judge in southwest Nebraska will let the state move forward with Gov. Jim Pillen’s plans to convert a state prison into a detention center for migrants facing deportation proceedings.

Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng, in a 17-page ruling Monday, ruled that Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, did not violate the Nebraska Constitution or state law by entering into a Sept. 30 contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to convert the state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook into a regional ICE detention center.

ICE certified the facility last week, Pillen announced Thursday. State and federal officials have said they expect to house the first detainees by the end of this week. A hearing on the motion was held Friday, and the lawsuit will continue.

“It is clear that the current situation with the department and ICE detainees was never contemplated when the statutes were created, but the language utilized by the Legislature is broad enough to allow the defendants to take the action they have chosen,” Heng wrote.

Pillen and federal officials announced the Nebraska-ICE partnership Aug. 19. Jeffreys signed the contract on Sept. 30, which was released to the public Oct. 17, two days after the lawsuit was filed.

A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Office referred questions to the Governor’s Office, and Pillen’s office had no immediate comment.

Nebraska Appleseed attorneys who filed the lawsuit Oct. 15 on behalf of 13 McCook residents and former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, expressed disappointment that the court did not stop the changes.

In a statement, Robert McEwen, Appleseed’s legal director, said he was pleased that Heng had let the case keep moving forward.

“The case will carry forward from here, and we will continue to represent the interests of our clients in halting the activities of the defendants as they relate to the large-scale detainment camp in McCook.”

Schimek was one of the original lawmakers who authorized the creation of the state’s Work Ethic Camp in 1997. It opened in 2001.

She and the taxpayers argued Pillen and Jeffreys were trying to “usurp” legislative authority by converting the McCook facility’s legislatively directed usage without first receiving legislative approval.

Heng overruled a state motion to dismiss the lawsuit — saying the taxpayers had a legal right to challenge the matter — but he denied a request to pause the state-federal partnership.

Heng also ruled that the McCook residents and Schimek had met their burden of having the standing to sue, even as state attorneys for Pillen and Jeffreys had argued others might be better suited to challenge the action, such as the Legislature, displaced state inmates from the McCook facility or future federal detainees., he said the McCook residents and Schimek had met their burden.

In denying the request for a temporary injunction, Heng pointed to the Nebraska Constitution’s requirement that the “general management, control and government” of all state penal institutions is done by the Legislature. His major question was whether the Legislature had delegated that authority.

“The answer is obviously, ‘yes,’” Heng wrote.

He pointed to the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and the authority of the governor to appoint a director, who then has general oversight of corrections oversight. Heng also ruled that Pillen and the executive branch have broad authority to enter contracts with the federal government.

“When the Legislature delegates authority, it may place such restrictions and limitations on that authority it chooses,” Heng continued. “It has not done so here.”

To pause the Nebraska-ICE deal, Heng said the 14 taxpayers would have needed to show “irreparable harm,” probable success of succeeding on the merits and a balance of hardships in favor of the taxpayers over the government. Heng wrote that he was not yet convinced the plaintiffs were likely to succeed.

Heng also ruled that Nebraska law broadly gives the state the authority to house anyone “committed” to the Corrections Department, including federal detainees.

Heng said that while state law requires a work ethic camp, it doesn’t require one in McCook or Red Willow County. He said the location is a decision left to the corrections director, who has signed a sworn statement saying the rehabilitation offerings at the former McCook facility would be available at other state facilities.

“If there is not such a facility for qualified inmates,” Heng said, “that is not the subject matter of this lawsuit.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2560-scaled-e1761585676122-2048x1207.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:01:30.370856

His administration has already canceled or threatened to cancel billions of dollars of previously approved federal spending and now wants to go after even more funding during the government shutdown .

States, cities, nonprofits and other groups have responded with more than 150 lawsuits accusing the Republican administration of an unlawful power grab.

An Associated Press analysis shows that so far, those suits are mostly succeeding in blocking the Republican president's spending moves, at least temporarily. But most of the legal battles are far from over, and the Supreme Court, where Trump so far has been more successful , could have the final word on at least some of them.

The court's conservative majority has been receptive at least in preliminary rulings to many emergency appeals from the administration. Legal experts say a pair of recent decisions by the court may bode well for the administration's push to gain more control over government spending. Here’s a look at the current legal score and what could lie ahead:

Courts have mostly ruled against the administration so far

As of early October, court orders were at least temporarily blocking the Trump administration’s decisions in 66 of 152 lawsuits over federal spending, an AP analysis shows. In 37 of those cases, courts had allowed the administration to proceed. In 26 of the cases, a judge had yet to rule on the matter. The remaining 23 had either been dropped or consolidated.

The count reflects decisions by district courts, appeals courts and the U.S. Supreme Court and will almost certainly change as the cases progress.

The flurry of litigation reflects not only the administration’s aggressive effort to wrest control of spending, but the Republican-controlled Congress’ unwillingness to push back, said Zachary Price, a constitutional law professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.

“Congress seems to be following its partisan interests more than its institutional interests, and that puts a lot of pressure on courts,” he said.

It's hard to say how much money the administration has withheld

Government watchdogs say the administration is blatantly ignoring a requirement in the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to report funding freezes to Congress.

Research by Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees estimated the administration was freezing, canceling or seeking to block a total of $410 billion as of early September. That's equivalent to about 6% of the federal budget for the year that ended on Sept. 30.

The administration has disputed that number.

Since the shutdown started this month, the administration has targeted even more funding , primarily in places represented by Democrats.

The Trump administration is taking a page from Nixon

Legal scholars say no president has attempted massive, unilateral cuts like these since Richard Nixon. The moves reflect an expansive view of executive power that is at odds with the Impoundment Control Act, court rulings and the Constitution, which grants Congress supremacy over spending, experts say.

""The power they’ve claimed is the power to delay and withhold funds throughout the year without input from Congress,"" said Cerin Lindgrensavage, counsel with Protect Democracy, which is involved in multiple lawsuits against the administration. ""That’s a theft of Congress’ power of the purse.”

In a message to Congress earlier this year, the White House said it was “committed to getting America’s fiscal house in order by cutting government spending that is woke, weaponized, and wasteful.”

White House budget director Russ Vought, a proponent of withholding federal funds, has argued presidents long had the power to spend less money than Congress appropriated if they could cut waste or be more efficient, and that power is needed to address the country's massive debt.

The government shutdown opened up a new opportunity to cut spending, he said this month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.""

""If I can only work on saving money, then I’m going to do everything I can to look for opportunities to downsize in areas where this administration has thought, ‘This is our way towards a balanced budget.’”

The administration has cut entire agencies

The 152 cases the AP identified challenge the closure of government agencies and offices, the cancellation of grants and other assistance and the attachment of new conditions on federal funding.

The administration has used the cuts, or threat of cuts, to try to impose its policies on gender , race , immigration and other issues.

But it’s not just money on the line. The funds supported jobs, school lunches, health programs, scientific research, infrastructure projects, foreign assistance, disaster preparedness, education initiatives and other programs.

Some notable rulings against the administration include the restoration of funding to 14 states that filed suit over nearly $2 billion withheld for electric car chargers and a block on potentially broad funding cuts to some of the country’s largest cities over their “sanctuary” immigration policies.

Judges have raised constitutional concerns

Judges who have ruled against the administration have often found strong reason to conclude the cuts, or threat of cuts, would violate the Constitution's separation of powers by usurping Congress' authority over spending.

They have also ruled the moves were most likely arbitrary under the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.

Judges who have sided with the administration have likened at least some of the legal claims before them to contract disputes that belong in a different court: the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

That court, which traces its origins to the mid-1800s, handles lawsuits by citizens seeking money from the federal government. Referred to as “the People's Court,” it is separate from the district courts that are handling most of the high-profile litigation against the administration.

The Supreme Court has often sided with the White House

The high court's conservative justices have allowed the administration to move ahead for now with plans to shutter the Education Department , freeze $5 billion in foreign aid and cut hundreds of millions of dollars for teacher training and research supported by the National Institutes of Health .

Those decisions may make it harder to challenge the administration’s spending cuts, though the high court has not yet considered their ultimate legality or overturned lower court rulings.

In the National Institutes of Health case, the high court ruled 5-4 in August that lawsuits over the cancellation of grant funding generally cannot be handled entirely by federal district courts. Instead, plaintiffs must sue in federal claims court for any money and turn to the district courts if they want to challenge the guidance that led to the grant terminations.

The impact of the Supreme Court’s decision is still unfolding, but it could force plaintiffs in the grant funding cases to start over in a new courtroom. In some cases, plaintiffs might have to decide if they want to sue on two fronts.

In the foreign aid case, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision in September suggested the Impoundment Control Act did not give private parties the right to sue over so-called pocket rescissions .

That's when the president submits a request to Congress not to spend approved money, but does it so late in the fiscal year that Congress doesn't have time to act and the funds go unspent.

Trump notified House Speaker Mike Johnson in August of a pocket rescission for the $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid , effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

Though the Supreme Court stressed its decision was preliminary, legal experts say it could make it easier for the Trump administration to use the tactic again.

When I read this poem, I saw parallels between the understanding of the contradictions at play in Lebanon and those in my country, the United States of America.

Like Gibran, we will assert: “You have your America, I have my America.”","A century ago, Gibran Khalil Gibran wrote a love poem to Lebanon, ""You have your Lebanon, I have my Lebanon."" He spoke of his affection for the captivating qualities of generosity and hospitality of the Lebanese people and the sheer beauty of the country and contrasted this with Lebanon’s petty, bickering politicians who sought nothing more than their own aggrandizement. When I read this poem, I saw parallels between the understanding of the contradictions at play in Lebanon and those in my country, the United States of America.

Today, many Americans are living in fear and even despair as they watch their president, seemingly unchecked, tearing down some of the foundations of democracy and gutting social and economic programs that have for decades provided for the safety, security, and well-being of millions. They ask: “How could this be happening?” and “Can our country survive this onslaught?”

But, as has always been the case in America, while some have felt hopeless, others are driven to respond. And so it was that a week ago, seven million Americans took to the streets in 2,700 cities and towns to demonstrate their resolve to save America’s democracy and arrest the drift toward authoritarianism.

All of this should serve as a reminder that there have always been these two Americas: one pushing to restrict democratic freedoms and the other working to expand them. Both have defined our history.

America, after all, was born with the original sins of genocide against native peoples, the forced enslavement of Africans, and the annexation and subjugation of Spanish-speaking peoples of the Southwest. As the country grew and attracted immigrants, these newcomers, whether they were Irish, Italians, Central Europeans, Jews, or Arabs were often met with discrimination, repression, and even violence.

This, however, was always only one part of America’s story. On the other side, for every racist, segregationist, anti-immigrant bigot, there were abolitionists who fought slavery, and organized movements that championed immigrants, labor, and civil rights for Blacks, Latinos, and Native peoples. And in the last century, for every xenophobe like Fr. Coughlin or Pat Buchanan, or segregationist like Bull Connor or George Wallace, there was a Martin Luther King, Caesar Chavez, and Jesse Jackson. And despite persistent bigotry and waves of recurring anti-immigrant bigotry, what remains are the core of Dr. King’s “I have a dream” speech and the spirit of the Statue of Liberty’s words welcoming the “tired and poor, yearning to be free.”

This is my family’s story. While my father’s mother and siblings were all able to immigrate to America after World War I, he was delayed and then unable to secure a visa because Congress determined that there were too many immigrants from the Mediterranean region. (One Senator famously said, “We don’t need any more Syrian trash in America.”) Eager to reunite with his family, he got a job on a ship sailing to Canada and then crossed into the US without documents in 1923. He received amnesty in the 1930s and became a citizen in 1943. Four decades later I was serving as a deputy campaign manager for Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign and was given to opportunity to place his name in nomination at the 1984 Democratic Convention.

Reflecting on my personal history as a metaphor for the broader American story, I noted in my speech that “I am the son of an illegal immigrant who is nominating for president the great grandson of a slave. Nowhere else but America could this happen.”

It’s important to remember that these two Americas are always with us. And we must never forget either one. If we forget the threats and challenges to freedom, we let down our guard and become vulnerable to the assaults when they come. But if we forget the promise of America and fail to recall the heroes and movements who in every generation have fought and won, then we lose hope and fail to meet the challenges before us.

And so, to those who despair and say that what is happening today is” un-American” as they witness efforts to gut voting rights, curtail immigration, use of military force to violently expel migrants and threaten freedom of speech and assembly—we must respond that we've been here before and we’ve always risen up to confront these threats to liberty. And we’ve won.

The bottom line is that we should remember that we’ve been through other dark periods in our history. In my lifetime, we’ve witnessed: the hysteria and repression of the McCarthy era’s manufactured anti-Communism scare; the racism and violence that followed the civil rights movement; the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Dr. King; the deeply polarizing Vietnam war; the national trauma of 9/11 and the anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hate crimes and government repression that followed; and the disastrous failed wars against Afghanistan and Iraq. Each time, we rose to meet these challenges.

Given our history, I feel confident that in the face of today’s xenophobia, racism, repression, and hate, we will rise again.

What was supposed to be a Halloween parade in Old Irving Park turned to chaos as ICE agents appeared to deploy tear gas through residential streets last week. Outrage was sparked by the arrest of construction worker, Luis Villegas, whose family says he was working on a now-unfinished project before he was chased down and arrested by federal agents.

Tensions continued to grow after Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino was photographed allegedly hauling a tear gas canister at protesters in little village. Monday morning, Bovino defended his actions.

""When we utilize force in law enforcement, this is in law enforcement in general: As we use force, it's the least amount of force necessary to affect an arrest or to affect the successful outcome of any given mission that we're on,"" Bovino said. ""So, whether it's the use of tear gas, or the use of hand techniques or any use of force by law enforcement, that's that least amount of force necessary to positively affect the outcome of that mission. And that's what we do here in Chicago.""

The incident stirred fear among residents and led to a statement from the village’s mayor.

What we know:

The incident occurred around 8:45 a.m. Sunday in the parking lot of 390 W. Lake St. in Addison, according to Addison police.

Officers responded to a report of a disturbance and found Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the area. Police said a crowd gathered and officers ""ensured the safety of the public until the area was clear.""

Authorities did not release additional details about the incident and said no Addison officers took part in any federal immigration enforcement.

An area business posted a live video on Facebook, showing federal agents surrounding a vehicle in the parking lot and breaking a window with people inside.

The agents were then seen detaining at least one person and putting her inside their vehicle. Further details haven't been released.

Mayor speaks out:

Mayor Tom Hundley addressed residents’ concerns in a statement on social media.

""I want to acknowledge the concern many residents are feeling in light of recent immigration enforcement activity in our area. These events have understandably caused fear and uncertainty, and I want to assure you that your safety and dignity matter to me.

""While immigration enforcement is a federal matter and outside the authority of our local government, I want to reaffirm what the Police Department has already shared: our officers do not assist with federal immigration operations, do not inquire about immigration status, and are bound by the Illinois Trust Act to preclude involvement in such enforcement. Any federal presence in Addison has occurred without coordination or support from our police department.

""During any ongoing incident, our Police Department may respond to the area, just like we do for the Addison Fire Protection District. This is solely to ensure that bystanders are safe, traffic does not become an issue, and the area is secure. This is their only role.

""Addison is a diverse and vibrant community, and we are stronger because of the people who live and work here. Though our ability to intervene in federal matters is limited, I remain committed to ensuring that our Village continues to be a respectful and welcoming place for all.""

Inside an empty salon, owner Maky Munoz sits in a styling chair getting her hair dyed by the only employee on the clock. The pair don’t have any clients at the moment.

It’s an unusual case for a salon that used to be full of customers waiting for a haircut. Clients could hear razors buzzing, blow dryers going off and chatter between staff and employees.

The majority of her clientele now remains at home, she says, afraid to spend money due to immigration enforcement and rumors of increased activity in east Tulsa, the center of Latino life in the city. Her sales have dropped 75%.

Munoz is one of many local business owners in the area who are feeling the impacts of the Trump administration’s deportation campaign. There has been an increasing number of Immigration and Custom Enforcement sightings in recent months, leaving many in the community afraid to venture outside of their home.

An August research paper showed increased immigration enforcement has led to “economic damage” to construction, agriculture and leisure and hospitality industries, mostly from losing immigrant workers. The U.S. economy was already seeing a reduction in its immigrant workforce in 2024, according to the study.

On the ground, things look starker. There are widespread reports of immigrants across the country who are “reluctant” to show up for work because of fear that they or family members will be apprehended.

This fall, Munoz has noticed her regulars have more fear of ICE agents, especially when it comes to going to work, and are paying close attention to their presence in the community.

“They tell me, ‘Cut my hair short because I’m not coming back, I’m scared. I have my kids. They’re off to school. I’m putting myself at risk,’” Munoz said.

Rey Villalobos, owner of the restaurant La Torta Loca, saw a 30% drop in sales this summer at his restaurant inside Plaza Santa Cecilia. The plaza, home to restaurants, boutiques and clothing stores, has seen less foot traffic in recent years. Rumors of ICE’s presence in the area doesn’t help.

Villalobos has sold tortas there for seven years. Typically, he sells the best on the weekends, but that isn’t the case lately.

“July was probably one of the worst months we’ve had in a long time,” he said. “It just felt dead here. You could feel it in the air, like, nobody wanted to come by here, and I mean, it’s understandable.”

If Hispanics — his main clientele — are impacted, the business as a whole will feel the consequences, he said. People have told Villalobos that they’re saving money to return to Mexico.

“I imagine people don’t want to buy things, invest in stuff, buy cars for the reason of ‘I could be deported,’” he said.

He’s seen sales bounce back to normal with the arrival of fall, and the lunch rush of customers is slowly flowing back.

The fear, he said, remains. People are more aware of ICE’s presence and cautious in case something happens, he said.

Similarly, Karla Cruz has noticed fewer people coming out to spend money lately. The owner of Bellisima Boutique in Plaza Santa Cecilia said she understands people are scared but rent is still due at the end of each month.

Cruz sometimes has weeks where she doesn’t sell any items at the boutique and barely makes enough to stay open. Before the increase in immigration enforcement, she said people would at least come out and look at the store.

“If (people) do come, they’re coming fast and buying what they need and not stopping by and looking at the other stores anymore,” she said.

Sara Melgoza, who works at a furniture store in east Tulsa, noticed gas stations that were typically packed with customers were empty after social media posts about ICE being present near 21st and Garnett streets.

“It wasn’t only the day they said ICE was there, but the following day, too,” Melgoza said. “That week you could tell the terror that happens when they’re scared about a situation.”

Munoz, the salon owner, said she doesn’t just miss the sales but her clients as well. Fewer people of color and families are coming in for haircuts and the occasional therapy session that the salon provided.

“We just have to wait and see if all of this gets any better,” Munoz said. “It’s not easy to leave your country and be hit with the wolf.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2cea6da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2722x1429+0+44/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Faa%2F41%2F36c4ae6f4a19a31eb017d18f522b%2Fvillalobos-1.png,N,,2025-10-27 14:16:55.166522

The district is represented by Representative Nicole Malliotakis, the only Republican member of Congress in New York City.
This lawsuit was filed by Elias Law Group, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that has handled much of the party’s redistricting litigation.
Mike Braun, a Republican, called a special legislative session to redraw congressional maps in his state.
That commission was first responsible for drawing the state’s congressional and legislative district maps ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.","A lawsuit filed on Monday on behalf of four New Yorkers charges that the state’s congressional map unconstitutionally dilutes Black and Latino votes in a district that covers Staten Island and part of southern Brooklyn, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times.

The case marked New York’s official entrance into the national gerrymandering arms race. Rewriting the state’s existing congressional districts represents one of Democrats’ best hopes of improving their chances in the 2026 midterm elections.

Filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the lawsuit argues that the lines for the 11th Congressional District unfairly disenfranchise Black and Latino residents under the state’s newly passed Voting Rights Act. The district is represented by Representative Nicole Malliotakis, the only Republican member of Congress in New York City.

The combined Black and Latino population on Staten Island has grown from 11 percent to 30 percent over the past 40 years, the suit notes, arguing that the current boundaries “confine Staten Island’s growing Black and Latino communities in a district where they are routinely and systematically unable to influence elections.”

A representative for Ms. Malliotakis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This lawsuit was filed by Elias Law Group, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that has handled much of the party’s redistricting litigation.

Filing a lawsuit is a far less certain path to redistricting than having a partisan legislature simply draw new maps and pass them into law, which is what Texas did earlier this year. But New York placed its redistricting process in the hands of an independent commission years ago, in hopes of insulating it from partisan politics.

Redrawing legislative boundaries for Congress and state legislatures is typically done at the start of the decade following the census. But the Trump White House has upended that cycle, pushing Republican-controlled states to redraw their congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterms in an effort to ensure the party maintains control of the House of Representatives.

Republicans have already redrawn maps in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, netting their party as many as seven likely pickups before any votes have been cast.

Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, the official head of the state Democratic Party, pledged to “fight fire with fire,” saying: “If they’re going to rig the system, I refuse to sit on the sidelines and let our democracy further erode any more than it already has under the Trump administration.”

But Democrats may face an uphill battle convincing a judge that the current lines are unacceptable: It was just last year that they drew and approved the map, which Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, himself blessed as a modest but meaningful improvement over the previous lines.

Democrats in Albany devised the current lines for New York’s 26 congressional districts after the state’s redistricting commission failed to come to a consensus and an unsuccessful attempt by the party to gerrymander to its advantage.

In addition to the states where maps have already been redrawn, the White House had mounted an aggressive push in Indiana to force the legislature to eliminate the state’s two Democratic districts, with the president himself calling legislators earlier this month to persuade them to draw new maps.

On Monday, Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, called a special legislative session to redraw congressional maps in his state. But immediately after his announcement, a spokeswoman for the state’s Senate Republican leadership said that “the votes still aren’t there for redistricting,” adding to the uncertainty surrounding the effort.

Republican leaders in both Kansas and Nebraska have indicated that they are open to redrawing ahead of the midterms, though neither have yet taken formal steps to do so. And Florida Republicans are contemplating new maps as well.

Until this month, the only Democratic countermove ahead of the midterms was in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a temporary suspension of the state’s independent redistricting commission in order to draw five new Democratic seats. That effort will need to be approved by voters this November in order to move forward.

But last week, Virginia Democrats made the surprise announcement that they would also embark on an effort to redraw their maps should Democrats hold both chambers of the legislature this November, possibly netting two or three more seats for Democrats. The legislature is expected to meet on Monday to begin the process.

This has left the courts as one of the last remaining avenues for a state like New York, which passed a law establishing the bipartisan commission to redraw its maps in 2014.

That commission was first responsible for drawing the state’s congressional and legislative district maps ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. But after months of public hearings, the commission’s Democratic and Republican members failed to agree on a single set of maps, sending the job back to the Democratic majorities in the State Legislature.

Democrats there quickly passed a set of maps that would have favored their party in 22 of the state’s 26 congressional seats — called “a master class” in gerrymandering by one elections expert. But those maps were thrown out by a judge, who appointed a special master to draw a new set of lines.

Republicans went on to capture four seats in 2022, a margin that was equal to the slim four-member majority the party won in the House of Representatives that year.

Democrats sued and ultimately won the opportunity to redraw the maps one more time. Leery of another protracted battle, they created maps last year that only slightly benefited their party.

Feldman v. Sullivan, 24A1278 (U.S. June 25, 2025), https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24A1278.html; Sullivan, 132 F.4th at 330.
Sullivan v. Feldman, 132 F.4th 315, 332 (5th Cir.","Despite its promise, arbitration is not always cheaper and faster than litigation, especially when class arbitration is involved. In Sullivan v. Feldman, the Fifth Circuit encountered what it called ""the Bleak House of arbitration.""1 The case involved nine overlapping proceedings over five years before nine different arbitrators, leading to four inconsistent awards.2 There was even an attempt, after the appeal was filed, to initiate a tenth arbitration.3 Two of the awards reached different results on class arbitration: one allowed class arbitration, while the other did not.4 Constrained by the parties' arbitration agreement and broad delegation clause, the court affirmed the confirmation of all four awards.5On March 11, the Fifth Circuit ordered the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, on remand, to stay the litigation while the parties initiate an eleventh arbitration to reconcile the conflicting awards.6

Sullivan is part of a larger split, percolating through the circuit courts, on whether incorporation of the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) into an arbitration agreement means that the parties intended to delegate class arbitrability issues to the arbitrator. In its March ruling, the Fifth Circuit panel ""reluctantly"" concluded that the issue was delegated to the arbitrators under circuit precedent, and affirmed the contrary awards.7On June 25, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the defendants an extension of time to August 28 to file a petition for certiorari on this issue.8 As of this writing, the defendants have not filed any petition for certiorari. The litigation in the district court is currently stayed, per a June 24 order.9 On September 12, the defendants filed notice of yet another appeal to the Fifth Circuit.10

Sullivan also stands as a reminder that broad delegations of power to arbitrators may prevent courts from correcting even serious errors when arbitrators go astray. Here, the parties' arbitration agreement provided for arbitration before a ""single"" arbitrator, to be resolved within four months. Nevertheless, the case has been going on for five years and as of this writing is now before its eleventh arbitrator.11

Background

Doctors Scott Sullivan and Frank Dellacroce, owners of various medical entities in New Orleans, engaged Stewart Feldman and his law firm to help ""mitigate financial risk and save taxes.""12 The investment plan ""fell apart"" after the doctors learned that the U.S. Tax Court had deemed a risk pool in the arrangement not to be a ""bona fide insurance company.""13 The ensuing dispute led to nine separate, overlapping arbitrations, culminating in a single hearing before the ""final four"" arbitrators.14 The hearing, held at a five-star resort, cost over $300,000 in room fees alone, and resulted in four wildly different awards, reaching conflicting conclusions on the ""hotly disputed"" issue of class certification and the personal liability of Jeff Carlson, president of one of the Capstone entities.15 The amounts of the conflicting awards ranged from about $1 million to about $88 million.16

The district court entered a judgment ""embodying all four awards in their riotously varying glory.""17 The defendants appealed.18

The Reluctant Affirmance of Class Arbitrability

The panel ""reluctantly"" followed precedent holding that incorporation of the AAA Rules delegates class arbitrability issues to the arbitrators.19 The parties' agreement incorporated the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, which themselves incorporate the Supplementary Rules.20 One of the Supplementary Rules provides: ""[T]he arbitrator shall determine . . . whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class.""21

Circuit courts are split on the effect of incorporation of the AAA Rules into an arbitration agreement: the Second, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that incorporation of the AAA Rules delegates class arbitrability issues to the arbitrator, but the Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits have held it does not.22 The court acknowledged that its own precedent was ""questionable"" in light of the Supreme Court's admonishment inLamps Plus, Inc. v.Varelathat ''[l]ike silence, ambiguity does not provide a sufficient basis to conclude that parties"" agreed to delegate class arbitrability.23 Nevertheless, the court affirmed the award.

Prior toSullivan, three Fifth Circuit cases had charted a ""middle path"" between the two options.24 In 2012, the court held inPetrofac v. DynMcDermott Petroleum Operations Co., ""that the express adoption of [the AAA] rules presents clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.""25 But in 2019, the court decided 20/20 Communications, Inc. v. Crawford.26 In that case, the court considered a class arbitration bar which provided that the arbitrator ""does not have the authority to fashion a proceeding gas class or collective action.""27 The court concluded that the incorporation of the AAA Rules did not clearly and unmistakably delegate arbitrability to the arbitrator when ""compare[d]"" with the class arbitration bar.28 But as one observer has pointed out, ""the only way you get to the conclusion that the parties prohibited class proceedings is to read and interpret the contract,"" and ""the delegation provision should send all contract interpretation issues to the arbitrator.""29 Consequently,20/20 Communications""amounts to an elevation of the issue of class arbitrability.""30 In other words, in some cases, the incorporation of the AAA Rules may clearly and unmistakably delegate arbitrability to the arbitrator, and in other cases, it may not.

A 2024 Fifth Circuit case complicated the issue even further, because it is in tension with 20/20 Communications. In Work v. Intertek Resource Solutions, Inc., the court held that incorporation of the JAMS Rules clearly and unmistakably delegates class arbitrability.31 But the JAMS Rules at issue, unlike the AAA Rules, donotspecifically mention class arbitrability. Rather, they state only that ""[j]urisdictional and arbitrability disputes . . . shall be submitted to and ruled on by the Arbitrator.""32 The Sullivan court thus described Work as an ""outlier"" in that ""[n]o other circuit court has held that a rule generally delegating arbitrability questions carries with it a delegation of class arbitrability.""33 The Fifth Circuit declined to rehearSullivanen banc to resolve this tension.34

The tension between these cases derives from developing Supreme Court precedent over the past three decades concerning delegation of arbitrability and its relationship to class arbitrability. In First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, the Supreme Court unanimously held in 1995 that ""[c]ourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is 'clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]' evidence that they did so.""35 This case thus established the rule for delegation of arbitrability issues in general.

Five years later, inStolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp., the Court expressed some skepticism towards class arbitration, holding that an arbitration agreement that was ""silent"" as to class arbitration did not allow for it.36 In a 5-3 decision by Justice Alito, the Court reasoned that ""class-action arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator.""37 The ""differences between bilateral and class-action arbitration"" were ""too great for arbitrators to presume . . . that the parties' mere silence on the issue of class-action arbitration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in class proceedings.""38

In the 2013, the Supreme Court considered the interaction between class arbitration and delegation in Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter.39 In that case, the Court unanimously held that an arbitrator may determine class arbitrability when ""[t]he parties agreed that the arbitrator should decide whether their contract authorized class arbitration.""40 This case thus ""seemingly took a step back fromStolt-Nielsen"" and its skepticism towards class arbitration.41 The Court held that an arbitrator's decision on the issue was controlling ""as long as the arbitrator '(even arguably) interpreted the contract.'""42

But in 2019, the Court expressed renewed skepticism towards class arbitration in Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela.43 There, the Court held 5-4 that ""[c]ourts may not infer from an ambiguous agreement that parties have consented to arbitrate on a classwide basis.""44 Chief Justice Roberts authored the majority opinion, and Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan wrote four dissents. Since then, Justices Barrett and Jackson have replaced Justices Breyer and Ginsburg on the Court.

The interaction of this line of Supreme Court cases has worked itself out in the Circuit Courts to produce the circuit split described above. Based on this history, some commentators have suggested that the Supreme Court is likely to rule that ""incorporation of the AAA rules is not 'clear and unmistakable' enough to delegate"" to the arbitrator the authority to decide class arbitrability.45

The Multiple Arbitrators and the Four-Month Deadline

Apart from the class arbitrability issue, the parties' arbitration agreement contained provisions that ""encouraged, or at least permitted, a veritable parade of arbitrations.""46 One provision gave the arbitrator the ""thesole and exclusive abilityto rule on all aspects of the arbitrator's appointment.''47 Another provided that ""either party may directly appoint the single arbitrator"" who ""shall proceed to resolve the dispute.''48 The arbitrators construed the ""single arbitrator"" provision to mean that ""multiple arbitrations could proceed simultaneously"" because each arbitration was a different ""dispute.""49 The parties' agreement did not allow the court to ""second-guess"" the arbitrators' decision, ""as long as the arbitrator's decision 'draws its essence' from the contract—even if [the court] disagree[s] with the arbitrator's interpretation.''50 Therefore, under the parties' agreement, the court was bound to defer to the arbitrators.51

Other provisions, too, contributed to the Bleak House ""parade."" The agreement stated: ""[T]he arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve all disputes and challenges to the formation and enforceability of this"" agreement.52 If the arbitrator did not complete the arbitration within four months, ""any party then may file another written demand for arbitration . . . with another"" arbitrator.53 The final four arbitrators all agreed that this deadline was ""unenforceable as unconscionable.""54 The court refused to review this determination, following the parties' agreement.55 Under Supreme Court precedent, ''[t]he sole question for [this court] is whether the arbitrator[s] (even arguably) interpreted the parties' contract, not whether [they] got its meaning right or wrong.''56 The court therefore declined to ""upend"" the arbitrators' unconscionability finding.57

The clause delegating enforceability questions thus backfired here against the drafter in a way similar to the AAA Rule delegating questions of arbitrability, including class arbitrability. At least one scholar has suggested that the law should ""distinguish[] between agreements to arbitrate a complaint and agreements to arbitrate the enforceability or scope of an arbitration provision"" by treating delegation clauses ""like weaker cousins of agreements to arbitrate the merits: terms that are presumptively valid but also laden with commonsense exceptions.""58 Although such concerns have usually been expressed in the consumer and employment arbitration contexts, this case shows that even sophisticated parties like the law firm in Sullivan may find there is a drawback to such broad delegations of authority.

Conclusion

This case illustrates complications arising from the circuit split over whether incorporation of the AAA Rules serves to delegate class arbitrability issues to the arbitrator—or in this case, arbitrators. Although the arbitrators reached opposite conclusions on this issue, the court was bound by precedent not to second-guess them.

This case also stands as a reminder to those who draft arbitration agreements of what can go wrong when parties delegate to arbitrators issues which will thereafter be unreviewable by courts. The parties' agreement stated that arbitration must take place before a ""single arbitrator"" over ""four months,"" but the arbitration took place before eleven arbitrators over five years.

Those drafting arbitration agreements ought to weigh carefully the pros and cons of extensive delegation of authority to arbitrators. Depending on the circuit, they should consider whether they want class arbitrability, in particular, to be decided by the arbitrators or by the courts.

The Oct. 19 operation at La Catedral Arena began as a quiet race day before more than 200 federal, state and local law enforcement officers descended on the venue around 2 p.m.

Officers zip-tied attendees' wrists and moved them to a holding area inside the arena. People with documentation were eventually released, while 105 undocumented individuals were loaded into vans and transported to facilities in Boise and Mountain Home.

""My wrists were ziptied so tight until I couldn't move anymore,"" Sujei Teo said. ""We were all just in like a big bunch. A big bunch of people we just wanted to get out of there.""

Five people were arrested in connection with an alleged illegal gambling operation: Ivan Tellez, the owner of La Catedral; Samuel Bejarano; Dayana Fajardo; Alejandro Estrada; and Cesar Orozco. All five were accused of allegedly assisting in the gambling operation and booked into the Ada County Jail.

The FBI stated that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement and Removal Operations division ""was present as part of the broader federal team to process individuals who were found to have potential immigration violations during the course of the investigation."" The agency said ICE's presence was separate from the criminal gambling investigation.

On Monday, families rushed to Elmore County Jail, where the ACLU of Idaho found many detainees were being held. Others returned to La Catedral to retrieve the vehicles of those who had been taken.

""I've only slept like two hours. It's been so tough,"" one family member said.

Protesters gathered at the Canyon County Administration Building, demanding answers about why more than 100 people were detained when the operation targeted five people allegedly involved in illegal gambling.

""They cannot do this to our kids,"" one protester said. ""Our kids deserve to be at school.""

By Tuesday, Tellez appeared in federal court in Boise and was released on conditions. Bejarano appeared but was not released due to his past criminal history. Estrada appeared and was released. Fajardo did not appear due to a transport issue. Orozco appeared on Wednesday and was released.

""He's a legal permanent resident. These allegations are very much out of character for Mr. Orozco,"" Max Williams, Orozco's attorney, said.

Attorneys said the 105 detainees were split up and taken to facilities in Utah, Rigby and Burley. Immigration attorneys meeting with affected families began questioning the FBI's handling of the operation.

""I think this could have been handled better,"" Nikki Ramirez said. ""If they were going to detain people for illegal activity, they could have just detained them. Why did everyone need to be questioned about their citizenship? That was irrelevant to the case they were investigating.""

On Thursday, Canyon County officials spoke publicly for the first time since the raid. Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram said he needed to clarify statements made by the Department of Homeland Security.

""Unfortunately, when people like the federal government, specifically DHS or Homeland Security, ICE comes into our community and they do these types of polarizing operations, we're left with the aftermath,"" Ingram said. ""A lot of those relationships since Sunday have been broken. The trust has been broken. So I feel like as a leader, it's my job to really engage with a community that feels that there's a divide right now.""

On Saturday, community members gathered to show support for families missing loved ones. Donations continued pouring into the ACLU to help families stock up on food and essentials, especially for children left without their parents.

""We need everybody. All of us,"" one Nampa resident said. ""We can't just stay by ourselves and make it. We need to join up and help each other.""",https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/b810ce80-f865-418f-87f8-87f409916841/20251027T040709/b810ce80-f865-418f-87f8-87f409916841_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:03:01.577798

For decades, the United States tolerated a level of illegal immigration that fostered a sense of lawlessness at the border and frustrated many Americans, including many Latinos.

Federal agents are rounding up people with brown skin, catching both U.S. citizens and legal immigrants in their dragnet. Some Latinos are now afraid to speak Spanish or listen to Spanish music in public. Some are missing Mass and staying home on Sundays, or asking friends to pick up their children from school. American citizens are living in fear of a government that is sworn to protect their liberties and keep them safe.

They have reason to fear. In President Trump’s anti-immigration blitz, federal agents have repeatedly violated civil liberties and humiliated people. Masked officials have shattered car windows and pulled out drivers, leaving children sobbing in back seats. In the middle of the night in Chicago, agents with rifles swarmed an apartment building, broke down doors and dragged people from their homes in handcuffs. Dozens of those taken away were U.S. citizens. Nationwide, immigration officials have detained more than 170 American citizens, including 20 held for more than 24 hours without the ability to make a phone call, ProPublica reported.

These actions are undermining the public trust that is necessary for effective enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws. The behavior of federal agents is provoking an angry backlash in many of the communities that Mr. Trump claims he is trying to help. If all of this is supposed to convey a sense of renewed law and order, it is not working.

As is typical for Mr. Trump, he has identified a real problem — illegal immigration — but responded with a destructive solution. For decades, the United States tolerated a level of illegal immigration that fostered a sense of lawlessness at the border and frustrated many Americans, including many Latinos. The Biden administration’s porous policies worsened the situation, making possible the largest immigration surge in American history, with most of the arrivals lacking legal permission to enter the country. Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to reverse those policies, and he has an electoral mandate to do so. At the border, he has succeeded at reducing illegal entries to the lowest levels in decades.

Yet he does not have a mandate to treat people cruelly or to break the law himself. Polls show that most Americans disapprove of his handling of the issue. The country does not need to choose between the chaos of the Biden approach and the chaos of the Trump approach. The best solution remains a comprehensive law that secures the border, deters future illegal entries, expands legal immigration and provides a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized migrants who have made their lives in the United States and are otherwise law-abiding members of society. Short of that — and Congress shows no signs of passing such a law — Mr. Trump can address illegal immigration in ways that are both more humane and effective. This country needs to enforce its laws without terrorizing innocent Americans and abandoning its values.

Of the many problems with Trump immigration policies, two themes stand out: the brutality toward immigrants who are here illegally and the unfairness toward citizens and legal immigrants.

People who entered this country illegally often did so at great risk to themselves, seeking a better life in the United States. They violated the law, yes, but the response should be proportional to their crimes. It should be both firm and humane. Instead, the Trump administration has reveled in harshness. Masked, plain-clothed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have tackled and body slammed people on the streets. Officials have launched raids into homes, destroying people’s property.

In one video, a federal agent said to a group of Latinos, including a U.S. citizen: “You got no rights here. You’re an amigo, brother.” After that encounter, one agent told another, referring to the immigrants, “We’re going to end up shooting some of them.” In another video, an agent yelled “adios” to the concerned wife of a detained migrant before he shoved her into a wall and she collapsed. Other disturbing videos have filled social media.

The tactics violate both the law and human decency. On the legal side, recent court decisions have emphasized that people accused of being here without permission have a constitutional right to some due process. That right is to all of our benefit: If the federal government could simply say that someone is in the country illegally without having to prove the claim, it could deport anyone with impunity. On the human side, a vast majority of these migrants have done nothing worse than come to the country illegally, in search of a better life. Federal agents should respond appropriately, not with the expectation that violence is necessary.

The second problem with the Trump approach is that its breadth inevitably sweeps up U.S. citizens and other legal residents. Federal officials are relying on racial profiling in a country where 20 percent of the population is Latino, most of whom are legal residents or citizens. The administration is able to do so because of Congress’s acquiescence on the topic and a wrongheaded ruling that the Supreme Court issued last month, upholding the use of racial profiling in the raids.

The use of racial discrimination in law enforcement should be an affront to all Americans. Videos show that many federal agents believe that the burden of proof is on Latinos to show they are here legally, not on the government officials who are accusing them of a crime. During a raid in California, officials yanked George Retes, a U.S. citizen who served in Iraq, from his car and held him for three days. Mr. Retes said he had a government ID in his vehicle, but officials did not let him show it to them. Similar treatment befell Javier Ramirez in California, Julio Noriega in Illinois and an unnamed military veteran in New Jersey, among others.

Americans have responded to these problems with protests. As if to prove the protesters’ point, federal agents have reacted with more abuses of power, using tear gas and pepper balls on peaceful demonstrators. Even after a federal judge demanded an end to these practices, they have continued.

Federal agents’ masks exacerbate the problems. Agents with masks know they are more likely to get away with violence and abuses of power because they are anonymous. To the community, masks signal that the government cares more about protecting its agents’ identities than democratic accountability. They create a sense that the government is sending faceless storm troopers to terrorize families.

Despite its aggressiveness, the crackdown has not even been effective at dealing with the millions of people who are in this country without legal permission. The administration is missing its own deportation benchmarks. It is on pace to deport fewer people than the Obama administration did in some years. The Obama administration’s approach made sense. It focused on people who arrived recently and on those who had committed crimes since arriving in this country — and it typically respected people’s rights to due process. It did not resort to masked agents and violent raids.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/27/opinion/27immigration-editorial-image/27immigration-editorial-image-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 12:03:59.534559

The administration’s latest move has been revising the naturalization test, making it harder, and perhaps impossible, for the most perceptive immigrants to become citizens.

In the past, aspiring citizens had to answer at least six of 10 questions correctly, in an oral examination drawn from a pool of 100. As of last week, however, new applicants will be given 20 questions, from a pool of 128, with a passing score of 12.

According to the director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, the old test was “just too easy.” As explained by a spokesperson, the new test, in conjunction with “neighborhood investigations,” will weed out those who are not “fully assimilated” and cannot “contribute to America’s greatness.”

If the test accomplishes anything, it likely will subtly favor Trump-friendly immigrants, and disfavor MAGA skeptics.

In theory, tougher new questions have replaced softballs about geography or holidays, which had short, obvious answers. Thus, two questions about the oceans bordering the U.S. have been removed, superseded by supposedly more demanding ones.

That claim is belied by the recommended answers in the new USCIS study guide, which provides equally short, easily memorized answers to seemingly complex questions.

Question 111 asks “Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War?” The sole approved answer is, “To stop the spread of communism.”

Anyone who attempted to provide a nuanced or historically comprehensive answer — say, about geopolitical rivalry or control of resources — would risk being marked wrong, and perhaps branded an unassimilated threat to American greatness.

In an oral examination with open-ended questions, the only smart approach is to stick to the answer in the study guide. It isn’t any harder to remember “stop communism” than it is to memorize “Atlantic Ocean.”

Memorization aside, the test presents a profound problem for applicants who have been paying attention to the news. The approved answers plainly contradict the conduct of the Trump administration. For many of the civics questions, honest answers would likely be unacceptable, while the approved answers clash with Trumpian reality.

Question 6, for example, asks “What does the Bill of Rights protect?” The answer, which would have been accurate before Jan. 20, is “The basic rights of people living in the United States,” with no mention of citizenship or immigration status.

The Trump administration, however, has seized people “living in the United States” without warrants, and shipped them to a notorious prison in El Salvador without any semblance of due process required by the Fifth Amendment.

Citizens and non-citizens alike, including children, have found themselves detained, roughed up and zip-tied in violation of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on arbitrary search and seizure. Nor has the First Amendment protected international students whose visas have been revoked because they disagree with U.S. foreign policy.

Question 15 asks why there are “three branches of government.” The given answer is “So one part does not become too powerful.”

Trump, of course, has asserted virtually unlimited power under the “unitary executive” theory, including an assertedly unreviewable power to order armed troops into U.S. cities, over the objections of state governors, under the pretext of “insurrection” or “rebellion.”

He also ordered the demolition of the East Wing of the White House without first consulting the National Capital Planning Commission. The list goes on.

Likewise, Question 18 asks “What part of the federal government writes laws?” The answer is “Congress.” And Question 20 asks to “Name one power of the U.S. Congress?” “Making the federal budget” is an approved answer.”

Trump has set about governing by executive order, including the unilateral imposition of tariffs, which is a power specifically given to Congress under Article I of the Constitution. He has often ignored congressional budget legislation, repeatedly disregarding the Impoundment Control Act by freezing or withholding previously authorized appropriations, grants and even disaster relief funds.

Perhaps the new test is intended as a teaching vehicle by including the ostensible reasons for the Korean, Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars — communism, communism, and freeing Kuwait. There is no question about the Iraq War, perhaps because an answer about false intelligence reports wouldn’t “contribute to America’s greatness.”

In any case, the test has a decidedly right-wing tilt, with four questions or answers about the Federalist Papers, and two suggesting Trump’s preferred version of birthright citizenship.

Most Asian immigrants were ineligible for naturalization until 1952, under racist insistence that they could not be assimilated into American society. Over 70 years later, USCIS has revived the same rationale for denying naturalizations.

Question 124 asks for the meaning of the national motto “E Pluribus Unum.” The answer, “out of many, one,” is accurate for the time being. Under Trump, it may soon be changed to, “out of many, only the right ones.”

Hamdi is a journalist and commentator who appears on British TV networks to analyze developments in the Middle East.
According to his social media, Hamdi regularly goes on speaking tours and has recently traveled to Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa, as well as the US.
Hamdi was detained Sunday morning at San Francisco International Airport by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, CAIR said in a statement.
Hamdi’s detention comes as the Trump administration has taken similar actions against pro-Palestinian activists and revoked the visas for people who have criticized Israel’s war in Gaza.","British commentator Sami Hamdi was detained on Sunday by federal immigration officers during a speaking tour in the United States, in what a Muslim advocacy group said was retaliation for his criticism of Israel.

The Trump administration said its decision to detain Hamdi and revoke his visa underscores that the US has no obligation to host foreigners “who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans.”

But the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has called Hamdi’s treatment a “blatant affront to free speech” and called for his release.

Here’s what we know.

Who is Hamdi?

Hamdi is a journalist and commentator who appears on British TV networks to analyze developments in the Middle East. Recently, he has spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza and international plans for the post-war governance of the enclave.

Based in London, Hamdi also writes about UK foreign policy and domestic politics. According to his social media, Hamdi regularly goes on speaking tours and has recently traveled to Malaysia, Turkey and South Africa, as well as the US.

He is also editor-in-chief of International Interest, a political risk consultancy in London.

When was he detained?

Hamdi was detained Sunday morning at San Francisco International Airport by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, CAIR said in a statement.

On Saturday, Hamdi had spoken at CAIR’s annual gala in Sacramento, California, and had been due to speak at the gala of CAIR Florida the next day.

CAIR said its lawyers were “working to address this injustice.” and called on ICE to release him.

“Abducting a prominent British Muslim journalist and political commentator on a speaking tour in the United States because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide is a blatant affront to free speech,” CAIR said.

Israel’s war in Gaza, launched after Hamas’ terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 68,000 people and reduced much of the enclave to rubble. Israel says its offensive has targeted Hamas and that it takes measures to avoid killing civilians, but a United Nations inquiry last month concluded for the first time that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel denies the allegation.

Why now?

Laura Loomer, a conservative activist with a direct line to Trump, said Hamdi’s arrest came after her “relentless pressure” on the State Department and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In a series of posts on X, she claimed Hamdi was “an individual with Islamic terror ties” and a supporter of Hamas.

The State Department confirmed it had arrested Hamdi, saying the US will continue to revoke the visas of foreigners who “support terrorism” and make Americans unsafe. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the approach showed common sense.

Loomer called on the Trump administration to take further action against CAIR by revoking its 501(c)(3) status, which makes the nonprofit organization exempt from federal taxes.

CAIR said Loomer, who has taken credit for a slew of high-profile firings in the Trump administration, was an “anti-Muslim extremist.” Loomer has previously described Islam as a “cancer on humanity” and said Muslims should not be allowed to seek political office in the US.

What are the legal issues?

Hamdi’s detention comes as the Trump administration has taken similar actions against pro-Palestinian activists and revoked the visas for people who have criticized Israel’s war in Gaza.

In October, Mario Guevara – a Salvadoran journalist who documented immigration raids – was deported to El Salvador after spending months in federal custody. He was arrested in June while covering an Atlanta-area “No Kings” protest against what organizers describe as Trump’s “authoritarian” agenda.

Legal experts and judges have voiced concern over the legal basis for such detentions. In September, William Young – a federal judge appointed in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan – issued an extraordinary 161-page rebuke of the Trump administration, saying its efforts to deport non-citizen activists represented a “full-throated assault on the First Amendment.”

Young’s ruling is expected to be appealed.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2187203810.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-27 13:03:05.531001

The salient points include the provisions that any H-1B petitions that are approved for an extension of stay, amendment or change of status – including change of employer petitions -will not be subject to the Presidential Proclamation or the associated $100,000.00 filing fee.

Additional Key Provisions:

USCIS also indicated that foreign nationals located within the United States with approved H1B petitions will not be subject to the proclamation or associated $100,000 fee if they depart the United States. A departure from the USA by a foreign national while an H-1B petition is pending will trigger the H-1B visa fee.

H-1B petitions filed with consular notifications after the effective date of September 21st, 2025, will be subject to the $100,000 fee regardless of whether the foreign national was in the United States at the time of the H-1B filing, apart from certain foreign nationals who hold current H-1B status.

Filing for Exceptions:

To qualify for a national interest exception, USCIS regulations mandate a high level and threshold mandating that the U.S. employer is unable to locate a qualified U.S. worker available for the role and contrary to the Proclamation itself, USCIS does not permit exceptions on a company-wide or industry-wide basis.

Eligibility for national interest exceptions would be granted only in ‘exceptionally rare’ circumstances where the following criteria may be met:

The foreign national’s presence in the United States is in the interest of the national interest of the United States;

No American worker is available to assume the position offered;

The foreign national does not pose a security threat to the United States;

Payment of the $100,000 fee by a U.S. employer would significantly undermine the national interest of the United States.

Considerations:

Travel Outside the United States after petition approval –If a foreign national employee departs the United States after the petition is approved, they will not become subject to the $100,000.00 fee because of their departure.

“The stated aims of the proclamation are to curb H-1B program abuses by prioritizing high-skilled, high-paid workers and to avoid the displacement of U.S. workers,” Dyer said.
Not explicitly clarified in the updated guidance was who exactly is supposed to pay the $100,000 fee.
“Maybe a company like Amazon or Meta could afford to pay $100,000 per worker to hire H-1B employees,” Minear said.
Specifically, Minear emphasized that H-1B visas are often the only temporary visa status available to Virginia’s doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers and teachers.","An executive order signed by President Donald Trump last month has left business immigration attorneys scrambling to understand its potential fallout and impact on their clients.

On Sept. 19, Trump signed the “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers” proclamation, mandating a new $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa petitions filed beginning on Sept. 21.

The H-1B visas allow employers to hire foreign workers in “specialty occupations” that require four-year college degrees, such as technology, engineering and medicine, on a temporary basis.

Charlottesville attorney Jennifer Minear, director of McCandlish Holton’s immigration practice group, said her inbox “exploded with inquiries about the proclamation” in the days following the announcement.

“To say that I have been fielding concerned calls about this issue would be a considerable understatement,” Minear said.

Henrico attorney Dustin Dyer, whose firm solely focuses on immigration law, said the proclamation could have impacts beyond the ultimate goal of the order.

“The stated aims of the proclamation are to curb H-1B program abuses by prioritizing high-skilled, high-paid workers and to avoid the displacement of U.S. workers,” Dyer said. “While the stated aim sounds lofty, the restrictions imposed by this proclamation are short-sighted and detrimental to the U.S. economy.”

Ultimately, attorneys in the business immigration space have cautioned that advice to clients remains subject to change as the situation develops, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services providing updates as recently as Oct. 20 on the proclamation, clarifying who is subject to the fee and exemptions.

“Because clients simply do not know whether this fee will apply, and because they know they can’t pay the fee if it does apply, I am already seeing multiple clients question whether they should proceed with job offers to those seeking H-1B status,” Minear said.

Proclamation

Per the executive order, the $100,000 fee for new H-1B applicants went into effect on Sept. 21 and would remain effective for one year, with the goal to target alleged “abuse” of the visa system by some employers.

The order cites statistics showing a growing percentage of foreign workforce share in areas such as computers and math, which the White House claimed “has made it even more challenging for college graduates trying to find IT jobs, allowing employers to hire foreign workers at a significant discount to American workers.”

To say that I have been fielding concerned calls about this issue would be a considerable understatement.

— Jennifer Minear, Charlottesville

Left unanswered in the proclamation was who would be on the hook for the $100,000 fee and which specific applicants are exempt from the fee.

“The proclamation was, to put it generously, poorly drafted and missing a lot of important information necessary to understand its scope and meaning,” Minear said.

On Oct. 20, USCIS issued guidance related to the $100,000 proclamation, clarifying that the fee does not apply to “an alien inside the United States” requesting an amendment, change or status or extension of stay, and that current H-1B visa holders are not prevented from traveling in and out of the country.

USCIS further stated that the secretary of Homeland Security can grant exemption to the $100,000 payment “in the extraordinarily rare circumstance where the Secretary has determined that a particular alien worker’s presence in the United States as an H-1B worker is in the national interest” and that no American worker can fill that role.

Notably, the updated guidance includes the terms “extraordinarily rare” and “high threshold,” terms absent from the initial executive order.

Minear said that the “national interest” exemption “is narrowed considerably” by the USCIS language.

“I am extremely skeptical that anyone will be approved for an exemption based on the process and criteria described,” Minear said.

USCIS also provided a pay.gov link through which “petitioners should submit the required $100,000 payment” and clarified that petitioners must make payment prior to filing with USCIS.

Not explicitly clarified in the updated guidance was who exactly is supposed to pay the $100,000 fee.

While the stated aim sounds lofty, the restrictions imposed by this proclamation are short-sighted and detrimental to the U.S. economy.

— Dustin Dyer, Henrico

Minear said her clients, many of whom are in the health care or education industries, are seeking guidance on next steps regarding the fee.

“Maybe a company like Amazon or Meta could afford to pay $100,000 per worker to hire H-1B employees,” Minear said. “My clients sure can’t.”

The updated guidance by USCIS comes as two federal lawsuits have been filed challenging the executive order.

The U.S Chamber of Commerce filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Oct. 16, arguing that Congress has the authority over H-1B visas and that the $100,000 fee would inflict significant harm on American businesses.

Some two weeks earlier, a diverse group of plaintiffs representing multiple industries filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, providing similar arguments and claiming harms to health care and education employers.

Due to the pending federal suits, Minear cautioned that it is “exceedingly difficult to advise clients in this environment.”

Looking ahead

Dyer anticipated potential economic impacts should the executive order survive scrutiny by the federal courts.

“H-1B professional workers, particularly those in fields like technology, health care and research, play a critical role in driving innovation and filling labor gaps that U.S. workers cannot always address,” Dyer said. “Limiting their entry by imposing an outrageous fee to utilize the H-1B program not only threatens America’s global competitiveness but also undermines businesses and industries that rely on specialized skills.”

Minear said her office receives so many inquiries on the H-1B visa issue that she has created templated email responses to the inquiries.

“There are, of course, no clients who can afford to pay a $100,000 additional fee to use the H-1B program, so if the fee is allowed to stand, it will effectively gut the H-1B visa program,” Minear said.

Dyer noted a possible alternative for long-term success that he theorized would benefit all stakeholders.

“The long-term economic costs far outweigh any perceived short-term benefits, and the U.S. should instead focus on policies that support both domestic workers and the talent we attract from around the world,” Dyer said.

Ultimately, Minear said the situation remains fluid while practitioners await more definitive guidance from the federal government and the resolution of the federal lawsuits.

“Hopefully, we will soon have an injunction from a federal District Court or, at minimum, further guidance from the administration that blunts the catastrophic impact of this proclamation on sectors of the economy that rely heavily on H-1B workers,” she said.

Specifically, Minear emphasized that H-1B visas are often the only temporary visa status available to Virginia’s doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers and teachers.

“The impact on Virginia’s education and health care system is certain to be profoundly negative if the proclamation remains in effect,” she said.",https://valawyersweekly.com/files/2025/10/Depositphotos_335369082_XL.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:02:10.780367

With this rulemaking, DHS proposes to amend its regulations governing the process by which U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) selects H-1B cap-subject petitions (or H-1B petitions for any year in which the registration requirement is suspended). The agency proposed to move away from a purely random lottery selection process to a weighted process to favor the selection of higher-skilled and higher-paid workers.

While CIS believes the DHS proposal will improve the status quo, CIS proposed additional reforms to ensure that the H-1B program fulfills its statutory purpose: to allow U.S. employers to temporarily hire truly high-skilled workers when qualified U.S. workers are unavailable — without displacing or undercutting American labor.

Replacing the purely random selection process with one that prioritizes higher wages and higher skill levels will help restore the program’s original intent, discourage abuse, and protect both U.S. and foreign workers from unfair labor practices. In tandem, CIS requested that DHS amend its regulations to only provide cap exemption eligibility for workers who are directly employed by a qualifying employer, reinstate USCIS’s itinerary requirement, repeal USCIS’s deference policy, tighten the “specialty occupation” definition, and work with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to raise wage rates to close known loopholes and enhance oversight.

Taken together, these changes would make the H-1B program more transparent, merit-based, and consistent with the letter and spirit of the Immigration and Nationality Act. CIS urged DHS to adopt a final rule that fully advances these objectives and to coordinate with DOL to ensure that wage-setting and certification processes align with congressional intent.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/h-1b-visa-social.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:01:50.062128

Rep. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) told Source New Mexico that a volunteer in her office spent the last several months creating AGUAS-NM.com in response to widespread—but hard-to-verify—reports of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arresting people across the state.

“Our community is held to the rule of law, so why shouldn’t law enforcement…be documented in hopes that they will follow the law as well?” she told Source on Thursday in a phone interview. “It was born of frustration and hope that when we shine a little bit of light that hopefully transparency wins.”

The website greets visitors with a disclaimer about the potential inaccuracy of individual arrest reports, and it warns that the website should not be used to interfere with law enforcement operations, which Anaya also stressed in the interview.

Users can anonymously submit photos, videos or summaries of potential ICE arrests to the website, which will then appear on the map as “unverified” until representatives of community groups visit the site in person and talk to witnesses, Anaya said.

Adding a layer of verification should help instill trust in the website while also aiming to stop the spread of misinformation, she said.

“Often people will think that a private security guard is ICE when really they may not be,” she said. “And I think that’s why we’re focusing so heavily on making sure that we have validated and unvalidated check marks.”

Spokespersons for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and El Centro de Igualdad and Derechos, two immigrant advocacy organizations, declined to comment Friday on the new website.

Data about how many ICE arrests have occurred in New Mexico amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push is hard to come by, though national data suggests arrests are increasing. The number of people ICE has detained in the state’s three detention centers has steadily increased, as well.

Some statewide elected officials are trying to collect information about ICE arrests to distribute to the public, including in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County. That’s another potential source of “verified” reports for the AGUAS-NM website, Anaya said.

“When it comes to other areas of the state, clearly, that’ll work a little bit differently,” she said. “But for us, it’s more about transparency.

Guardian Australia has spoken to lawyers for eight people who have since been sent back to immigration detention awaiting their eventual deportation.
Upon his re-detainment, Adnan told border force officers he wanted to see his wife and children after being apart for more than a decade.
Adnan says he found out about his visa for Nauru in the middle of the night when border force officers came to his door and took him back into detention.","Adnan* says he had never heard of Nauru when Australian Border Force officers showed up at his door in the middle of the night to inform him Nauru had granted him a 30-year visa.

Initially believing Nauru was part of Australia, Adnan felt a brief sense of relief before he realised he was being sent back to a place he had become uncomfortably familiar with – immigration detention.

“I thought there had been a mistake. I hadn’t had a lawyer for years, and I had never really understood what was happening in my case,” he told Guardian Australia through his lawyer.

“I have been in detention since, trying to figure out how all of this happened to me, and why I have been selected for this punishment.”

The man, whose real name Guardian Australia is not using to reduce the risk of reprisal, is one of more than 350 people within the so-called NZYQ cohort, which the federal government has promised to deport to the tiny Pacific island in a $2.5bn deal.

In 2023, the high court ruled the government’s policy of indefinitely locking up non-citizens who cannot be deported to another country was unconstitutional. The judgment paved the way for the group’s release.

It’s a cohort consisting of many different stories. Some – including Adnan – have had their visas cancelled on character grounds after being convicted of crimes and sentenced to 12 months or more in jail. Others have been refused a visa but cannot be deported because they are refugees or stateless.

A number of people within the group have since been subject to strict monitoring conditions, including ankle monitors, as part of tough restrictions to ensure community safety.

A deal struck with Nauru in February means authorities can apply for long-term visas on behalf of people within the NZYQ cohort without their knowledge. Once Nauru grants the visa, Australian authorities can re-detain the visa holder in an immigration detention centre until they are sent to the island.

The government swiftly passed laws in September stripping non-citizens on removal pathways of natural justice – a legal principle affording everyone access to a fair hearing and to a decision without bias.

The changes aim to speed up deportations by removing the cohort’s right to taking further legal challenges that might delay their deportation.

In recent months, authorities have been conducting night-time and dawn raids on those within the cohort who have been granted a 30-year visa for Nauru – an island home to just 12,000 people and with limited physical and mental health services.

Guardian Australia has spoken to lawyers for eight people who have since been sent back to immigration detention awaiting their eventual deportation. Many more are believed to have been re-detained but with the government refusing to release any details, human rights groups are left to investigate who is suddenly missing from the community.

Adnan says it feels as if he is “living in a nightmare”.

Upon his re-detainment, Adnan told border force officers he wanted to see his wife and children after being apart for more than a decade. Adnan could not leave the country or bring his family to Australia prior to his conviction because he had been placed on temporary protection visas.

Adnan says he found out about his visa for Nauru in the middle of the night when border force officers came to his door and took him back into detention.

“These days are like living in a nightmare. I made mistakes since I came to Australia – I have been punished for those mistakes. I have tried everything to put my life back on track. I am not a young man – I cannot keep rebuilding my life. I do not know why Australia has selected me for this terrible punishment,” he says.

The deputy chief executive of the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre, Jana Favero, says Australia’s treatment of noncitizens with criminal convictions is divisive and unfair.

“If two people commit the same crime, but only one faces exile to a remote island penal colony after they’ve done their time, that’s not justice – it’s divisive and sends a message to people without citizenship that they will never be equal,” she says.

Details about the criminal histories of the people within the NZYQ cohort are scant but the home affairs department in March said 13 had been convicted for murder or attempted murder.

About 95 have had a criminal history of sex-based offending and 133 have been previously convicted of assault, violent offending, kidnapping or armed robbery. At least nine have been found guilty of low-level crimes or have no criminal history. All were detained after serving their sentences.

Favero says border force’s unannounced night-time visits to people mirrored controversial intimidation tactics by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“What we’ve seen with ICE in the US is now becoming reality here – and families will be torn apart, with devastating, lifelong consequences,” she says.

“This kind of alarming behaviour by border force officials is copying the worst of tactics from Trump and ICE, turning up unannounced and intimidating people, and in some cases detaining them, simply because of where they were born.”

The Human Rights Law Centre’s legal director, Sanmati Verma, told Guardian Australia the government is ignoring the “brutal reality” of its actions.

“Under the cover of secrecy, the Australian government is pulling people out of the community, locking them in detention, and smuggling them out of the country,” she says.

“No matter where we are from, or what visa we hold, there is a common dignity that binds our communities together. We should not accept our government inflicting lifelong punishment on migrants and refugees, simply because of their visa status.”

A home affairs department spokesperson says it does not comment on operational matters but is “committed to maintaining a migration system that is robust, effective and in the national interest”.

“A memorandum of understanding between Australia and the Republic of Nauru signed on 29 August 2025 enables Australia to effect the removal of individuals who have no legal right to remain in Australia and cannot be returned to a country of which they hold citizenship,” the spokesperson says.

Travis County v. ICE Local law enforcement officials in the Austin area have often been at odds with Republican state and federal political leadership over the role local law enforcement should play in immigration enforcement.
Other options are less expansive, like training sheriff’s deputies to run their own immigration checks from county jails.","ICE agents are seizing more people from jails in the Austin area, county officials tell The Texas Newsroom, sometimes visiting the facilities multiple times per day as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement nationwide.

“For inmates in our care and custody, they usually wait 24 hours or less because we get pickups from [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] almost every day,” Kristen Dark, Public Information Officer of the Travis County Sheriff’s Office, said in an interview this month.

She added: “Sometimes they do pick up from us twice a day.”

Aggressive immigration sweeps and arrests have become a hallmark of Trump-era immigration policy. Cities in blue states like California and Illinois have seen the most public crackdowns, including the deployment of federal troops. But, in Texas, where local leaders are compelled to hand people arrested on other charges over ICE directly from county jails, many immigration arrests remain hidden from public view.

The Texas Newsroom filed records requests and spoke to immigrants’ advocates and law enforcement officials to get a clearer picture of how immigration enforcement has changed here under Donald Trump’s second term.

The findings reveal that a growing number of people in Travis County find themselves facing deportation after sometimes routine run-ins with the police.

The jump in the number of people in the county jail identified for ICE arrest coincides with similar increases in other Texas counties, according to data from the Deportation Data Project.

Dark says the local increase can largely be attributed to a growing jail population. Others point to Trump administration policies that have swept a growing number of people into ICE custody and deportation proceedings.

Some local law enforcement officials, like Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez, worry the current administration’s aggressive policies could further interfere with their efforts to build healthier connections with immigrant communities. Hernandez is one of several law enforcement officials in Texas who have been reluctant to cooperate with federal immigration agents.

Despite these concerns, even more people will likely face deportation after entering the jail system under a new state law taking effect next year.

“Hernandez always says, we want people to run to us, not away from us,” Dark said. “If someone is a victim of crime, we don't want them to be afraid to talk to us. We want to hear from them.”

The state’s top Republican politicians, like Gov. Greg Abbott, have voiced strong support for policies that compel local officials to enforce federal immigration rules.

""Texas finally has a partner in the White House,” Andrew Mahaleris, Press Secretary for Abbott wrote in response to a request for comment. “Governor Abbott fully supports the Trump Administration’s efforts to deport those who intentionally broke our laws and entered our country illegally.""

Civil rights advocates point out that ICE is, increasingly, detaining people who are in the county legally or are pursuing a path to legal residency.

ICE detainers go up

In Texas, jails will hold someone for an additional 48 hours if a background check reveals the person may be in the country without legal status. This “immigration hold,” which is also called an “ICE detainer,” gives federal agents more time to take them into custody.

People can be arrested and sent to county lockup for reasons as innocuous as driving without a license to far more serious allegations like assault. Until final conviction, they are presumed innocent.

Immigration attorney Iris Albizu believes part of the increase in immigration arrests from county jail is because ICE is detaining more people who are in the process of applying for legal residency.

“What is shocking is that people that are already in the system, people that already have a protected status [...] those people are being detained,” Albizu said.

In response to an open records request, the Travis County Sheriff's office provided The Texas Newsroom with snapshots of the number of people in county jails on the first day of each month for the past several years.

Six out of the nine months this year showed higher numbers of people with ICE detainers as compared to this same period last year. It was the highest in May, when 343 people in Travis County jails were flagged for pickup by ICE. That month, people with ICE detainers accounted for nearly 15% of the local jail population.

But monthly point-in-time numbers only tell part of the story, as some people may be moved from the jail and then to ICE detention before they are counted, and others may stay in jail for months appearing in multiple counts.

Analysts said a better metric is to measure the growth in ICE detainers issued to people booked into jail.

ICE data compiled by the Deportation Data Project, a project run by UCLA and UC Berkeley, shows the number of detainers issued to people booked into local jails was 40% higher in the first six months of this year than during that same period last year.

“It's clear that the Trump administration's priorities around increasing immigration enforcement and mass deportation — they are doing that in Travis County,” said Jacob Kang-Brown, a researcher who studies the use of county jails in immigration enforcement at the Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank that advocates against mass incarceration.

This uptick cannot be fully explained by an increase in the local jail population. While overcrowding has been an issue in Travis County jails, the rise in detainers issues appears to have outpaced jail population growth.

“Texas has one of the highest rates of ICE arrests, and that's really being driven by the arrests that are happening in the local jails,” Kang-Brown added.

The Texas Newsroom has asked for more detailed data on ICE detainers to provide a fuller picture of local enforcement patterns.

Travis County v. ICE

Local law enforcement officials in the Austin area have often been at odds with Republican state and federal political leadership over the role local law enforcement should play in immigration enforcement.

Hernandez unsuccessfully fought a 2017 law that mandated that counties hold all inmates flagged with ICE detainers for pickup. Since then, she has complied with the mandate.

But, unlike some other counties, Travis has not partnered with federal or state agencies to enforce immigration policy beyond the detainer system. This affects communication between the agencies, which is already limited.

Dark said neither ICE nor the Texas Department of Public Safety have notified the Travis County Sheriff’s ahead of time when they conduct immigration sweeps or raids.

ICE did not reply to an emailed list of questions from The Texas Newsroom.

But under a new state law passed this year, coordination between ICE and local sheriff’s departments will expand despite this reticence.

The new law, which will go into full effect by the end of next year, will require departments to choose from three different options for how to form deeper partnerships with federal immigration agents.

One will allow counties to create their own immigration task forces, empowered to check people's citizenship status while out on patrol. Other options are less expansive, like training sheriff’s deputies to run their own immigration checks from county jails.

""We're looking at all of the models very, very carefully. And we'll be considering the cost and the impact of each before we make our decision,"" said Dark.

No matter what model counties chose, immigrants advocates say the law is sure to increase the already growing number of people who find themselves facing deportation after being detained by local authorities for unrelated reasons.

“That person may be innocent of whatever they’re charged with,” said immigration attorney Iris Albizu, “But, because now they’re caught by immigration, they’re trapped.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0238af0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+248/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd0%2F80%2F3b374b864fb490236bebd123f39f%2Ftravis-county-correctional-complex-50839314891-o.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:16:55.094459

“This individual’s visa was revoked and he is in ICE custody pending removal,” Ms. McLaughlin wrote, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

Mr. Hamdi appeared to be the latest person to have an American visa revoked over political speech. Other cases have raised questions about First Amendment protections.

Mr. Hamdi is the managing director of the International Interest, an organization that “advises on geopolitical environments and risks across the globe,” according to its website. He has appeared as a commentator on the British television news channel Sky News and other outlets.

He had been on a speaking tour in the United States, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization. He attended the organization’s annual gala on Friday night in Sacramento and was scheduled to speak at a gala in Florida on Sunday night.

Mr. Hamdi was detained at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday morning, according to CAIR, which called for his release. Mr. Hamdi is based in London, according to his LinkedIn account.

CAIR said in a statement that Mr. Hamdi had been detained “because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide” while on his speaking tour. It called the action “a blatant affront to free speech.”

CAIR has long been controversial in Washington, presenting itself as a champion of civil rights for Muslims in an era of Islamophobia yet regularly pilloried by many, especially on the political right, as an apologist for extremism.

“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” Ms. McLaughlin said in the social media post on Sunday.

Earlier this fall, judges rebuked Secretary of State Marco Rubio for taking similar actions against other pro-Palestinian activists. A judge in Massachusetts last month ruled that the Trump administration had used the threat of deportation to systematically silence noncitizens in academia who protested in support of Palestinians. He said the government had violated the First Amendment as part of a broader strategy to stamp out campus activism.

On its X account, the State Department reposted Ms. McLaughlin’s announcement about Mr. Hamdi and added: “We’ve said it before, we’ll say it again: The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans. We continue to revoke the visas of persons engaged in such activity.”

Federal officials initially identified him as Jose Castro-Rivera, but family members say his name was Josué Castro Rivera, a 24-year-old from Honduras.

According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, agents tried to detain Castro Rivera and three other passengers Thursday morning after pulling over their vehicle as part of what the Department of Homeland Security described as a “targeted, intelligence-based” operation. ICE said Castro Rivera “resisted heavily and fled,” running into traffic where he was hit by a passing vehicle.

Virginia State Police said troopers responded around 11 a.m. to a vehicle-pedestrian crash in the eastbound lanes near the Military Highway interchange. They said the man was struck by a 2002 Ford pickup and died at the scene. The crash remains under investigation.

Family members told the Associated Press that Castro Rivera was headed to a gardening job that morning and had been living in the United States for about four years, sending money home to relatives in Honduras. His brother, Henry Castro, called his death “an injustice.”

“He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him,” Henry Castro said. “He had a very good heart.”He added that the family is now raising money to transport Josué’s body back to Honduras for burial.

DHS officials have not commented further on the incident but reiterated that the outcome “could have been prevented had Castro Rivera complied with our officers.”

Immigration attorneys and advocates in Virginia said the case underscores growing fear within immigrant communities amid an escalation of federal enforcement actions nationwide.

President

Arab American Institute

A century ago, Gibran Khalil Gibran wrote a love poem to Lebanon, ""You have your Lebanon, I have my Lebanon."" He spoke of his affection for the captivating qualities of generosity and hospitality of the Lebanese people and the sheer beauty of the country and contrasted this with Lebanon’s petty, bickering politicians who sought nothing more than their own aggrandizement. When I read this poem, I saw parallels between the understanding of the contradictions at play in Lebanon and those in my country, the United States of America.

Today, many Americans are living in fear and even despair as they watch their president, seemingly unchecked, tearing down some of the foundations of democracy and gutting social and economic programs that have for decades provided for the safety, security, and well-being of millions. They ask: “How could this be happening?” and “Can our country survive this onslaught?”

But, as has always been the case in America, while some have felt hopeless, others are driven to respond. And so it was that a week ago, seven million Americans took to the streets in 2,700 cities and towns to demonstrate their resolve to save America’s democracy and arrest the drift toward authoritarianism.

All of this should serve as a reminder that there have always been these two Americas: one pushing to restrict democratic freedoms and the other working to expand them. Both have defined our history.

America, after all, was born with the original sins of genocide against native peoples, the forced enslavement of Africans, and the annexation and subjugation of Spanish-speaking peoples of the Southwest. As the country grew and attracted immigrants, these newcomers, whether they were Irish, Italians, Central Europeans, Jews, or Arabs were often met with discrimination, repression, and even violence.

This, however, was always only one part of America’s story. On the other side, for every racist, segregationist, anti-immigrant bigot, there were abolitionists who fought slavery, and organized movements that championed immigrants, labor, and civil rights for Blacks, Latinos, and Native peoples. And in the last century, for every xenophobe like Fr. Coughlin or Pat Buchanan, or segregationist like Bull Connor or George Wallace, there was a Martin Luther King, Caesar Chavez, and Jesse Jackson. And despite persistent bigotry and waves of recurring anti-immigrant bigotry, what remains are the core of Dr. King’s “I have a dream” speech and the spirit of the Statue of Liberty’s words welcoming the “tired and poor, yearning to be free.”

This is my family’s story. While my father’s mother and siblings were all able to immigrate to America after World War I, he was delayed and then unable to secure a visa because Congress determined that there were too many immigrants from the Mediterranean region. (One Senator famously said, “We don’t need any more Syrian trash in America.”) Eager to reunite with his family, he got a job on a ship sailing to Canada and then crossed into the US without documents in 1923. He received amnesty in the 1930s and became a citizen in 1943. Four decades later I was serving as a deputy campaign manager for Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign and was given to opportunity to place his name in nomination at the 1984 Democratic Convention.

Reflecting on my personal history as a metaphor for the broader American story, I noted in my speech that “I am the son of an illegal immigrant who is nominating for president the great grandson of a slave. Nowhere else but America could this happen.”

It’s important to remember that these two Americas are always with us. And we must never forget either one. If we forget the threats and challenges to freedom, we let down our guard and become vulnerable to the assaults when they come. But if we forget the promise of America and fail to recall the heroes and movements who in every generation have fought and won, then we lose hope and fail to meet the challenges before us.

And so, to those who despair and say that what is happening today is” un-American” as they witness efforts to gut voting rights, curtail immigration, use of military force to violently expel migrants and threaten freedom of speech and assembly—we must respond that we've been here before and we’ve always risen up to confront these threats to liberty. And we’ve won.

The bottom line is that we should remember that we’ve been through other dark periods in our history. In my lifetime, we’ve witnessed: the hysteria and repression of the McCarthy era’s manufactured anti-Communism scare; the racism and violence that followed the civil rights movement; the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Dr. King; the deeply polarizing Vietnam war; the national trauma of 9/11 and the anti-Arab and anti-Muslim hate crimes and government repression that followed; and the disastrous failed wars against Afghanistan and Iraq. Each time, we rose to meet these challenges.

Given our history, I feel confident that in the face of today’s xenophobia, racism, repression, and hate, we will rise again. Like Gibran, we will assert: “You have your America, I have my America.”

Originally conceived to combat international terrorist networks like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS), these designations trigger sweeping financial sanctions, severe criminal penalties, and extensive surveillance authorities. President Donald Trump’s comments at a White House roundtable on “Antifa” earlier this month make it likely that his administration will designate this decentralized anti-fascist movement as an FTO — a move that would create an unprecedented expansion of counterterrorism authorities into the domestic political space.

During the roundtable, Trump was asked directly whether he would designate Antifa as an FTO. The president’s response was unambiguous: “I think it’s the kind of thing I’d like to do. If you agree, I agree. Let’s get it done.” This was not casual political rhetoric. It was a directive from the Commander-in-Chief to his national security apparatus, witnessed by millions of Americans. It is also something the first Trump administration took steps toward enacting near the end of the president’s first term in office. (For example, see section 2 of the Executive Order issued on Jan. 5, 2021.) The implications could extend far beyond anti-fascist activists to the entire architecture of American civil society and constitutional governance.

The FTO Framework: Powerful by Design

To understand why an Antifa FTO designation would be so consequential, one must first grasp the extraordinary scope of authorities that such designations unleash. The FTO system was deliberately constructed to maximize governmental power against international terrorist threats. Created by the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the framework provides the executive branch with extraordinary authorities that are designed to dismantle terrorist networks quickly and comprehensively.

Once an organization is designated as an FTO, providing “material support” to it becomes a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison, or life if the support results in death. The statutory definition of “material support” is intentionally expansive and includes providing: “currency or monetary instruments, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, personnel, and transportation.” Only medicine and religious materials are explicitly exempted.

The breadth of this definition reflects Congress’s determination to eliminate all forms of assistance to designated organizations. The statute applies to U.S. persons regardless of where the prohibited conduct occurs, creating global reach for American terrorism prosecutions. The Supreme Court’s decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project clarified that even speech intended to promote peaceful conflict resolution may constitute material support if provided to a designated organization.

Financial consequences activate automatically upon designation. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requires all U.S. financial institutions to freeze assets within ten business days and report the frozen funds to the government. This financial disruption is designed to immediately sever designated organizations from the global financial system, preventing them from accessing resources needed for operations.

The Holy Land Foundation case demonstrates the scope of these authorities when applied to charitable organizations. Five charity officials received sentences ranging from 15 to 65 years for providing aid to Palestinian communities that prosecutors argued were under the influence of Hamas, a designated FTO. While the defendants maintained they were providing legitimate humanitarian assistance, the court found that the statutory framework criminalized their support regardless of the charitable intent.

Immigration Consequences and the Specter of Denaturalization

Beyond criminal prosecution and financial sanctions, FTO designation triggers severe immigration consequences that could create an underclass of vulnerable individuals subject to expulsion. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, any non-citizen who is a member or representative of a designated FTO is automatically inadmissible to the United States and subject to removal proceedings. The State Department may immediately revoke visas of any foreign nationals deemed to be members, representatives, or supporters of the designated organization. This authority extends to individuals who have “endorsed or espoused terrorist activity” or provided any form of material support, creating an exceptionally broad basis for visa revocation and deportation. (That said, similar provisions for removal of foreign nationals lawfully in the United States are currently being challenged in court on First Amendment grounds.)

The consequences reach even further for naturalized American citizens. Federal law permits denaturalization of individuals who were members of or affiliated with a “terrorist organization” within five years immediately following naturalization. Once Antifa receives FTO designation, any naturalized citizen who attended a counter-protest, donated to a legal defense fund, or expressed support for anti-fascist principles during their first five years as a citizen could face citizenship revocation proceedings.

The recent expansion of denaturalization enforcement, with the Department of Justice announcing in June 2025 that denaturalization cases would become one of its top five enforcement priorities, creates a particularly acute vulnerability for many of the estimated 25 million naturalized Americans. Consider a German immigrant who became a U.S. citizen in 2023 and maintained connections with anti-fascist groups in her home country, or a French national who was naturalized in 2024 after years of participating in counter-demonstrations against far-right movements in Europe. Both could face potential citizenship revocation and deportation based on activities that were entirely legal when undertaken.

The denaturalization standard requires only “clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence” in civil proceedings — a lower threshold than criminal conviction — and carries no statute of limitations. This creates a permanent cloud of legal jeopardy hanging over millions of naturalized Americans whose past political associations could be reinterpreted as terrorism support under an expansive FTO designation.​

Civil Liability Under the Anti-Terrorism Act

The designation of Antifa as an FTO could also potentially expose individuals and organizations to devastating civil liability under the Anti-Terrorism Act (18 U.S.C. § 2333). The ATA authorizes any U.S. national injured “by reason of an act of international terrorism” committed by a designated FTO to sue for treble damages, plus attorneys’ fees and costs. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), enacted in 2016, expanded this authority to include aiding-and-abetting liability against “any person who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with” those who commit acts of international terrorism. This creates possible exposure not just for alleged Antifa subjects themselves, but for anyone deemed to have provided material support — including nonprofits, donors, and service providers.

Unlike criminal cases requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt, ATA civil cases proceed under the lower “preponderance of the evidence” standard, making them easier to win. Even frivolous ATA lawsuits could impose crippling litigation costs — defense firms specializing in terrorism cases charge hundreds of dollars per hour, and cases routinely take years to resolve. The threat of ATA liability could force organizations to obtain expensive specialized insurance (if available at all), conduct exhaustive vetting of all partners and donors, and potentially abandon any activities that could be remotely connected to anti-fascist activism. This civil liability mechanism could thus accomplish through private litigation what criminal prosecution alone might not achieve: the significant curtailment of civil society organizations engaged in political opposition to “anti-fascism,” not through direct government action but through the specter of catastrophic financial liability.

The FISA Surveillance Integration

An FTO designation would also seamlessly integrate Antifa into America’s most sophisticated surveillance infrastructure. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the government may conduct electronic surveillance of “agents of foreign powers,” including “groups engaged in international terrorism.” Once Antifa is designated as an FTO, anyone deemed an “agent” of this “foreign power” becomes eligible for FISA surveillance — including American citizens (though with some stricter standards).

This surveillance integration represents a qualitative escalation beyond traditional criminal investigation. FISA surveillance operates under different standards than domestic criminal investigations. Federal agents need only demonstrate probable cause that “the target of the surveillance is a foreign power or [an] agent of a foreign power” and that “a significant purpose” is obtaining “foreign intelligence information.” The standard does not require demonstration that criminal activity is planned or imminent.

The National Security Agency’s (NSA) authorities under FISA are extensive and largely classified, but publicly available documentation confirms the agency “relies on Title I of FISA to conduct electronic surveillance of foreign powers or their agents, to include members of international terrorist organizations.” These capabilities extend beyond simple wiretapping to include comprehensive electronic monitoring, physical searches, and business records collection.

For American citizens associated with anti-fascist activities, FISA designation could mean potential subjection to the full spectrum of intelligence community surveillance capabilities, all conducted in secret with limited judicial oversight. Unlike criminal investigations, FISA surveillance does not require notification of targets, potentially allowing years of monitoring without the subject’s knowledge.

Social Media Transformation: From Resistance to Compliance

The surveillance implications extend beyond government agencies to encompass the private sector platforms where much contemporary political organization occurs. The impact on digital platforms would be immediate and comprehensive. Major social media companies — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram — maintain terms of service prohibiting content from designated terrorist organizations. Currently, these platforms often resist government information requests about political activists based on First Amendment principles. An FTO designation could eliminate the legal foundation for such resistance.

Facebook’s Community Standards explicitly state that “organizations that are engaged in terrorist activity are not allowed on the platform.” Once Antifa is designated as an FTO, any content expressing support for anti-fascist principles, sharing protest logistics, or providing resources for activists could become prohibited terrorist content subject to immediate removal. Users posting such content could also face permanent account suspension.

The technological infrastructure already exists for comprehensive content monitoring. Social media companies have developed sophisticated algorithmic systems to identify terrorist content, with Twitter reporting suspension of over 1.5 million accounts for terrorism-related violations between 2015 and 2020, 90 percent identified through automated systems rather than user reports.

The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) – comprised of YouTube, Twitter/X, Facebook, and Microsoft, and other platforms – maintains shared databases of “digital fingerprints” from known terrorist content. Anti-fascist organizing materials, protest footage, and political commentary could be added to these databases, creating automated, cross-platform content removal and user identification systems.

These changes could extend beyond direct content removal to comprehensive user profiling. The same machine learning systems currently used for content recommendation could begin identifying users based on engagement with anti-fascist content, creating detailed profiles for potential government intelligence gathering. This transformation would convert social media platforms from potential sources of opposition to government overreach into comprehensive surveillance and enforcement networks.

Organizational Vulnerabilities: A Hypothetical Case Study

The abstract legal framework above becomes more concrete when applied to real-world organizational structures. Consider how an FTO designation could impact the “Alliance for Democratic Resistance” (ADR), a fictional but realistic progressive non-governmental organization (NGO), as well as other civil society organizations. ADR operates from a headquarters in Washington, D.C., with regional offices in Portland, Chicago, Atlanta, and Austin. The organization maintains partnerships with civil rights groups in Germany, the U.K., and France, and receives grants from European foundations supporting anti-fascist education programs.

ADR’s activities include organizing counter-protests against white supremacist demonstrations, providing know-your-rights training for protesters, maintaining a legal defense fund for arrested activists, publishing research on far-right movements, and hosting international conferences on combating extremism. These activities, while entirely legal under current law, could become potentially criminal once Antifa is designated as an FTO.

The organization’s international partnerships could be recharacterized as coordination with foreign terrorist entities. Its legal defense fund might constitute material support for domestic terrorists. Research publications could be classified as terrorist propaganda. Training programs might be deemed terrorist instruction.

Within ten business days of designation, OFAC would require ADR’s banks to freeze all accounts and report holdings to the Treasury Department. Staff members would face FBI investigation for potential material support violations. Donors — from major foundations to individual contributors — could become targets for financial crimes prosecution. International partners would be barred from entering the United States.

Beyond criminal charges and asset freezes, ADR could conceivably face civil suits from anyone injured during a protest or counterdemonstration where Antifa was present. A business owner whose property was damaged, a counter-protester who was injured, or even a police officer hurt during a demonstration could sue ADR for treble damages under the ATA, arguing the organization aided and abetted Antifa’s activities by providing meeting space, legal support, or protest coordination. The treble damages provision means a $100,000 injury claim could result in a $300,000 judgment, plus potentially millions in legal fees.

The organization would face immediate operational collapse regardless of whether criminal charges are ultimately filed. Legal defense costs alone could reach millions of dollars. Donors would flee to avoid association with designated “terrorists.” Foundation grants would be suspended pending investigation. Staff would resign to protect themselves from legal jeopardy. Office leases would be terminated, insurance policies cancelled, and nonprofit tax status revoked.

This scenario reflects how FTO designations can destroy organizations through the process itself, independent of successful criminal prosecutions. The mere initiation of terrorism-related investigations creates financial and reputational damage from which most organizations cannot recover.

Cascading Effects Across Civil Society

The destruction of directly targeted organizations represents only the beginning of a possible broader social transformation. The impact could cascade far beyond directly targeted entities, creating a comprehensive chilling effect across the entire progressive political ecosystem. Every progressive nonprofit, civil rights group, and political organization would face immediate compliance assessments. Legal counsel would advise clients to avoid any activities potentially construed as supporting anti-fascist principles. Foundation boards could vote to suspend grants to organizations with possible connections to counter-protest activities.

Academic institutions would face particularly complex challenges. Universities might cancel conferences on combating fascism, restrict faculty research on anti-fascist movements, and suspend student organizations engaged in counter-protest activities. The chilling effect on academic freedom would be profound, as scholars avoid research topics that might create legal jeopardy.

Media organizations may similarly self-censor. Publishers might refuse books on anti-fascist history or strategy. Journalists could avoid reporting on anti-fascist activities to prevent potential material support liability. Documentary filmmakers might cancel projects examining anti-fascist movements.

Religious and community organizations engaged in social justice work would face difficult choices about continuing programs that could be interpreted as supporting a designated terrorist organization’s ideology. Labor unions might prohibit solidarity activities with anti-fascist activists. Nonprofit legal organizations could suspend representation of activists facing charges.

This phenomenon, known to scholars as “anticipatory conformity,” demonstrates how the mere existence of broad criminal penalties can achieve censorship objectives without formal enforcement. Organizations and individuals modify behavior to avoid potential prosecution, effectively accomplishing the government’s regulatory goals through self-censorship. The cumulative effect would be the systematic elimination of civil society infrastructure supporting resistance to far-right political movements.

International Coordination and Enforcement

These domestic effects would be amplified by international coordination that extends the reach of American FTO authorities globally. The European response to Trump’s domestic Antifa designation in September reveals the international dimension of this campaign. Far-right parties across Europe have demanded similar designations in their own countries. The Dutch parliament passed a resolution calling for a terrorist designation. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced parallel measures. A draft resolution reportedly backed by 79 Members of the European Parliament from 20 countries calls for EU-wide designation.

This international far-right strategic coordination – simultaneously targeting “Antifa,” an amorphous movement with no clear organizational hierarchy, across multiple democracies – serves a common purpose: eliminating organized resistance to far-right governance by recharacterizing political opposition as terrorism.

An American FTO designation could provide legal foundation for far-right European prosecutions of American activists traveling abroad. Under existing mutual legal assistance treaties, European authorities could request extradition of Americans for “terrorism-related” activities that constitute protected political speech in the United States. International asset freezing orders could create global enforcement networks targeting democratic opposition.

The Hungarian approach illustrates these possibilities. The government of Viktor Orbán has used its Antifa classification to pursue terrorism charges against Italian MEP Ilaria Salis for allegedly participating in counter-demonstrations against far-right groups. This demonstrates how terrorist designations can transform routine political disagreement into criminal conspiracy, creating a template that could be applied to American activists abroad.

The integration of domestic and international enforcement could create a comprehensive global system for monitoring and prosecuting political opposition, transcending national boundaries and constitutional protections that have traditionally limited government surveillance authority.

The Self-Defeating Logic of Counterterrorism Overreach

The profound irony of designating Antifa as an FTO is that weaponizing counterterrorism authorities against domestic political movements will inevitably undermine those very tools when deployed against genuine international terrorist threats. The FTO framework and material support statutes have proven remarkably effective in disrupting al-Qaeda and ISIS networks precisely because courts have afforded them substantial deference based on their narrow application to FTOs that pose legitimate national security threats.

Once these authorities are stretched to encompass domestic political opposition — applied to Americans engaged in constitutionally protected speech and association — that judicial deference should evaporate. Federal courts confronting cases where naturalized citizens face denaturalization for attending protests, or where nonprofits are prosecuted for providing legal defense funds, will likely be compelled to impose constitutional limitations that have been unnecessary when the targets were genuinely foreign terrorist networks. The inevitable wave of successful constitutional challenges will probably force courts to narrow material support definitions, impose heightened intent requirements, and establish First Amendment protections, as well as other safeguards, that will then apply equally to prosecutions of actual terrorism support.

Congressional appetite for FISA reauthorization — already strained by documented FBI abuses in querying Section 702 data on protesters, political donors, and even members of Congress — will surely further erode when those authorities are systematically deployed against political opposition rather than foreign intelligence targets. The House Judiciary Committee has already advanced legislation to substantially curtail FISA authorities in response to civil liberties concerns, and adding domestic political targeting to this record could make reauthorization politically untenable.

The result of pursuing the chimera of “Antifa terrorism” could lead to the systematic dismantling of the legal infrastructure that has successfully prevented another September 11th-scale attack, opening genuine vulnerabilities to al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other international terrorist organizations that pose real threats to American security. By misappropriating tools designed to protect Americans from foreign terrorism to instead target Americans for their political beliefs, the administration risks achieving the ultimate counterterrorism failure: strengthening the nation’s real enemies while weakening the legal framework designed to combat them.

Strategic Response Options for Civil Society

Despite these formidable challenges, civil society organizations and democratic institutions retain several avenues for strategically responding. Understanding these options becomes crucial as the threat of FTO expansion moves from theoretical to imminent. Congressional oversight represents a potential avenue for institutional resistance, though one unlikely to bear immediate fruit given current political alignments. While the House and Senate Judiciary Committees technically possess authority over terrorism designations and could demand detailed justifications for applying FTO frameworks to domestic political movements, prominent members of Congress have become some of the loudest advocates for FTO designation.

Congressional appropriators theoretically could restrict funding for enforcement activities targeting constitutionally protected political speech, but such efforts would face steep political headwinds. The more realistic congressional strategy focuses on building a factual record through minority oversight efforts — hearings, letters, and reports documenting constitutional concerns — that could support future legal challenges and lay the groundwork for legislative reform should political conditions change after subsequent election cycles. In the immediate term, however, civil society must look beyond Congress to other institutional mechanisms for resistance.

State and local governments also retain significant authority to resist federal overreach. State attorneys general possess independent prosecutorial discretion and could refuse cooperation with federal investigations targeting protected political activity. Several states are considering legislation limiting cooperation with federal political surveillance operations, similar to existing immigration sanctuary policies.

Legal challenges could focus on multiple constitutional vulnerabilities. First Amendment protections for political association create barriers to criminalizing ideological movements. Due Process violations in the secretive designation process could provide grounds for challenge. Equal Protection concerns about selective targeting of left-wing movements while ignoring comparable right-wing threats might support discrimination claims or claims of arbitrary and capricious government conduct.

Out of an abundance of caution at least, organizations should establish robust compliance monitoring and due diligence frameworks to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape. This includes implementing comprehensive legal review processes for activities, partnerships, and funding sources that could face heightened scrutiny under expanded terrorism authorities. Legal counsel should regularly assess organizational exposure under material support statutes and maintain current knowledge of designation criteria and enforcement trends. Organizations should establish systematic tracking of relevant legislative and regulatory developments, including congressional hearings, agency guidance, and judicial decisions that could affect operational parameters. Financial compliance protocols should include enhanced due diligence on funding sources, grant recipients, and international partnerships to ensure alignment with applicable sanctions regulations. Regular legal audits of programs, communications, and institutional relationships can help identify potential vulnerabilities before they become predicates or excuses for enforcement issues. Organizations should also establish clear documentation protocols for activities, decision-making processes, and compliance efforts to demonstrate good faith efforts to operate within legal boundaries.

Professional associations — bar organizations, academic societies, and press freedom groups — must take public stands against FTO expansion into the domestic political space. The American Bar Association, representing over 400,000 lawyers, could provide crucial legitimacy to constitutional and other legal challenges while offering resources for targeted individuals and organizations.

Strategic communications efforts must educate the public about the implications of applying foreign terrorism authorities to domestic political movements, though public opinion on constitutional rights presents a complicated picture. Recent polling shows 53 percent of Americans believe the First Amendment “goes too far in the rights it guarantees,” while 47 percent support “a strong leader that breaks the rules.” These attitudes create favorable conditions for executive overreach, making strategic communications critical to connect abstract FTO designation to concrete consequences such as: targeting nonprofit donors, criminalizing protest participation, censoring social media, and enabling deportation of naturalized citizens for political activities. These tangible consequences may resonate more powerfully than appeals to constitutional principles, particularly when framed around personal vulnerabilities that terrorism authorities would create for millions of Americans across the political spectrum.

Constitutional Crisis and Democratic Resilience

These response strategies operate within a broader context of a constitutional crisis that transcends any single policy or legal framework. The potential designation of Antifa as an FTO represents a fundamental test of American constitutional democracy’s resilience. To be clear: The U.S. government already has the legal tools necessary to investigate domestic criminal activity by Antifa adherents. The FTO framework was designed to combat genuine foreign terrorist threats to American security. Applying these powerful authorities to domestic political movements would represent an unprecedented expansion that threatens core constitutional principles.

The implications extend well beyond anti-fascist activists to any domestic political movement maintaining international connections. Environmental groups coordinating with European counterparts, labor unions participating in international solidarity campaigns, and human rights organizations working with foreign partners could all theoretically face similar targeting under expanded FTO authorities.

As White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has articulated, the administration views opposition to its policies through a conspiratorial lens. He has characterized the Democratic Party as “a domestic extremist organization” and claimed the existence of “a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country.” This stated worldview creates conditions where routine political opposition could be reframed as terrorism worthy of the full spectrum of counterterrorism responses.

The systematic weakening of oversight mechanisms — from inspector general dismissals to civil rights office closures — has created ideal conditions for expanding terrorism authorities into the domestic political space. Without effective institutional constraints, the powerful authorities designed to combat foreign terrorism could be redirected against American citizens engaging in constitutionally protected political activity.

The designation would mark a dark turn in American democratic development. Once the precedent is established that domestic political movements can be criminalized through foreign terrorism designations, constraining these authorities becomes exponentially more difficult. The secrecy surrounding counterterrorism operations, the broad scope of material support statutes, and the deference courts typically show to national security claims create conditions where such authorities tend to expand rather than contract.

The current moment requires extraordinary vigilance from American civil society. The FTO system represents one of the most powerful tools in the federal government’s legal arsenal, deliberately designed to dismantle targeted organizations quickly and comprehensively. While these authorities have served important national security purposes when applied to genuine foreign terrorist threats, their application to domestic political movements would fundamentally alter the balance between security and liberty that defines American constitutional democracy.

The only reliable safeguard against such expansion is sustained lawful opposition from informed citizens, civil society organizations, and constitutional institutions committed to preserving the framework that makes democratic opposition possible. The stakes have never been higher, and the time for preventive action is rapidly diminishing.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239999886.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 09:56:40.250713

The ECHR forms part of UK law but is interpreted by a European court

Unlike other human rights treaties, the ECHR has a court to rule on whether governments are compliant. The UK agreed to let people take cases to the European Court of Human Rights in the 1960s.

In addition, the Human Rights Act 1998 made the ECHR part of UK domestic law. People can appeal against government immigration decisions, such as a family visa refusal or deportation for criminal offending, before an immigration judge in the UK if there is a human rights angle.

The 1998 act also requires the UK courts to “take into account” the case law of the European Court. As a result, the precedents set by the court in Strasbourg affect UK immigration law even if the UK is not involved in the case.

Article 3 and Article 8 of the ECHR can be used to contest immigration decisions

Under the European Court’s “living instrument” doctrine, its interpretation of ECHR rights can change over time. In the 1980s, the court began to rule that migrants could invoke Article 8 and Article 3 of the ECHR.

Article 8 protects the right to family and private life. Article 8 does not give families a right to choose their country of residence, but it may require someone to be granted residence rights depending on the individual circumstances. These circumstances, such as the strength of the family’s ties in the country of residence and the obstacles to living together abroad, have to be balanced against the state’s interest in immigration enforcement to see whether removal is proportionate.

Article 3 prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. If someone would experience treatment reaching this threshold, as interpreted by the court, they cannot be removed under any circumstances.

Article 8 cases involve balancing the public interest with individual circumstances

ECHR rights are reflected in the UK’s immigration rules and appeals system. This means that people can be granted residence rights based on ECHR considerations where they would not otherwise qualify (for example, if they had been living here without authorisation).

The immigration rules on Article 8 family life include allowing people to stay if there would be insurmountable obstacles to a couple living together outside the UK or if there would be unjustifiably harsh consequences for the family. Separate rules on Article 8 private life cover scenarios where people have been living in the UK without authorisation as children or for many years.

People whose Article 8 claim is denied by the Home Office can appeal to the immigration tribunal in the UK. The judge will weigh up the public interest in immigration control against the person’s family or private life, taking a wide range of factors into account, to decide whether removal is proportionate. This is known as the “balancing exercise” or “balance sheet” approach.

In cases where the person has committed a criminal offence, legislation passed in 2014 has raised the bar for an appeal to succeed, although British judges still retain some discretion to block deportation in compelling cases.

From 2015 to 2024, around 61,000 ECHR appeals were successful in the first-tier immigration tribunal. Recent media coverage has highlighted appeals by criminals specifically, although successful challenges based solely on the ECHR represent around 3% of completed deportations for criminal offending.

The Labour government wants to reinforce previous attempts to limit ECHR rights

Under Theresa May, the Home Secretary from 2010 to 2016, the government changed the immigration rules and passed primary legislation aiming at limiting discretion in Article 8 cases. The courts have sought to demonstrate respect for this aim while upholding their role in adjudicating on what constitutes a breach of ECHR rights in individual cases.

Since taking office, the Prime Minister and several Cabinet ministers have said that they believe too many ECHR cases are successful despite not being truly exceptional. An internal government review is underway and an immigration white paper has promised legislation on Article 8.

The Conservative and Reform parties say they would leave the ECHR.",https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/content/uploads/2020/08/institutions-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 09:56:43.969172

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Egypt sent a team of experts to Gaza this weekend to help locate the bodies of deceased Israeli hostages, according to a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. The spokesperson added that Netanyahu had approved a purely “technical team” and that its members were not connected to the Egyptian army. Egyptian state media reported that logistical support and earth-moving equipment had been sent to Gaza. Senior Hamas Official Khalil al-Hayya said on Sunday that Hamas has started searching in new areas of Gaza for the remaining 13 hostages. Isabel Kershner reports for the New York Times; Samy Magdy and Melanie Lidman report for AP News.

The U.S. military is operating surveillance drones over the Gaza Strip to ensure that both Israel and Hamas adhere to the ceasefire agreement, Israeli and American officials said on Friday. The sources added that the surveillance missions are operating to support the new Civil-Military Coordination Centre in southern Israel. Natan Odenheimer and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

“We have […] made it clear regarding international forces that Israel will determine which forces are acceptable to us,” Netanyahu said yesterday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday that the international force would be made up of “countries that Israel’s comfortable with.” Steven Scheer reports for Reuters.

Israel’s military said on Saturday that Israeli forces carried out a “targeted strike” on a member of Islamic Jihad in central Gaza, who was allegedly planning an attack on Israeli troops. Islamic Jihad said in a statement that the Israeli military’s claim of a planned attack was a “mere fallacious allegation.” Local medics said that four people were wounded in a drone strike, but there were no immediate reports of deaths. Witnesses separately reported that Israeli tanks had shelled eastern areas of Gaza City. The Israeli military did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters reports.

An Israeli drone attack today has killed at least one person in Abasan al-Kabira, near Khan Younis in Gaza, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. Al Jazeera reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE

UNRWA said yesterday that Israel continues to block its international staff and humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. Around 12,000 of its local staff are pushing ahead with providing “health-care, psychosocial support, and education to the people,” UNRWA added in a post on social media. Tim Hume and Stephen Quillen report for Al Jazeera.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russian drones killed three people and injured 31 others, including six children, in an air attack on Kyiv on Saturday night. A separate drone attack on Friday night killed two people and injured 13 others, also in Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Moscow had used nearly 1,200 attack drones, more than 1,360 guided aerial bombs, and over 50 missiles against Ukraine in the last seven days. Lidia Kelly and Pavel Polityuk report for Reuters; Anastasiia Malenko reports for Reuters.

Russia successfully tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, a weapon that Moscow says is capable of piercing any defence shield, Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday. Russia’s Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov, told Putin that the missile travelled 14,000 km and was in the air for around 15 hours. Guy Faulconbridge and Lidia Kelly report for Reuters

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Argentinian President Javier Milei’s Freedom Advances party secured nearly 41% of the national vote in Argentina’s legislative elections yesterday, nearly doubling its representation in Congress. Trump congratulated Milei on his “landslide victory” on social media, later adding “BIG WIN […] for Javier Milei, a wonderful Trump Endorsed Candidate!” Ali Walker reports for POLITICO.

Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas announced yesterday that Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh would temporarily assume the leadership of the Palestinian Authority if Abbas were to step down or die. Sheikh would hold those powers for 90 days before elections would take place to pick a new leader. Aaron Boxerman and Adam Rasgon report for the New York Times.

Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) announced yesterday that it is withdrawing its fighters from Turkey to northern Iraq “to avoid clashes or provocations.” The PKK had announced earlier this year that it would disband and renounce armed conflict in Turkey, ending four decades of fighting. Stella Martany and Cinar Kiper AP News.

The Pakistani military said yesterday that 5 Pakistani soldiers and 25 fighters from Afghanistan died in clashes near the border. Officials from both countries arrived in Istanbul on Saturday for talks aimed at preventing a full-scale conflict. Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja said that failure to reach an agreement in Istanbul would mean “open war.” Ariba Shahid reports for Reuters.

Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary yesterday claimed that it had captured the Sudanese army’s headquarters in El-Fasher. Two videos shared by the RSF show its soldiers cheering outside the army base; Reuters was not able to verify the date of this video. The army has yet to give a statement on its current position. Khalid Abdelaziz and Nafisa Eltahir report.

Israeli strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon yesterday killed three people, the Lebanese Ministry of Health said. The Israeli military said it had targeted Hezbollah members, adding that it had killed Ali Hussein al-Mousawi, who “played a significant role in the re-establishment and strengthening of Hezbollah.” Hezbollah has not confirmed any information about the deaths. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon said that an Israeli drone had dropped a grenade close to one of its patrols on Sunday afternoon. Al Jazeera reports.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Sixty-five nations this weekend signed the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime in Hanoi. The treaty establishes the first universal framework for investigating and prosecuting offences committed online and facilitates the sharing of electronic evidence across borders. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “It is a vow that no country, no matter their level of deployment, will be left defenceless against cybercrime.” Vibhu Mishra reports for UN News.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Trump administration is planning to reorganize ICE by replacing several senior leaders in field offices across the country, according to sources. The sources said that the proposals stem from frustration in the Homeland Security Department and the White House that Trump’s goal of deporting over 1 million people in his first year in office is not being met. Hamed Aleaziz and Tyler Pager report for the New York Times.

The Department for Homeland Security said on Friday that it plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Gracia to the “thriving democracy” of Liberia within a week, according to a court filing. The Justice Department has previously attempted to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, but none of these countries agreed to take him. Julianna Bragg reports for Axios.

Immigration authorities yesterday detained British commentator Sami Hamdi and revoked his visa, a Homeland Security Department official said. Hamdi spoke at a gala for the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) in California on Saturday and was due to speak in Florida on Sunday but he was detained at San Francisco International Airport. Conservative activist Laura Loomer took credit for Hamdi’s arrest on social media. Stephen Coates reports for Reuters.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

A U.S. military strike against an alleged drug vessel on Friday killed six people in the Caribbean Sea, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on social media. Hegseth said it was the first strike carried out at night and claimed that the vessel was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart report for Reuters.

Hegseth has ordered the deployment of the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, along with its accompanying warships and attack planes, to the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, the Pentagon said on Friday. The enhanced U.S. military presence “will bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,” a Pentagon spokesperson said. It is unclear when Ford will be moving to the region or where exactly it will be positioned. Charlie Savage and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

USS Graveley, a U.S. guided missile destroyer, yesterday docked in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago’s capital. U.S. officials and officials from Trinidad and Tobago said the warship will remain in Trinidad until Thursday so that both countries can carry out training exercises. Venezuela said the “dangerous conduct of military exercises” in the waters of a neighboring country constitutes a “serious threat” to the Caribbean region, according to a statement from the Venezuelan foreign ministry. AP News

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Trump cosigned a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia yesterday on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. The first phase of the agreement involves Thailand’s release of 18 Cambodian soldiers and the removal of heavy weapons and landmines from the border region. Malaysian troops are being deployed to ensure the fighting does not restart. Erin Hale and Tim Hume report for Al Jazeera.

A Navy helicopter and a fighter jet based on the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier yesterday crashed into the South China Sea within 30 minutes of each other, the U.S. Pacific Fleet said in a statement. The causes of the two crashes are under investigation. Trump said today that the incidents could have been caused by “bad fuel,” ruling out foul play. Konstantin Toropin reports for AP News.

U.S. intelligence, obtained in 2022, shows that the United Arab Emirates gave technology to China to upgrade its long-range missiles fired from fighter jets, according to six sources. Two sources said that the technology was passed to Huawei by G42, the UAE’s AI group. G42 disputed the U.S. intelligence, saying it categorically rejected the “false and defamatory allegations.” Demetri Sevastopulo reports for the Financial Times.

Chinese and U.S. negotiators said yesterday that they had agreed to a framework deal on tariffs and other issues ahead of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s meeting this week. The issues discussed include bilateral trade, export controls, reciprocal tariff extensions, fentanyl-related tariffs, and cooperation on combating fentanyl trafficking, according to the Chinese negotiators. Jamieson Greer, the U.S. representative, said, “We talked about extending the truce, we talked about rare earths, of course, we talked about all kinds of topics.” Keith Bradsher and Zunaira Saieed report for the New York Times.

Trump announced on Saturday that he would increase tariffs on Canadian goods by 10% following the Canadian television ad that used clips from an address by Ronald Reagan. Matina Stevis Gridneff reports for the New York Times.

The Treasury Department announced on Friday that it was sanctioning Colombian President Gustavo Petro because he provided “benefits” to “narco-terrorist organizations” since taking office in 2022. The department has also sanctioned Petro’s wife, his son, and Colombia’s interior minister. Julie Turkewitz reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

New York Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty on Friday morning to felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James’s trial is set to go ahead in late January 2026. Devan Cole, Lauren del Valle, and Kara Scannell report for CNN.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

A Pentagon spokesperson said on Friday that the Defense Department had accepted an anonymous gift of $130 million from a wealthy donor to pay military salaries during the government shutdown. Two sources named Timothy Mellon, a billionaire and major financial backer of Trump, as the anonymous donor. Mellon has not confirmed this. White House officials said that covering the cost of military pay for the first half of October totalled about $6.5 billion. Leo Shane III, Paul McLeary, and Jack Detsch report for POLITICO; Tyler Page reports for the New York Times.

The Justice Department said on Friday that it will monitor polling sites in California and New Jersey ahead of the November 4 election “to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.” Shawn Hubler and Laurel Rosenhall report for the New York Times.

The Trump administration will not use emergency funds to cover the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Food Assistance Program during the government shutdown, according to a memo obtained by POLITICO. SNAP is set to run out of federal funds at the end of the month, which would leave around 42 million people without the necessary food benefits from November. Administration officials believe that Democratic governors and anti-hunger groups will sue the administration for not tapping into the contingency fund for SNAP, two sources said. Grace Yarrow and Meredith Lee Hill report.

Trump last week nominated Hegseth’s senior military aide Lt. Gen. Chrisopher LaNeve to replace Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. James Mingus. The Senate still needs to approve LaNeve. Hegseth did not announce LaNeve’s nomination, nor did Mingus announce his departure, even though he is less than halfway through a four-year role. “Hegseth wants [LaNeve] in,” a defense official said. “Who he replaces doesn’t matter.” Paul McLeary reports for POLITICO.

He argued that the Trump administration’s actions bring to mind the way China and Iran’s repressive governments have previously executed drug smugglers.
“They summarily execute people without presenting evidence to the public,” Paul contended in his conversation with Bream.
The Kentucky libertarian joined Democratic US senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Adam Schiff of California in introducing a war powers resolution that would have blocked the Trump administration’s use of military strikes within or against Venezuela.
They’re going to be – like – dead.” Paul has had military-related disagreements with Trump before his Sunday interview on Fox.","The Trump administration’s military airstrikes against boats off Venezuela’s coast that the White House claims were being used for drug trafficking are “extrajudicial killings”, said Rand Paul, the president’s fellow Republican and US senator from Kentucky.

Paul’s strong comments on the topic came on Sunday during an interview on Republican-friendly Fox News, three days after Donald Trump publicly claimed he “can’t imagine” federal lawmakers would have “any problem” with the strikes when asked about seeking congressional approval for them.

US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.

Speaking with Fox News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream, Paul asserted that Congress has “gotten no information” on the campaign of strikes from Trump’s administration – despite the president claiming the White House would be open to briefing the federal lawmakers about the offensive.

“No one said their name, no one said what evidence, no one said whether they’re armed, and we’ve had no evidence presented,” Paul said of the targeted boats or those on board. He argued that the Trump administration’s actions bring to mind the way China and Iran’s repressive governments have previously executed drug smugglers.

“They summarily execute people without presenting evidence to the public,” Paul contended in his conversation with Bream. “So it’s wrong.”

Paul’s comments separate him from other Republican members of Congress who have spoken in favor of the Trump administration’s offensive near Venezuela, including US House representative Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, as reported by the US news website Semafor.

The Kentucky libertarian joined Democratic US senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Adam Schiff of California in introducing a war powers resolution that would have blocked the Trump administration’s use of military strikes within or against Venezuela. But the measure failed to win a majority in the Senate.

Trump on Friday told the media that his administration would be willing to brief lawmakers on the strikes but simply saw no reason to seek congressional authorization for them.

“I think we’re just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” Trump said. “We’re going to kill them. They’re going to be – like – dead.”

Josué Castro Rivera was on his way to his gardening job Thursday when ICE officers pulled over his vehicle and tried to detain him and three other passengers, according to his brother, Henry Castro.

Castro Rivera bolted on foot from the scene and attempted to cross Interstate 264 in Norfolk — where a 2002 Ford pickup fatally struck him, according to state and federal authorities.

He was pronounced dead on the scene around 11 a.m., according to the Virginia State Police.

“He had a very good heart,” his devastated brother said Sunday.

Castro Rivera had been living in the US for four years and was sending money back to Honduras for his family, Henry said.

ICE officers had been carrying out a “targeted, intelligence-based” operation, and that the passengers were detained for allegedly living in the country without legal permission, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.

Castro Rivera “resisted heavily and fled” and died after a passing vehicle hit him, the DHS said.

“He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him,” his heartbroken brother said.

Castro Rivera’s family plans to raise money to send his body back to Honduras for a funeral, blasting his death as an “injustice.”

The DHS said the garden-worker’s death was “a direct result of every politician, activist, and reporter who continues to spread propaganda and misinformation about ICE’s mission and ways to avoid detention.”

Similar deaths during immigration operations have triggered outrage and calls for additional investigations.

Last month in a Chicago suburb, federal immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican man during a traffic stop.

The DHS initially said a federal officer was “seriously injured,” but police body camera video showed the federal officer walking around and describing his own injuries as “nothing major.”

In July, a farmworker died after falling from a 30-foot-high roof during a chaotic immigration raid at a southern California marijuana farm.

In August, a man ran away from federal agents onto a freeway in the same state and was fatally struck by a vehicle.

Immigration detention is supposed to be administrative, not punitive.","TORONTO, Oct. 27, 2025 /CNW/ - In a major procedural victory, the Ontario Court of Appeal has unanimously upheld the certification of a national human rights class action challenging Canada's practice of placing immigration detainees in provincial jails.

The matter is directed to proceed to trial as a Class Action.

In Richard v. Canada (Attorney General), more than 8,300 non-citizens detained in provincial and territorial prisons between 2016 and 2024 will pursue claims that the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) violated their Charter rights and acted with systemic negligence. These immigration detainees were held in 87 provincial jails under agreements between CBSA and provincial governments. Many were asylum seekers or permanent residents.

The class members were detained in jails for purely administrative reasons. None of the members of the certified class were detained for criminal charges.

All provinces have now ended their immigration detention agreements and arrangements with the CBSA.

The Court of Appeal confirmed that claims alleging systemic negligence and breaches of sections 7, 9, 12 and 15 of the Charter should proceed to trial. These claims concern fundamental rights concerning liberty, arbitrary detention, cruel treatment, and discrimination. The Courts have ruled that those claims raise common legal and factual issues for the class which are deserving of adjudication at trial.

Human-Rights Criticism

The Canadian Red Cross, the UN Human Rights Committee, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International have all criticized Canada for detaining non-citizens in jails alongside convicted offenders, subjecting them to strip searches, lockdowns, segregation, and restricted access to counsel and family.

Their findings describe these practices as inconsistent with international standards, which require immigration detention to be non-punitive, humane, and a measure of last resort.

The saga began when the Trump administration sent federal immigration agents into Los Angeles earlier this year to conduct large-scale raids and arrests.
He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.” At issue in each case, however, is Trump’s legal authority to federalize the National Guard and use it for domestic law enforcement.
On most days, each state’s National Guard is a state militia by default with the governor serving as commander-in-chief.
Armed with that deferential standard, the three-judge panel proceeded to green-light Trump’s deployment of the National Guard because of the facts on the ground.","Three states—California, Oregon, and Illinois—are currently suing the Trump administration over its National Guard deployments in separate lawsuits with mixed results. Last week, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delivered a major setback to California Governor Gavin Newsom by allowing Trump to continue to deploy the National Guard units while litigation continues.

There are significant legal questions at stake in these cases, namely when and how the president can deploy the National Guard on American soil, and what courts, states, and Congress can and have done to constrain him. In another sense, what’s really at the core of these cases is whether judges can see what’s happening right in front of them.

Newsom v. Trump is extraordinarily tangled at the moment because separate portions of the case are being considered simultaneously in different federal courts. Last week’s ruling by the Ninth Circuit dealt with the lower court’s decision to issue a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration over the summer. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll focus on that initial TRO and the court decisions that followed it.

The saga began when the Trump administration sent federal immigration agents into Los Angeles earlier this year to conduct large-scale raids and arrests. Those raids drew large numbers of protesters. In response, Trump federalized the California National Guard and ordered it to protect federal immigration agents as they carried out their raids and arrests. California Governor Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration to challenge the National Guard’s federalization and deployment.

In the lawsuit, Newsom argued that the deployment was unlawful, unconstitutional, and procedurally invalid. Judge Charles Breyer, who happens to be the younger brother of retired Justice Stephen Breyer, ruled in the governor’s favor and granted a temporary restraining order. His ruling was blunt about what had happened.

“At this early stage of the proceedings, the Court must determine whether the president followed the congressionally mandated procedure for his actions,” Breyer wrote. “He did not. His actions were illegal—both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.”

At issue in each case, however, is Trump’s legal authority to federalize the National Guard and use it for domestic law enforcement. The administration has pointed to language from a provision in federal law known as Section 12406, which comes from the Militia Act of 1903. On most days, each state’s National Guard is a state militia by default with the governor serving as commander-in-chief. The law in question, however, allows the president to “call [National Guard units] into federal service” under three circumstances.

One of those circumstances is if the United States is “invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation.” While the Trump administration has claimed that the “invasion” language in other laws and constitutional provisions can be triggered by the presence of undocumented immigrants, they did not rely on that argument here. Instead they pointed to the other two circumstances: if there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of [the federal government],” or if the president is “unable with the regular forces to execute [federal law].”

The administration argued that the latter two conditions were met in Los Angeles (and in the other two cities, for that matter) because protesters were obstructing federal efforts to carry out mass deportations. Before that point, however, it also argued that the federal courts had no jurisdiction over Trump’s actions, citing the 1827 case Martin v. Mott.

Martin involved President James Madison’s use of the New York militia during the War of 1812. Jacob Mott, a member of the militia, refused to comply and was court-martialed after the war ended. This was not uncommon as many Federalists in New England opposed the war. In a subsequent lawsuit, Mott claimed that his court-martial was invalid because he had not disobeyed lawful orders, effectively rejecting Madison’s authority to call up and direct the militia during the war.

The Supreme Court disagreed and ruled that Madison’s actions were lawful. Justice Joseph Story wrote in broad strokes. He concluded that Congress had lawfully delegated the discretion about activating the militia to the president, and that his decision as to whether or not an emergency existed to justify it was “conclusive upon all other persons.” Story gave broad latitude to the president in these circumstances. “Whenever a statute gives a discretionary power to any person, to be exercised by him upon his own opinion of certain facts, it is a sound rule of construction, that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts,” he wrote.

That sounds, at least on its face, like a pretty strong precedent for the administration to cite. Breyer was unconvinced. He noted that the court’s deference stemmed at least in part from its historic pattern of deferral to the president in matters of war and national security. The War of 1812 obviously counted as such; law-enforcement raids in Los Angeles plainly do not. In addition, Breyer noted, the Supreme Court had not embraced such a deferential approach to presidential decision-making in general in the two hundred years of rulings that followed Martin.

“Between the unique concerns raised by federal military intrusion into civilian affairs and the fact that federal officials are not uniquely positioned to ascertain what is happening on the ground (as compared to, say, state and local officials), the Court is not convinced that the judiciary cannot question presidential assertions about domestic activities leading to military action,” Breyer concluded.

The three-judge Ninth Circuit panel, which consisted of two Trump appointees and a Biden appointee, took a much different approach. It viewed the Martin ruling as broadly applicable to the present day. The panel noted that “some of the Martin Court’s reasoning addressed factual circumstances of that case that are not present here, particularly the Court’s consideration of the nature of a foreign invasion and concerns about militiamen disobeying orders.” Nonetheless, it concluded that “we must give a great level of deference to the President’s determination that a predicate condition exists” because of the ruling.

California asked the Ninth Circuit to review the panel’s decision in an en banc hearing, meaning that the entire appellate court would review it. (Since the Ninth Circuit is so large, it only uses a subset of eleven judges for en banc hearings.) The court declined to do so, keeping the lower court’s restraining order on ice for now. That drew a strenuous dissent from Judge Marsha Berzon and some of her colleagues, who castigated the panel’s decision.

Among Berzon’s critiques was the panel’s approach to Martin. “Martin cannot, and does not, change the meaning of a statute not in effect when Martin was decided and whose predecessor, the Militia Act of 1795, was distinct from and not considered in Martin,” she explained. “Read carefully, in fact, Martin did not address at all courts’ authority to review the President’s exercise of his delegated power to call forth the militia.” (Emphasis hers.) Armed with that deferential standard, the three-judge panel proceeded to green-light Trump’s deployment of the National Guard because of the facts on the ground.

This is a fraught exercise, to say the least, because Trump’s own arguments for the deployments often appear to be either exaggerated or even false. The president’s choice of targets also appears to hinge less on whether there is an actual emergency and more on whether he likes the city and its residents. Los Angeles and Chicago are disfavored and suffered accordingly; San Francisco, on the other hand, escaped Trump’s targeting for now because Silicon Valley billionaires called him this week and asked him not to intervene.

The panel found that events on the ground met that threshold. “There is evidence that the day before, protesters threw objects at ICE vehicles trying to complete a law enforcement operation, ‘pinned down’ several FPS officers defending federal property by throwing ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid, and other objects,’ and used ‘large rolling commercial dumpsters as a battering ram” in an attempt to breach the parking garage of a federal building,’” it noted when summarizing the evidence presented to it.

Breyer drew different conclusions. “While [federal officials] have pointed to several instances of violence, they have not identified a violent, armed, organized, open and avowed uprising against the government as a whole,” he wrote. “The definition of rebellion is unmet.” The judge pointed out that while some protesters threw bottles and rocks, they were not carrying firearms and did not follow some central or organized authority that sought to overthrow the civil power.

The episodes of violence also occurred during otherwise peaceful protests. “Courts have repeatedly reaffirmed that peaceful protest does not lose its protection merely because some isolated individuals act violently outside the protections of the First Amendment,” Breyer observed. He rejected the notion that the collective totality of protests became a “rebellion” on such broad grounds.

On the other Section 12406 condition, that the president is “unable to execute the laws,” Breyer also found insufficient support for that reason. The Trump administration claimed it could have apprehended more people but for the protests. That was not enough, the judge concluded. “Nor does the statute allow for the federalizing of the National Guard when the president faces some risk in executing the laws, though of course federal employees should never have to fear danger when performing their jobs,” Breyer wrote. “The statute requires that the president be ‘unable’ to execute the laws of the United States. That did not happen here.”

The panel took a far more deferential view of the matter, however, and blocked Breyer’s temporary restraining order solely on the third condition—the “unable to execute the laws” one—by concluding that one was sufficient. That decision drew more criticism from Barzon when the Ninth Circuit denied en banc review. She noted that the third condition had only been invoked once before in its century-long existence under far more urgent circumstances.

“Although Section 12406(3) has been in existence for over 100 years, the only other time it has been invoked was when President Nixon federalized the National Guard to sort and deliver mail following a strike by over a quarter of all national postal workers, an event that “threatened to bring the nation to a standstill,” she noted. In an era before emails and the internet, this would have been devastating for the national economy—and crippling for the federal government’s basic operations.

Berzon was careful to note that while historical practice was not the actual boundary of the Section 12406 power, it could be highly indicative of its scope. “The 1970 invocation confirms that the text means precisely what it says: for the President to call forth the National Guard, he must actually and significantly lack the capacity to carry out certain laws through ordinary means,” she explained.

What truly separated the opinions of Breyer and Berzon from the panel’s opinion was not just different standards of review or jurisdictional questions, but a deeper sense of this country’s history and principles. These cases are not merely about whether the president happened to comply with a few pre-conditions in a particular federal law; they are about bedrock principles in the Anglo-American legal tradition.

“The rejection of military involvement in civil law enforcement except upon the most exigent circumstances traces to the events immediately preceding the American Revolution,” she wrote. “At that time, the British government used troops to enforce laws that American colonists widely considered oppressive and so inspired deep and enduring antagonism towards military involvement in domestic law enforcement.” These events led the Framers to put strict limits on when and how the military could be used on American soil for domestic purposes.

Newsom v. Trump is unlikely to be the vehicle by which these disputes reach the Supreme Court. That fate will likely fall to the Illinois litigation since the federal district-court judge and the Seventh Circuit all sided with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, which simplified matters. But the different approaches between the various judges in the California case are likely to be more illustrative of how the Supreme Court handles the matter. At its core, this is a case about determining whether the president is acting in good faith when wielding immense power. The justices’ track record on that front is not reassuring.",https://images.newrepublic.com/dc6712d7d281750de6b36cf1888296f657684e42.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-10-27 06:57:25.414425

But Canal Street’s western portion is a civic disgrace.
Developers began buying up small Canal Street properties a few years ago with plans to tear them down and put up modern new buildings.
As a result, little redevelopment has come to the street’s western fringe since 2017.
Canal Street’s cacophonous western portion has long seemed more of a rough outskirt than a handsome boulevard the border between Soho and Tribeca deserves.","The Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on Canal Street was not a pretty sight.

If President Trump wants to ensure Zohran Mamdani’s election so he can “take over” the city, as he’s warned, he couldn’t come up with a spectacle more certain to drive liberal New Yorkers into Mamdani’s camp than a squad of masked ICE agents, accompanied by an armored vehicle, descending on unlicensed street vendors in broad daylight to bust a whopping dozen or so for peddling counterfeit goods.

But unlike agitators who screamed “Fascist!” at the agents, our emotions should be nuanced. With City Hall unable or unwilling to protect legitimate Canal Street businesses and the public from the scourge of unlicensed sidewalk merchants, somebody had to do the job or at least begin to — even if the optics were terrible and the results minuscule.

I celebrate and honor the Big Apple’s diversity and singularly colorful street life. But Canal Street’s western portion is a civic disgrace. The cheap wooden animals, “I ❤️ New York” caps and bogus Gucci and Cartier products — and the guys who sell them — have Canal in a stranglehold. The abandonment to sidewalk anarchy stalled a nascent revival that was on the point of making the run-down boulevard worthy of its potentially iconic crosstown location.

Imagine how much worse it would be if misdemeanor-friendly Mamdani gave the hustlers even more free rein than they already enjoy!

Developers began buying up small Canal Street properties a few years ago with plans to tear them down and put up modern new buildings. One owner told me in 2017, “Canal is in significant flux.” But that was before “bail reform,” “Raise the Age” and legions of leftist judges and elected officials made prosecution of most crimes short of murder ineffectual.

As a result, little redevelopment has come to the street’s western fringe since 2017. Reason No. 1: The lawless sidewalk scene scared off potential retail tenants needed to anchor new buildings.

“I buy and sell and lease on Canal, so you can’t use my name. It was already the worst and noisiest traffic bottleneck in Manhattan. But the vendors are the worst deal-breakers,” one real-estate executive told me after the ICE raid. “I don’t like the way ICE did it, I’m the farthest thing from a Trumper, but somebody had to get a handle on this thing.”

The day after the raid, with the hustlers (at least for now) chased out, I was able to truly see — and appreciate — the street for the first time I could remember. Canal Street’s cacophonous western portion has long seemed more of a rough outskirt than a handsome boulevard the border between Soho and Tribeca deserves. Recent incremental changes made it a somewhat softer and gentler outskirt. The familiar engines of urban regeneration — lower rents than in neighboring districts, easy transit accessibility and enough surviving old-school grit to qualify as “edgy” — drew small boutiques, art galleries and even a hotel or two.

The blocks along the Holland Tunnel approach now have enough interesting shops and galleries to seem cutting-edge, the way Alphabet City did before gentrification. A stroller west of Canal’s bustling Chinatown portion will find the “largest Banksy museum in the world,” a former bank turned into a haunted house, Nordic Knots handmade rugs, the members-only “Social Wellness Club” and a Brooklyn Circus menswear shop. They uneasily share the sidewalks with mysterious shopping arcades and retailers of hardware, lighting fixtures, plastics and a thriving foam-rubber shop with a “Now hiring” sign.

But as the funky brick-and-mortar improved inch by inch, the unchecked proliferation of menacing vendors made much of the street a creepshow, especially at night.

Hustlers so dominate Broadway and Canal’s south corner that my wife and I, having alighted from the subway, took a cab to a restaurant just three blocks away to avoid a gauntlet of aggressive, marijuana-puffing vendors backed by a soundtrack of boom-box rap music. The scene wasn’t merely ugly — it was scary.

It’s not only my impression. NY1 reported last month that 800 local business owners signed a petition demanding more NYPD enforcement on and around Canal Street, citing open drug dealing, unreported muggings and robberies and sidewalk defecation. The NYPD responded that it’s conducting “targeted operations” to stem the sleaze, but before ICE stormed in, there was little if any visible improvement.

Of course, shoddy goods fill sidewalks all over Midtown. Hustlers even took over the Brooklyn Bridge’s narrow pedestrian walkways until a New York Post exposé shamed Mayor Adams’ team into getting rid of them (although they’ve begun crawling back).",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/newspress-collage-j9xi1ipkb-1761500729558.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1761486389&w=1200,N,,2025-10-27 07:16:47.242582

""Abducting a prominent British Muslim journalist and political commentator on a speaking tour in the United States because he dared to criticize the Israeli government's genocide is a blatant affront to free speech,"" said the Washington, DC-based Council on American-Islamic Relations in a statement. Hamdi was in California to speak at CAIR's annual gala on Saturday. On Sunday, he was heading to Florida to speak at another of the group's events.

US Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed on social media Sunday that ""thanks to the work of"" DHS chief Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ""and the men and women of law enforcement,"" Hamdi's visa was revoked and he is in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody pending removal.

Under President Donald Trump, McLaughlin said, ""those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country. It's common sense.""

""We call on ICE to immediately account for and release Mr. Hamdi, whose only 'crime' is criticizing a foreign government that committed genocide.""

McLaughlin also linked to a social media post from Amy ""Mek"" Mekelburg, the founder and editor-in-chief of Rise Align Ignite Reclaim (RAIR), which CAIR identifies as ""a hate organization and website that regularly publishes anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim conspiracy theories."" Both Mekelburg and far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer publicly celebrated ICE's detention of Hamdi.

Meanwhile, CAIR said that ""our attorneys and partners are working to address this injustice. We call on ICE to immediately account for and release Mr. Hamdi, whose only 'crime' is criticizing a foreign government that committed genocide.""

""Our nation must stop abducting critics of the Israeli government at the behest of unhinged Israel First bigots,"" the group added. ""This is an Israel First policy, not an America First policy, and it must end.""

Throughout Trump's second term, his administration has provided the Israeli government with diplomatic and weapons support—like his Democratic predecessor—while targeting foreign scholars critical of Israel's genocide in the Gaza Strip for deportation. The administration has also engaged in a broader crackdown on dissent.

Blasting Hamdi's detention and potential deportation, Yasir Qadhi, a Pakistani American Muslim scholar and dean of the Islamic Seminary of America in Texas, said on social media Sunday: ""Our government is doing this on behalf of and as Israel's proxy, because he is a vocal critic of that genocidal regime. Our country is heading towards a fascist dictatorship in which any speech that goes against the official narrative is going to be criminalized.""

In response to Hamdi's detention, Drop Site News shared his recent interview on Sky News about the ceasefire in Gaza after two years of US-backed Israel's genocidal assault.

This past summer, Hamdi took a speaking tour in South Africa, where he spoke with The Voice of the Cape, the country's first Muslim radio station. In an interview, he credited his father, Mohamed Hechmi Hamdi, for his political awareness.

Over 65% of people in the Eastern Coachella Valley live in poverty, according to the Coachella Valley Rescue Mission.","Immigration raids in California's Coachella Valley — a key source of the nation's produce — have upended daily life, keeping parents from fields, children from school and multiple families crowded into shared homes.

Why it matters: Fear in one of the country's poorest regions shows how the Trump administration's immigration crackdown is shaking a vulnerable labor force, mostly undocumented, overwhelming churches and food banks.

The raids in the region are also partly forcing the Trump administration to warn Americans of a looming food crisis brought on by its own crackdown on undocumented farmworkers.

Zoom in: Axios recently interviewed more than a dozen farmworkers, volunteers, advocates and religious leaders in the Coachella Valley, who said the panic is pushing families to the brink of starvation and mental health breakdowns.

They said some families with undocumented members are being reduced to one breadwinner (or none) as farmworkers opt not to work out of anxiety that a raid could nab them away.

They said families are keeping U.S.-born children home from school, often over images they've seen on social media from other cities of immigration agents arresting parents in cars while picking up students.

They said three-bedroom trailers have become homes to three families, sometimes accommodating as many as 15 people per dwelling, as people try to combine resources for survival.

What they're saying: ""People are scared to even come out of the house. They just sit inside, getting depressed,"" farmworker organizer Rosalba De La Cruz told Axios in Spanish.

""I've never seen it like this,"" Imelda Barragan, a farmworker, said in Spanish. She's seen periodic raids in the area over the decades.

Reyes Lopez, a lead community organizer with the Inland Congregations United for Change, said the cruelty of the raids puzzles people, especially since workers are needed in this area, which can get to 115 degrees.

The other side: ""Under Secretary (Kristi) Noem, our brave law enforcement officers are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin tells Axios.

""Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training. There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson tells Axios.

Zoom out: The Coachella Valley, a desert area in Southern California that's a 2 1/2 hours drive east of Los Angeles, is a popular tourist destination with towns like Palm Springs and events like the Coachella music festival.

It also supports year-round farming because of its warm, sunny climate and access to irrigation fed by the Colorado River.

It employs tens of thousands of farmworkers, generating billions of dollars annually.

The region produces crops during the winter months when other areas can't, helping stabilize the national food supply.

The valley is one of the country's leading producers of winter vegetables and fruits, particularly dates, leafy greens, bell peppers, table grapes and citrus fruits.

Between the lines: Religious and multifaith groups like PICO California and Catholic archdioceses are stepping in to help farmworkers.

Axios witnessed volunteers and fellow farmworkers with permanent residency status organize a food bank at Mission San Juan Diego in Mecca, Calif. Dozens of cars of needy farmworkers lined up for three days' worth of donated food.

Meanwhile, some struggling families are taking in U.S.-born children of parents recently deported.

Over 65% of people in the Eastern Coachella Valley live in poverty, according to the Coachella Valley Rescue Mission.

The bottom line: Rev. Rocendo Herrera of Our Lady of Guadalupe Sanctuary in Mecca tells Axios that since the raids, every week the Catholic church gets around 4,000 people for services.

Morales says he and activist Jessi Olazaba were at the school to document reports of ICE agents in the area when they say they became targets of the officers.

""He pushed me backward and I fell and hit my head on the concrete,"" Olazaba said. ""I have a huge knot in back of my head from this.""

Morales and Olazaba are both U.S. citizens born in the country, but Morales says the officers, who were dressed in plain clothes, basically attacked him without provocation.

""I'm feeling multiple punches being thrown to the back of my head,"" Morales said. ""The entire time I'm screaming 'help, help, help.' I still don't know who they are. I'm just guessing, assuming they were ICE.""

Federal agents eventually transported Morales to FBI headquarters in Chicago, where he was released with no charges.

Agents took Olazaba to Rush Copley Hospital in Aurora for the injury to her head. They also gave her a citation for allegedly obstructing an arrest.

By Mel Leonor Barclay andJasmine Mithani for The 19th

Nonprofits working to combat domestic violence and sexual assault have notched a string of legal wins as they push back against efforts by the Trump administration to put restrictions on work that goes against the administration’s views.

A series of lawsuits has, at least temporarily, blocked the administration from enforcing restrictions on millions of dollars of funding for upcoming grants and forced it to return grants it took away from some nonprofits working with LGBTQ+ victims.

Domestic violence groups and the broader network of gender-based violence nonprofits have been on high alert since the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders — followed by a temporary federal freeze in late January — to end federal funding for programs or organizations out of step with the administration’s ideology. The funding, advocates say, is essential to providing life-saving services to vulnerable victims, who are more likely to be women.

Related | Shocker: Trump thinks domestic violence isn't really a crime

Through agency rules, the administration is actively trying to restrict the use of federal grants to fund what it calls “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility activities and “gender ideology extremism.” It is also trying to restrict federal grants from organizations that in any way express support for abortion and that serve immigrants without permanent legal status in the country.

The restrictions go even further: Nonprofits that want to continue to receive federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, are not allowed to “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”

Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, last month downplayed the seriousness of domestic violence crimes in a speech. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” Trump said.

The lawsuits

In June, 17 state-level coalitions that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, represented by Democracy Forward and the National Women’s Law Center, sued the administration over such restrictions on Violence Against Women Act grants awarded by the Justice Department. The following month, in a separate lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward, many of the same state coalitions sued over similar rules attached to grants from the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

In early August, Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the new restrictions on Justice Department grants as the case progresses.

The judge agreed that the nonprofits face an impossible choice between accepting conditions that will harm the core services they provide or going without essential funding. The judge cited two examples: Complying with the rules would bar the organizations from providing the same quality of services to transgender victims and could also prevent organizations counseling victims from doing anything other than calling law enforcement.

“These examples are simply two of many activities that the coalitions engage in that they reasonably fear will now subject them to loss of grant funding,” Smith wrote. “The Office’s assurances that … the office will be reasonable in its interpretation of the conditions is cold comfort.”

Related | Sexual assault victims are being abandoned—just as Trump ordered

A similar preliminary injunction came down in mid-October in the HHS and HUD case, blocking the rollout of restrictions on those agencies’ grants as the case continues. In her ruling, District Judge Melissa DuBose, also of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, said the administration didn’t provide a “satisfactory explanation” the new slew of restrictions, finding that Trump officials “engaged in a baseless and arbitrary process” that didn’t consider the “harmful impact their decision would have on the coalitions and the vulnerable populations they serve.”

Litigation in both cases will likely stretch into 2026.

Advocates against domestic violence and sexual assault celebrated the two rulings, which are part of a broader effort that also includes challenges to rules trying to strip funding from groups that work with LGBTQ+ and immigrant victims.

“This injunction provides immediate relief to survivors, and it allows us and our programs to continue our life-saving work without the threat of restrictive, harmful policies that would have undermined our ability to support those who need it most,” Mike Waterloo of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said of the August ruling.

“This is not a permanent solution, and we still have work to do.”

A coalition of states working with Democracy Forward called the ruling on health and housing grants “a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work.”

LGBTQ+ victims

One of the Trump administration’s first targets was funding that supported groups working with LGBTQ+ people. Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group, helmed an early lawsuit on behalf of nine nonprofits that receive federal funding, several working in the intimate partner violence field.

The organizations argue that the Trump administration’s executive orders, including the order calling for the end of federal funding for activities that promote “gender ideology extremism,” amount to “an existential threat to transgender people.” Forcing the organizations to comply violates the groups’ free speech, due process and equal protection rights, they say.

In June, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction in the case that favored the nonprofits, saying that their case was likely to succeed in court. The judge’s ruling reinstated canceled grants and voided instructions hindering new applications and instructions for funding, including one from the Office of Violence Against Women stating that “that no LGBTQ+ related content should be submitted.”

The administration appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in August. The case continues to move through the courts.

LGBTQ+ Americans, with the exception of gay men, are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, partner abuse or dating violence than cisgender and heterosexual people. Queer women are significantly more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime than straight women, according to an analysis of federal survey data by the Human Rights Campaign. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey said they have experienced intimate partner violence, and 47 percent reported being sexually assaulted.

FORGE, one of the plaintiffs, is among the only organizations in the country focused specifically on transgender victims of violence. The 30-year-old organization relies on federal grants for 90 percent of its funding.

Legal services for immigrant victims

A coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in early October challenging a new rule from the Justice Department that could restrict the use of federal grants to pay for legal services for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.

The upcoming rule says states and the local nonprofits they fund are barred from providing some legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status to be in the country. The lawsuit argues that the Violence Against Women Act — which authorized a part of the funding in question — includes a broad list of allowable legal services that include divorce, parental rights, child support, employment-related lawsuits, housing, civil rights and more.

The Justice Department’s new rule does allow states to pay for restraining and custody orders, legal action dealing with human trafficking and legal services to obtain U and T visas, as required by other laws.

The states argue that it’s unclear how exactly they and the organizations that use the funding will be able to comply with the order: Which immigrants are restricted? What legal services are not allowed?

They also argue that the order would force them to violate the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, which says that services for victims are “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”

“With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is taking the lead on the lawsuit. (James, who has led more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, is a political target of Trump; the president’s Justice Department is pursuing federal mortgage fraud charges against James related to a house she owns in Virginia.)

“We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”
