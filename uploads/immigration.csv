I don’t agree with this, gentlemen.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has congratulated President Trump on what he called a “perfect operation” in Venezuela.","The U.S. military launched a large-scale attack on Venezuela Saturday to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. Missiles rained down on army bases, airfields and key infrastructure across the capital Caracas and the surrounding region. By 2 a.m., U.S. special forces reached Maduro’s residence and abducted him along with his wife. They were then boarded onto a U.S. warship and flown to the U.S. President Trump posted an image of Maduro bound and blindfolded aboard the USS Iwo Jima. Maduro and his wife were later held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, to face criminal charges of narcoterrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy and weapons offenses. They are now being flown by helicopter to Lower Manhattan to appear in federal court today. Shortly after the operation, President Trump praised U.S. forces for abducting Maduro and his wife, and promised to run Venezuela and seize the country’s oil. Venezuela has the world’s largest reserves of crude oil.

President Donald Trump: “The oil companies are going to go in. They’re going to spend money. They’re going to — we’re going to take back the oil that, frankly, we should have taken back a long time ago. A lot of money is coming out of the ground.”

After the operation, Venezuela’s Supreme Court officially designated the country’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, as interim president. On Saturday, Rodríguez denounced the abduction of Maduro and his wife and vowed that Venezuela was ready to defend itself against the United States.

Vice President Delcy Rodríguez: “We demand the immediate liberation of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores — the only president of Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro. … Everything within the Constitution, we learned it from Commander Chávez in the face of adversities, in the face of coup d’état, in the face of oil sabotages. We are ready to defend Venezuela. We are ready to defend our natural resources that must be for national development.”

Soon after her comments, President Trump issued a warning to Rodríguez, telling The Atlantic, “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” By Sunday, Rodríguez posted a more conciliatory message on Instagram saying that her government is ready to work with the U.S. She wrote, “We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence.”

Meanwhile, Semafor is reporting that The New York Times and The Washington Post knew of the secret U.S. raid on Venezuela before it was scheduled to begin Friday night, but held off on publishing the story to avoid endangering U.S. troops. A senior Venezuelan official speaking to The New York Times said that at least 80 people, including civilians and soldiers, were killed in the U.S. attack on Saturday. The Cuban government said 32 of its citizens had been killed, including military and intelligence personnel. This is Jonatan Mallora, whose home was damaged by U.S. airstrikes.

Jonatan Mallora: “I don’t agree with this, no matter what happened, whatever it was. Look at everything that happened there, inside, over on that side, too, and in the back, as well, all of that. We have to be aware. We have to have principles. Now I’m hoping for a quick response from the government to help my family, my children, because they nearly killed my kids here. You know, my kids were almost killed. Up there, there were families, too. Two elderly women died because of these acts that never should have happened, because we aren’t to blame for what happens in this world. They have their problems, and we have ours. Now look at all this chaos. I don’t agree with this, gentlemen.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has congratulated President Trump on what he called a “perfect operation” in Venezuela. He spoke Sunday from an Israeli Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “Regarding Venezuela, I want to express the entire government’s support for the determined decision and action of the United States to restore freedom and justice to that part of the world, as well. I must say that across Latin America right now we are seeing a transformation in several countries that are returning to the American axis and, not surprisingly, also to a connection with the state of Israel. We welcome this. We congratulate President Trump on his decision. We also salute the American military forces who carried out a perfect operation.”

Netanyahu’s praise for the U.S. assault on Venezuela came as Israeli forces occupying the Gaza Strip shot and killed at least three Palestinians in separate attacks over the weekend. Among the dead were a fisherman and a 15-year-old boy. Their deaths bring the number of Palestinians killed by Israel in Gaza since the October 10 ceasefire was declared to 414, with more than 1,100 injured.

Meanwhile, in occupied East Jerusalem, over 130 Palestinians from 26 families face imminent eviction from their homes in the neighborhood of Silwan, after Israel’s Supreme Court denied their final chance to appeal their evictions.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/49/80449/full_hd/hd7-Congress-Venezuela.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 11:00:20.891812

The UK’s border security commander, Martin Hewitt, said the new powers to seize phones more easily marked a “key moment”.
Since his unit was set up, officers have “disrupted” smuggling gangs more than 4,000 times.","Officers will seize mobile phones and sim cards from migrants without the need to arrest them as part of Sir Keir Starmer’s pledge to “smash the gangs” smuggling people across the Channel.

The power has come into force days after the prime minister suffered a blow when new figures showed 41,472 people arrived in the UK on a small boat last year – the second-highest number on record.

On Sunday, the Labour leader announced he had stepped up his bid to ease the crisis – and had ordered the Home Office to close asylum hotels before the current 2029 deadline, although he would not be drawn on a new date.

Officers will begin taking electronic devices from people at Manston processing centre in Kent, to download data they believe will help them gather intelligence on people smugglers.

The new powers for law enforcement agencies are designed to speed up investigations and come after Labour’s new Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act became law in December.

Border security minister Alex Norris said: “We promised to restore order and control to our borders which means taking on the people smuggling networks behind this deadly trade.

“That is exactly why we are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.

“These operational measures sit alongside sweeping reforms to the system, to make it less attractive for migrants to come here illegally and remove and deport people faster.”

Last week, official 2025 figures were 13 per cent higher than the numbers recorded in 2024, when 36,816 migrants made the perilous journey, and 41 per cent higher than 2023's total of 29,437. It was also just 9 per cent below the all-time high of 45,774 in 2022.

On Sunday, Sir Keir said Britons would start to see ‘evidence’ of asylum hotel closures in the coming months.

Their use was highlighted this summer with a wave of protests centred around the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, after an asylum seeker who had arrived by small boat in the UK was temporarily housed and later charged, jailed and deported for sexually assaulting a woman and a 14-year-old girl.

The prime minister said he was “determined” to close the hotels but could not give a date when that might happen.

He told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: “I’ve said to the system, to the relevant departments, I want to see that brought forward as soon as possible, but no longer the end of parliament. Bring it forward.

“I want us to close hotels. I think over coming months you’ll see evidence of that.”

Sir Keir said he did not want to “set a date” until “we’re absolutely sure that we can meet that date”.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp accused ministers of “cosmetic tweaks” and said there was no deterrent to those crossing the Channel, as he reiterated his party’s call for the UK to quit the European Convention on Human Rights.

The government’s new law also introduces new criminal offences, such as up to 14 years in jail for storing or supplying boat engines to bring migrants to the UK via the English Channel smuggling route.

Smugglers downloading maps on where to depart on small boats or researching the best places to buy equipment for the dinghies could also face up to five years in prison.

The UK’s border security commander, Martin Hewitt, said the new powers to seize phones more easily marked a “key moment”.

""The deportation rate rose from 19 percent in 2023 to 27 percent in the first three quarters of 2025,"" Brunner highlighted, adding, however, that this increase was ""still far from sufficient"" to keep net migration in the EU within manageable rates.

""We must combat illegal migration on all fronts,"" Brunner said, explaining that this requires consistency in upholding and increasing deportation rates of people who have lost the right to remain in the EU.

He added that the EU also had to do more to move towards ""swiftly rejecting people with little prospect of receiving asylum.""

Both aspects of migration management, he stressed, require close cooperation with third countries.

Focus on deterring would-be migrants through policy

Furthermore, Brunner also highlighted the role that third-country partnerships play in ensuring that people do not embark on dangerous migrations in the first place, emphasizing the importance of deterring prospective migrants.

Brunner's remarks are backed up by recent legal changes to the way the EU handles migration: Its member states agreed on several far-reaching measures to limit migration and speed up returns last month in Brussels as part of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) that will go into effect throughout the EU starting in June 2026.

As part of those agreements, they thrashed out terms to increase the pressure on rejected asylum seekers to go back home while also streamlining deportation procedures in general.

To this end, they also agreed that return hubs can and will be set up in third countries located outside the EU — without highlighting thus far which particular countries the bloc is eyeing as potential partners in this endeavor.

Some EU member states like Denmark, however, have expressed that they do not find the scope of these agreements and the timeline of their implementation entirely sufficient.

Return hubs: Exporting migration management to outside the EU

Such return hubs outside the EU will serve multiple purposes: One main purpose of a third country hub would be to intercept migrants before they reach the EU and take them to these hubs to process their cases.

Those with legitimate asylum claims could be distributed among EU member states for protection, while those whose applications are rejected could be returned to their home countries without being admitted into the European Union.

A solidarity mechanism for member states that do not wish to take in more asylum seekers to opt out by paying 20,000 euros per rejected migrant will also be part of that plan.

In addition to that, there are also numerous cases of asylum seekers already in the EU, whose asylum claims are rejected, and these failed asylum seekers are therefore technically due to be deported back to their home countries; however, in the absence of return agreements with certain nations, they cannot be sent back.

A return hub could serve as a place to house them alternatively for an indefinite amount of time, with hopes of encouraging them to voluntarily return to their country of origin from there.

Above all, these return hubs are meant to discourage people from embarking on migration routes in the first place and therefore destroying the business model of smugglers.

European nations join calls to alter ECHR to enable sweeping asylum restrictions -- but how?

Reinterpreting — not changing — ECHR

Return hubs in third countries have long been floated as a possible tool for EU migration management; however, various proposals and plans were rejected or stymied under previous governments.

With a move to the right across various EU member states, the idea of third-country return hubs has gained momentum in the past year and was eventually signed into law in December.

Among the nations at the forefront of pushing the idea of such return hubs are Italy — which has opened its own hubs in Albania, albeit under ongoing legal problems with fully implementing the use of these facilities — and Denmark.

Both countries are at the forefront of pushing for a reinterpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in the context of migration.

Giving into pressure amid the new EU agreements signed last month, a majority of the signatories to the convention endorsed the idea of allowing a different and somewhat more flexible interpretation — and implementation — of the ECHR in the migration context; however, any changes will still have to go through the court of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).

All 27 EU member states are signatories to the ECHR, as are 19 other states.

UK and Danish leaders call for reinterpretation of ECHR

Denmark willing to overstep convention

Despite a joint backing for a reformed interpretation of the ECHR, the Danish government has announced it will not wait for the court to change its practices.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, in her New Year's Address, announced a ""comprehensive reform on deportation"" including harsher methods to deport foreign nationals who receive criminal convictions, regardless of their connection to Denmark. This could mean Denmark violating the existing interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

""Instead of waiting several years, (…) we are taking the lead and implementing legislation before the summer,"" she announced.

Denmark's Minister for Integration, Rasmus Stoklund, acknowledged that Denmark could run a ""procedural risk"" of breaching international law by not waiting for the court.

Denmark: Reforms before elections

Frederiksen said that her government's deportation reform will see ""even more foreign criminals … deported from Denmark,"" explaining that those who are sentenced to at least one year in prison — regardless of their ties to Denmark — should face deportation.

""Thanks to a strict Danish immigration policy – and our willingness to push the boundaries of convention – we are already deporting many foreign criminals,"" she said in her last New Year's speech as prime minister of the current coalition government; in November, the Nordic nation is expected to go to the polls amid a recent dip in support for her party.

Frederiksen went as far as identifying quite specific boundaries of when people with a foreign background should — or shouldn't — be welcome in the Scandinavian nation; the Danish prime minister said her country would refuse to embrace to those who came from a ""culture of domination.""

Without making direct references to any particular group, the comment is seen as a rejection of certain groups of Muslims living in Denmark, whose cultural and tribal structures are widely seen as conflicting with Danish values, i.e. those with traditional, conservative, hierarchical and male-dominant structures, which often are found to be in disregard of women's and minority rights.",https://scd.infomigrants.net/media/resize/my_image_small/58235db716d62b39905cd2facb71828fb089da5d.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 09:57:19.156762

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

U.S. forces killed at least 80 people, including civilians, during the military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas on Saturday, according to a senior Venezuelan official. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said yesterday that 32 Cuban military and intelligence personnel were killed in the U.S. attacks. According to two U.S. officials, around 6 U.S. soldiers were injured. Isabela Espadas Barros Leal and Genevieve Glatsky report for the New York Times; Jack Nicas reports for the New York Times.

President Trump yesterday evening reiterated that the United States was now “in charge” of Venezuela, following the capture of Maduro on Saturday morning. When asked by reporters what he needed from the current acting leader of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, Trump said, “We need total access. We need access to the oil and to other things in their country that allow us to rebuild their country.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier on Sunday that the Trump administration would keep a military quarantine in place on the country’s oil exports to exert leverage on the new leadership there. Rubio said in an interview that people were “fixating” on Trump’s declaration on Saturday that the U.S government would run Venezuela, adding “it’s not running – it’s running policy, policy with regards to this.” Edward Wong reports for the New York Times.

“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development,” Rodríguez said yesterday on social media, having earlier condemned the U.S. attack on Saturday as an illegal grab for the country’s national resources. Rodríguez added, “President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war.” Trump told The Atlantic Sunday, “If [Rodríguez] doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” as he raised the possibility of another strike. Reuters reports; Rebecca Falconer reports for Axios.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are scheduled to appear today before a federal judge in New York. Trump administration officials have portrayed Maduro’s capture as a law-enforcement action to hold Maduro accountable for criminal charges filed in 2020, accusing him of narco-terrorism conspiracy. In a new indictment, unsealed on Saturday, prosecutors allege that Maduro personally oversaw a state-sponsored cocaine trafficking network that partnered with some of the world’s most prolific drug trafficking groups. Jack Queen reports for Reuters.

Trump said on Saturday morning that he fully expects U.S. oil companies to be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry. Administration officials have told oil executives in recent weeks that if they want compensation for their seized property, then they must be prepared to go back into Venezuela and invest heavily in its petroleum industry, two sources told POLITICO. “They’re saying, ‘you gotta go in if you want to play and get reimbursed,’” said one industry official familiar with the conversations, adding that the offer has been on the table for the last 10 days. Ben Lefebvre, Zack Colman, and James Bikales report; Ben Geman reports for Axios

Trump administration officials are set to provide a briefing this afternoon on the military operation to capture Maduro to the Gang of Eight, as well as Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senate Armed Services Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Armed Services Committee, according to an official briefed on the plans. When asked why he had not sought Congressional authorization for the attack, Trump said on Saturday that he did not trust its members to keep the plans confidential. Annie Karni reports for the New York Times.

The U.N. Security Council is due to meet today following the U.S. attack on Venezuela. Colombia, backed by Russia and China, requested the meeting of the 15-member council, diplomats said. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

“Cuba looks like it’s ready to fall,” and “Colombia is very sick too,” Trump said yesterday on board Air Force One. Trump rejected the possibility that his administration might use U.S. forces to hasten the Cuban government’s demise, explaining that Venezuela was Cuba’s main economic backer. Trump also added, “We need Greenland from a national security standpoint…The EU needs us to have Greenland.” Earlier on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, “It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the US needing to take over Greenland. The US has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish kingdom.” Sophia Cai reports for POLITICO; Rebecca Falconer reports for Axios.

“If Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” Trump posted on social media on Friday. A rights group said yesterday that at least 16 people have been killed in last week’s protests. Deaths and arrests have been reported by both state media and rights groups, though the figures differ. Barak Ravid reports for Axios; Elwely Elwelly reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

Trump said yesterday that U.S officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week. Darlene Superville and Aamer Madhani report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israeli forces yesterday shot and killed three Palestinians in separate incidents in Khan Younis, Gaza, according to local health authorities. Medics reported that those killed included a 15-year-old boy, a fisherman on the Palestinian side of the Yellow Line, and a third man who was shot east of Khan Younis in an area under Israeli control. Nidal al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel’s revocation of licences for 37 international non-governmental organizations working in Gaza and called for the measure to be reversed, according to a statement on Friday. “[Israel’s] announcement comes on top of earlier restrictions that have already delayed critical food, medical, hygiene and shelter supplies from entering Gaza,” the statement added. Daphne Psaledakis reports for Reuters.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces recaptured the port city of Mukalla and much of Hadramout over the weekend. The city had been seized last month by the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council. Two residents of the Hadramout towns of al-Qatn and Seiyun told AP News that the STC had withdrawn from military camps. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry said on Saturday that it will host a conference in Riyadh to bring together all southern factions in Yemen “to discuss just solutions to the southern cause.” Fatma Khaled reports; Saeed Al-Batati and Vivian Nereim report for the New York Times.

British and French war planes over the weekend bombed an underground facility in Syria that was used by Islamic State militants to store weapons, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Malaika Kanaaneh Tapper and Jim Pickard report for the Financial Times.

Senior Syrian and Israeli officials will meet today in Paris to resume negotiations on a new security agreement, according to an Israeli official and another source. The talks are expected to take place over two days, with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani participating opposite a new group of Israeli negotiators. The resumption of talks is the direct result of a request from President Trump to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met last Monday in Mar-a-Lago, according to the source. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

Chinese cyberattacks on Taiwan’s key infrastructure rose 6% in 2025 from the previous year to an average of 2.63 million attacks a day, according to a report published by Taiwan’s National Security Bureau yesterday. The report said China’s “cyber army” timed operations to coincide with military and political coercion. For instance, China launched 40 “joint combat readiness patrols” by sending military planes and ships close to Taiwan, and cyberattacks escalated on 23 of those occasions. Yimou Lee reports for Reuters.

Unidentified gunmen on Saturday evening killed at least 30 people and abducted several others in attacks on two neighbouring villages in Nigeria, a Nigerian government official said yesterday. Saikou Jammeh, Ismail Alfa, and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

ICE officers are using Mobile Fortify, a facial recognition app, to speed up arrests by allowing officers to identify individuals and their immigration status by taking a picture, according to U.S. officials. The app has access to several government criminal databases. The data includes previous encounters with immigration officials, such as if an immigrant was arrested at the southern border or entered at a legal entry point, officials said. Sources said it also taps into publicly available sources, including social media posts. A spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department denied this. Michelle Hackman, Arian Campo-Flores, and Hannah Critchfield report for the Wall Street Journal.

Hannah C. Dugan, a Wisconsin state judge convicted of obstructing federal agents attempting to arrest an undocumented migrant, resigned her position on Saturday. Julie Bosman reports for the New York Times.

U.S DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The FBI said on Friday that it disrupted a plan by 18-year-old Christian Sturdivant, inspired by the Islamic State, to attack a grocery store and fast-food restaurants in North Carolina. In recent weeks, the FBI has arrested a number of other individuals alleged to have been plotting terrorist attacks on or around New Year’s Eve. Many of the investigations, including the one that led to charges against Sturdivant, involved undercover agents or officers offering encouragement and, in some cases, suggestions on carrying out the attacks.

Every Monday morning, I’ll be offering an update on goings-on at the Court (“On the Docket”); a longer introduction to some feature of the Court’s history, current issues, or key players (“The One First ‘Long Read’”); and some Court-related trivia. If you’re not already a subscriber, please consider becoming one. And for those who want to start 2026 with a bang, you might also consider whether a gift subscription would be a welcome present (or, at least, an amusing gag) for a friend or family member:

Not surprisingly, there was exactly one newsworthy development out of the Supreme Court last week—the clockwork release, at 6 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, of the Chief Justice’s “Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary.” I’ve written before about both the history of this tradition and how Chief Justice Roberts has meaningfully departed from the practice of his two immediate predecessors by no longer asking Congress for … anything. Indeed, the Roberts reports have typically been remarkable only for their unremarkability, elevating to a fine art pablum packaged as historical anecdotes.

Against that backdrop, the 2025 year-end report is fascinating for its subtleties. Reading between the lines, one can find the Chief Justice of the United States standing up for immigrants; extolling the continuing aspirations of the Declaration of Independence; and reiterating the importance of judicial independence—three messages that are certainly welcome as we look ahead to the second year of the second Trump administration. The problem, though, is that one has to read between the lines to find those takeaways. Given the year that just transpired—not just the substantive behavior of the executive branch but its unprecedented hostility toward, threats against, and defiance of federal judges—this would’ve been a golden opportunity for Chief Justice Roberts to make the kind of statement that might’ve resonated across the political/ideological spectrum. By opting for subtlety, it seems worth asking exactly who the Chief Justice views as his audience these days. Not only am I increasingly unsure of the answer, but, far more importantly, I wonder if he might be, too.

More on that in a moment.

On the Docket

There were no formal rulings out of the full Court last week. Besides the Chief Justice’s year-end report, the only noteworthy action was the release, on Friday, of the oral argument calendar for February—a surprisingly light session with only seven arguments across six days, only one of which (the Hemani Second Amendment dispute) is likely to be of broader significance to non-lawyers.

The justices are next set to meet in person this Friday, when they are scheduled both for their regular Conference and for what the Supreme Court’s website calls a “non-argument session” on the bench. Those sessions can sometimes include the handing down of decisions in argued cases, but they don’t have to; no opinions came down during such a session on November 21. We’ll know more later this week, either because the Court will announce that it is expecting to hand down opinions on Friday—or because it won’t. The next regular Order List is expected next Monday at 9:30 ET, after which the Court will begin the January 2026 argument session.

Finally, on a more personal note, I’ve posted to SSRN a revised version of my attempt to look holistically at the Court’s behavior on Trump-related emergency applications during the October 2024 Term. You can download the essay, which is forthcoming in the Supreme Court Review, for free at this link. And although it’s not directly Supreme Court-related, I’ll be one of the witnesses this Wednesday afternoon at 2:30 ET, when the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights is set to hold a (twice-postponed) hearing on “Impeachment: Holding Rogue Judges Accountable.” Something tells me there will be some disagreements.

The One First “Long Read”:

An Audience of … One?

The foil for Chief Justice Roberts’s 2025 year-end report is an obvious one: this year’s 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. But the way he decided to introduce his protagonist (Thomas Paine) is quietly revealing: “Two hundred fifty years ago this week, a recent immigrant to Britain’s North American colonies put the finishing touches on a manuscript in which he hoped to express ‘plain truths’ about his newly adopted home.” As Roberts puts it, Paine’s (anonymous) January 1776 publication of “Common Sense” “electrified the country and played a crucial role in stimulating a vote for independence in the Second Continental Congress six months later.” (While reading it, I could almost hear the line from Hamilton: “immigrants—we get the job done.”)

Briefly recapping the history of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and the provenance of its signers, Roberts pointed to that document as one that “enunciated the American creed, a national mission statement, even though it quite obviously captured an ideal rather than a reality, given that the vast majority of the 56 signers of the Declaration (even Franklin) enslaved other humans at some point in their lives.” As Roberts notes, many of the Declaration’s signers were lawyers and future judges—a subtle but unmistakable nod to the role of the rule of law in promoting that “American creed.”

But Roberts didn’t stop there. Connecting the Declaration to the Constitution that followed a little more than a decade later, the Chief Justice pivoted to the role of the courts, specifically, in achieving the Declaration’s aspirations, noting that “[t]he connection between these two foundational documents could not be clearer when it comes to the judicial branch,” and describing the Constitution’s enshrinment of an independent judiciary as an “arrangement, now in place for 236 years, [that] has served the country well.”

Extolling the virtues of judicial independence is not a new theme for the Chief Justice’s year-end report, but it seems like no accident here; more than any specific substantive point, the year-end report seems centered on defending for the basic structure of our government—and the role of the courts in that structure—closing with a quote from, of all people, President Calvin Coolidge, in marking the 150th anniversary of the Declaration in 1926:

“Amid all the clash of conflicting interests, amid all the welter of partisan politics, every American can turn for solace and consolation to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States with the assurance and confidence that those two great charters of freedom and justice remain firm and unshaken.” True then; true now.

Thus, if one looks hard enough, one can find in these seven pages an outwardly reassuring message from the Chief Justice.

The problem is … everything else that’s happened over the last 12 months. Whatever one thinks about the Trump administration, the following six points are, in my view, objectively undeniable:

The Trump administration has pushed the substantive boundaries of executive power under both statutes and the Constitution to a degree unmatched by any of its predecessors;

Congress has sat entirely on the sidelines while that’s happened, even in contexts in which the executive branch has usurped legislative power;

We’ve seen an unprecedented number of rulings from federal district courts and courts of appeals (including judges from across the ideological spectrum) blocking the Trump administration’s actions—many of which have raised alarm bells about the executive branch’s substantive and litigation behavior;

We’ve seen an unprecedented degree of hostility to those rulings from the executive branch—including (a) calls for the impeachment of judges who have ruled against the government; (b) the filing by the Attorney General of frivolous misconduct complaints against some of those judges; (c) the Deputy Attorney General referring to a “war” between the executive branch and the federal courts; (d) the White House Deputy Chief of Staff referring to judges who rule against the administration as being part of a “judicial insurrection; and (e) multiple cases in which the executive branch has openly defied coercive court orders instead of (or while) appealing them;

That hostility has manifested in a sharp rise in threats against the physical safety of federal judges—and not just through the insidious practice of “pizza doxxing” (where pizzas in the name of the murdered son of New Jersey federal district judge Esther Salas are regularly being delivered to the unlisted home addresses of myriad federal judges). Indeed, as a coalition of retired federal judges has noted, “The United States Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies have determined that many of these threats have posed a credible danger to the judges, their loved ones, and their court staff”; and

While all of this has been happening, the Supreme Court has largely enabled the Trump administration’s behavior in the small (and carefully self-selected) subset of cases the Justice Department has taken up—not just rewarding the executive branch’s behavior but, in several cases, chastising those same lower courts for failing to divine the justices’ intent from un- (or thinly) explained rulings.

In other words, it seems fair to describe 2025 as a year of unprecedented assaults on the very constitutional structure and judicial independence the Chief Justice appears to be so invested in publicly defending. Against that backdrop, the fact that his year-end report doesn’t even indirectly allude to any of those assaults (unlike last year’s, which was at least elliptically critical of some elected officials) is, frankly, inexcusable. However much praise the Chief Justice deserved for his rare public statement last March pushing back against President Trump’s calls for impeachment of federal judges, the reality is that he has said literally nothing on that subject (or any related topic) since. Here was a golden opportunity for the Chief Justice to at least return to that theme. Instead, as someone who doesn’t do anything by accident, he passed.

All of this brings us back to the question with which I started the post: Who does the Chief Justice view as his audience? It certainly isn’t the Court’s critics—for whom the paeans to the role of immigrants in our Founding story and the indirect defense of judicial independence will be far too subtle and un-specific to be remotely mollifying. And it certainly isn’t the Trump administration (or Congress, for that matter), who somehow avoided even indirect criticism notwithstanding the events of the past 12 months. Nor is it Roberts’s colleagues in the federal judiciary—who won’t find a single word in the report that responds to their mounting (and increasingly public) frustration with the Supreme Court’s behavior.

That leaves as the potential audience (besides the Chief Justice himself) folks who support the current Supreme Court but not the Trump administration—a small cohort of conservative lawyers who might view themselves as “never Trumpers,” but who have been just as reticent to speak out against the alarming patterns described above as the Chief Justice has been. For them, reminding everyone that Thomas Paine was an immigrant and that our country was founded entirely on the premise that ours is a government of laws, and not of men, may be reassuring. But as the calendar turns to 2026, and against the backdrop of everything that has happened (and is happening), that degree of subtletly is, and will be, lost on everyone else.

SCOTUS Trivia: Chief Justice Rehnquist’s 1997 Report

The Supreme Court’s website, which really is a wonderful resource for so many things, includes digital copies of the Chief Justice’s year-end report for every year dating back to 2000. Alas, it doesn’t have Chief Justice Rehnquist’s 1997 year-end report—which provides a useful illustration of how the year-end report could be used to send a message that other government institutions receive.

In that report, Rehnquist took on the growing problem of judicial vacancies—which was exacerbated by the refusal of the Republican-controlled Senate to vote up or down on many of President Clinton’s nominees. As the New York Times reported on January 1, 1998, Rehnquist wrote that the “vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.” And although he noted that delays by President Clinton in sending nominations to the Senate had contributed to the problem, his main criticism fell on the Senate itself. “The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee,” Rehnquist wrote, “but after the necessary time for inquiry, it should vote him up or vote him down.” To let nominees languish, Rehnquist concluded, would imperil the federal judiciary’s ability to operate.

Rehnquist’s critiques—and the significance of a Republican-appointed Chief Justice criticizing Senate Republicans—had their desired effect; although President Clinton still struggled to get all of his judicial nominees through the Senate, the Rehnquist report helped pressure the Senate into at least moving a bit more formally on those nominations that were submitted. And it remains today a powerful example of how the year-end report, for all of its shortcomings, can be an effective opportunity for the Chief Justice to put himself (and the judiciary) above partisan politics. He just has to want to do so.

TRANSCRIPTION:

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU, and we don't need to tell you--federal immigration policy has impacted a great number of people around the country and right here in our community. I'm David Fair, and welcome to the first Washtenaw United conversation of 2026. Washtenaw United--it's our weekly exploration of equity and opportunity in our community. And I can tell you there are a good number of people who feel opportunity is being taken away. Our first guest of the New Year has been working these issues in an up-close and personal way. Christine Sauve is policy engagement and communications manager at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. And thank you for making time for us today! And Happy New Year, Christine!

Christine Sauve: Happy New Year! Thanks for having me!

David Fair: In the first 11 months of the second Trump presidency, more than 1.6 million immigrants have lost their legal status in the United States. NPR reported that's a number larger than the entire population of Philadelphia. Could you have imagined that, in this day and age, that this is where we would find ourselves?

Christine Sauve: You know, after the results of the 2024 election were clear, we knew that 2025 would be hard. I would say, even though we knew it would be challenging, experiencing those challenges and seeing families affected is another matter. So, again, expecting some of the policies that have happened still doesn't minimize the hurt and the suffering.

David Fair: For those unfamiliar with the work of the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, would you give us a brief synopsis of the services your organization provides?

Christine Sauve: Yeah. The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center is a legal resource center for low-income immigrants across the state. We provide immigration legal services for free, and we serve unaccompanied children in federal custody, as well as those released. We serve farm workers, people applying for asylum or naturalization. We also serve folks who are in detention or facing deportation.

David Fair: And that has become more difficult to do. Funding is at a premium. The number of people who are requiring assistance has gone up. How has federal government cutting resources impacted your ability to help as many as you can?

Christine Sauve: Yes. So, we have seen some very serious funding cuts at the same time that the need for services has just skyrocketed. So, MIRC was affected by some of the Trump Administration's efforts to eliminate funding for long-standing, legal orientation programs. For example, we ran a help desk in Detroit's immigration court. That program was ended. The administration did attempt to end funding for unaccompanied children's legal services. Our country had historically said, ""We should provide lawyers for children to face their cases in court."" Thankfully, due to litigation, most of that funding has been restored, but the future looks shaky. And this has caused great instability for organizations like ours. At the same time, our call volume is way up. We've received over 5,000 calls the past year. Our calls from detention are up threefold. And people are calling us for good reason, because having a lawyer really makes a difference in immigration court. 62% of people with a lawyer were deported, compared to only 27% of those who had a lawyer. So, it makes a big difference.

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU's Washtenaw United, and we're talking with Christine Sauve from the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. With all of the increased immigration and customs enforcement operations taking place here in Washtenaw County, around the state and around the country, are you finding that more immigrants are refusing to show up for court?

Christine Sauve: You know, that's an interesting question that has been in the news recently. Historically, the data has shown that the majority of people show up for their appointments. And that's even more so true if you have legal counsel. So, between 96 and 98% of children and families with legal counsel show up their court appointments. So, looking at some of the recent numbers just over this past year, there has been an increase in some of those rulings without someone there. And I think that's, in large part, due to the increase in immigration enforcement that we're seeing at the court. So, specifically, ICE is targeting and arresting and detaining people at their court appointments. But I can say for our clients, the vast majority of our clients, do show up for their appointments again because they know that's the only way that they can actually achieve the outcome that they're seeking in their case.

David Fair: I was going to say. Do the repercussions become worse should they miss those court dates?

Christine Sauve: Yes. And we're seeing that play out because if you miss your court hearing, the ruling will be made against you for removal. And that opens up more people who are then targeted for ICE detention and removal. We've seen an increase in the detainment of individuals with pending application, so some of our clients who have a pending application for asylum, even some of our child clients who had pending applications and were really just waiting for their green card. And so, the detention centers are almost at capacity, and it really pushes people to the brink. People are being detained for longer periods, and it puts a strain physically, mentally, spiritually. And that, sadly, is pushing some people to choose to self-deport or what's known as voluntary departure.

David Fair: You know, this used to be a country that prided itself on being so welcoming. Inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty, there's a plaque with the Emma Lazarus poem called ""The New Colossus"". It contains the following words: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free."" And that had become a part of the American identity. It offered promise that the American Dream was not only real, but accessible. How would you assess the state of the American Dream in 2026?

Christine Sauve: I'd say it's in tatters. You know, so many individuals have placed their faith in our immigration system only to see the rules changed midway. So many lawful programs that people have been participating in waiting for their final outcome in court, those programs were ended. And their status is now tenuous, and they can be arrested and detained. So, I think of that quote often myself because my great-grandfather came here as, what would today be called, an unaccompanied child. And I don't think he would be welcomed in the same way that he was at that period and able to start a life here. And that's what just so many people who are coming recently have wanted was a chance at opportunity or better opportunities for their kids. And I have been the beneficiary of that. And I truly believe that it's still at the core of what has made this country great and part of our American values.

David Fair: Well, 2026 is shaping up to be a year of potentially even harsher immigration policy and enforcement. So, how is the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center shaping up to deal with that reality?

Christine Sauve: We are doing the best we can with the resources that we have. There are 31,000 cases pending in immigration court, and only about a third of those individuals have a lawyer. So, people need attorneys, and our nonprofit immigration legal system is under-resourced. So many of our partners have been very kindly holding community fundraisers to raise more resources to provide attorneys for those who need them. Because, in immigration court, you're not provided an attorney if you can't afford one, unlike in the criminal court process. So, we're also just trying to share information with the community, so that people are aware of their rights and can be better informed. But the real difficulties that we're seeing are, again, stemming from the massive numbers of people who are now detained, and that's creating, essentially, a second child separation crisis. Because as more parents are detained, their children, many of whom are U.S. citizens, are suffering at home separated from their parents.

David Fair: You know, you're pointing it out with your answer there, but we tend to have these kinds of conversations in a very political context: who's on what side and why and how many are affected. But we're talking about people, families, and community. And too many voices are being silenced out of fear. How do we, as a community at whole, help address those fears and move us forward instead of regressing?

Christine Sauve: You know, it really takes discussion, and I know many people have just maybe had some of those conversations over the holidays with their loved ones, but people have different access to different information these days. So, helping get the word out about what's really happening in their communities can help the conversation. You know, what's so striking working so close to this issue and having the vantage point we do is that, most Americans, what they say they want in the immigration system, this administration is doing the exact opposite. So, most Americans say they wants fairness. And it's not really fair to arrest and detain people who have been playing by the rules. Most people say they want order, but instead we're seeing lawlessness--agents without identification, misuse of force. And then, most people say that they want affordability. They want a cost of living to be addressed. And instead, we're spending billions on detention and enforcement. So, I think if we go back to our core values, we can have some of these conversations and maybe look at some real policy changes.

David Fair: We will have opportunity to have many more conversations over the course of the next year. I appreciate your time today and look forward to our next conversation, hopefully with a little more optimism.

Christine Sauve: Thank you so much! Appreciate it!

Detainees report widespread depression, anxiety, insomnia, and emotional breakdowns.","Eighty asylum seekers detained in preparation for being returned to France under the UK government’s controversial “one in, one out” scheme have called on UN bodies to investigate their treatment. claiming they have suffered “fear, humiliation, and psychological distress” at the hands of the Home Office since arriving in the UK in small boats.

The detainees have compiled a document, “Report on conditions and treatment at Harmondsworth immigration removal centre”, which claims they have been treated unjustly by the Home Office since arriving in the UK on small boats. Harmondsworth is one of two detention centres close to Heathrow airport in London.

The asylum seekers, who come from a variety of conflict zones including Sudan, Afghanistan and Iran, accuse the Home Office of subjecting them to arbitrary detention, denial of legal representation, inadequate medical care, degrading treatment and severe psychological harm. They say they came to UK “in the pursuit of safety, dignity, and a chance to live a peaceful life”.

They are calling on the UN and human rights groups to urgently investigate conditions that people detained for deportation under the “one in, one out” scheme are held in.

The report’s circulation coincides with new government powers coming into force to seize mobile phones carried by people who arrive in the UK on small boats to examine them for information about people smugglers. One offence that under the new powers could lead to a sentence of up to five years in jail is “collecting information that is of use to those planning an illegal crossing”, which could include checking the weather forecast to identify favourable times to cross the Channel.

Despite a raft of measures to tackle people smuggling gangs using small boats to bring asylum seekers to the UK since Labour came to power, 2025 had the second-highest number of crossings on record with more than 41,000 people reaching the UK on small boats.

According to the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of deaths among those in northern France hoping to reach UK was significantly lower than in 2024 despite the increase in crossings. More than 36,000 crossed in 2024 and at least 85 deaths were recorded, while 36 deaths were documented in 2025.

The first return flight to France of 2026 under the “one in, one out” scheme is due on Wednesday. According to the most recent figures issued by the Home Office, 193 people have been sent to France in the first three months of the scheme, while in turn 195 have been brought here legally. This represents less than a quarter of the 803 people who crossed the Channel in small boats in a single day on 20 December.

According to the report, detainees say they were not given sufficient time to rest, recover or receive psychological support following traumatic journeys and their Home Office interview, with some not having seen or spoken to their families since detention began.

They add that along with not receiving adequate medical treatment for a range of physical ailments the psychological impact of detention has been profound. The report states: “Many detainees are young adults between the ages of 17 and 30. Detainees report widespread depression, anxiety, insomnia, and emotional breakdowns.

“There have been multiple incidents involving individuals experiencing severe mental health crises, including self-harm attempts. Detainees report being placed in isolation or disciplinary units. This environment has created constant fear, despair, and uncertainty, with detainees expressing that they feel dehumanised and invisible.”

The detainees say their treatment since arriving in the UK violates fundamental principles of human rights, dignity and due process and amounts to being punished for seeking protection. “The authors of this report ask not for privilege, but for fairness, humanity, and freedom. They ask to be seen, heard, and treated as human beings,” the report states.

The Home Office and the UN’s refugee agency have been approached for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8856c9942c673266266a38d1adec3b60fb6af5f8/1017_213_3483_2787/master/3483.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=70c0c23233549fd51760718222db5903",N,,2026-01-05 05:56:48.835369

According to law enforcement, Porter — a father of two — fired celebratory gunshots into the air with an AR-15-style rifle outside his apartment complex on New Year’s Eve. An off-duty ICE officer who lives at the complex heard the gunfire and responded, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The ICE officer, who has not been identified, exchanged gunfire with the shooter, DHS said. Porter was pronounced dead at the scene.

""He was a great Black man. He was a girl dad,"" said Porter’s cousin, Jsane Tyler.

Chants of ""Say his name, Keith Porter"" echoed through the street Sunday evening as family members, neighbors, and activists mourned Porter and called for an independent investigation into the shooting.

In its statement, DHS said, ""On December 31, an off-duty ICE officer bravely responded to an active shooter situation at his apartment complex. In order to protect his life and that of others, he was forced to defensively use his weapon and exchanged gunfire with the shooter. Fortunately, our brave officer was not injured while protecting his community.""

An LAPD report states the off-duty federal officer confronted Porter, identified himself as law enforcement, and claims Porter fired toward him, prompting the officer to return fire.

Family members and community leaders dispute that account and say Porter was not a threat.

""This is not someone who was out to harm anyone,"" said Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles. ""Police lie, and it’s disgusting the way they assassinate Black life.""

Some at the vigil acknowledged that firing a weapon into the air is dangerous but questioned whether deadly force was justified.

""It’s not the smartest thing to do if that was the case,"" said neighbor Carter Nunez. ""But regardless, is that punishable by death? I don’t think so. We have due process in this county.""

As the vigil continued, community members renewed calls for an independent investigation.

""He was off duty. Protocol states he was supposed to stay in that house and call 911 if he thought Keith was a danger to anyone else,"" Tyler said.

Sunday evening, a crowd of about 50 gathered on wet asphalt outside the Village Pointe apartment complex in Northridge to grieve Keith Porter Jr. The group included activists, family members and Porter’s co-workers from Home Depot. The Compton man was shot at the complex on Dec. 31 by an off-duty Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, according to authorities.

Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles — of which Porter was a member — said in a news release that the vigil was organized to memorialize the 33-year-old father and call for an independent investigation into his death.

“We want to recognize that one of the worst imaginable injustices has been committed, and there will be time for us to protest,” Melina Abdullah, a co-director of Black Lives Matter Grassroots, said during the vigil. ”This is a time for grief. … We are not going to be quiet.”

In a statement after the incident, Homeland Security officials said the agent was “forced to defensively use his weapon” and opened fire “to protect his life and that of others.” Officials said Porter was an “active shooter” threat.

According to a statement from the civil rights organization Project Islamic Hope, Porter was celebrating the new year by firing a rifle into the air when an “overzealous” off-duty agent shot him.

Firing guns into the air, which poses the risk of people being injured or killed, is a felony. The fatal shooting of Porter is under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department’s Robbery-Homicide Division, officials said. The FBI, the U.S. Department of Justice and Homeland Security Investigations also are handling the case because a federal agent was involved.

On Sunday evening, mourners crouched around a makeshift memorial and wrote heartfelt messages to Porter and his family on a small board above his photo. Porter is survived by a 9-year-old daughter.

Bishop Jack Wilson, a friend of Porter’s mother, was on hand for the gathering. The Solid Rock Mission Church official said he remembered Porter as a child, when he was always smiling and had the manners of an old Southern gentleman.

“He was full of life, and always smiling,” Wilson said. “It hurts me that he didn’t take his last breath, but his last breath was taken from him.”

Abdullah said Black Lives Matter Grassroots, an activist group within the BLM movement, would meet with L.A. County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman on Tuesday morning to demand that there be a federal investigation into the agent responsible for the killing. Authorities had yet to identify the agent Sunday.

Hochman “was elected from the backing of police associations that came from murderous cops, like the one who stole Keith’s life,” Abdullah said. “The people have the power, and the people have a demand.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a83e8e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3984x2092+0+282/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2Fff%2F2aecc49b4ac688e24e612c43ad0c%2F1536595-me-ice-agent-shooting-northridge-jja-0002.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:02:17.149315

Virginia’s outgoing Attorney General Jason Miyares quickly agreed to a consent decree to resolve a Justice Department lawsuit filed against the state in late December challenging laws allowing students in the country illegally to qualify for in-state tuition and financial aid at public colleges and universities.

“In a joint court filing, Miyares and lawyers for the Justice Department asked a federal judge to declare the Virginia Dream Act invalid and bar state authorities from enforcing it. If approved, the joint consent decree order would make Virginia the fourth state to scrap its policies that allow eligible undocumented students to pay the lower in-state tuition rate,” Inside Higher Ed reported Jan. 2.

“The joint agreement came just one day after the Trump administration sued Virginia over its in-state tuition policies—the seventh such lawsuit.”

A Dec. 30 news release from the Justice Department announcing the lawsuit had stated: “These laws unconstitutionally discriminate against U.S. citizens who are not afforded the same reduced tuition rates, scholarships, or subsidies, create incentives for illegal immigration, and reward illegal immigrants with benefits that U.S. citizens are not eligible for, all in direct conflict with federal law.”

A Jan. 1 social media post by Miyares echoed that notion.

“It is clear that the Northam-era statute on in-state tuition eligibility is preempted by federal law,” he posted on X. “Illegal immigrants cannot be given benefits that are not available to American citizens. Rewarding non-citizens with the privilege of in-state tuition is wrong and only further incentivizes illegal immigration. I have always said I will call balls and strikes, and I am proud to play a part in ending this unlawful program.”

According to Axios, the Virginia lawsuit represented the “latest example of the DOJ’s push to limit states from offering tuition benefits to undocumented immigrants, without which higher education could be inaccessible to the nation’s estimated 850,000 undocumented minors.”

Reuters reported that under President Donald Trump, the Justice Department has also “filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.”

“Texas and Oklahoma, both led by Republican governors, quickly settled by agreeing to consent decrees blocking enforcement of their state laws.”

Similarly, Virginia followed suit, prompting an appeal, WRIC reported: “In a Dec. 31 joint press release, the Legal Aid Justice Center, the ACLU of Virginia and the Dream Project announced that they had filed an emergency motion to intervene in a federal lawsuit that took aim at both undocumented and refugee students in Virginia.”

“The Attorney General of Virginia has abandoned his duties to defend Virginia law and the people of the Commonwealth, so we must,” said ACLU-VA Senior Immigrants’ Rights Attorney Sophia Gregg in the release. “Attorney General Jason Miyares has sided with the Department of Justice — intentionally working in secrecy and over a holiday weekend — to manufacture a predetermined outcome to deprive Virginian students of not only their futures but their day in court.”",https://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lawsuit.kanchanachitkhamma72.png,N,,2026-01-05 04:56:51.140279

Andy Kim denounced the U.S. military’s surprise weekend raid on Venezuela as illegal, pledging to move quickly when Congress reconvenes this week to check President Donald Trump’s power to start wars.

Hours after approving an operation to seize Venezuela’s autocratic leader Nicolás Maduro, Trump said Saturday the U.S. would seize oil deposits in the South American country and “run” the nation for an unspecified period. “We are going to run the country for some time,” Trump said, adding that he was not afraid of “boots on the ground.”

Confusion continued as to who is running Venezuela after Trump’s declaration. Secretary of State Marco Rubio contradicted Trump on Sunday, saying the U.S. would not assume daily responsibility for governing Venezuela and instead force an “oil quarantine” to press for changes in the oil-rich nation.

Foreign heads of state denounced the attack — a roughly two-and-a-half-hour operation, according to U.S. military officials — that jolted the Venezuelan capital city of Caracas and killed dozens, while legal experts said it broke international law.

Congressional Democrats including Kim, a Democrat who held national security posts in the Obama administration, publicly fumed that Congress had not been briefed before the attack.

Asked why Congress was not briefed, as is required for significant military operations, Trump said: “Congress has a tendency to leak.”

The dark-of-night operation marks the most aggressive use of military force against Venezuela since the Trump administration mounted a campaign to topple the Maduro government last year. It also drew immediate comparisons with other U.S. military campaigns to overthrow overseas governments or invade foreign nations, including Panama in 1989, Kuwait in 1990 and Iraq in 2003.

For months, Trump has been threatening regime change in Venezuela and military forces have been conducting missile strikes on suspected drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean.

Before Congress broke for the holidays, Congress passed legislation that became law to limit the president’s legal authority to attack other countries. In a significant shift, the law repealed two legal justifications presidents have used top deploy troops for decades — officially called “authorizations for the use of military force,” or AUMFs.

Though Congress passed that legislation, further efforts to limit presidential war powers in Washington, where Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, face a rocky future as Republican allies continue to back Trump.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats from New York, demanded briefings this week. Republicans largely lauded Maduro’s capture. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, called the operation “decisive and justified,” and said the Trump administration was “working to schedule briefings for members as Congress returns to Washington.”

Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said he will force a vote this week to block further military actions against Venezuela absent congressional approval.

Kaine tried to muster support for his resolution without success last year. Kaine’s measure and other efforts to limit Trump’s military options, would need to clear both chambers of Congress, and Trump would have to sign them, to enter into law.

“We’ve entered the 250th year of American democracy and cannot allow it to devolve into the tyranny that our founders fought to escape,” Kaine said.

Almost all Democrats and a few Republicans are expected to vote for his resolution.

A deepening entrenchment of the U.S. military abroad threatens to splinter wings of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, where many diehard Trump-supporting lawmakers prefer an isolationist approach to foreign policy over a hawkish stance more traditional with Republicans.

“This is the same Washington playbook that we are so sick and tired of that doesn’t serve the American people, but actually serves the big corporations, the banks and the oil executives,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said on Sunday in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Greene, a devotee of the “America First” brand of politics that favors withdrawal from the global stage, is retiring from Congress this month after breaking with Trump over publication of government files about the deceased sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump himself has criticized U.S. lethal intervention in foreign lands. At a 2016 Republican presidential debate he described the Iraq war that the U.S. began in 2003 as a “big, fat mistake.”

Speaking on Fox News on the weekend, Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmed and defended the decision the administration made not to brief lawmakers. “That’s probably one reason it didn’t leak over these four days as they were waiting for the right weather,” Cotton said.

In posts online, Kim said Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “blatantly” lied to Congress during recent briefings about the Trump administration’s goals in Venezuela, which they said did not amount to regime change.

The action to seize Maduro was “disastrous,” Kim said. “Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war,” he wrote.

“President Trump ran on an America First platform that opposed regime change wars, yet this operation shows a clear shift from that position,” Rep. Donald Norcross (D-1st), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “Even more concerning, Congress was not informed beforehand, which is a clear violation of our Constitution.”

After American warplanes early Saturday bombed Caracas, U.S. forces abducted Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and transported them to New York, where the Trump administration is pursuing criminal charges against the pair.

In its indictment, the Justice Department accused Maduro of leading a “corrupt, illegitimate government” powered through a broad drug-running network that inundated the U.S. with tons of cocaine.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), a steady Trump ally who has criticized U.S. military involvement abroad, said Maduro “helped fuel the poison drug trade that’s killing Americans and destroying families.”

“America has a responsibility to stop this poison at the source before more Americans are murdered,” Van Drew said.

Maduro is being held in Brooklyn at a prison opened in the 1990s called the Metropolitan Detention Center, or MDC. He faces federal drug and weapons charges in the Southern District of New York, a jurisdiction known for high-profile criminal prosecutions, along with his wife, son and three other individuals.

In a joint statement, Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay rejected the attack of Venezuela as a threat to stability in the region. “These actions constitute a dangerous precedent for peace, regional security and pose a risk to the civil population,” the joint statement added.

On Sunday, 26 members of the European Union urged restraint from all sides.

Bay Area congressional representatives on Saturday denounced the United States’ military action against Venezuela by the administration of President Donald Trump overnight Friday, calling it in turns “illegal” and “unconstitutional”.

Trump announced Saturday that the U.S. military struck Venezuela and a ground force entered the country and took Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and his wife into custody on what Trump said were drug trafficking-related indictments from the U.S. Department of Justice dating back to 2020.

He said the United States and a group of unnamed oil companies would run the country until a leader reliably sympathetic to U.S. interests could be installed and said military occupation was a possibility, without offering specifics. Trump said Venezuela’s vice president was leading the country in the meantime and was taking direction from the U.S.

Protests were planned around the region Saturday by antiwar groups including the Answer Coalition and Sonoma County Veterans for Peace. Events were planned in San Francisco, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and other cities to voice objection to the action, which was called a “dangerous precedent” by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

U.S. Rep. John Garamendi (D-Fairfield) said the attack raised two questions, including what constitutional authority the president used to justify the action, and what the administration’s plan was after forcibly removing Venezuela’s leader.

“Last night, in direct violation of the United States Constitution, President Trump illegally attacked Venezuela’s capital and seized Nicolas Maduro,” Garamendi said in a statement.

He said Congress must assert its authority to restrict such unilateral military action by the executive branch.

Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) called Maduro an “illegitimate leader” but questioned the Trump administration’s reliance on allegations of drug trafficking as a justification of force and said the administration had not proven Maduro represented an urgent threat to the United States.

“If the President grounds his actions on the basis of drug trafficking charges, it is entirely hypocritical in light of his recent pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez who was responsible for bringing more than 400 tons of cocaine in the United States in order to ‘shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos,'” Pelosi said in a statement.

“The Administration says Maduro will be tried for drug trafficking in a U.S. court – but Hernandez was convicted of the same crimes by an American jury and Trump pardoned him,” she said.

U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Livermore) similarly said in a press conference Saturday that Maduro was an illegitimate leader, but said that the administration’s actions were unconstitutional.

Maduro has been accused by the International Criminal Court of crimes against humanity and political repression starting in 2014, and of remaining in power despite allegedly losing an election in 2024, according to Human Rights Watch and the Carter Center, a U.S.-based non-profit organization that monitors elections.

An arrest warrant was issued in 2024 for Maduro in Argentina, using any country’s ability to bring human rights charges under a principle called “Universal Jurisdiction”. But Trump did not cite international law in the U.S. operation and Guterres said the action threatened international law.

“He’s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected,” said Guterres’ spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.

The U.N. said the action had been denounced by Venezuela’s government and that casualty figures from the operation, which involved military strikes, were unclear as of Saturday afternoon. Trump said there were no U.S. casualties.

Swalwell said nobody wanted to see Maduro in charge of Venezuela but said Trump’s unilateral military actions had been taken without legal congressional authority.

“What this president has done, in the shortcuts that he has taken, is he’s going to, one shortcut at a time, put us in a fascist cul-de-sac. That’s where he’d taken us, that’s the objection. It’s not a process objection; it’s an objection for acting in such a fascistic way,” he said.

Swalwell would not rule out funding an occupation of Venezuela, saying that too much was unknown, including how long any troop deployments would last and what they could cost. But he said the president had put Congress in a “tough position” and the Democratic caucus would meet soon to try to determine its stance.

Swalwell, the Dublin native who is running for governor of California, did not rule out impeachment actions when asked and said all options were on the table.

U.S. Rep. Lateefah Simon (D-Oakland) said the president had started an illegal war.

“The President launched a war last night without the consent of Congress. That is unconstitutional and illegal,” Simon said in a statement.

She cited other past U.S. military actions in South and Central America and said Trump’s repeated mentioning of oil as the motivation for the coup disproved the administration’s claim that Maduro’s removal was about narcotics trafficking.

“This administration tells Americans there is no money for housing. No money for health care. No money to feed hungry children. But there is always money for war,” Simon said. “Congress must reassert its Constitutional power to declare war and reign in this Administration. We must use every tool to hold this President accountable and to defend the principle that in the U.S., we do not let one man choose war.”

Mario Guevara spent over 20 years covering the Latino community in Metro Atlanta. Last summer, he was arrested by Doraville police at a ""No Kings"" rally in DeKalb County and later turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE.

Guevara spent more than 100 days in ICE custody before being deported to El Salvador.

Now, three months later, he says he is still receiving tips and questions from people across Metro Atlanta.

""Every day I receive tips from the community,"" Guevara said. ""When people contact me, they want to know what is going on in their area.""

Proposed detention facility raises concerns

One of the biggest questions right now centers on Social Circle, a small city of about 5,000 people located roughly 45 miles east of Atlanta.

Local leaders say they were surprised after The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration is considering turning large warehouses in several cities into holding centers for detained immigrants.

The draft proposal reportedly includes facilities that could hold between 5,000 and 10,000 people each.

City leaders say they were not contacted

David Keener said the city did not receive any notice from the federal government before the report came out.

""We do not have the water and sewer capacity,"" Keener said. ""That's probably the biggest reason. And most people in town are opposed to this facility locating here.""

City officials say only one building in Social Circle might even be large enough to handle something like this.

What power do cities have?

Eric Taylor said the city is now trying to figure out what legal options it has.

""The city is actively trying to figure out what authority we have,"" Taylor said. ""Unfortunately, the U.S. Constitution has a supremacy clause, which means the federal government is often not subject to city or state laws.""

CBS News Atlanta reached out to ICE for comment but has not yet received a response.

Guevara speaks from experience

Guevara says the community's biggest concern should be how long people would be held inside and what conditions would be like.

""Nobody in jail expects a five-star hotel,"" he said. ""But the food and conditions need to be tolerable.""

He says he saw those conditions firsthand during the more than 100 days he was detained in Georgia.

The big picture: Asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" if Venezuelans should remain in the U.S. given the instability, Noem argued that Venezuela is ""more free today than it was yesterday"" and insisted TPS holders can apply for refugee status instead.

""We need to make sure that our programs actually mean something and that we're following the law,"" Noem said when pressed about forced returns during political upheaval.

The backdrop: The Trump administration terminated TPS for Venezuelans earlier this year. The Supreme Court allowed the termination to proceed while litigation continues.

President Trump also halted asylum applications from 19 countries, including Venezuela, after a shooting incident in D.C.

Newly elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins called the TPS termination ""reckless, dangerous and wrong"" on Saturday, urging Trump to reinstate the program.

MENDOCINO, CA — The first rapid response network and watch hotline for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Mendocino County has launched with the help of several local volunteers.

Anyone who sees ICE agents in the area can call (707) 621-8220 to report sightings to the Mendocino County Rapid Response Network, which has volunteers trained and ready to quickly identify, verify, and inform the community if ICE is conducting raids or detaining immigrants locally.

The network also works to dispel false rumors of ICE sightings, share verified information with local news outlets, and post updates about ICE activity on social media. The network officially launched in early December, but the group has been recruiting volunteers and organizing trainings since the spring of 2025.

Rapid response networks are volunteer-led community organizations that monitor ICE activity and support immigrant communities. These networks largely came to prominence during President Donald Trump's first term, following his administration's increased targeting and removal of immigrants lacking permanent legal status.

According to a press release from the Mendocino County network, ""An important part of the network is the sharing of community education so people know their rights and how to protect themselves.""

Judy Abeja Hummel of Boonville, a volunteer and member of the network's steering committee, said in an interview that one of their goals is to support local immigrant neighbors and friends who are fearful of ICE raids.

""I hope that ICE does not come to this community, but if they do, I want us to be ready to stand up in solidarity with all of our neighbors. To me this isn't a question of immigration, this is a question of civil rights, human rights, and human decency,"" Hummel said. ""Many of my Latino neighbors have been afraid to leave the house, or they just go to work and come straight home. There have been many false alarms and rumors that keep re-traumatizing people. One important thing we offer is checking every rumor that comes along and verifying or debunking it as quickly as possible, so that people can go on living their lives.""

Hummel also said the network has trained 125 local volunteers to help monitor and verify ICE sightings. She said the steering committee has about six to eight people leading the group's efforts. The network is still looking for a local volunteer coordinator for the Round Valley region.

""We are divided into five regions -- Ukiah, Willits, Anderson Valley, North Coast, and South Coast, and each area has a local volunteer coordinator organizing, vetting, and bringing volunteers onboard,"" Hummel said.

The Mendocino County Rapid Response Network will also be hosting ""know your rights"" trainings in Spanish and English, has a program to support businesses in being prepared for immigration raids, and is developing a group of volunteers to accompany immigrants to their court hearings.

Perhaps the most ominous feature of Trump’s foray in Venezuela is that it took place less than a year into Trump’s term.","“The action against Venezuela is manifestly illegal under international law, and cannot plausibly or by any reasonable standard be characterized as a law enforcement action,” Philippe Sands, an expert on international law, told me in the wake of the military action.

“What now is the plan?” he continued. “One need only to think of Nicaragua, Afghanistan and Libya, amongst others, to imagine what the consequences might be, and the encouragement it will surely give to others to act with such brazen disregard for the international legal norms that bind us all.”

Trump, of course, is not the first U.S. president to sideline Congress on matters of war and peace. Stretching the bounds of executive authority on military action may be especially tempting as many lawmakers appear increasingly eager to shirk the responsibility of such decisions. But the latest episode appears unique compared to previous interventions; more on that below.

Meanwhile, the average American might be shocked by the turn of events, but no one in Washington can seriously claim to be surprised.

The Trump administration spent months openly flaunting lethal and illegal boat strikes against alleged drug traffickers and threatening to topple the Maduro regime. When even the boat strikes became impossible to defend under the law after the revelation in November about a “double tap” strike that killed survivors clinging to a boat, the administration stonewalled. Despite the apparently indefensible nature of that attack, Republicans in Congress eventually rallied around Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. There is a famous children’s book about what happens in these sorts of situations.

Trump declared in November that the airspace above and around Venezuela was closed, and weeks later he ordered a blockade of the country. Both of these actions were essentially acts of war — or, at a bare minimum, very clear statements of the administration’s intentions about what was coming.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration never made an honest and coherent case to the American public about what they were doing and why. Trump has repeatedly peddled the transparently ridiculous claim that each boat strike saved 25,000 American lives from drug overdoses. An emerging journalistic consensus now holds that administration officials coalesced around ousting Maduro based on three rationales — oil, drugs and immigration — but three different bad reasons to launch an illegal regime change war do not add up to one good one.

The idea that this reflects a serious effort to stymie drug trafficking was already rendered a farce by Trump’s decision last month to pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was serving a 45-year prison sentence after being convicted of trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into the U.S. — pretty much the exact same thing that Maduro is now accused of. You also cannot legally depose a sovereign nation’s leader because the country’s citizens are illegally immigrating to your country or because you want to seize their natural resources.

The Trump administration’s intellectual shell game should have been familiar to anyone who lived through the run-up to the Iraq war, when President George W. Bush’s administration offered up shifting and factually unsupported claims in the months before they took the country into war. That war is now widely understood as a historic mistake — something that Trump himself used to get elected in 2016 — but this obvious parallel appears to have eluded many in recent months.

What happens next on the ground in Venezuela is anyone’s guess at this point, but it is also a logical consequence of our current political situation — one in which Congress and the Supreme Court have largely let Trump have his way since returning to office. There is, however, nothing permanent about this arrangement, and the public has the power to change it.

Already, there have been efforts by administration defenders to draw legal comparisons between Trump’s actions in Venezuela to those of other presidents in different contexts. The comparisons are premature at best and facile at worst.

“This pushes precedents very far, but we don’t know just how far yet, because so many facts and plans are unclear,” Matthew Waxman, a Columbia Law School professor and former George W. Bush Administration official, told me.

“All modern presidents have claimed broad power to use substantial military force without congressional authorization,” he continued. “Some of those contemplated regime change. One might call any of these violations of Congress’ prerogatives, but because these questions don’t get litigated in court, it falls to Congress to defend its own powers.”

The supposed precedents include Trump’s first-term strike against Qasam Soleimani, Barack Obama’s NATO-led bombing campaign in Libya, Bill Clinton’s participation in the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia and George H.W. Bush’s arrest and prosecution of the onetime Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.

There are obvious factual distinctions. Soleimani was a senior military leader in Iran but not the head of state, and Trump did not decide that we would “run” the country afterward. Obama and Clinton each had the support of a robust international coalition and a legitimate humanitarian rationale for their decisions. (Obama, in any event, has said that his worst mistake in office was “failing to plan for the day after” the Libya intervention.)

Bush’s invasion of Panama in 1989 and arrest of Noriega appears most on point, but in that case the U.S. facilitated the swift installation of an opposition leader who had won a presidential election. Waxman acknowledged that the episode provided “some parallels and precedent” as a legal matter, but he noted that even “that operation strained constitutional and international law.” On top of that, “if this really does turn into a protracted occupation of Venezuela, it could far exceed the Panama case in terms of presidential unilateralism,” Waxman said.

Sometimes, however, a fine-grained legal analysis can obscure just as much as it illuminates.

Even if there were no distinctions between Trump’s actions in Venezuela and those earlier military campaigns, what would that prove? Many Americans were not even alive when some of those events happened, and all of those actions — by Trump, Obama and the first Bush — appear to have been illegal under U.S. law, international law or both.

What many people are really talking about when they invoke these comparisons is whether as a matter of policy, those interventions were as good or as bad as what Trump just did — not whether they were lawful. That is a different and legitimate discussion, but it is not one that legally vindicates the Trump administration.

We should have seen something like this coming — Congress, the press corps and the rest of official Washington.

Trump has spent the last year running roughshod over the American public’s representatives in Congress, with the Republican majority happy to play ball. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a prominent anti-interventionist Republican, underscored this approach after the strikes on Venezuela — raising concerns with the move’s constitutionality only to back off two hours later.

Democrats, for their part, have been focused in recent months on releasing millions of pages of unvetted information from the Justice Department’s criminal investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein. In the process, they have generated even more conspiracy theories that will probably exist in perpetuity, and they have positioned the party behind the irresponsible and thus-far unsupported claim that there is a large “Epstein class” of rich and powerful criminals who will be decisively taken down once the public scours through everything that the Justice Department missed or intentionally covered up under both the Trump and Biden administrations.

This is not to equate the Democrats’ actions with the Republican Party’s institutional backing of the Trump administration, but if these are the adults in the room, I would hate to see the children.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court justices — the six Republican appointees, more specifically —bear considerable responsibility for Trump’s actions and the chaotic state of American politics today.

Trump likely would not have been reelected without their intervention during the 2024 campaign had the court not rewritten the Constitution to grant him sweeping criminal immunity and effectively shut down the Justice Department’s prosecution over Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election results.

The decision — which immunizes Trump from future prosecution for pretty much anything that he can plausibly structure or describe as an “official act” of the presidency — has clearly emboldened Trump in his second term. How could it not?

On top of that, the Republican appointees on the court have facilitated Trump’s executive overreach and power grabs for most of the last year. The court has only recently started to put up the most basic effort to maintain some democratic guard rails. Last week, they finally brushed back Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in major U.S. cities run by Democrats after nearly a year of needless chaos and uncertainty. The justices also appear poised to invalidate Trump’s “emergency tariffs” after wasting several months taking up the dispute in the first place — and after a year of Trump antagonizing U.S. allies and adversaries alike and destabilizing the U.S. and global economies in the process.

Perhaps the most ominous feature of Trump’s foray in Venezuela is that it took place less than a year into Trump’s term. There are three more years to go and countless opportunities for more international interventions that are illegal, unwise or both.

Are there any checks that can be put on Trump? There is nothing the public can do about the Supreme Court (at least in the very short term), and American voters may have to overcome even more legal obstacles from the Republican appointees on the Supreme Court before the midterm elections. But the public will have an opportunity to change the composition of Congress in November, and it is possible that fact will weigh on GOP lawmakers even before then.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc0%2Fd4%2F0fed193240479ba829c2105153bf%2Ftrump-us-venezuela-27916.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 18:12:24.951333

U.S. VENEZUELA ATTACK CASUALTY COUNT: At least 40 people were killed in the U.S. attack on Venezuela, according to New York Times, citing a Venezuela official.","Warning: This article contains details that may be disturbing for some readers.

Nestled near the mountains, far from any settlement, stands a prison ostensibly made for the most dangerous terrorists and criminals.

Some consider the El Salvadorian institution one of the strictest prisons in the world.

“Welcome to hell,” said the prison director to over 200 newcomers. “You will leave it only dead.”

Andry Omar Blanco Bonilla, from Valencia, Venezuela, had seen videos about this place on YouTube.

Now, he asked himself: what has gone wrong in his life for him to end up here?

Andry was among 252 Venezuelans who were sent by Trump’s order to the maximum-security prison in El Salvador, known as the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.

They were accused of being members of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua, though no one provided any evidence. People with no criminal record, who were fleeing poverty, ended up confined in inhumane conditions alongside 40,000 dangerous criminals.

At the prison, they were tortured and abused, including sexually, according to Human Rights Watch. One detainee was allegedly forced to have oral sex with one of the prison’s guards, while the others were called homophobic slurs.

The event formed the basis for hostile ties between the U.S and Venezuela, which culminated Saturday with the American bombing of Caracas.

It was a sign that Trump’s ambitions are to enforce a ‘might-makes-right’ philosophy in the Western hemisphere – where migration itself is treated as a crime and a military intervention to any country is justified.

For Andry, making ends meet in Venezuela was almost impossible.

Still, his growing up there had some brightness. His youth was filled with the loud sounds of motorcycle engines. It was a passion that led to him meeting his partner, Susana, at a motorcycle exhibition.

“We dated for a couple of months, getting to know each other. Over the years, our feelings grew stronger. What caught my attention most about her? Her gaze, her smile, her laugh,” Andry said.

Just 20 years ago, Venezuela was a promising country because it held the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Today, it is associated with economic crises, hyperinflation, repression, and a humanitarian catastrophe. The situation worsened after the political crisis in 2019, when Nicolás Maduro usurped power following rigged elections.

So Andry found himself at the U.S. border at the end of 2023. He did not have a work permit, so he immediately surrendered to border authorities and filed for asylum, hoping to be able to work in the U.S. legally.

After a month, Andry visited the immigration center to update his address. Fortune was not on his side.

“Do you have any tattoos on your body that are not visible?” the officer asked while processing his address change.

“Yes,” Andry replied as his chest, back, and leg were partially covered with ink. He explained the personal meaning of each. The drawing of a clock showed the time of his mother’s birth.

The officer was unsatisfied.

“The officer practically wanted to force me to affirm something that was totally a lie, to say I belonged to a gang,” Andry recalled. “He just said, ‘You’re detained.’”

Among Venezuelans, tattoos have sometimes been associated with the transnational criminal organization Tren de Aragua, which is involved in drug, weapons, and human trafficking.

The supposed fight against this organization became a focus of Trump’s second term. In February, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization. From that point on, the United States attacked Venezuelan infrastructure and conducted military operations – culminating in Saturday’s capture of Maduro.

More than one hundred Venezuelans have already been killed in boat strikes, even though the Trump administration has so far failed to provide evidence that these boats belonged to cartels or were carrying drugs.

A similar thing can be said of Andry: there was no evidence of his involvement in a criminal gang — other than the government’s interpretation of his tattoos.

The U.S. detained Andry for five months, labeling him as a “danger to society.”

“I’ve been a person with an impeccable record. I’ve never been detained, never been imprisoned, never had a legal problem in the U.S., not even a traffic ticket the whole time I was there,” he said.

Venezuela and the United States have severed diplomatic relations. When it became clear that deportation directly to his home country was impossible, the court released him on bail for several months.

Andry bought himself a plane ticket to return home to Venezuela in April 2025. He did not want to wait for ICE to come and deport him. But in February 2025, they acted first.

He was told to appear at an ICE office the next day to update his data. It was a ruse. When he showed up, he was detained. They put handcuffs on Andry, “violently, like a criminal,” he recalled.

When Andry said that he already had a ticket to Venezuela and could exchange it to the nearest date, the officer responded: “You should have left when you could.”

What followed was a nightmare most of us can barely imagine. After another month of detention with no clarity on his future, he thought he was returning home.

Andry boarded a military plane and was told not to raise the window shades.

When the plane landed, instead of being back home in Venezuela, he saw the El Salvador flag. He was pulled off a bus in front of a massive fortress-like building surrounded by electric fences and dozens of watchtowers.

Trump had sent him, along with other Venezuelans, to El Salvador by invoking an 18th-century military law that allowed the deportation of people without judicial review.

“They told that we were ‘welcome’ to the CECOT, what they now call the concrete hell,” recalled Andry.

The only option was to resign himself to a suffocating cell, a bed without a mattress, and white prison clothing. He had no way to contact either his family or a lawyer. There were days that he did not know if there would be a tomorrow, due to severe hypertension and a lack of adequate medical care.

“I was being beaten, treated verbally and physically very badly. I questioned myself a lot about why I was there,” Andry said.

Inside the cells, detainees had no access to proper hygiene: each cell had only two sinks and two toilets, without any partitions. The lights in the cell were not turned off at night. The food was always the same and had to be eaten by hand.

According to Human Rights Watch, the guards took the detainees from the cells every day to search them. The deportees were forced to kneel and were beaten with kicks and fists, as well as batons.

There were ten people in their tiny cell, which was designed for 80. They were already losing their minds, but perversely prison staff told them to be grateful. Other cells like theirs held 150–200 people, they’d say.

From his first day in El Salvador, Andry felt like he had been kidnapped. Deprived of any human rights, he was trapped in a cell as if he were a dangerous criminal. However, the most difficult for him was not knowing what was happening to his family, if they even were aware he was detained in a prison for terrorists. He tried to support himself day by day by talking to his companions in the cell and recalling warm-hearted moments about his youth and family.

At CECOT, prisoners are not allowed to do any activities outside of their cells besides half an hour of physical exercise in handcuffs. During the remaining 23 and a half hours, they are left with only two Bibles per cell. That was the only thing that saved Andry, who had felt distant from God until he found himself in hell.

“All our time there passed in uncertainty, not knowing when we would have the opportunity to see light again. We were detained inside the cell every single day. They never took us out to get sun or fresh air,” Andry recalled.

His freedom was to come unexpectedly in the early morning hours of July 18, 2025, at approximately 1:30 a.m.

Andry was already sleeping because of his curfew, which required him to be in bed by 9 p.m. each night. The prison director entered, together with other officers, who were banging on the cell bars and saying to get up, bathe, and dress.

“You’re returning to your country, your hell is over,” Andry heard from the CECOT director.

They were traded for Venezuelan political prisoners and ten American detainees who were held in the country. Andry reunited with his family in Venezuela, and is now back home in Valencia.

But his arrival in Venezuela now coincides with the next stage of escalation, when the U.S. has attacked his country directly.

“There’s a bit of fear about what could happen. There’s no war or intervention where there hasn’t been some loss of human life,” he said.

At least 40 people died, including civilians, as a result of yesterday’s American attack on Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. Besides striking military infrastructure the U.S. also hit a three-story residential complex in a coastal area of the city.

Andry is currently safe with his family, but a period of political instability looms. The United States – the country which sent him to a prison hell – is now claiming that they will “run” Venezuela for the foreseeable future.

Competing claims for power in Venezuela could lead to civil war, prolonged conflict, or an even worse situation than he was trying to escape years ago.

«[The war is not] what I.. want for my country either. It would destabilize the country much more than it’s already destabilized today,” he said.

NEWS OF THE DAY:

By Oksana Stepura

Good morning to readers; Kyiv remains in Ukrainian hands.

NUMBER OF WOMEN IN ARMY SURGES: The share of female officers in the Ukrainian army has jumped from 4% to 21% over the past 2 years, Oksana Hryhorieva, the Ukrainian army’s gender adviser, told Hromadske Radio.

While women in the army have become captains and majors, due to a lack of training no woman in the army has risen to the rank of combat general.

NO STRIKE RESTRICTIONS, NO NEW WEAPONS: Following a meeting with foreign security advisers, Zelenskyy said that allies are no longer imposing restrictions on strikes inside Russia, but are instead withholding certain types of weapons from Ukraine to prevent these strikes.

Zelenskyy noted that Ukraine is currently in a phase of “use what we have”, while the equipment that partners don’t want to be used by Ukraine isn’t being delivered.

U.S. VENEZUELA ATTACK CASUALTY COUNT: At least 40 people were killed in the U.S. attack on Venezuela, according to New York Times, citing a Venezuela official. There were no U.S. casualties but about six American troops were injured during the operation which captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

The NYT’s sources in the U.S. government said that Maduro rejected an American proposal that would have allowed him to flee to Turkey. This was allegedly offered as a counter-proposal after Maduro offered the U.S. access to his country’s oil, in an attempt to prevent an American raid.

VENZUELA’S DIRTY, EXPENSIVE OIL: The infrastructure needed for peak oil production in Venezuela would cost $100 billion and take about ten years, The Washington Post reported. The challenge comes with ensuring sufficient security and stability to make such long term investments worthwhile and profitable.

The oil in the country is also a form of heavy crude which is more difficult to process and refining the oil requires more carbon emissions than other types of oil. There are also concerns about the resilience of Venezuela’s energy grid, as oil production is extremely energy-intensive.

Mr. Himes said he had spoken with Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, who had also received no phone call from the administration.

“I’m a member of the Gang of Eight, and I have yet to get a phone call from anybody in the administration,” Representative Jim Himes, the Connecticut Democrat who serves as the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday on CNN. The Gang of Eight refers to the Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, as well as the chairs and ranking minority members of each chamber’s intelligence committees. Together, the group is typically briefed on classified matters.

Mr. Himes said he had spoken with Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, who had also received no phone call from the administration.

In the wake of President Trump’s announcement on Saturday of the attack on Venezuela and the extraction of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, Mr. Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat who is the Senate minority leader, called for the administration to immediately brief Congress. They asked for the administration’s plan “to prevent a humanitarian and geopolitical disaster that plunges us into another endless war or one that trades one corrupt dictator for another.”

But on Sunday, the leaders said they were still in the dark. Senator Schumer appeared on ABC’s “This Week” to outline the questions he still had about the operation.

“How long do they intend to be there?” he said. “How many troops do we need? How much is it going to cost, what are the boundaries?”

Mr. Jeffries, speaking on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” said he did not trust Mr. Trump to run one country, much less two. “Donald Trump claims that he’s going to run Venezuela,” he said. “He’s done a terrible job running the United States of America.” And he added that Democrats would prioritize taking legislative action to rein in Mr. Trump when Congress returned to Washington this week, “to ensure that no further military steps occur absent explicit congressional approval.”

During a news conference in Palm Beach, Fla., on Saturday to announce the attack on Venezuela, Mr. Trump said he had circumvented Congress because he did not trust its members to keep his plans confidential.

“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Mr. Trump said.

Maxwell Frost says the potential for chaos in Venezuela means President Donald Trump’s administration must fully brief Congress on Nicolás Maduro’s arrest.
Indeed, he said it should have happened before military forces entered Venezuela and deposed Maduro.
Frost noted that the same administration revoked temporary protected status for Venezuelans in the U.S. while also taking military action to remove the regime.
Most international observers believe opposition leader Edmundo González rightfully won a 2024 election against Maduro, including Frost.
But I’m wary of the United States making decisions on behalf of Venezuelans,” Frost said.","U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost says the potential for chaos in Venezuela means President Donald Trump’s administration must fully brief Congress on Nicolás Maduro’s arrest.

The Orlando Democrat said that with no leadership in a major South American nation, informing Congress of future actions can’t wait. Indeed, he said it should have happened before military forces entered Venezuela and deposed Maduro.

“No. 1, as per the law, at least the Armed Services committee should be informed about these things before they happen,” he said. “The President says, ‘Well, Congress leaks.’ Well, the law doesn’t say it’s up to discretion like that.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio at a press conference cited concerns about the timeliness of the military operation in bypassing notification.

“We called members of Congress immediately after,” Rubio said. “This was not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on. It was a trigger-based mission in which conditions had to be met night after night. We watched and monitored that for a number of days. So it’s just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, ‘Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days.’”

But Frost said the announced plans to only brief most of Congress over the next week ignores the continuing threat of chaos on the horizon. He pointed to developments over a matter of hours on Saturday.

The U.S. arrested Maduro overnight. In a morning press conference, Trump said the administration had conversations with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s Vice President. Trump said Rodríguez told Rubio she was “essentially willing to do what we think is necessary.” But within hours, Rodríguez told state media the government would demand Maduro’s immediate release and promised that her nation would not “surrender” to the U.S.

Frost also pointed to statements from Trump that the U.S. was prepared for a “second wave if we needed to do so,” indicating potential for further military action.

“I don’t know what is going to happen,” Frost said. “We don’t know what else the President has planned.”

Frost suggested that political concerns for the President, such as his poor approval ratings and the ongoing release of files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, prompted the military action more than any concern for the well-being of Venezuelans. Frost noted that the same administration revoked temporary protected status for Venezuelans in the U.S. while also taking military action to remove the regime.

But Frost, like other Florida Democrats, stressed that he holds no sympathy for Maduro. Nearly half of all Venezuelans living in the U.S. live in Florida, a number that rose sharply in 2010, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

“Nicolás Maduro is a brutal dictator, who spent a decade killing, disappearing and jailing his people. On a personal note, my Mom is a refugee from Cuba who was escaping political oppression,” Frost said.

“But a lot of things can be true at once. There are a lot of people in the Venezuelan diaspora celebrating today, and the reason there is a diaspora is that there is a brutal dictatorship in Venezuela.”

He felt distressed when Trump said five times in his press conference Saturday that the U.S. will now run the nation, rather than laying out any plan for selecting new leadership in Venezuela.

Most international observers believe opposition leader Edmundo González rightfully won a 2024 election against Maduro, including Frost. Frost stopped shy of endorsing elevating Gonzalez to power, a course promoted by others like U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, but he didn’t dismiss the approach.

“I will say, of course, I think he (González) won that election and Maduro stole the election, so that makes some sense. But I also think there is something to be said about a new election being done. But I’m wary of the United States making decisions on behalf of Venezuelans,” Frost said.

“If history tells us anything about our country getting involved in Latin America, it’s not a pretty picture.”",https://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Congress_Frost_60965-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 18:12:29.495507

The Biden administration and the second Trump administration have recognized Mr. González’s victory.
She has spent the last year courting Mr. Trump’s support and trying to enlist his help in ousting Mr. Maduro.","Publicly, Ms. Rodríguez and the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, have said the government that was in place under Mr. Maduro is still in charge. In a fiery speech broadcast Sunday on state television, Mr. Padrino López channeled decades of Venezuelan nationalism and said that the country’s armed forces would “continue to employ all its available capabilities for military defense, the maintenance of internal order and the preservation of peace.”

“Our sovereignty has been violated and breached,” he said, backed by uniformed soldiers. Mr. Padrino López said that U.S. forces had killed a “large part” of Mr. Maduro’s security detail in the raid that apprehended him, part of a death toll of soldiers and civilians that rose to 80 on Sunday.

Mr. Maduro is in a Brooklyn jail with his wife, who were both indicted on federal drug trafficking and weapons charges. They are expected to make their initial appearances in federal court on Monday.

In a series of television appearances on Sunday, the U.S. secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said that the U.S. military would maintain a “quarantine” around Venezuela to prevent the entry and exit of oil tankers under American sanctions.

But though President Trump has said the United States intends to “run” Venezuela and reclaim American oil interests after ousting Mr. Maduro, Pentagon officials said that there were currently no U.S. military personnel in the country.

In an interview with CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” Mr. Rubio said that the large U.S. naval force amassed in the Caribbean Sea off Venezuela will remain “until we see changes, not just to further the national interest of the United States, which is No. 1, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.”

Trump administration officials indicated that the large U.S. military force, which includes 15,000 troops as well as aircraft and warships, was a signal to the Venezuelan authorities that they must act more favorably toward the United States or risk what Mr. Trump called a “second wave” of attacks.

Here’s what else to know:

Oil reserves: Mr. Rubio focused on Sunday, as Mr. Trump did a day earlier, on the opportunities for American companies in Venezuela’s oil sector, and on the need for Venezuelan officials to clamp down on drug trafficking. Mr. Trump made clear his desire to open up Venezuela’s vast state-controlled oil reserves to American oil companies, saying, “We are going to run the country right.” But U.S. intervention could prove complicated and expensive.

Drug charges: An indictment unsealed by a federal judge in New York City charged Mr. Maduro, his wife, Cilia Flores, and four others with four counts, including narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine and possession of machine guns. Despite the U.S. focus on cocaine trafficking, experts say Venezuela’s role in that trade is modest. Mr. Maduro was being held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, and he and Ms. Flores were expected to make their first appearance in Manhattan federal court soon. Read more ›

Protests and celebrations: Some people took to the streets of Chicago and Washington on Saturday to protest the U.S. military intervention. Venezuelan migrants in New York cheered Mr. Maduro’s removal from power. Read more ›

Nobel winner: Venezuela’s main opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, posted a statement asking that her political ally, Edmundo González, be recognized as Venezuela’s president immediately. Ms. Machado had sought in recent months to curry favor with Mr. Trump, but on Saturday he said she lacked the “respect” needed to govern Venezuela.

The images, filmed on cellphones by people in different cities, captured the exact moments in which an air and ground incursion — orchestrated by the Trump administration to remove Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, and establish a U.S.-led interim administration — played out in real time.

The New York Times was able to verify several videos shared either on social media or directly with reporters. The Times also interviewed residents who documented the attack and provided a firsthand account of a morning that has fundamentally reordered the region’s political landscape.

Helicopters flying over Caracas as explosions rock the Venezuelan capital early Saturday. Parts of this audio were muted by The New York Times because of the number of expletives heard.

The strikes took many people by surprise in Caracas, a city that was already exhausted by crises even as the United States had spent months amassing a massive naval and air presence in the Caribbean. The incursion also startled residents in La Guaira, a strategic port city an hour’s drive from the capital that served as a primary target during the operation.

It had started as a normal Friday night in Venezuela. Residents were hanging out at homes, bars and nightclubs when the operation began in the hours after midnight. But the night’s casual atmosphere soon turned to panic.

“Something is blowing up over there!” a woman cried with expletives while filming the scene outside a restaurant in Catia la Mar, a city in La Guaira state. “They’re invading us!” Venezuelan officials would later say that U.S. strikes targeted naval infrastructure and medical warehouses in the nearby port.

“They’re invading us!” a woman shouts as flare-like lights repeatedly cross the sky in La Guaira, a port city where U.S. strikes targeted naval infrastructure and medical warehouses.

The muffled explosions filling the air first confused Roison Figuera, 29, who said he thought they were part of the final episode of the Netflix show “Stranger Things” he was watching at home.

“And another one goes off,” he said, “and I say, ‘Well, no, this is not the television.’”

He went up to the roof of his house, which has a direct view of the Port of La Guaira. He saw another explosion erupt, so he took out his cellphone.

“At first, I thought a fuel truck or a ship had exploded,” Mr. Figuera, a local journalist and dancer, said. “But then I actually thought — half-joking — I asked myself, ‘Have the Marines arrived?’”

When he heard from colleagues that similar explosions were taking place in Caracas, he realized some kind of attack was taking place.

A local journalist, Roison Figuera, filmed the Port of La Guaira right after it had been struck. “Have the Marines arrived?” he asked himself.

Closer to the port, people driving a car captured the moment in which a strike hit the ground. “Another one is coming, there it comes!” a man said right before driving past a loud bang and a massive fireball. Another explosion is heard as the car rushes down the street.

Some of the destruction was filmed by residents as they made their way through a city under siege. The precision of the strikes was visible in the ruins of the port. Cellphone footage captured fires burning behind blue-fenced facilities with shipping containers.

On the streets outside, people were starting to clear the rubble in an attempt to restore traffic to the main coastal artery of La Guaira, which connects the port with the highway that climbs up to Caracas.

Chaos also ensued in Caracas after U.S. strikes hit Fort Tiuna, a fortified military base that houses, among other things, Venezuela’s Ministry of Defense. Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured at the defense compound.

Armando Polachini, who lives in a residential complex next to the fort, had been kept awake by neighbors throwing a loud party. But the music was abruptly eclipsed by the thunderous roar of an explosion. When moments later the power went out — part of a cyberoperation that cut power to large swaths of the capital to allow U.S. military aircraft to approach undetected — a thought grabbed him.

“The first thing that came to mind was these are the Americans,” said Mr. Polachini, 44, the manager of a clothing brand. “I grabbed my phone and the first thing I did was try to record what was happening.”

Chaos ensued on the roads in Caracas as crowds of people tried to flee the scene after a nearby military base was hit repeatedly during the raid.

Below his balcony, crowds rushed from their apartments and into the streets, fleeing either on foot, by car or on motorcycles. Mr. Polachini decided to stay put and calm his family, who began to panic.

“It was a pretty horrible situation,” he said. “I still have it playing over and over in my mind. Over and over. The sound of the missiles — the sound of them falling.”

Hours later, after dawn broke over the coast, Mr. Figuera went to film the aftermath in La Guaira. A massive plume of smoke loomed over the port. Other Venezuelans in the greater Caracas area and nearby northern coast emerged from their homes to find their communities transformed, lining up at the few open supermarkets to try to stock up on supplies: toilet paper, precooked corn flour and canned goods.

“There is an eerie silence here,” Mr. Figuera said. “I’m kind of in shock. I don’t feel anything. I’m just waiting to see what might happen.”

U.S. forces will continue to prevent oil tankers on a U.S. sanctions list from entering and leaving the country until the government opens up the state-controlled oil industry to foreign investment — presumably giving priority to American companies — and makes other changes, he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS News.

“That remains in place, and that’s a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes, not just to further the national interest of the United States, which is No. 1, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela,” he said.

And in a testy exchange later on “Meet the Press” on NBC News, Mr. Rubio complained that people were “fixating” on Mr. Trump’s declaration at a news conference in Florida on Saturday that the U.S. government would run Venezuela. He added that “it’s not running — it’s running policy, the policy with regards to this.”

Mr. Rubio said on CBS that the U.S. naval force that Mr. Trump massed in the Caribbean Sea near Venezuela over recent months — “one of the largest naval deployments in modern history, certainly in the Western Hemisphere” — would remain in place to enforce the quasi blockade, with the aim of “paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue.”

And he added that Mr. Trump could put U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela beyond the recent operation in which Army Delta Force soldiers seized Mr. Maduro, if it served American interests. The president “does not feel like he is going to publicly rule out options that are available for the United States,” Mr. Rubio said.

A White House official said Mr. Rubio had detailed in his interviews on Sunday what Mr. Trump had meant when he used the word “run,” and that there was no contradiction in their remarks. The officials said top Trump aides “will continue to diplomatically engage” with the current leadership in Venezuela.

Mr. Trump told The Atlantic on Sunday that if the current acting leader of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, a vice president under Mr. Maduro, “doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”

Mr. Rubio led an effort in the Trump administration to oust Mr. Maduro that was supported throughout the fall by Stephen Miller, the president’s homeland security adviser, and John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, The New York Times reported in September.

As Mr. Trump did in his news conference on Saturday, Mr. Rubio focused in his Sunday interviews on oil as the main prize for the United States in its operation against Mr. Maduro, the autocratic leader of the country who is now in detention with his wife, Cilia Flores, in Brooklyn. Mr. Trump said on Saturday that “we’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground.”

On Sunday, Mr. Rubio told CBS News that the oil industry in Venezuela, which is controlled by the government and under U.S. sanctions, needed to be “reinvested in.”

“It’s obvious they do not have the capability to bring up that industry again,” he said. “They need investment from private companies who are only going to invest under certain guarantees and conditions.”

Mr. Rubio’s and Mr. Trump’s remarks over the weekend suggested that the administration intended to force Ms. Rodríguez to allow American oil companies to invest and operate in the country under favorable conditions.

The statements by the two men amount to an explicit declaration of gunboat diplomacy and an embrace of the kind of 19th-century U.S. imperialist policy in the Western Hemisphere that has been widely criticized across Latin America.

For years, Chevron has been the only U.S. oil company operating in Venezuela, in several joint ventures with the state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., or PDVSA. The Biden and second Trump administrations gave Chevron a license to operate there as an exception to sanctions imposed on Venezuela’s oil industry by Mr. Trump in his first term. Other American companies had a large presence over decades in the Venezuelan industry, but left the country during two periods when the government exerted state control over the ventures.

U.S. forces boarded two oil tankers last month that were transporting oil from Venezuela to Asia. The first one, the Skipper, was on a Treasury Department sanctions list for transporting Iranian oil, and a federal court had granted the Justice Department a warrant to seize the tanker based on that history. The second one, the Centuries, was not on the department’s sanctions list.

For days, the U.S. Coast Guard has been pursuing another tanker on the sanctions list, the Bella 1, which had been going to Venezuela to pick up oil. That tanker changed its flag to that of Russia and renamed itself the Marinera during the trans-Atlantic pursuit, and the Russian Foreign Ministry told the U.S. government formally on Dec. 31 to stop chasing the tanker.

The Trump administration has said all weekend that it hopes to work with Ms. Rodríguez, and Mr. Rubio deflected questions on Sunday about why it was not supporting any leadership bid by Venezuela’s main opposition figures.

He was in contact throughout last year with figures in the opposition movement. And as a senator from Florida, he signed a formal letter of support for María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader, to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. She was awarded that prize last year, which frustrated Mr. Trump, who had been openly campaigning to win it himself.

On Saturday, Mr. Trump said in his news conference that Ms. Machado lacked the “respect” within Venezuela to govern, even though international election experts say a candidate she supported, Edmundo González, beat Mr. Maduro in a 2024 election by a wide margin. The Biden administration and the second Trump administration have recognized Mr. González’s victory.

In January 2025, right after starting his new job, Mr. Rubio spoke with both Ms. Machado and Mr. González, whom he called the “rightful president,” and “reaffirmed the United States’ support for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela,” according to a State Department summary of the call.

On Saturday, Ms. Rodríguez sounded a defiant tone, denouncing the U.S. raid against Mr. Maduro and saying he was the country’s rightful president. When asked on Sunday whether the United States could work with her, Mr. Rubio said: “We’re going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what we know of what they’ve done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward. So we’re going to find out.”

Mr. Rubio also said there were no immediate plans to send U.S. troops into Venezuela to seize other officials who have also been indicted by the U.S. Justice Department on drug trafficking charges, as Mr. Maduro was in 2020, during the first Trump administration. He said that had not been a consideration in planning for the operation to take Mr. Maduro.

Mr. Rubio said that the United States planned to ensure that Venezuela stopped trafficking drugs. The Trump administration stated last year that curbing “narco-terrorism” from Venezuela was a main reason for its campaign against the country, which has included carrying out legally questionable military strikes on boats that have killed at least 115 people.

However, Venezuela’s role in the drug trade is limited. Mr. Maduro allowed some Colombian cocaine producers to send their product through Venezuela, mainly to Europe, but the country does not produce fentanyl, which has long been Mr. Trump’s stated focus.

When asked in the NBC interview whether Communist-run Cuba, an ally of Venezuela, was the next target of the Trump administration, Mr. Rubio did not deny the possibility. He said that “the Cuban government is a huge problem” and that “they are in a lot of trouble, yes.” Mr. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, has said for decades that the leadership of Cuba must be removed, and that toppling the Maduro “regime” in Venezuela would help lead to a transformation in Cuba.

In another interview on Sunday, on “This Week” on ABC News, Mr. Rubio said that congressional authorization of the military operation to seize Mr. Maduro was not necessary because it was “a law enforcement operation” rather than an “invasion.” He also said that notifying members of Congress ahead of the operation would have led to leaks of the military plans and endangered American soldiers.

Tyler Pager and Minho Kim contributed reporting.

This week he was back onstage, brushing off the latest U.S. escalation — a strike on a dock that the United States said was used for drug trafficking — by bouncing to an electronic beat on state television while his recorded voice repeated in English, “No crazy war.”

Mr. Maduro’s regular public dancing and other displays of nonchalance in recent weeks helped persuade some on the Trump team that the Venezuelan president was mocking them and trying to call what he believed to be a bluff, according to two of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the confidential discussions.

So the White House decided to follow through on its military threats.

On Saturday, an elite U.S. military team swooped into Caracas, the capital, in a pre-dawn raid and whisked Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, to New York to face drug trafficking charges.

Weeks earlier, U.S. officials had already settled on an acceptable candidate to replace Mr. Maduro, at least for the time being: Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, who had impressed Trump officials with her management of Venezuela’s crucial oil industry.

The people involved in the discussions said intermediaries persuaded the administration that she would protect and champion future American energy investments in the country.

“I’ve been watching her career for a long time, so I have some sense of who she is and what she’s about,” said one senior U.S. official, referring to Ms. Rodríguez.

“I’m not claiming that she’s the permanent solution to the country’s problems, but she’s certainly someone we think we can work at a much more professional level than we were able to do with him,” the official added, referring to Mr. Maduro.

It was an easy choice, the people said. Mr. Trump had never warmed up to the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who had organized a winning presidential campaign in 2024, earning her the Nobel Peace Prize this year. Since Mr. Trump’s re-election, Ms. Machado has gone out of her way to please him, calling him a “champion of freedom,” mimicking his talking points on election fraud in the United States and even dedicating her Peace Prize to him.

It was in vain. On Saturday, Mr. Trump said he would accept Ms. Rodríguez, saying that Ms. Machado lacked the “respect” needed to govern Venezuela.

U.S. officials say that their relationship with Ms. Rodríguez’s interim government will be based on her ability to play by their rules, adding that they reserve the right to take additional military action if she fails to respect America’s interests. Despite Ms. Rodríguez’s public condemnation of the attack, a senior U.S. official said that it was too soon to draw conclusions about what her approach would be and that the administration remained optimistic that they could work with her.

Mr. Trump declared on Saturday that the United States intended to “run” Venezuela for an unspecified period and reclaim U.S. oil interests, an extraordinary assertion of unilateral, expansionist power after more narrow, and also contested, arguments about stopping the flow of drugs.

In Ms. Rodríguez, the Trump administration would be engaging a leader of a government that it had routinely labeled illegitimate, while abandoning Ms. Machado, whose movement won a presidential election last year in a victory widely recognized as stolen by Mr. Maduro.

And it was not immediately clear if Ms. Rodriguez would even play along. In a televised address, she accused the United States of making an illegal invasion and asserted that Mr. Maduro remained Venezuela’s legitimate leader.

To retain leverage, senior U.S. officials said, restrictions on Venezuelan oil exports would remain in place for now.

But others involved in the talks expressed hope that the administration would stop detaining Venezuelan oil tankers and issue more permits for U.S. companies to work in Venezuela in order to revive the economy and give Ms. Rodríguez a shot at political success.

Ms. Rodríguez, 56, arrives at the job of Venezuela’s interim leader with credentials of an economic troubleshooter who orchestrated the country’s shift from corrupt socialism to similarly corrupt laissez-faire capitalism.

She is the daughter of a Marxist guerrilla who won fame for kidnapping an American businessman. She was educated partly in France, where she specialized in labor law.

She held middling government posts in the government of Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, before being promoted to bigger roles with the help of her older brother Jorge Rodríguez, who eventually became Mr. Maduro’s chief political strategist.

Ms. Rodríguez managed to stabilize the Venezuelan economy after years of crisis and slowly but steadily grow the country’s oil production amid tightening U.S. sanctions, a feat that earned her even the grudging respect of some American officials.

As Ms. Rodríguez consolidated control over economic policy and eliminated rivals, she built bridges with Venezuela’s economic elites, foreign investors and diplomats, to whom she presented herself as a soft-spoken technocrat and a contrast to the burly security officials forming most of the rest of Mr. Maduro’s inner circle.

Those alliances have borne fruit in recent months, earning her powerful champions that helped to cement her rise to power. On Saturday, her assumption of power was greeted with cautious optimism by some of Venezuela’s captains of industry, who said in private that she had the skills to create growth, if she could persuade the United States to relax its chokehold on the country’s economy.

For all her technocratic leanings, Ms. Rodríguez has never denounced the brutal repression and corruption sustaining Mr. Maduro’s rule, once calling her decision to join the government an act of “personal revenge” for her father’s death in prison in 1976, after being interrogated by intelligence agents from pro-U.S. governments.

Ms. Rodríguez’s capacity for negotiating across Venezuela’s ideological chasm could prove useful in easing tensions. Juan Francisco García, a former ruling party lawmaker who has since broken with the government, said he had some apprehensions about her ability to govern but gave her the benefit of the doubt.

“History is full of sectors and figures linked to dictators who have, at some point, served as a bridge to stabilize the country and transition to a democratic scenario,” Mr. García said.

The contradictions enveloping Ms. Rodríguez were on display on Saturday when she addressed the nation.

While Mr. Trump said that Ms. Rodríguez had been sworn in as Venezuela’s new president, it was clear that Mr. Maduro’s supporters — including Ms. Rodríguez herself if her remarks are taken at face value — still see him as Venezuela’s leader.

Spotlighting the potential challenges ahead, even the text on Venezuelan state television labeled her as vice president. People close to the government said those displays of loyalty were a necessary public relations strategy to pacify the ruling party loyalists, including in the armed forces and paramilitary groups, who were reeling from the military humiliation inflicted by the United States on their country and the destruction and death caused by the attack. At least 40 Venezuelans died, both civilians and soldiers, according to a senior Venezuelan official.

U.S. forces managed to descend into the capital largely unopposed, destroy at least three military bases and grab the country’s president from a heavily guarded compound, without any loss of American life.

Still, the Trump administration has chosen to give Mr. Maduro’s vice president a chance and to pass over Ms. Machado, who won the Nobel Prize and had at least some allies in Mr. Trump’s circle.

Ms. Machado, a conservative former member of the National Assembly from an affluent Venezuelan family, boasts decades-long ties to Washington.

She has spent the last year courting Mr. Trump’s support and trying to enlist his help in ousting Mr. Maduro. She has openly supported his military campaign in the Caribbean and mostly refrained from commenting on his policies toward Venezuelan migrants.

On Saturday, after Mr. Trump announced that the U.S. military had captured Mr. Maduro, she released a statement saying that she was ready to lead. “Today we are prepared to assert our mandate and seize power,” she wrote in a message she posted on X.

But roughly two hours later, Mr. Trump said they had not spoken. It would be “very tough” for Ms. Machado to take control of her country, Mr. Trump said, adding in his televised speech that she was a “very nice woman” but “doesn’t have the support” in Venezuela to lead.

A spokeswoman for Ms. Machado declined to comment.

“For Trump, democracy is not a concern — it is about money, power, and protecting the homeland from drugs and criminals,” said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a research institute in Washington.

In his speech to the nation, Mr. Trump also made no mention of Edmundo González, the retired diplomat who became Ms. Machado’s political surrogate after she was barred from running. Mr. González, who is in self-imposed exile in Spain, is considered the legitimate winner, by a wide margin, of the 2024 election, even though Venezuelan authorities handed the victory to Mr. Maduro.

Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, and María Victoria Fermín , Mariana Martínez and Isayen Herrera from Caracas, Venezuela.

Americans took to the streets of Chicago and Washington on Saturday to protest the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, even as Venezuelan migrants in New York gathered to celebrate the removal of Nicolás Maduro from power.

Holding signs that read “No Blood for Oil,” “No U.S. War on Venezuela” and “Hands Off Latin America,” a crowd of several hundred people gathered in Federal Plaza in Chicago as night fell. They called the operation to remove Nicolás Maduro, the ousted Venezuelan leader, an act of imperialism that Americans did not vote for, carried out without required Congressional approval.

“I’m 37 and grew up with the Iraq wars,” said Katrina Denny. “This morning, I was like, ‘Oh my God, we’re doing it again.’”

She said she thought that protests would grow if the Trump administration continued to use military force in Venezuela. “They filled half the plaza tonight on short notice, but this is only the beginning,” she said. “If this continues, I’m sure there will be many more events and larger ones.”

Many protesters expressed suspicion of the White House’s motives. “If Maduro wasn’t legally elected, that’s not for us to say,” said Adela Cruz, 51. “It just seems like a ploy to get oil.”

Jonny Bishop, 28, said he was worried for the men and women in the military. “As someone who teaches high school, my kids are the ones who may have to go to war,” he said, adding that with all of the other problems facing Americans, “going to war is the last thing we need.”

After the rally in Federal Plaza, the Chicago police allowed protesters to march up Dearborn Street to Wacker Drive, near Trump Tower Chicago.

In Washington, people on both sides of the issue gathered for separate afternoon rallies near the White House.

At one of them, dozens of opponents of the intervention chanted anti-Trump slogans. One of the organizers, Morgan Artyukhina, 38, said their message was “that this is a war that is being waged by the Trump administration, not just in contravention of U.S. law and international law, but also, falsely in the name of the American people.”

A few blocks away, a smaller group celebrated the capture of Mr. Maduro by U.S. troops.

Draped in a Venezuelan flag, Leonardo Angulo, 35, danced near a statue of Simón Bolivar, who helped free Venezuela from Spanish imperial rule. Mr. Angulo, who has lived in the United States for eight years, said he and his family came out “to celebrate, and gather with my people, because we share this feeling, this feeling of joy, of happiness, of hope most of all.”

Still, there was an undercurrent of anxiety, which one person in the crowd attributed to concerns that federal agents would appear and detain the Venezuelans present at the rally.

In New York, Venezuelan migrants described a mix of euphoria, relief and guarded hope after years of exile.

Beatriz Hernández danced in Times Square as a group of 100 gathered in Midtown, waving flags and calling family members back home.

Ms. Hernández, 60, said the moment felt transformative for the Venezuelan diaspora forced to emigrate because of poverty and lack of freedom during Maduro’s administration.

“It’s a great joy, the news we received,” said Ms. Hernández, who is originally from Maracaibo, Venezuela. “We haven’t slept since 3 a.m. It’s almost 6 p.m. and I don’t think we’ll be sleeping anytime soon because of the adrenaline.”

Ms. Hernández arrived in New York four years ago after a long journey that she said included crossing the Darién Gap on foot before reaching the U.S. border, where she requested asylum.

“The news is a hope of being able to return safely to our country,” she said. “I think that now I will be able to see my daughters who stayed there, and that in the not-too-distant future I will be able to return to my country and hug my sister.”

Lucia Coronel, 30, who is originally from Maracay, left Venezuela nine years ago and first emigrated to Colombia. She arrived in New York, where she requested asylum, three years ago.

“Now I don’t care about asylum,” Coronel said. “I feel a relief that opens up the possibility of returning to our homes voluntarily and safely. We didn’t emigrate by choice, we emigrated out of necessity.”

Other Venezuelans were more measured.

“We’ve gone through sadness and joy,” said Kimberly Castillo, 32, who is also from Maracay. “Sadness because nobody wants to see their country being bombed by another country. We are sad about the people who were caught in the middle, but are joyous knowing now there is the possibility for better times for my country.”

The Pulitzer Prize-winning team seeks to present the true facts, unaffected by agenda or biases.

President Donald Trump said a U.S. military assault succeeded in capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, both facing U.S. charges related to cocaine trafficking under newly unsealed indictments.

In a Jan. 3 press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said the U.S. would ""run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.""

Trump also said Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as interim president. Trump said Rodríguez had talked to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and was ""essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.""

However, Rodríguez criticized the U.S. military action as ""brutal aggression"" on state television and called for Maduro’s immediate release.

Maduro, an authoritarian, has led Venezuela since 2013, succeeding an ideological ally, Hugo Chávez, who had been in office since 1999. Under both men, U.S. relations with Venezuela frayed over foreign policy, oil and human rights.

In July 2024, Maduro declared victory following an election that international observers described as fraudulent. The country’s opposition candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, received about 70% of the vote.

Tensions between Trump and Maduro escalated in September after the U.S. government began attacking vessels off the coast of Venezuela, killing more than 100 people, in what Trump described as an effort to thwart drug smuggling.

When a reporter asked Trump during the Mar-a-Lago press event whether he’d spoken to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado following Maduro’s arrest, Trump said Machado ""doesn't have the support or the respect within the country.""

Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for democracy in Venezuela, had a 72% approval rating from Venezuelans according to a March poll by ClearPath Strategies.

Trump said without evidence that the United States’ role in governing Venezuela ""won’t cost us anything"" because U.S. oil companies would invest in new infrastructure in the oil-rich country. ""It’s going to make a lot of money,"" Trump said.

Here, we fact-checked Trump’s and Rubio’s statements from the press conference.

Rubio: ""It’s just not the kind of mission that you can pre-notify (Congress about) because it endangers the mission.""

The administration’s lack of warning to Congress bucks laws and precedents.

Rubio said members of Congress were not notified in advance. Trump said the administration was concerned about Congress potentially leaking news of the administration’s decision to capture Maduro.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., praised the operation as a ""decisive action.""

But Congressional Democrats said Congress should have been notified in advance. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said, ""Maduro is terrible. But Trump put American servicemembers at risk with this unauthorized attack.""

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said Trump and his cabinet were not forthcoming about their intentions for regime change, so ""we are left with no understanding of how the administration is preparing to mitigate risks to the U.S. and we have no information regarding a long-term strategy following today’s extraordinary escalation.""

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the right to declare war. The last time that happened was for World War II.

Since then, presidents have generally initiated military action using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without an official declaration of war.

Since Congress passed the 1973 War Powers Resolution, the president has had to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing the U.S. military into hostilities and terminate the use of the military within 60 days unless Congress approves. If approval is not granted and the president deems it an emergency, an additional 30 days are granted for ending operations.

In recent decades, congressional consent has usually been granted through an authorization for the use of military force. But an authorization has not been passed for operations in Venezuela. Kaine and other lawmakers have pursued legislation — so far fruitlessly — to prohibit the use of federal funds for any use of military force in or against Venezuela without Congressional authorization.

The Trump administration has whittled away at prior notification requirements. Under federal law, eight bipartisan, senior members of Congress must receive prior notice of particularly sensitive covert actions. In June 2025, the administration told Republicans, but not Democrats, about the forthcoming U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. For the Venezuela operation, it appears no lawmakers were notified in advance.

Trump: Each U.S. boat strike off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 people.

Pants on Fire!

The Trump administration has struck at least 32 vessels killing about 115 people in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean since September. Trump said previously that the boats were carrying drugs en route to the U.S. and during the press conference he said the drugs on each boat would kill ""on average, 25,000 people.""

However, experts on drugs and Venezuela told PolitiFact the country plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the U.S. And the administration has provided no evidence about the type or quantity of drugs it says were on the boats. This lack of information makes it impossible to know how many lethal doses of the drugs could have been destroyed.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 73,000 U.S. drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025. That means the drugs on 32 boats would have been responsible for 800,000 deaths, nearly 11 times the number of U.S. overdose deaths in one year.

Trump: ""Maduro sent savage and murderous gangs, including the bloodthirsty prison gang Tren de Aragua, to terrorize American communities nationwide.""

There is no evidence Maduro sent members of Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua to the U.S.

The U.S. Justice Department indictment against Maduro does not mention Trump’s statement.

An April report from the federal National Intelligence Council contradicted Trump’s statements about links between Maduro and Tren de Aragua.

""While Venezuela's permissive environment enables (Tren de Aragua) to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,"" the report said.

Trump: Venezuela ""stole"" U.S oil in the past.

This needs context.

In the early 20th century, Venezuela’s long-serving dictator, Juan Vicente Gómez, allowed foreign companies almost exclusive access to the country’s oil resources.

In 1975, after decades of seeking greater control of its oil resources, Venezuela nationalized its oil industry.

""Trump’s claim that Venezuela has stolen oil and land from the U.S. is baseless,"" Francisco Rodríguez, a Venezuelan economist at the University of Denver, told the Washington Post. ""The U.S. was much more interested in having Venezuela be a provider of oil — relatively cheap oil — than to have a production collapse in Venezuela,"" Rodríguez said. As a result, the change was ""relatively uncontroversial"" at the time.

U.S. oil companies, including Exxon and Mobil and Gulf, now Chevron, lost about $5 billion each in assets and were compensated $1 billion each, according to news reports, the Post reported.

But Rodríguez said the companies didn’t push for additional compensation at the time, in part because no forum existed to do so.

In general, experts have told PolitiFact that invading a country to take its oil would be both illegal and unethical. In 2016, Trump mused about how the U.S. should have taken Iraq’s oil when it invaded to oust Saddam Hussein.

Experts pointed to the Annex to the Hague Convention of 1907 on the Laws and Customs of War, which says that ""private property ... must be respected (and) cannot be confiscated."" It also says that ""pillage is formally forbidden.""

""If ‘to the victors go the spoils’ was legal doctrine, then we would have believed that (then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein) should have been able to keep Kuwait City after he invaded"" in 1990, terrorism analyst Daveed Gartenstein-Ross told PolitiFact in 2016. ""But we viewed that — quite rightly — as an act of aggression under the U.N. Charter.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/846ecf6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5765x3027+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2Fe4%2Fd761dce8425ab9acf3086a0e21cc%2Ftrump-us-venezuela-26003648894364.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 18:12:33.795616

In a report in the Washington Post, the warehouse is part of the Trump administration’s effort to seek contractors to “help it overhaul the United States’ immigrant detention system in a plan that includes renovating industrial warehouses to hold more than 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time.”

“Rather than shuttling detainees around the country to wherever detention space is available, as happens now, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement aims to speed up deportations by establishing a deliberate feeder system,” the Post reported the documents as saying. “Newly arrested detainees would be booked into processing sites for a few weeks before being funneled into one of seven large-scale warehouses holding 5,000 to 10,000 people each, where they would be staged for deportation.”",https://www.dailyfreeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DFN-L-pat-ryan-hed-01.jpg?w=1024&h=575,N,,2026-01-04 12:57:07.149759

11 October Hasan Ali Moh’D Saleh, 67, died after being detained at the Krome detention center in south-west Miami-Dade county.","Thirty-one people died in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in 2025 – making it the agency’s deadliest year in more than two decades, as the Trump administration moved to detain a record number of people.

Some of those who died in detention had arrived in the US recently, seeking asylum. Others had arrived years ago, some as young children. Some had been apprehended on criminal charges or had served time for convictions; others had been picked up in the administration’s indiscriminate ICE raids.

They died of seizure and heart failure, stroke, respiratory failure, tuberculosis or suicide. Some died at ICE detention centers and field offices, others after they had been transferred to hospitals, but were still under ICE custody. In some cases, their families and lawyers have alleged, they died of neglect, after repeatedly trying and failing to get medical care.

These deaths occurred as the Trump administration ramped up its immigration operations, detaining a record number of people in December. The agency was holding 68,440 people in detention in mid-December; nearly 75% of them had no criminal convictions. December was also the deadliest month in ICE custody – six people died.

As detention facilities across the US grow more crowded, human rights advocates, immigration lawyers and lawmakers have reported unsanitary conditions, inadequate food and poor medical care. The number of deaths this year marks the highest level since 2004.

“This is a result of the deteriorating conditions inside of ICE detention,” said Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, a non-profit that has been tracking immigration detention deaths for years.

The Department of Homeland Security, which encompasses ICE, denied that conditions in detention were declining. “It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the agency. She added that the average rate of death remained low, saying that “consistent with data over the last decade, death rates in custody are 0.00007%”, but did not provide the underlying data for that figure.

Advocates, however, warned that as the administration detains more people, ICE facilities will continue to see more deaths.

“I’m definitely worried that in the coming years, we could see more of this as ICE is trying to expand its facilities, detain and deport more people,” said Ghandehari.

The Guardian has been tracking everyone who died in custody this year. These are their stories.

23 January

Genry Ruiz Guillén, 29, of Honduras, died in a hospital in Hialeah, Florida.

Guillén had come to the United States from Honduras in 2023. He worked in construction.

In October 2024, he was apprehended by local law enforcement, and then transferred to the Krome immigrant detention center in South Florida. His mother told Univision that in December, Guillén called her from detention and told her he wasn’t feeling well, and that he was experiencing fainting spells. It was the last time she spoke with him, she said.

According to ICE, Guillén “had difficulty breathing, prompting a medical emergency” before he died.

“I never thought my son would come to this country to die like this, nor did I ever think I would receive that news,” his mother told Univision.

29 January

Serawit Gezahegn Dejene, 45, of Ethiopia, died at a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona.

He had come to the US in August 2024, and was apprehended by the border patrol, which transferred him to the Eloy detention center. He had cleared the initial steps to apply for asylum according to ICE.

In December 2024, he reported to staff at the detention center that he had an elevated heart rate and fatigue, and was seen by healthcare providers who said he had a possible lymphoma diagnosis, according to ICE.

20 February

Maksym Chernyak, a Ukrainian citizen, died of an apparent stroke at a hospital in Miami.

Chernyak, 44, fled Kyiv with his long term-partner during the Russia-Ukraine war and came to the US on humanitarian parole, according to the Miami Herald.

Chernyak was arrested on 26 January over a domestic violence claim. His partner described the incident as a “family misunderstanding” exacerbated by a language barrier, according to the Miami Herald. He was “kind and warm-hearted”, she told the outlet. Chernyak was then transferred to the Krome detention center in Miami.

While in custody, he experienced “vomiting and seizure activity”, according to ICE. Chernyak was then transferred to a hospital on 18 February, where staff “established a stroke alert due to unresponsive state”, according to ICE. A preliminary cause of death was listed as “bleeding from the brain”.

An investigation by the Miami Herald said that medical experts who reviewed his case have raised concerns about whether Chernyak received adequate care due to the length of time that elapsed before Krome staff called 911. ICE denied allegations that Chernyak did not receive proper medical attention.

23 February

Juan Alexis Tineo-Martinez, 44, of the Dominican Republic, died at the Centro Medico hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

He was taken into custody by US Customs and Border Protection air marine operations two days prior to his death, according to ICE.

Agents contacted local 911 after Tineo-Martinez said he was experiencing leg pain, according to the agency, and he was transferred to the hospital for evaluation. The Dominican embassy in Puerto Rico did not respond to the Guardian’s query about Tineo-Martinez’s cause of death.

8 April

Brayan Garzón-Rayo, 27, of Colombia, died at the Phelps county jail in Rolla, Missouri.

Garzón-Rayo’s mother, Lucy Garzón, told St Louis Public Radio that she and her family came to the US in November 2023, fleeing growing threats of violence and harassment from law enforcement in Bogotá.

In March Garzón-Rayo was charged with a misdemeanor for credit card fraud, and then transferred to ICE custody. He spoke to his mother a few days before he died, Lucy Garzón told SLPR, and complained about stomach pains and the poor quality of the jail’s food.

Lucy Garzón told SLPR that officials told her that her son appeared to have died by suicide. ICE has not confirmed an official cause of death.

His mother said that Garzón-Rayo loved riding his motorcycle, watching soccer and sledding after fresh snowfall.

16 April

Nhon Ngoc Nguyen, 55, died at a hospital in El Paso, Texas.

He was apprehended in February in Albuquerque, according to his family’s lawyer, Tin Nguyen, and his partner and friends couldn’t locate him for days. Eventually, they realised he was being held at the El Paso processing center in Texas. Tin Nguyen said that Nhon Ngoc had been showing early signs of dementia and possible side effects from a head injury prior to his detention.

Shortly after his detention, he began experiencing health complications, Tin Nguyen told the Guardian. ICE eventually offered to release him, so long as his family was able to provide him with round-the-clock acute care, the attorney said – but he didn’t have health insurance and his family was unable to pay for such care. In the meantime, Nhon Ngoc’s condition began rapidly worsening. He died of acute pneumonia, according to ICE.

Nhon Ngoc had come to the US in 1983 and became a legal resident as part of the Refugee Act of 1980. In 1991, he was convicted of second-degree murder and served time at San Quentin prison, in California. After his sentence, in 2013 ICE opened a deportation case against him. While it was pending, he moved to Albuquerque and began rebuilding his life.

He had a loving partner and a huge community of friends, Tin Nguyen said: “He was kind.”

25 April

Marie Ange Blaise, a 44-year-old citizen of Haiti, died at the Broward transitional center in Pompano Beach, Florida.

Blaise entered the US on an unknown date and location, according to ICE. She was apprehended by Customs and Border Protection on 12 February while attempting to board a flight to Charlotte, North Carolina, according to authorities.

ICE has not released an official cause of death. According to reporting by WLRN Public Media on the medical examiner’s report about her death, Blaise spoke to her son hours before she died. “She complained of having chest pains and abdominal cramps, and when she asked the detention staff to see a physician, they refused her,” her son told investigators, according to WLRN Public Media. According to the outlet, ICE offered a conflicting account, saying that Blaise did not take blood pressure medication she was offered.

5 May

Abelardo Avellaneda Delgado, 68, died while in transit from a local jail to a federal detention center, the first detainee to die in this manner in at least a decade.

Delgado was originally from El Huariche, Mexico. During his nearly 40 years in the US, he raised a large family and worked on tobacco and vegetable farms, according to previous Guardian reporting.

Delgado, who did not have legal status, was apprehended in Statenville, Georgia, on a parole violation on 9 April. His family told the Guardian they grew alarmed by his deterioration in jail, and worried about the medications he was being given.

Eventually, Delgado was transferred from the jail to Georgia’s Stewart detention center. But he never made it. Instead, he became “unresponsive” in the transport van with highly elevated blood pressure; the driver called 911, but Delgado died on the scene.

ICE has said the cause of death is under investigation and his family said they are still waiting for answers. “It bothers me,” his son, Junior, told the Guardian in June. “He was a great-grandfather.”

7 June

Jesus Molina-Veya, a 45-year-old citizen of Mexico, died at the Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia.

Molina-Veya entered the country without authorization on numerous occasions, starting in 1999, according to authorities. During his time in the US, Molina-Veya was arrested on charges including child molestation, a hit-and-run and possession of controlled substances, ICE said.

On 7 June, Molina-Veya was found unresponsive in his cell. While an official cause of death has not been released, an ICE spokesperson has called the death “an apparent suicide”. His death was the second reported in Georgia within a month, a state with one of the highest numbers of detainees in the US.

23 June

Johnny Noviello was found unresponsive at the Bureau of Prisons’ federal detention center in Miami.

Noviello moved with family from Quebec to Florida in 1988 and became a lawful permanent resident in 1991. His father, Angelo, told the Guardian that Johnny was diagnosed with epilepsy shortly after he was born, and would often become ill during the winter. So the family settled in Daytona Beach, seeking a warmer climate.

Noviello, 49, spent most of his life in Florida. He worked at a Dollar Tree and loved going to the beach and playing pool in his spare time, his father said. He maintained close ties to Canada, making regular trips to see family in Montreal.

He spent time in prison for selling drugs, including hydrocodone and oxycodone, but was released early on good behavior. He was apprehended by ICE agents on 15 May at the Florida department of corrections probation office. Noviello’s cause of death is under investigation.

Noviello’s father said the family has not received an autopsy report. “We’re in limbo, we don’t know what happened,” he said. “I don’t know why they didn’t send him to Canada right away.”

26 June

Isidro Pérez, 75, of Cuba died at a Florida hospital of undetermined causes.

According to the Miami Herald, Pérez was a mechanic and fisher from Cuba, and arrived in the US in 1966 at the age of 16.

He was convicted of marijuana possession in the 1980s and served time in prison. His stepdaughter told the Herald that, during his time behind bars, Pérez studied to become a mechanic, and that when he got out of prison, he began rescuing animals. “We’re all humans, you know, we make mistakes, but we remake ourselves,” she told the outlet.

On 5 June, five immigration officers apprehended Pérez at a community center. Officers took him to the Krome north service processing center in Miami. Three weeks later, Pérez died in ICE custody.

19 July

Tien Xuan Phan, 55, died at the Methodist hospital north-east in Live Oak, Texas.

Phan was detained earlier in June for failing to leave the US after a removal order, and held at the Karnes county immigration processing center in Karnes City. He was transferred to a hospital for evaluation after experiencing seizures and vomiting, and becoming unresponsive, according to ICE. His cause of death remains under investigation.

5 August

Chaofeng Ge, 32, of China, died four days after entering ICE custody in Pennsylvania.

Ge was born in 1992 in Luoyang, Henan province, China, and worked in construction. He arrived in the US via the southern border in 2023, when he was detained for unlawful entry. According to an attorney for his family, he spent his time while incarcerated trying to learn English, practicing by writing out scripture and short stories.

He was eventually released and settled in Queens, New York, where he worked as a delivery driver, according to his attorney. In 2025, he was arrested for possessing several stolen credit card numbers in his cell phone and for unauthorized access to a device, and was eventually detained by ICE. ICE and the Pennsylvania state police said that he died by suicide while detained.

His family filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security in the southern district of New York, requesting more information about his death. “I am devastated by the loss of my brother and by the knowledge that he was suffering so greatly in that detention center,” said Yaofeng Ge in a public statement. “He did not deserve to be treated that way. I want justice for my brother, answers as to how this could have happened, and accountability for those responsible for his death.”

Ge is survived by four siblings and his parents, who live in China.

31 August

Lorenzo Antonio Batrez Vargas, 32, died after he was detained at the Central Arizona Florence correctional complex.

Known as “Lenchito” by friends and family, Batrez Vargas was a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) recipient who was brought to the US from Mexico as a five-year-old. He was arrested by police in Flagstaff, Arizona, on 2 August, and charged with possession and use of drug paraphernalia. Immigration enforcement agents said they took Batrez Vargas into custody in Phoenix before transferring him to the detention center in Florence, where his family believes he contracted Covid-19, according to media reports.

ICE said that his cause of death was unknown and remained under investigation.

“We want justice. We want this to never happen to anyone else, especially not to undocumented immigrants,” Jaime Vargas, Batrez Vargas’s uncle, told Univision.

8 September

Oscar Rascon Duarte, of Mexico, died at a long-term medical facility while in ICE custody.

Duarte, 58, had first come to the US in 1976, was deported in 2004 and then re-entered via the southern border. He served a 20-year sentence in prison for attempted sexual contact with a minor and child molestation. After he completed his sentence, he was transferred to ICE custody.

At first, he was held at the Florence staging facility, according to ICE, but was later transferred to Promise hospital in Mesa, Arizona, “due to late-stage Alzheimer disease, right kidney cancer, and hepatitis C all of which required a higher level of care”, where he eventually died, ICE said.

18 September

Santos Banegas Reyes, 42, of Honduras, died at the Nassau county correctional center in New York.

He was a construction worker and a father of two daughters, one of whom lives in the US while the other lives in Honduras, according to local news reports.

He was apprehended on 17 September by federal immigration agents just hours before he was found “not breathing” in his cell at the Nassau county correctional center. According to ICE, the preliminary cause of death appeared to be liver failure complicated by alcoholism. His family is contesting his cause of death, and have requested an independent autopsy.

22 September

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, 39, died after falling ill at the Adelanto detention center in California.

His mother, Lucía Uribe, told the Guardian that Ismael had come to the US from Mexico when he was five, crossing the US southern border along with his sister and cousin to join his mother and father. The family settled in Westminster, California, and later moved to Huntington Beach.

He spent a year studying graphic design, and then began working – first at a factory that produced cleaning supplies and later at car washes. Lucía said that Ismael loved listening to music. He was always willing to help others, and often helped his sister, a single mother, with childcare.

Uribe had been protected from deportation under the Daca program, but he was denied renewal because he had been convicted of driving under the influence.

He was apprehended in August during an immigration raid at the Fountain Valley Auto Wash, where he had worked for about 15 years, and was transferred to Adelanto. There, he fell ill – first with a cough and fever, and then other medical complications, according to his family. He was transferred to a hospital, where he died.

His mother learned of the detention through one of his co-workers, and said she was unaware of any medical condition he had. “I want to see less medical negligence,” she told the Guardian, referring to conditions at ICE detention centers.

ICE said Uribe’s cause of death was “still under investigation”.

24 September

Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, 37, of El Salvador, was killed when a gunman opened fire at the ICE field office where he was being held.

He is survived by his partner, Berenice Prieto, and four children. He had worked mowing lawns and trimming trees, and in his free time he liked fishing around the Dallas-Forth Worth area, his loved ones told CBS.

Guzman-Fuentes was arrested by Dallas police in late August, due to an outstanding warrant for driving under the influence and other charges that were later dropped.

“We had just bought our first home together, and he worked hard every single day to make sure our children had what they needed. His death is a senseless tragedy that has left our family shattered,” Prieto said in a public statement shortly after his death. “I do not know how to explain to our children that their father is gone.”

29 September

Miguel Ángel García Medina, 31, of Mexico, was killed outside an ICE field office in Dallas.

García Medina is survived by his wife, Stephany Gauffeny, two stepdaughters and a son – who was born three days after his death – his mother and grandparents, who live in Mexico, and three siblings.

“Everyone tells me the same thing: he was very funny. He always made us laugh, and that’s why we miss him so much,” Gauffeny told the Guardian. “He was very goofy, you almost always saw him laughing, joking or singing.”

Gauffeny – who clarified to the Guardian that her husband was referred to in an ICE press release as Miguel García-Hernández, his stepfather’s last name – also said: “He was a very present father. Sometimes he wouldn’t go to work if my daughters needed something.”

García Medina was born in San Luis Potosí, a central state in Mexico, and crossed the US border without papers when he was a teenager, settling in Arlington, Texas. He met Gauffeny at a party shortly after and the two were friends for years before they became a couple.

He had lived in the Dallas area for nearly two decades, most recently making a living painting and remodeling homes. In his free time, he liked to work on his truck, Gauffeny said.

He ended up in ICE custody early on 24 September, after a short time in jail for a DUI. While he was shackled inside a government van outside the ICE field office, a gunman opened fire. He died five days later of his gunshot wounds.

He would have turned 32 on 5 January, which is also the day of his 10th wedding anniversary. Gauffeny told the Guardian that he had been in the process of obtaining a green card and planning to open his own painting company. “He made business cards and said he was going to buy the equipment,” she said. “He was so excited and had a lot going for him.”

29 September

Huabing Xie, of China, died at El Centro regional medical center in Calexico, California.

The border patrol had apprehended Xie on 12 September in Indio, California, and transferred him to the Imperial regional detention facility, according to ICE. In 2023, he had been placed under removal proceedings, the agency said.

The agency said that Xie experienced “what appeared to be a seizure and became unresponsive” and medical personnel at the detention center tried to administer life-saving measures, before emergency medical services arrived and took him to the hospital, where he died.

4 October

Leo Cruz-Silva, a 34-year-old man from Mexico, died while detained by ICE at the Ste Genevieve county jail in Missouri.

A few days before he died, he was detained by police in Festus, Missouri, for public intoxication, according to federal immigration officials. The police then handed him over to ICE, which served him with a notice that the agency would reinstate a previous deportation order. Cruz-Silva had likely entered the US before 2010, when he was a child, according to immigration officials, and was expelled twice after re-entering via the southern border.

On 4 October, Cruz-Silva died by apparent suicide, according to ICE.

About 50 people organized a vigil to mourn him. “He was a person, he was a brother, he was a son, he was a person,” Susie Johnson, the founder of Abide in Love, a non-profit that works with ICE detainees in Missouri jails, told St Louis Public Radio. “All loss of life, in my opinion, is tragic, and I hate that it happened in our community,” she said.

11 October

Hasan Ali Moh’D Saleh, 67, died after being detained at the Krome detention center in south-west Miami-Dade county.

Saleh, who was from Jordan, first came to the US in 1994 and became a lawful permanent resident a few months after he arrived in the country.

Saleh managed a convenience store in Fort Lauderdale. In 2017, he was charged – along with a dozen other clerks and store owners – in a scheme to exchange food stamps for cash. He had served time in prison, and after his release in 2020, ICE placed him under an “order of supervision” that required him to regularly check in with immigration officers. In 2025, he was apprehended and placed at Krome.

He was taken to a local hospital due to a high fever, and became unresponsive. A physician listed his preliminary cause of death as cardiac arrest.

23 October

Josué Castro Rivera, a 25-year-old man from Honduras, was killed while trying to flee ICE agents in Virginia.

He had been on his way to a gardening job when ICE agents pulled over his vehicle, his brother, Henry Castro, told reporters. When agents tried to detain Castro Rivera and three other passengers, he fled, running into traffic. He was struck while crossing Interstate 264 in Norfolk.

According to his brother, Castro Rivera had come to the US four years ago, and had been working to help support family in Honduras. “He had a very good heart,” Castro told the Associated Press. “He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him.”

23 October

Gabriel Garcia Aviles, a 54-year-old from Mexico who had been living in the US for 30 years, died about a week after being detained by immigration agents.

Aviles was a father of two and grandfather of three, according to his family. His daughter, Mariel, told LA Taco she used to speak with him every day, and described him as someone who was “always happy and loved bikes”.

Customs and Border Protection agents grabbed him during a “roving patrol” in the southern California city of Costa Mesa on 14 October. Mariel last spoke with him shortly after he was apprehended, she told LA Taco. In the days that followed, his family tried repeatedly to contact him, but said that officers at the Adelanto detention facility refused to connect them.

A week after his detention, Mariel received a call informing her that her father was in critical condition at the Victor Valley global medical center. The last time his family was able to see Aviles, he was unconscious in a hospital room guarded by immigration officers, Mariel told LA Taco.

His family has questioned ICE’s assessment that Aviles died of “natural causes” and complications of alcohol withdrawal. He had been healthy, his daughter said, prior to his detention.

25 October

Kai Yin Wong, 63, of China, died at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas.

Wong had first come to the US in 1970 as a permanent resident. He was convicted of sexual abuse of a child in 2010, and served a 14-year sentence. He was then transferred to ICE custody and ordered deported from the US.

Before his death, he had been detained at the South Texas ICE processing center in Pearsall. In October, he was first transferred to a local hospital after he complained of shortness of breath, and then airlifted to another hospital in San Antonio when he started to experience heart failure and possible pneumonia. He was transferred to another medical center for heart valve repair surgery, according to officials, and died from complications.

3 December

Francisco Gaspar-Andrés, a 48-year-old man from Guatemala, died at an El Paso hospital due to suspected kidney and liver failure, according to ICE.

He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Lucía Pedro Juan, and their four daughters. The couple had run a plant nursery outside Miami for a decade, and Pedro Juan has described him as a hard-working husband who fought to provide for their family.

According to an interview Pedro Juan gave to the El Paso Times, the couple had gone on a grocery run during the Labor Day holiday when they were pulled over by a highway patrol officer who asked to see their identification papers, and then turned them over to ICE; they were eventually separated by immigration officers. “I hugged him, I tickled him on his ribs and I gave him a kiss on his cheek,” she said of their goodbye. “I never saw him again.” Pedro Juan was detained for three months and later deported to Guatemala.

Gaspar-Andrés ended up at Camp East Montana, a detention facility at the Texas military base known as Fort Bliss. The American Civil Liberties Union has called the facility a “human and civil rights catastrophe” following several reports of injuries, illnesses and abuses.

Gaspar-Andrés was repeatedly seen by medical staff for symptoms including bleeding gums, sore throat and body aches, fever, jaundice and hypertension. He was transferred to a hospital on 16 November, where he was diagnosed with hyponatremia. He was later placed on dialysis and palliative care, before he died in December, according to ICE.

His wife told the El Paso Times that Gaspar-Andrés had been relatively healthy prior to his detention, and disputed ICE’s assertion that he had hypertension or other underlying conditions.

5 December

Pete Sumalo Montejo, 72, died at the Valley Baptist medical center in Harlingen.

He had first come to the US from the Philippines in 1962, as a lawful permanent resident. In 1992, he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child and in 2024 he was convicted for possession of a controlled substance, according to ICE.

In February, ICE detained Montejo at the Montgomery processing center, where he began to experience several medical complications including shortness of breath and hypoxia, anemia, and septic shock resulting from pneumonia, according to the agency.

6 December

Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani, 48, of Pakistan, died at a hospital in Fort Worth, Texas.

He first came to the US in 1996 as a nonimmigrant visitor, according to ICE, and overstayed his visa. He was arrested by border patrol in 2017, in North Dakota, and ordered to leave the US after he did not appear at a 2019 immigration court hearing. Then, in June, ICE located him at a jail in Euless, Texas, where he had been booked.

He spent more than five months at the Prairieland detention center in Alvarado, Texas, before he died. ICE has said Sachwani had a history of medical conditions – including chronic respiratory, liver and kidney issues – and died of “natural causes”.

12 December

Jean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old man from Haiti, died at the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, one day after he was taken into custody.

ICE said Brutus died of “suspected natural causes”. His cousin told NBC New York that the family is still searching for answers about what happened. “We haven’t had some kind of closure surrounding his death,” Evans Belony, his cousin, told the outlet. “He was like a loved one, that we all loved, he was like a brother.”

Brutus came to the US in 2023 as an asylum seeker, his cousin said, who added that Brutus had been “very depressed and very sad” following the death of his mother.

The conditions at Delaney Hall, where Brutus was held, have come under scrutiny from lawmakers and advocates. Andy Kim, a Democratic senator from New Jersey, toured Delaney Hall the day after Brutus’s death and spoke to about 80 detainees, who he said described receiving poor medical care and “disgusting” meals that included raw meat. He called for the facility to be closed.

14 December

Fouad Saeed Abdulkadir, 46, of Eritrea died of “medical distress”, according to the agency.

According to court documents obtained by the Daily Voice, Abdulkadir filed for an emergency federal motion for medical relief three days before he died.

Abdulkadir had been an imam at the Islamic Center of Northeast Ohio, and had gained a green card in 2018. In 2023, he was charged with wire fraud and misuse of public funds and later sentenced to prison. Supporters wrote to a US district judge requesting leniency, arguing that Abdulkadir may not have fully understood the application process for the benefits programs he was convicted of misusing.

“We miss his teachings, his knowledge. We crave him for our own sake, not just for him. He’s an actively good man,” a supporter wrote, according to the Daily Voice.

ICE took custody of him in July 2024, and detained him at the Moshannon Valley processing center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, where he died a year and a half later. Community members raising funds for his funeral services said that Abdulkadir “spent his life selflessly caring for others, nurturing our children with the wisdom of the Qur’an, healing family rifts, and offering kindness to everyone he met. His boundless generosity touched countless souls, and the space he leaves behind feels immeasurably quiet and deep.”

15 December

Nenko Stanev Gantchev, 56, was born in Bulgaria and died at the North Lake processing center in Baldwin, Michigan.

Gantchev was “discovered unresponsive on the floor of his cell during routine checks”, and his official cause of death is still under investigation, according to ICE.

He had first arrived in the US in 1995. According to the agency, Gantchev was denied a green card in 2009 and, in 2023, was ordered by an immigration judge to return to Bulgaria. He was apprehended by immigration agents in September as part of the administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz”, which sent hundreds of federal agents to Chicago to crack down on unauthorized immigrants.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/483cd1d5d1031a1f2f884250465bd83403ad66c9/1_0_2499_2000/master/2499.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb315f8b88121a3ad4ea8fc4f1d05f30",N,,2026-01-04 11:57:16.982449

Trump told reporters Saturday the U.S. will “run” Venezuela for the time being.
On Dec. 17, the House narrowly rejected two concurrent resolutions that would have expressed opposition to U.S. military engagements against terror organizations in the Western hemisphere and against Venezuela unless authorized by Congress.","What the United States does next in Venezuela and in the Western Hemisphere more broadly are questions that loom large as the 119th Congress returns to work this week for its second session.

On the heels of the U.S. military’s abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro early Saturday morning and the administration’s planned prosecution of Maduro on weapons and drug charges, Democrats and at least a handful of Republicans will push for Congress to make its voice heard on the matter — starting this week.

At least one vote appears likely in the Senate in the days ahead on requiring congressional authorization for additional U.S. military actions in or against Venezuela.

By the end of January, lawmakers may also decide whether to withhold Defense appropriations for such operations.

At least classified briefings on Venezuela, if not public hearings, are also in the works.

“It’s time for Congress to get its ass off the couch and do what the Constitution mandates that we do,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations panels, told reporters on Saturday.

Votes ahead

The Senate is poised to vote next week on a resolution by Kaine that would block U.S. military action within or against Venezuela unless authorized by Congress, he said. It would be the latest of several so far ill-fated attempts to assert congressional prerogatives.

What’s more, Kaine said, whenever the House-Senate compromise version of the two chambers’ 2026 Defense appropriations bills comes up for a vote, the Senate will decide whether to consider an amendment by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., that would prohibit use of funds to prosecute military action in or against Venezuela.

[Related: US capture of Maduro rests on criminal case]

Lawmakers hope to clear the Defense spending measure by Jan. 30, when stopgap funding will expire.

If past is prologue, however, the attempts to rein in the president’s military actions will fall narrowly short in partisan votes.

Lawmakers’ reactions on Saturday to the president’s actions in Venezuela — with Republicans almost universally backing him and virtually all Democrats decrying the action — only confirmed Congress’s ossified divisions.

Cuba and beyond

Trump’s military operation in Venezuela is just the opening chapter of an as yet unwritten story.

Trump told reporters Saturday the U.S. will “run” Venezuela for the time being. The president said a small number of American forces may be needed in that country for that purpose, and he did not rule out additional and potentially lethal U.S. military action there.

“We’ve been in quagmires in the Americas for decades, if not centuries, because of decisions just like this,” Kaine said.

The unresolved questions only start with how the U.S. will oversee governance in Venezuela and whether there will be resistance from Venezuelans.

Many lawmakers are also wondering aloud if the ouster of Maduro is part of a larger plan to remake the Western Hemisphere, and perhaps Greenland, by force if necessary.

The White House’s November National Security Strategy said some U.S. military forces should be repositioned from other regions to the Western Hemisphere to deal with problems such as drug trafficking and migration and to establish or expand access in “strategically important locations.”

The strategy also called for bolstering U.S. maritime forces in the region and for “targeted deployments to secure the border and defeat cartels, including where necessary the use of lethal force to replace the failed law enforcement-only strategy of the last several decades.”

At a news conference Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the taking of Maduro as a law enforcement operation supported by the U.S. military.

But Rubio suggested that Cuba’s leaders, in particular, should worry about their own future.

“If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” Rubio said.

[Related: Press Conference: Donald Trump Discusses the Capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela – Jan. 3, 2026]

Trump, for his part, told reporters his administration “wants to surround ourselves with good neighbors.” He said Cuba is “not doing very well right now” and is a “failing nation.”

Trump said Cuba is “very similar” to Venezuela “in the sense that we want to help the people in Cuba.”

[Related: Trump: US will ‘run’ Venezuela after military mission to nab Maduro]

Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, is worried about what might come next across the region.

“Based on the administration’s National Security Strategy, I am deeply concerned that this may be an indication of more to come as the administration seeks to dominate the Western Hemisphere,” Smith said in a statement.

‘What comes next’

But Smith and others are concerned, first off, about the administration’s plans in Venezuela.

“It appears the Trump Administration gave no consideration or plan for what comes next in terms of a functioning government in Venezuela,” Smith said, echoing a widespread Democratic view. “This vacuum threatens to destabilize South America, will likely have no impact on the drug cartels, and could make the situation worse.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Armed Services Committee, asked in a statement: “What does it mean that the U.S. will ‘run’ Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?”

No public hearings have yet been held on the four-month-old campaign of strikes against alleged drug running boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, or on the deployment of a vast U.S. naval armada in those waters or on U.S. military plans regarding Venezuela.

But even top Republicans who have been critical of the Trump administration’s foreign policy efforts largely fell in line Saturday, while expressing a desire to learn more about the operation and its aftermath.

Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he would soon convene a briefing about the administration’s plans.

“This arrest was the culmination of a monthslong effort by the Trump administration to degrade the narco-terrorist organizations that Maduro oversaw,” Wicker said in a statement Saturday. “The Venezuelan people must now act swiftly to put their country back on a path to peace and prosperity, which will redound to the benefit of all their neighbors.”

Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Mitch McConnell similarly commended Trump’s move to sack Maduro. The president “has broad constitutional authority and long historical precedent for the limited use of military force,” McConnell wrote on the social platform X.

But McConnell, R-Ky., made clear he didn’t think it was America’s job to “run” Venezuela for long.

“A free, democratic, and stable Venezuela, led by Venezuelans, is in America’s national security interests,” he wrote. “I expect the Administration to brief Congress soon on how it intends to secure this outcome.”

Some Democrats said Saturday that administration officials, in briefings to lawmakers less than a month ago, lied about their goal to change the leadership of Venezuela — either by not acknowledging it or even, in some cases, allegedly denying it.

“The administration has assured me three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y. “Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans.”

Members were not notified in advance of the operation, Trump confirmed to reporters on Saturday.

Partisan divisions

In addition to Kaine’s war powers resolution, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., has drafted a joint resolution that would direct the removal of U.S. armed forces from any counterdrug strikes that have not been authorized by Congress.

Both chambers have already repeatedly defeated — in largely party-line votes — multiple resolutions opposing Trump’s Caribbean operations.

On Dec. 17, the House narrowly rejected two concurrent resolutions that would have expressed opposition to U.S. military engagements against terror organizations in the Western hemisphere and against Venezuela unless authorized by Congress.

The chamber defeated a concurrent resolution offered by top House Foreign Affairs Democrat Gregory W. Meeks of New York, that would have directed the president to remove the use of armed forces against any presidentially designated terror organization in the hemisphere.

Two Republicans, Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, broke with their party to vote for the resolution, which went down on a 210-216 vote.

On Saturday, though, Bacon was supportive of ousting Maduro.

Another House Republican, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, expressed her opposition to Saturday’s operation.

Two Texas Democrats, Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, bucked their party to vote against Meeks’s resolution.

The House similarly voted down, 211-213, a second concurrent resolution offered by Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., that would have directed the president to remove the use of armed forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela unless authorized by Congress.

Similarly, the Senate, on the strength of GOP votes, blocked two previous attempts to constrain Trump.

On Oct. 8, the Senate did not agree, 48-51, to a motion to discharge from committee a binding joint resolution by Kaine and Sen. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., that would bar military strikes against alleged drug boats.

Then the Senate voted 49-51 on Nov. 6 against discharging from committee another joint resolution from Kaine and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that would have blocked U.S. military action within or against Venezuela.

On both Senate votes, Paul and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski were the only two GOP senators to cross the aisle and support advancing the Democratic resolutions. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., opposed bringing the Schiff resolution to the floor, though he backed doing so with Kaine’s.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2026/01/venezuela_BC_003_010326.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 13:11:45.296039

A state budget deficit, caused in part by the expansion of Medi-Cal and other Democratic priorities, will also challenge lawmakers hoping to backfill cuts by the Trump administration.
“It’s a difficult time for California,” said Limón, who lives in unincorporated Santa Barbara County and is married with a young daughter.
“We need federal immigration reform,” Limón said.
“And that includes a comprehensive look at the state of immigration, the benefit of immigration, the benefit of our immigrant community.","Since President Trump’s immigration raids began sweeping through California’s cities and farm fields, state Senate President Monique Limón has carried a copy of her passport.

“Just in case,” she said.

Limón is one of the most powerful politicians in the state behind Gov. Gavin Newsom, but the detainment of American citizens, including U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla — who was handcuffed by federal agents in Los Angeles in June — showed that no Latino in California is safe.

In July, a farmworker in the country illegally fell to his death during an immigration raid in Camarillo, part of her district, and fear of other sweeps prompted the recent cancellation of a holiday parade in her hometown of Santa Barbara.

Locals have been detained while walking to the grocery store, she said.

“There’s this fear of racial profiling that is happening that I think is very real,” said Limón, 46.

The granddaughter of a Mexican farmworker and the first Latina elected Senate president, Limón ascended to the post in November after a tumultuous year that saw the Democratic-led state under constant attack from Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress.

The coming months will test Limón as the Trump administration ramps up deportations, looks to expand offshore drilling off the Santa Barbara coastline and slashes federal funding for Medicaid and other programs.

Limón, a progressive Democrat, must also work alongside Newsom, who is likely to use his final year as governor to strengthen his reputation as a presidential contender and may clash with Limón and other legislators over budget decisions.

A state budget deficit, caused in part by the expansion of Medi-Cal and other Democratic priorities, will also challenge lawmakers hoping to backfill cuts by the Trump administration.

“It’s a difficult time for California,” said Limón, who lives in unincorporated Santa Barbara County and is married with a young daughter. “Not just our state, but I think the country as a whole.’

On Friday, Limón joined immigration advocates outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Santa Maria to demand answers about the detainment of nearly 150 people in Limón’s central coastal district in late December.

“We can’t let what’s happening be something that we normalize,” Limón said.

Raids last year targeted farms in Limón’s district, an area that includes all of Santa Barbara County and parts of San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties.

For Limón, the fight for immigrant rights is deeply personal.

Limón’s grandfather picked strawberries in Oxnard after coming to the U.S. through the state’s bracero program. The senator draws a link between California’s economy and its undocumented workforce, blaming labor shortages and unharvested crops on the raids.

“We need federal immigration reform,” Limón said. “And that includes a comprehensive look at the state of immigration, the benefit of immigration, the benefit of our immigrant community.

“That is not just in all the taxes they pay, but certainly their contributions to so many sectors of our economy as well.”

A 2019 study by the federal government estimated half of all of the state’s farmworkers are undocumented and the vast majority of workers are from Mexico.

Limón remembered Jaime Alanis Garcia, the farmworker who died in Camarillo in July, in a speech on the Senate floor. She described Garcia calling his family in his final moments and telling them how scared he was.

“After 30 years of working in this country as a farmworker, doing the job that our government, our country, our constituents, has called an essential worker job, that his life would end that day, that way, because of where he was working,” said Limón.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement that more than 10,000 alleged undocumented immigrants have been arrested in Los Angeles since Trump took office last year, but the agency didn’t provide statewide numbers.

DHS “has arrested and deported hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens across the country, including gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers.

“DHS is just getting started under President Donald Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem,” the statement said. “The best is yet to come.”

Limón said “it’s not lost” on her that the granddaughter of immigrants is helping lead the state at a time when Trump wants to remove Mexicans from California.

Growing up in Santa Barbara, she marched with her parents against Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot measure which denied many taxpayer-funded services to undocumented immigrants.

The coastal city was also the site of a massive oil spill in 1969 that killed thousands of birds, fish and sea mammals, and helped launch the state’s environmental movement.

Limón’s own interest in environmentalism was sparked, she said, by the wildfires that erupted in the nearby Santa Ynez Mountains and forced school classes to stay indoors, she said.

The first person in her family to go to college, Limón attended UC Berkeley and received a master’s degree in education from Columbia University.

Petite in stature, she describes herself as an “accidental politician” whose interest in higher education led her to run for her local school board, which led to a campaign for state Assembly, and later, state Senate.

Colleagues, including some Republicans, describe her as reasonable and a policy wonk who loves spreadsheets.

Sen. Henry Stern (D-Los Angeles), who has worked with Limón to target oil drilling, said she is a “lower-key kind person” who doesn’t seek out the spotlight.

“She doesn’t have that pushiness that many politicians tend to have, which is ‘Who is in the front, who gets to be on TV?’” he said.

Former Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez, who now heads the California Labor Federation, recalled Limón’s uphill effort to pass a bill to stop predatory lending. The legislation died the previous session, and support waned.

Gonzalez asked her how she was going to get the votes.

“She said, ‘I am asking you to trust me and let me work this,’” Gonzalez said. The bill passed with bipartisan support and caps interest rates on consumer loans.

Her other high-profile bills include requiring employers to disclose pay ranges in job ads and allowing child-care workers to unionize.

She has frustrated pro-housing groups by declining to vote on some bills, including one to allow more density near transit stops, and by her push to force an environmental review for a controversial development in her Santa Barbara hometown.

In November, she criticized the Trump administration over its announcement to open up the coast to offshore drilling, arguing “new offshore drilling leases lock us into decades of pollution.”

Some of her relatives are politically conservative and she gets an array of questions at family gatherings: “Why didn’t California do this? I heard on the news that this is happening. What does this mean?”

Her extended family is so large that a recent Thanksgiving of nearly 40 family members was considered small.

Her aunt, Mónica Gil, an executive at NBCUniversal Telemundo, introduced Limón at a gala in December to honor her in downtown Los Angeles. During her speech, Limón reminded the crowd that it took 175 years for a woman with her background to be elected Senate president.

“We are starting to see the glass ceiling crack,” said Limón. “We’re not there yet, but that glass ceiling that’s cracking is opening doors.”

Former state Sen. Kevin de León was the first Latino elected Senate president, and the author of the state’s sanctuary law, which limits state and local government cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Complicating the state’s budget process is an anticipated shortfall in the coming year.

Sen. Roger Niello (R-Fair Oaks), vice chair of the budget and fiscal review committee, expressed alarm that California’s expenditures continue to outpace revenues, even though the state isn’t in a recession.

He predicted Limón will be a “good pro tem for Republicans to try to collaborate with” because she “will listen to people.”

The state budget divided some Democrats last year when Newsom proposed ending new Medi-Cal enrollments for some undocumented groups and requiring others to pay monthly premiums. The majority of the Legislature, including Limón, backed the changes.

Sen. María Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), a member of the Latino Caucus, opposed the move and chastised her colleagues for the “betrayal.” “Remember today’s date and what the Senate is doing,” said Durazo during a speech from the Senate floor.

Limón said her starting point with the new budget is to try and “keep the existing programs in place that help Californians without having to do reductions or cuts.”

In early December, dozens of immigrants rights’ advocates met with Limón’s staff to present their priorities for the budget.

The Trump administration last year secured tens of billions of dollars in government funding to hire more immigration officers and build detention centers — infrastructure intended to speed up deportations.

Some advocates want at least $150 million for immigrant legal services in California’s budget, money that would follow an initial outlay last year.

“There is going to be need for permanent funding [for legal services] throughout the Trump administration,” said Masih Fouladi, executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center, who attended the meeting.

Durazo also wants more money for attorneys.

“It actually stops people from getting deported,” said Durazo. “We learned from what worked.”

While the arrests have brought attention to California’s field workers and day laborers, Limón said students and others also need a pathway to citizenship.

“That is only going to come from the federal government,” she said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/87ae9d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4301+0+582/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd2%2F20%2Ff861175a49298099db548e9ce1fd%2F1532205-me-1204-sen-pro-tem-monique-limon-gem-007.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 11:12:15.143253

In one fell swoop, the capture appeared to render the 1973 War Powers Resolution obsolete, if not an outright work of fiction.
Similarly, the deployment of a vast military force off Venezuela, including the largest US aircraft carrier, was carried out without seeking authorization.
Stung by this haughty disregard, congressional Democrats hit out ferociously on Saturday, with insistent demands to be briefed on future actions.
“That is a situation unfortunately that I think the framers of the constitution did not really anticipate,” he said.","Nothing speaks more eloquently of the disempowering of the US Congress under Donald Trump’s second presidency than the brazenly audacious arrest of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia.

Far from recognizing it, Trump did not even acknowledge Congress’s right to know – keeping senior members in the dark until the operation to seize the strongman was under way.

Only after the operation to detain Maduro had begun did the administration bother to tell members of the congressional “gang of eight”: the top Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives, plus the chairs and ranking members of the intelligence committees of the two chambers.

That marks a conspicuous break with convention, even as previously observed by Trump himself. When Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s Quds force was killed in a targeted strike during Trump’s first presidency in January 2020, the gang was punctiliously consulted, people involved in that operation have said.

In one fell swoop, the capture appeared to render the 1973 War Powers Resolution obsolete, if not an outright work of fiction.

The 1973 act – passed in the wake of the Vietnam war amid widespread anxieties about an incipient “imperial presidency” – requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops into hostilities and withdraw them after 60 days, unless Congress authorizes the action or declares war.

It was a reaction to Lyndon Johnson’s perceived abuse of the notorious Tonkin Gulf Resolution of 1964, an ostensibly narrow measure that Johnson ultimately exploited to pursue unlimited war in Vietnam.

Yet long before the operation to seize Maduro, Trump had in effect communicated that he considered such congressional limits null and void by offering up a raft of alternative legal justifications – including executive orders declaring the Venezuelan leader and his henchmen “narco-terrorists” and thus potentially subject to similar precepts that governed the post-2001 “war on terror”.

Its effectiveness in constraining presidents from acts of war has long been shown to be limited, as the prolonged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan attest – although George W Bush received congressional authorization in both cases.

The 1989 invasion of Panama – carried out under the administration of George HW Bush to unseat the central American country’s dictatorial ruler, Manuel Noriega – was conducted without a former declaration of war or specific congressional approval. Bush, however, had taken care to garner bipartisan support on Capitol Hill beforehand.

Nor did Barack Obama seek specific prior congressional approval before the operation to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, but instead acted under the authority of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), passed by Congress after the 11 September 2001 al-Qaida terror attacks on New York and Washington.

Under Trump 2.0, no approval was sought for the mass military build-up off Venezuela’s shores or the estimated 35 lethal strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats that have killed at least 115 people since last September. Similarly, the deployment of a vast military force off Venezuela, including the largest US aircraft carrier, was carried out without seeking authorization.

The disdain implicit in the explanations from Trump and Marco Rubio as to why information on the Maduro raid was withheld even from senior congressional figures – that they cannot be trusted because they might leak – is unmistakable.

“It’s just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say: ‘Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,’” Rubio told reporters.

Stung by this haughty disregard, congressional Democrats hit out ferociously on Saturday, with insistent demands to be briefed on future actions.

“President Trump has made no secret of his intentions to effectively abolish the Congress, and that pattern continues today with his flagrant disregard for the Article 1 war powers of Congress, which is essential to our constitutional system of checks and balances,” said Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker.

Mark Warner, the Democrat’s ranking member on the Senate’s intelligence select committee and a member of the gang of eight, said: “Our constitution places the gravest decisions about the use of military force in the hands of Congress for a reason. Using military force to enact regime change demands the closest scrutiny, precisely because the consequences do not end with the initial strike.”

And, Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator for Virginia who last month tabled a war powers resolution seeking to rein in the administration’s actions in Venezuela, said: “It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy and trade.”

He added: “Where will this go next? Will the president deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies?”

Yet it is hard not to detect an air of impotent futility in the Democrats’ chorus of indignation.

With the exception of a few known Republican rebel figures such as Thomas Massie, a representative from Kentucky, Republican criticism was muted, whatever private misgivings some might have about Trump’s extravagant assumption of presidential powers at their expense.

Matt Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to Bernie Sanders, the leftwing Vermont senator, cited Mike Lee, a Republican senator from Utah, as an example of how far the party’s members in Congress have ceded ground to the president.

Having initially voiced reservations about the lack of authorization from Congress, Lee sharply changed tack – apparently after speaking to Rubio - saying that Maduro’s arrest was within “the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect US personnel from an actual or imminent attack”.

Duss contrasted Lee’s supine stance with his previous actions, when he jointed Sanders to support a war powers resolution aimed at restricting US support for Saudi Arabia’s military intervention in Yemen during Trump’s first term.

“Senator Lee spoke very eloquently about the constitutional principles at stake, and that was just when the United States was only supporting the Saudi emirati war in Yemen,” said Duss. “So for him to come out now and say the president has inherent authority to invade a country and kidnap a foreign leader without any authorization from Congress, is just wild.

“It’s been clear for a while that he, along with many other Republicans, have decided that their political careers depend on staying in the good graces of Donald Trump and there’s really no past principle that they won’t abandon.”

Duss said the instruments available to Congress under the War Powers Resolution were no longer fit for purpose. He suggested that the legislation needed to be rewritten, in the manner of the national security powers reform bill, which Sanders introduced – ironically, along with Lee – during Trump’s first presidency.

The legislation was never enacted and even if reintroduced and passed would likely be vetoed by Trump – even if the Democrats were to recapture one or both chambers of Congress in November’s midterm elections.

Short of a foreign policy disaster in Venezuela that could produce a groundswell of Republican opinion that might then yield a Senate supermajority to override a presidential veto, such legislation’s only hope, Duss conceded, is the future election of a sympathetic Democratic president.

“That is a situation unfortunately that I think the framers of the constitution did not really anticipate,” he said. “Given that so many of the kind of separation of powers and the checks and balances presume that you’re going to have leaders who care about the law and who care about these processes.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0875114693379a7bee8c3b7b8c1ae529d57fd01/1965_611_1894_1516/master/1894.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=43a12bd45a470179a5d491445a342f9a",N,,2026-01-04 11:12:18.874610

For the past three years, the Bakhtani family lived in the Capital Region using their education to give back to others.

“My sons are not criminals. They are hardworking men who labor more than 40 hours a week to provide for their families.”

In a message from the mother of the Bakhtani family – read by Afghan American Community Center President, Yousaf Sherzad – she describes the pain she felt when her husband and three sons were detained by ICE at the beginning of December.

“As a mother, my heart is breaking. I have endured war, exile, hunger and loss, but this pain is beyond my strength.”

The Bakhtani family were taken to an ICE detention center in Buffalo, one son forced to leave behind a 2-month-old daughter. After weeks, the father was released with only one of his sons. He tells CBS6 that his son has already gained U.S. citizenship – and everyone else is going through the proper channels to do the same.

“I have asylum pending and I have my social security work permit, which is not expired, in my wallet. Also, I have a state ID.”

The case has sparked outrage from several elected officials – including a representative from Albany’s new mayor, Dr. Dorcey Applyrs.

Chief of staff Nesta Littlejohn said, “This administration is not going to back down from the scare tactics coming from Washington, DC. This administration is going to uphold Albany’s sanctuary city status.”

“Yes, of course, we need national immigration reform, but creating a reign of terror in our streets is not the way to do it.”

Vock,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/04/operation-midway-blitz-cost/,"Operation Midway Blitz — which yielded about 4,500 arrests over four months, according to DHS’ own estimates — illustrates the enormous cost and resources such a goal would require.
There is the human toll: In September, ICE agents shot and killed Silverio Villegas González, a Mexican immigrant, during a traffic stop in Franklin Park.
“Operation Midway Blitz turned ordinary life into a risk for thousands of Illinois residents,” Pritzker said in a recent statement.
And these totals don’t reflect the use of similar weapons beyond Broadview, where immigration agents often used tear gas and pepper balls on local residents.
Shortly before Christmas, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump lacked authority to deploy the Illinois National Guard for Midway Blitz.","As the Trump administration steadily hypes the benefits it sees from its monthslong immigration enforcement surge in Illinois, federal officials have been less eager to address the other side of the ledger: the fiscal cost of Operation Midway Blitz.

Activists, Illinois Democrats in Congress and members of the public have repeatedly sought an accounting of the operation, only to see their requests repeatedly stonewalled. But a Tribune review of court filings, databases and other public records detailing the scope of the incursion and the typical costs of its components begins to paint a clearer picture.

Since Midway Blitz began in early September, the federal government has spent at least $59 million deploying and equipping federal personnel and detaining the roughly 4,500 people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents during that period, the Tribune found.

The analysis — a conservative, back-of-the-envelope estimate — offers one of the first examinations of the operation’s price tag as criticism has escalated over the lack of transparency surrounding how it was conducted and its taxpayer cost.

“For months, the Trump administration has trampled over our Constitution and failed to answer even the most basic questions about how they are conducting immigration enforcement,” U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Naperville said recently, after touring several ICE facilities. “People deserve to know how federal resources are being used in their name.”

Officials from the Department of Homeland Security and its two primary immigration agencies — ICE and Border Patrol — declined to answer detailed questions about Midway Blitz’s costs, without refuting the Tribune’s findings. Instead, a top DHS official emphasized the administration’s broader immigration agenda and criticized Illinois Democratic elected officials, including Gov. JB Pritzker, for limiting cooperation with federal authorities.

“The cost of American lives saved is uncalculatable,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement. “Our law enforcement is removing thousands of convicted murderers, rapists, child abusers from the country. President Trump is committed to keeping Americans safe.”

“Sanctuary politicians like Governor Pritzker are providing a safe haven for the world’s criminal illegal aliens in Chicago on the taxpayer’s dime,” she added. “Does The Chicago Tribune intend to write a story on the billion-dollar price tag of benefits going toward illegal aliens in sanctuary cities?”

The term “sanctuary cities” refers to jurisdictions that limit when and how local law enforcement may cooperate with federal immigration agencies in specific circumstances. It has nothing to do with public benefits. Eligibility rules for most public benefit programs — such as Medicaid, food stamps and cash assistance — have federal rules that generally bar immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission from receiving them.

Pressed to share the source of the “billion-dollar” figure, explain the apparent discrepancy in the administration’s claims and provide additional details about Midway Blitz spending, Border Patrol spokesperson Steven Bansbach responded in an email: “We have nothing further to add.”

The Tribune’s review of government expenses reveals a costly and sprawling operation that extended well beyond immigration arrests, encompassing a surge of manpower, overtime pay, and expenditures on aircraft, crowd-control munitions, private contractors and hundreds of National Guard troops kept on standby.

The most visible component has been the addition of about 300 government agents — mostly Border Patrol, along with some ICE officers — who traveled to Chicago from outside the region.

Agents conducted immigration sweeps in ethnic neighborhoods, at Home Depot parking lots and even at a Halloween parade. They also were involved in the build-up at ICE’s processing center in west suburban Broadview, where sometimes tense protests over detainee conditions resulted in agents pushing demonstrators, firing baton rounds and unleashing clouds of chemical irritants. In one two-week span alone, records show, ICE used $100,000 worth of less-than-lethal munitions on crowds outside the facility.

Processing the hundreds of detainees also was a significant cost, in terms of manpower and materials, records show. Meanwhile, 500 National Guard troops from Texas and Illinois slept, ate and trained on bases far from the action, costing as much as $19 million, according to one estimate from U.S. Sen Dick Durbin’s office.

The Tribune’s financial breakdown underscores Trump’s enforcement priorities. In one small but telling detail, the administration approved dozens of Black Hawk helicopter flights but provided only cheap foil blankets for detainees.

The costs in the Chicago region have implications for the rest of the country as well. While Trump failed in using Chicago or other cities as “training grounds” for military forces, the scale and tactics of Midway Blitz suggest a blueprint for similar operations elsewhere, including areas the Trump administration has targeted for enforcement actions, such as Charlotte, New Orleans and the Twin Cities.

Plus, Trump’s top domestic adviser, Stephen Miller, an ardent opponent of immigration, has previously called for ICE to arrest at a “minimum” 3,000 people per day nationwide for immigration violations. Operation Midway Blitz — which yielded about 4,500 arrests over four months, according to DHS’ own estimates — illustrates the enormous cost and resources such a goal would require.

A high-stakes exercise

Of course, money isn’t the only way to measure Midway Blitz’s costs.

There is the human toll: In September, ICE agents shot and killed Silverio Villegas González, a Mexican immigrant, during a traffic stop in Franklin Park. A longtime Chicago resident with diabetes also died, reportedly of natural causes, while in federal custody in Michigan. In another incident, a Border Patrol agent shot a woman five times before agents arrested her; a judge dismissed the charges against her in November.

The operation also disrupted daily life in Chicago and many suburbs. When federal agents rolled into neighborhoods, residents formed makeshift whistle brigades to warn neighbors and document encounters.

“Operation Midway Blitz turned ordinary life into a risk for thousands of Illinois residents,” Pritzker said in a recent statement. “This campaign of intimidation tore communities apart, hurt our economy, and violated the basic rights of people who call Illinois home.”

The Trump administration says the heavy federal presence has improved public safety, claiming the operation targeted violent, “worst of the worst,” criminals. But an earlier Tribune analysis found two-thirds of detainees had no criminal record and only 1.5% of them had been convicted of a violent felony or sex crime.

A public show of force

The mass deportation effort started, cryptically, on Sept. 6 with a Trump social media post. Sharing an image inspired by the Vietnam War film “Apocalypse Now,” the Republican president wrote, “‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning…’ Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

Two days later, DHS made it official, announcing the beginning of Operation Midway Blitz.

“This operation will target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,” McLaughlin promised at the time. “President Trump and (DHS) Secretary (Kristi) Noem have a clear message: no city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.”

The largest contingent of new federal forces was for Border Patrol, which brought between 200 and 232 agents to the operation, according to court testimony. The agency, which typically has little presence in the Chicago area, also used helicopters, boats and other vehicles.

At an annual salary of $75,000 — which is about average for an agent with a bachelor’s degree, including overtime, premium pay for Sundays, holidays and night shifts — the cost for paying 200 agents for 10 weeks is nearly $3 million.

Border Patrol personnel costs were likely even more than $3 million. Nearly 10 weeks elapsed between September and Nov. 10, when Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino posed for photos with at least 166 agents in Millennium Park before leaving for his home state of North Carolina. But Border Patrol officials insisted the operation did not end with Bovino’s departure and other enforcement actions continued before ramping up again last month when Bovino briefly returned to the Chicago area with at least 100 agents. Border Patrol officials have not provided details on how many agents remain in the Chicago region but other surges are anticipated in 2026.

Many immigration agents stayed in local hotels rather than the Great Lakes Naval Station in North Chicago. At the standard government rate of $110 per night, housing 200 agents for 10 weeks would exceed $1.5 million.

Add to that the $92 daily per diem for food, an amount set by the General Services Administration, and the cost increases by another $1.2 million.

Helicopters were another major expense.

Border Patrol deployed Black Hawk helicopters to the region and increased its use of other copters.

Records obtained by Flightradar24, a popular flight-tracking service, showed DHS has primarily used five helicopters in the region since September. Most departed from DuPage Airport in West Chicago, about 30 miles west of downtown Chicago.

Two Black Hawk helicopters flew at least 33 missions totaling nearly 29 hours of flight time, according to Flightradar24. Based on the U.S. Government Accountability Office’s estimate from six years ago that the Army spent $3,116 per flight hour on Black Hawk operation and support costs, those 33 missions would have been close to $90,000 at 2019 rates.

It’s likely the figure is even higher, as Flightradar24 data may not include all flights during the surge. The systems don’t always detect low-flying helicopters. And government crews occasionally switch off the choppers’ ADS-B signal to prevent public detection, like what happened last year when an Army Black Hawk collided with a passenger jet near Washington, D.C. Flightradar24 data does not appear to reflect a flight that corresponds with the raid of a South Shore apartment building on Sept. 30.

In addition to the Black Hawks, the Department of Homeland Security has used three lighter Airbus H125 helicopters in the Chicago area for 71 flights totaling 77 hours since September. Operation and support costs are more difficult to pinpoint for the H125, but commercial sources indicate a minimum hourly rate of $2,000, which means the 71 flights cost roughly $154,000.

The Tribune’s estimate didn’t include costs for four boats used by Board Patrol or rental cars that federal agents used.

72-hour workweek

Unlike Border Patrol, ICE had a sizable presence in the Chicago area before Midway Blitz, with about 65 enforcement officers, including 31 at the Broadview processing center, court records show.

When the blitz began, Broadview staff shifted from five 8-hour days to six 12-hour days per week, effectively increasing their workweek from 40 hours to 72 hours. At time-and-a-half for overtime, that equaled 88 hours of regular pay.

For 31 employees earning about $75,000 annually, the additional cost was $54,000 per week. It’s unclear how long the heightened workload lasted but if it was for all 10 weeks, the added pay totaled about $540,000.

As protests and detainee numbers at the Broadview facility grew, ICE brought in reinforcements. Five teams — about 80 agents total — arrived from cities including El Paso, New York and Phoenix, according to court testimony, presumably taking them from their regular duties. If those 80 officers averaged $75,000 per year and worked 10 weeks for Midway Blitz, their total pay would have been about $1.2 million.

It’s unclear what ICE’s lodging arrangements are. But if the 80 agents used $110 hotel rooms for 10 weeks, that would be another $616,000, and their per diem would add $515,200.

There were also collateral costs the Tribune didn’t include in its totals.

ICE called on agents from the Border Patrol, FBI, Bureau of Prisons, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Homeland Security Investigations to help run the Broadview facility, though how many offices and how long they worked there remains unclear.

Underwood said after touring the Broadview facility that ICE has also used private contractors from Paragon Systems to support operations there. Officials from Paragon did not return calls seeking comment about their contract.

What’s more, the Broadview facility sent at least 131 unprocessed detainees to ICE’s El Paso facility for processing, which, in turn, strained El Paso’s resources.

Underwood said ICE has also been using administrative offices in downtown Chicago, as well as a Homeland Security Investigations field office, located in Lombard, to handle an overflow of detainees. The west suburban lawmaker said 50 to 60 ICE officers and support staff were working out of the downtown office in late December. Underwood was told that an additional 60 would be starting soon. ICE intends to hire 805 new officers across the six-state region that covers Chicago in the near future.

Policing protests added further expense. In just two weeks in September, ICE agents used a variety of chemicals and less-lethal projectiles on protesters that cost $100,000, records show. ICE officers continued using those munitions for nearly another two weeks, presumably doubling the total cost. And these totals don’t reflect the use of similar weapons beyond Broadview, where immigration agents often used tear gas and pepper balls on local residents. They also don’t include the cost of deploying state or local police forces to Broadview to assist ICE.

Handling detainees

Since 2022, Illinois law has banned immigration detention centers in the state. It also bars local governments from contracting with ICE to hold detainees. That has not only created a bottleneck at Broadview, which went from a processing center to a de facto detention center during Midway Blitz, but also meant that detainees from Illinois were sent to far-flung destinations across the Midwest and South.

At the same time, the Trump administration has curtailed policies allowing detainees to be released on bond. As a result, the number of people in ICE custody nationwide rose from 39,000 when Trump returned to office in January 2025 to 61,000 by late August, according to the Migration Policy Institute. That number could grow to 107,000 by January, according to its researchers.

Republicans in Congress responded in July with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included $45 billion to build immigrant detention facilities over the next four years. That’s three times as much per year for detention as ICE spent last fiscal year.

Midway Blitz was an especially abrupt shift in immigration enforcement in Illinois, which saw the largest increase in arrests of any state over the five weeks after the operation began, according to the Marshall Project, with detentions rising to six times what they were before September.

While staffing expenses piled up at Broadview, ICE kept expenses for detainees’ welfare to a minimum. The facility lacks showers, beds, medical services and food preparation space. A lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees alleged agents provided only cold Subway sandwiches — regardless of whether they met an individual’s dietary needs — and bottled water.

After bringing detainees to Broadview, ICE typically moved them to facilities in other states. At least 400 people taken into custody at Broadview between September and mid-October were sent to another country.

The Migration Policy Institute estimated that, as of September, detainees nationwide spent an average of 44 days in detention, with costs averaging $152 per day.

The Department of Homeland Security said it had arrested more than 4,500 people during Midway Blitz. The agency has not provided more detailed information about the detainees’ backgrounds or current status.

But if each of those 4,500 people spent 44 days in detention, and detention costs $152 per night, the cost of housing the detainees would be more than $30 million.

The population boom in ICE detention facilities has also led to a major increase in the chartered flights the agency uses to move and deport detainees. That nationwide increase is reflected in a near doubling of ICE flights out of the Gary/Chicago International Airport over the last year. At last count, there were 93 outbound flights, with 20 occurring after September, according to Human Rights First, an advocacy group that monitors ICE’s air operations.

ICE’s chartered flights cost an average of $8,577 per hour, according to the agency. The average flight duration from Gary is 2 hours and 20 minutes, according to Human Rights First. Therefore, the cost of the 20 flights since September would be approximately $400,000.

But flights operated by ICE Air Operations often include multiple stops en route to their final destination, which could substantially increase the cost of transferring detainees from Gary if they remain on the plane the entire time. The typical flights from Gary included two stops before they ended, according to Human Rights Watch.

If all legs of the journey were equal in duration, the total flight cost would be closer to $800,000.

‘Money was wasted’

Some of the highest expenses stemmed from personnel largely kept out of daily enforcement.

After courts blocked Trump from deploying the Illinois and Texas National Guard to support the mission, about 200 Texas Guard troops were sent to a training center near Chicago in October.

During their 41-day deployment, which ended in mid-November, the Texas troops spent less than 24 hours patrolling the Broadview facility.

Meanwhile, 300 Illinois Guard members were federalized by Trump and stationed at a training site in Marseilles, a state-owned military base about 75 miles southwest of Chicago. They never deployed for the stated mission.

Durbin’s office, citing figures from the Army, said the expected operations, maintenance and personnel costs for federalizing all 500 National Guard soldiers in Illinois for a full two months was $19.4 million, which works out to $323,333 per day.

“Ninety-eight percent of that money was wasted, wasted to create a reign of fear and terror in this Chicago community,” Durbin said at a November news conference.

Shortly before Christmas, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump lacked authority to deploy the Illinois National Guard for Midway Blitz. The president said just days ago that he would end his efforts to deploy National Guard troops to Illinois and other states — for now.

But even if the Guard members return home, the operation’s ever-growing financial costs are expected to continue rising.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CTC-L-Broadview-ICE-protest05.jpg?w=1024&h=527,N,,2026-01-04 09:57:04.358402

“A Democratic governor could declare the Republican party a terrorist group and ban it from state contracts or ban it from owning land,” Mitchell said.
“Cair Texas is open for business and continues to protect the community and so is Cair Florida,” Mitchell said.
He believes that the erosion of support for Israel in the US is motivating its supporters to fuel anti-Muslim hatred.
The incidents of hate that Cair has documented have ranged from discrimination in education and employment, to verbal harassment, vandalism and violent attacks.","The deputy director of the US’s biggest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group warns that Republican governors’ steps to declare his organization a “terrorist organization” won’t stop with the Muslim community.

“No governor should have the power to unilaterally declare a civil rights or advocacy group he disagrees with a terrorist organization, take punitive action against them, all in violation of due process and free speech,” Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the deputy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told the Guardian this month. “If any governor can get away with abusing that kind of power, then no organization is safe.”

In November, the Texas governor Greg Abbott designated Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood, the century-old movement founded in Egypt and active through chapters overseas, “foreign terrorist and transnational criminal organizations”. The Florida governor Ron DeSantis issued a similar order in early December.

Mitchell cautioned conservatives who care about free speech to take the threat seriously.

“A Democratic governor could declare the Republican party a terrorist group and ban it from state contracts or ban it from owning land,” Mitchell said. “Anyone could be on the chopping block if a governor is able to win this power to simply declare American organizations to be banned terrorist groups without ever even charging them with wrongdoing.”

Texas’s designation bars the groups from acquiring property in the state and authorizes the attorney general, Ken Paxton, to “sue to shut them down”, while Florida’s order prohibits the groups, and “any person known to have provided material support or resources” to them, from receiving any state contracts, employment or funding.

While the orders are limited to the two states, national conservatives have long agitated against both groups, and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, has said that similar orders at the federal level are “in the works”.

The Washington-based non-profit organization, which was founded in 1994, has called the orders “unconstitutional and defamatory” adding that they have “no basis in law or fact”. Cair has sued in both states in response to the orders.

The Texas directive accuses Cair of having ties to Hamas, which has been designated as a terrorist group by the US government, while the Florida order claims that Cair was founded by “persons connected to the Muslim Brotherhood” and connects the Muslim Brotherhood to Hamas. Cair has repeatedly denied ties to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.

Mitchell believes that Cair’s “advocacy for the Palestinian people” is what has “driven Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott and other Israel-first politicians absolutely crazy”.

“Let’s be very clear: the facts are clear, Cair is an independent organization,” he said. “It has never been an offshoot or subsidiary or partner of the Muslim Brotherhood or any other foreign entity, much less a foreign terrorist group.”

Mitchell noted that “we condemn terrorism so often that Isis quite literally called for the assassination of our national executive director. We still have the publication they issued with a bull’s-eye on his head. And so that’s what real terrorists think of us.” (In 2016, Isis included a photo of Cair’s director, Nihad Awad, on a hit list of American Muslims.)

So far, he said, the designations have not disrupted Cair’s daily operations. “Cair Texas is open for business and continues to protect the community and so is Cair Florida,” Mitchell said.

He dismissed the proclamations as “publicity stunts” that he says are “meant to smear our organization and satisfy the anti-Muslim, pro-Israel crowd in their base”.

Still, Mitchell said, the designations and orders carry consequences, such as the restrictions on land purchases and state contracts, which, he argues, are “obviously unconstitutional”.

To Mitchell, the actions against Cair echo the attacks against the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the 1950s and 60s.

“Alabama shut down the NAACP in their state for eight years, until the supreme court intervened and allowed the NAACP to resume its work,” he said. “Texas tried to shut down the NAACP chapters in Houston and other cities.”

“To me, I see a very clear historical parallel between the targeting of our organization today and the target of Black civil rights groups in the 1960s even down to the crazy accusation that Black rights leaders and organizations were part of a communist plot to take over America,” he said.

He believes that the erosion of support for Israel in the US is motivating its supporters to fuel anti-Muslim hatred.

“It is very evident to us that pro Israel lobby groups and anti-Muslim hate groups are deliberately stirring up anti-Muslim hysteria to try to distract the American public from their Israel-first agenda,” he said.

Mitchell noted that in the US, anti-Muslim bigotry and hate incidents soared after 9/11, then declined, before rising again “dramatically” amid conspiracy theories about Barack Obama during his presidency, Donald Trump’s call during his first presidential campaign for a ban on all Muslims entering the US and high-profile attacks linked to Isis.

Around 2021, reports of anti-Muslim hate finally started to go down, he said. But since the fallout from the Hamas attacks of October 2023 and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza, Mitchell said, “anti Muslim bigotry” has “spiked up to a level that it had not been ever, as far as our records”.

The incidents of hate that Cair has documented have ranged from discrimination in education and employment, to verbal harassment, vandalism and violent attacks.

And while Cair’s data for 2025 is not yet available, Mitchell said that, anecdotally, the anti-Muslim rhetoric this year “is dramatically worse this year than it was last year”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e4adcf3c5763f9f2203b217f79bcf380d34a30/1_0_1063_850/master/1063.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8518bc0bdabe1a65eddd7f3f9c1227b4",N,,2026-01-04 11:57:20.585649

Authorities have not yet released the full identity of the victim. Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, alongside Porter’s family and loved ones, are holding a community vigil in honor of Porter on Sunday. The remembrance will be held at the Village Pointe complex (17171 Roscoe Blvd., Northridge) where the fatal shooting took place in the final hour of Wednesday.

“This vigil is about remembering Keith as a human being, not a headline or a hashtag and standing with his family as they demand truth and accountability,” said a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles organizer in a statement. “An off-duty federal agent took his life, and the community deserves clear answers, full transparency and justice.”

Friends and family of Porter expressed sadness over the sudden loss on social media.

“This is the type of friend a lot of us wish we had,” Bryon Taylor wrote on Facebook, who described Porter as a funny, cool and down-to-earth person who loved life.

“I genuinely & whole heartedly loved this man. Pooter was an amazing friend to me. Whenever and for whatever I needed, he was there. This really really breaks my heart ... Praying for his mother, children, and his entire family,” Mimi Love wrote on Facebook.

One Instagram user, who claimed to work with Porter at Home Depot, commented on his last Instagram post: “He is one of the most popular people in this store. He’s already a legend around here from just being him ... This is beyond heartbreaking.”

Authorities have not yet identified the ICE agent responsible.

The New Year’s Eve death is under investigation by the Robbery-Homicide Division, which handles all shootings by officers from outside law enforcement agencies, said LAPD Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton.

Since the incident involves a federal agent, the case is also being handled by the FBI, the U.S. Department of Justice and Homeland Security Investigations.

After the incident, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the ICE agent was responding to an “active shooter situation” at his apartment complex.

However, the lack of injuries to anyone else at the scene and statements from neighbors have fueled speculation that Porter may have been ringing in the new year by shooting a gun into the air, a felony that is punishable by prison due to the high risk of death or injury.

Hamilton said it was “too early to tell” if that was the case.

Police detectives have not yet spoken to the ICE agent due to protocols on how deadly force investigations are conducted with federal law enforcement officers. “We won’t interview them for days,” said Hamilton.

After the incident, Homeland Security officials released a brief statement that said the agent opened fire “in order to protect his life and that of others.”

“He was forced to defensively use his weapon and exchanged gunfire with the shooter,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary of public affairs, adding that the ICE agent contacted police afterward.

According to a City News Service report, police officers responded to the Valley Village Pointe apartment complex at Roscoe Boulevard and Amestoy Avenue in Northridge at 11:37 p.m. Wednesday.

Early reports by the news service quoted an unnamed LAPD officer as saying the man who was killed was firing an assault rifle into the air. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.

By Friday morning, a small makeshift memorial of votive candles and roses had sprung up outside of a ground-level apartment neighbors said was associated with the man who was killed. Nobody answered the door when a Times reporter knocked Friday.

Several neighbors expressed alarm at what happened, including one who said stray bullets had struck her apartment.

Ahead of Saturday’s assault, the Republican-controlled Congress rejected War Powers Resolutions aimed at preventing Trump from launching a war on Venezuela without lawmakers’ approval.","Members of the U.S. Congress on Saturday demanded emergency legislative action to prevent the Trump administration from taking further military action in Venezuela after the president threatened a “second wave” of attacks and said the U.S. will control the South American country’s government indefinitely.

Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), said that “Congress should vote immediately on a War Powers Resolution to stop” President Donald Trump, whose administration has for months unlawfully bombed boats in international waters and threatened a direct military assault on Venezuela without lawmakers’ approval.

“Trump has no right to take us to war with Venezuela. This is reckless and illegal,” said Casar. “My entire life, politicians have been sending other people’s kids to die in reckless regime change wars. Enough. No new wars.”

Another prominent CPC member, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), said in response to the bombing of Venezuela and capture of its president that “these are the actions of a rogue state.”

“Trump’s illegal and unprovoked bombing of Venezuela and kidnapping of its president are grave violations of international law and the U.S. Constitution,” Tlaib wrote on social media. “The American people do not want another regime change war abroad.”

Progressives weren’t alone in criticizing the administration’s unauthorized military action in Venezuela. Establishment Democrats, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California and others, also called for urgent congressional action in the face of Trump’s latest unlawful bombing campaign.

“Without congressional approval or the buy-in of the public, Trump risks plunging a hemisphere into chaos and has broken his promise to end wars instead of starting them,” Schiff said in a statement. “Congress must bring up a new War Powers Resolution and reassert its power to authorize force or to refuse to do so. We must speak for the American people who profoundly reject being dragged into new wars.”

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said he will force a Senate vote next week on a bipartisan War Powers Resolution to block additional U.S. military action in Venezuela.

“Where will this go next?” Kaine asked in a statement. “Will the president deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies? Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people’s elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk.”

“It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy, and trade,” Kaine added. “My bipartisan resolution stipulating that we should not be at war with Venezuela absent a clear congressional authorization will come up for a vote next week.”

The lawmakers’ push for legislative action came as Trump clearly indicated that his administration isn’t done intervening in Venezuela’s internal politics — and plans to exploit the country’s vast oil reserves.

During a press conference on Saturday, Trump said that the U.S. “is going to run” Venezuela, signaling the possibility of a troop deployment.

“We’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” the president said in response to a reporter’s question, adding vaguely that his administration is “designating various people” to run the government.

Whether the GOP-controlled Congress acts to constrain the Trump administration will depend on support from Republicans, who have largely applauded the U.S. attack on Venezuela and capture of Maduro. In separate statements, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) described the operation as “decisive” and justified.

Ahead of Saturday’s assault, the Republican-controlled Congress rejected War Powers Resolutions aimed at preventing Trump from launching a war on Venezuela without lawmakers’ approval.

One Republican lawmaker who had raised constitutional concerns about Saturday’s actions, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, appeared to drop them after a phone call with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

But Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) noted in a statement that both Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “looked every senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn’t about regime change.”

“I didn’t trust them then, and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” said Kim. “Trump rejected our constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2253891367.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 11:12:23.655521

The network also works to dispel false rumors of ICE sightings, share verified information with local news outlets, and post updates about ICE activity on social media. The network officially launched in early December, but the group has been recruiting volunteers and organizing trainings since spring of 2025.

Rapid response networks are volunteer-led community organizations that monitor ICE activity and support immigrant communities. These networks largely came to prominence during President Donald Trump’s first term, following his administration’s increased targeting and removal of immigrants lacking permanent legal status.

According to a press release from the Mendocino County network, “An important part of the network is the sharing of community education so people know their rights and how to protect themselves.”

Judy Abeja Hummel of Boonville, a volunteer and member of the network’s steering committee, said in an interview that one of their goals is to support local immigrant neighbors and friends who are fearful of ICE raids.

“I hope that ICE does not come to this community, but if they do, I want us to be ready to stand up in solidarity with all of our neighbors. To me this isn’t a question of immigration, this is a question of civil rights, human rights, and human decency,” Hummel said. “Many of my Latino neighbors have been afraid to leave the house, or they just go to work and come straight home. There have been many false alarms and rumors that keep re-traumatizing people. One important thing we offer is checking every rumor that comes along and verifying or debunking it as quickly as possible, so that people can go on living their lives.”

Hummel also said the network has trained 125 local volunteers to help monitor and verify ICE sightings. She said the steering committee has about six to eight people leading the group’s efforts. The network is still looking for a local volunteer coordinator for the Round Valley region.

“We are divided into five regions — Ukiah, Willits, Anderson Valley, North Coast, and South Coast, and each area has a local volunteer coordinator organizing, vetting, and bringing volunteers onboard,” Hummel said.

The Mendocino County Rapid Response Network will also be hosting “know your rights” trainings in Spanish and English, has a program to support businesses in being prepared for immigration raids, and is developing a group of volunteers to accompany immigrants to their court hearings.

Trump also said that Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as interim president. The US president said Rodríguez had talked to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and was “essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again”.

However, Rodríguez criticised the US military action as “brutal aggression” on state television and called for Maduro’s immediate release.

Maduro has led Venezuela since 2013, succeeding an ideological ally, Hugo Chavez, who had been in office since 1999. Under both men, US relations with Venezuela frayed over foreign policy, oil and human rights.

In July 2024, Maduro declared victory after an election that international observers described as fraudulent. The country’s opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, reportedly received about 70 percent of the vote.

Tensions between Trump and Maduro escalated in September after the US government began attacking vessels off the coast of Venezuela, killing more than 100 people, in what Trump described as an effort to thwart drug smuggling.

When a reporter asked Trump during the Mar-a-Lago media event whether he had spoken to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado following Maduro’s arrest, Trump said that Machado “doesn’t have the support or the respect within the country”.

Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for democracy in Venezuela, had a 72 percent approval rating from Venezuelans in a March 2025 poll by ClearPath Strategies.

Trump said, without evidence, that the US’s role in governing Venezuela “won’t cost us anything” because US oil companies would invest in new infrastructure in the oil-rich country. “It’s going to make a lot of money,” he said.

PolitiFact fact-checked Trump’s and Rubio’s statements from the news conference.

Rubio: “It’s just not the kind of mission that you can pre-notify [Congress about] because it endangers the mission.”

The Trump administration’s lack of warning to Congress bucks laws and precedents.

Rubio said that members of Congress were not notified in advance of the US actions on Venezuela. Trump said the administration was concerned about Congress potentially leaking news of the administration’s decision to capture Maduro.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, praised the operation as a “decisive action”.

But Congressional Democrats said that Congress should have been notified in advance. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, said, “Maduro is terrible. But Trump put American servicemembers at risk with this unauthorised attack.”

Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, said Trump and his cabinet were not forthcoming about their intentions for regime change in Venezuela, so “we are left with no understanding of how the administration is preparing to mitigate risks to the US, and we have no information regarding a long-term strategy following today’s extraordinary escalation”.

The US Constitution assigns Congress the right to declare war. The last time this happened was during World War II.

Since then, presidents have generally initiated military action using their constitutionally granted powers as commander-in-chief without an official declaration of war.

Since Congress passed the 1973 War Powers Resolution, the president has had to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing the US military into hostilities, and terminate the use of the military within 60 days unless Congress approves. If approval is not granted and the president deems it an emergency, an additional 30 days are granted for ending operations.

In recent decades, congressional consent has usually been granted through an authorisation for the use of military force. But such an authorisation has not been passed for operations in Venezuela. Kaine and other lawmakers have pursued legislation – so far fruitlessly – to prohibit the use of federal funds for any use of military force in or against Venezuela without congressional authorisation.

The Trump administration has whittled away at prior notification requirements. Under federal law, eight bipartisan senior members of Congress must receive prior notice of particularly sensitive covert actions. In June 2025, the administration told Republicans, but not Democrats, about a forthcoming US strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. For the Venezuela operation, it appears no lawmakers were notified in advance.

Trump: Each US boat strike off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 people

The Trump administration has struck at least 32 vessels, killing about 115 people, in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean since September. Trump said previously that the boats were carrying drugs en route to the US, and during the news conference, he said the drugs on each boat would kill “on average, 25,000 people”.

However, experts on drugs and Venezuela told PolitiFact that the country plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the US. And the administration has provided no evidence about the type or quantity of drugs it says were on the boats. This lack of information makes it impossible to know how many lethal doses of the drugs could have been destroyed.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 73,000 US drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025. This means that the drugs on 32 boats, which would have killed 800,000 people based on Trump’s claim, would be responsible for nearly 11 times the number of US overdose deaths in one year.

Trump: “Maduro sent savage and murderous gangs, including the bloodthirsty prison gang Tren de Aragua, to terrorise American communities nationwide.”

There is no evidence that Maduro sent members of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua to the US.

The US Justice Department indictment against Maduro does not mention Trump’s statement.

An April report from the US National Intelligence Council contradicted Trump’s statements about links between Maduro and Tren de Aragua.

“While Venezuela’s permissive environment enables [Tren de Aragua, or TDA] to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,” the report said.

Trump: Venezuela ‘stole’ US oil in the past.

[We probably need an italics statement here about the verdict?]

In the early 20th century, Venezuela’s long-serving hardline leader, Juan Vicente Gomez, allowed foreign companies almost exclusive access to the country’s oil resources.

In 1975, after decades of seeking greater control of its oil resources, Venezuela nationalised its oil industry.

“Trump’s claim that Venezuela has stolen oil and land from the US is baseless,” Francisco Rodríguez, a Venezuelan economist at the University of Denver, told The Washington Post. “The US was much more interested in having Venezuela be a provider of oil — relatively cheap oil — than to have a production collapse in Venezuela,” Rodríguez added.

As a result, the change was “relatively uncontroversial” at the time, he said.

US oil companies, including Exxon and Mobil as well as Gulf, now Chevron, lost about $5bn each in assets, and were compensated $1bn each, according to news reports, The Washington Post reported.

But Rodríguez said the companies did not push for additional compensation at the time, in part because no forum existed to do so.

In general, experts have told PolitiFact that invading a country to take its oil would be both illegal and unethical. In 2016, Trump mused about how the US should have taken Iraq’s oil when it invaded to remove its then-leader, Saddam Hussein.

Experts pointed to the annex to The Hague Convention of 1907 on the Laws and Customs of War, which says that “private property … must be respected [and] cannot be confiscated”. It also says that “pillage is formally forbidden”.

“If ‘to the victors go the spoils’ was legal doctrine, then we would have believed that [Saddam Hussein] should have been able to keep Kuwait City after he invaded [Kuwait]” in 1990, terrorism analyst Daveed Gartenstein-Ross told PolitiFact in 2016. “But we viewed that — quite rightly — as an act of aggression under the UN Charter.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-03T183233Z_1419358269_RC2UTIACH6F3_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA-1767483432.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2026-01-04 00:12:31.925894

Brandan P. Buck, Research Fellow in Foreign Policy Studies:

“The US capture of Nicolás Maduro introduces serious diplomatic and strategic risks without advancing the administration’s core policy interests in Venezuela or Latin America. The president’s proposal this morning to ‘run’ Venezuela carries the same risks of overextension that plagued US policy in the Middle East—this time in the Western Hemisphere. This operation is unlikely to reduce drug trafficking or migration, key objectives of the Trump administration policy in Latin America. Instead, the president has now added to a new suite of foreign policy challenges that risk further entanglement and his promise to put America first.

“The collapse of Nicolás Maduro’s tyranny is great news for Latin America. For over two decades, the Venezuelan dictator and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, were the main advocates for socialism across the region, which led not only Venezuela but also other countries into left-wing authoritarianism and economic collapse. In fact, ‘21st Century Socialism,’ as Chávez labeled it, is still not over everywhere. Today, for example, the Nicaraguan socialist dictatorship led by Daniel Ortega is still in place.

“Although the end of the Maduro regime is good news, it would be a mistake for the US to occupy or run Venezuela. The country has a legitimate president, Edmundo González Urrutia, who won the 2024 presidential election with over 67 percent of the vote. With the support of opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was then banned from running and has recently won the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to restore democracy and liberty in Venezuela, González Urrutia is ready to take over the country, which is in no danger of civil war or social collapse.

But Trump’s move to abduct Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and announce that the US will “run” the Latin American country has drawn comparisons with the regime change wars that he built a political career rejecting.

Some critics from Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, who backed his message of focusing on the country’s own issues instead of conflicts abroad, are criticising Washington’s march to war with Venezuela.

Still, Trump’s grip on Republican politics appears to remain firm, with most legislators from the party praising Trump’s actions.

“To President Trump and his team, you should take great pride in setting in motion the liberation of Venezuela,” Senator Lindsey Graham wrote in a social media post.

“As I have often said, it is in America’s national security interest to deal with the drug caliphate in our backyard, the centrepiece of which is Venezuela.”

Graham’s reference to a “drug caliphate” seems to play on Islamophobic tropes and promote the push to liken the US attacks on alleged drug traffickers in Latin America to the so-called “war on terror”.

The US senator heaped praise on the winner of the FIFA Peace Prize – handed to Trump by the association’s chief, Gianni Infantino, in December – and called him “the GOAT of the American presidency”, which stands for “the greatest of all time”.

Muted criticism

While it was expected that Graham and other foreign policy hawks in Trump’s orbit would back the moves against Venezuela, even some of the Republican sceptics of foreign interventions cheered the abduction of Maduro.

Former Congressman Matt Gaetz, one of the most vocal critics of hawkish foreign policy on the right, poked fun at the “capture” of the Venezuelan president.

“Maduro is gonna hate CECOT,” he wrote on X, referring to the notorious prison in El Salvador where the Trump administration sent hundreds of suspected gang members without due process.

Libertarian Senator Rand Paul, who has been a leading voice in decrying Congress’s war-making power, only expressed muted disapproval of Trump’s failure to seek lawmakers’ authorisation for military action in Venezuela.

“Time will tell if regime change in Venezuela is successful without significant monetary or human cost,” he wrote in a lengthy statement that mostly argued against bringing “socialism” to the US.

“Best though, not to forget, that our founders limited the executive’s power to go to war without Congressional authorisation for a reason – to limit the horror of war and limit war to acts of defence. Let’s hope those precepts of peace are not forgotten in our justified relief that Maduro is gone and the Venezuelan people will have a second chance.”

Early on Saturday morning, Republican Senator Mike Lee questioned the legality of the attack. “I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorisation for the use of military force,” he wrote on X.

Lee later said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him that US troops were executing a legal arrest warrant against Maduro.

“This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect US personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” the senator said.

Dissent

Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene was one of the few dissenting voices.

“Americans’ disgust with our own government’s never-ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going,” Greene wrote on X.

Greene, a former Trump ally who fell out with the US president and is leaving Congress next week, rejected the argument that Trump ordered Maduro’s “capture” because of the Venezuelan president’s alleged involvement in the drug trade.

She noted that Venezuela is not a major exporter of fentanyl, the leading cause of overdose deaths in the US.

She also underscored that, last month, Trump pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, a convicted drug trafficker who was serving a 45-year sentence in a US jail.

“Regime change, funding foreign wars, and American’s [sic] tax dollars being consistently funneled to foreign causes, foreigners both home and abroad, and foreign governments while Americans are consistently facing increasing cost of living, housing, healthcare, and learn about scams and fraud of their tax dollars is what has most Americans enraged,” Greene said.

Congressman Tomas Massie, another Republican, shared a speech he delivered in the House of Representatives earlier this month, warning that attacking Venezuela is about “oil and regime change”.

“Are we prepared to receive swarms of the 25 million Venezuelans, who will likely become refugees, and billions in American treasure that will be used to destroy and inevitably rebuild that nation? Do we want a miniature Afghanistan in the Western Hemisphere?” Massie said in the remarks.

“If that cost is acceptable to this Congress, then we should vote on it as a voice of the people and in accordance with our Constitution.”

While Massie and Greene are outliers in their party, Trump’s risky moves in Venezuela were a success in the short term: Maduro is in US custody at a minimal cost to Washington.

Similarly, few Republicans opposed the US war in Iraq when then-President George W Bush stood under the “mission accomplished” sign on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln after toppling Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, in 2003.

But there is now a near consensus across the political spectrum that the Iraq invasion was a geopolitical disaster.

The fog of war continues to hang over Venezuela, and it is unclear who is in charge of the country, or how Trump will “run” it.

The US president has not ruled out deploying “boots on the ground” to Venezuela, raising the prospect of a US occupation and the possibility of another Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan.

“Do we truly believe that Nicolas Maduro will be replaced by a modern-day George Washington? How did that work out in… Libya, Iraq or Syria?” Massie warned in his Congress speech.

Mr. Santelli, 57, who now lives in Miami, said a feeling of immense joy washed over him when he heard the news of Mr. Maduro’s removal from Venezuela.

More than 15 years ago, he and his family obtained asylum in the U.S. within days and, then, eventually, citizenship. With Mr. Maduro in power, however, Mr. Santelli had not been able to return to Venezuela, as his mother had lost her memory and died. He has not seen his brother in nearly two decades.

Still, he realized that the reaction in the community around him had been much more mixed, as the immigration status of many Venezuelans, a majority of whom have entered the United States in the past decade, has become increasingly tenuous.

“There is pain and happiness, but above all, worry,” Mr. Santelli said.

Nearly eight million Venezuelans have fled their troubled country, the largest exodus in Latin America’s modern history and one of the largest crises of forced displacement in the world. As of June 2025, about 1.1 million had come to live in United States, including about 600,000 immigrants who had entered under a humanitarian program known as Temporary Protected Status.

Many Americans did not begin paying attention to the plight of Venezuelans until migration levels reached record heights under the Biden administration. As local and state officials struggled to shelter and assist migrants in major cities and in overcrowded shelters along the southern border, the humanitarian crisis became political red meat for President Trump, who returned to office promising to carry out mass deportations of migrants.

Soon after taking office, Trump administration officials moved to end T.P.S. protection for Venezuelans, a decision the Supreme Court has allowed to stand for now as litigation continues. After the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., the administration halted all asylum petitions and immigration applications filed for immigrants from 19 countries. The affected countries were those whose citizens it had restricted from travel to the United States earlier in the year, including Venezuela.

Trump administration officials have framed the measures as efforts to combat fraud and abuse in the national immigration system and to enhance national security. Immigration lawyers and Venezuelan American leaders have countered that the moves have been tainted with racial animus and sought to falsely cast a broad swath of the Venezuelan diaspora as criminals and terrorists.

On Saturday, Mr. Trump repeated familiar talking points, conflating immigration with crime and drug trafficking, as he denounced gangs and criminal organizations that he said had inflicted crime and terror in American cities.

“As I’ve said many times, the Maduro regime emptied out their prisons, sent their worst and most violent monsters into the United States to steal American lives,” Mr. Trump said. At the same time, he added, among the most significant beneficiaries of the U.S. operation would be those who “got thrown out of Venezuela that are now in the United States.”

“Some want to stay, and some probably want to go back,” he said.

Adelys Ferro, a founder of the Venezuelan-American Caucus, a grass-roots group representing Venezuelan interests in the United States, said that, as some Venezuelans were taking to the streets to celebrate, some others were staying inside, worried about immigration raids.

Despite entering the country under humanitarian programs once considered safe and legal, their lives have been thrust into uncertainty, Ms. Ferro said.

“We are victims of the Nicolás Maduro regime, but we are also victims of the Trump administration policies,” she said.

In a statement on Saturday, Eileen Higgins, the newly elected mayor of Miami, called on the Trump administration to reinstate the T.P.S. program, describing the decision to end it as “dangerous, reckless and wrong.”

Homeland Security officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the future of the program or the criticism from officials and Venezuelan American leaders over the decision to end it.

Legal challenges to the Trump administration’s efforts to rescind the T.P.S. program have been led by the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the U.C.L.A. School of Law. Ahilan T. Arulanantham, a lawyer with the center, said the instability in Venezuela underscored why T.P.S. holders should be allowed to remain in the United States.

Declarations entered in the case say that Venezuelan T.P.S. holders pay taxes and contribute to Social Security, and that they tend to hold jobs and to obtain higher education at greater rates than the broader American population.

In Manhattan, José, a cook from Venezuela, said that he had applied for asylum and T.P.S. as soon as he arrived in the United States in 2022. His T.P.S. has expired, and his asylum case has been pending in bogged-down immigration courts.

Since his last hearing in December, he has had to wear an ankle monitor.

On Saturday, he said he was feeling overjoyed that Mr. Maduro had been toppled, but that he was concerned about what would come next in Venezuela. Mr. Maduro’s reign, for Venezuelans inside and outside the country, elicits memories of food shortages, poor public services and economic decline.

“We still don’t know what is going to happen,” said José, who asked that only his first name be used for fear of retaliation from immigration authorities. “I want to wait it out here.”

At a cafe in Queens on Saturday, Rose Ramírez, 28, of Guárico, Venezuela, said she had been experiencing indescribable emotions since videos of the bombing in her native country began circulating overnight.

“If I had to choose one word to describe this moment, I would say it’s one of great joy and hope that we will have a more prosperous country,” said Ms. Ramírez, while caring for her 4-month-old son, who was in a stroller.

But Ms. Ramírez, who arrived in New York a little over a year ago and was still seeking asylum, also said a new period of uncertainty was now beginning.

“I think we will continue to be in limbo,” she said. “I would like to think that there will now be better cooperation and a better understanding of our legal situation here, but the truth is that it will take time for order to be restored.”

From the legal vantage point, how strong is that claim, either in a U.S. criminal court, which it sounds like Nicolas Maduro is about to see the inside of, or under international law?

ANDERSON: So it's certainly true that they have an indictment against Nicolas Maduro they're certainly - almost certainly going to proceed against. They seem to be confident they can make a criminal case. It doesn't make much of a difference in terms of the domestic legal arguments about why the president could pursue this operation or the international ones. Domestically, the president's almost certainly relying on the president's inherent Article 2 authority to use military force. The executive branch asserts the president can do so with broad discretion, at least where it doesn't result, or expected to result, in a major armed conflict.

And in terms of international law, it's possible they're just going to accept that this is a violation of international law. I think more likely, we're going to see a justification be made similar to the maritime strikes against alleged narcotics traffickers, where they claim involvement in narcotics trafficking is the equivalent of an armed attack on the United States, and that triggers a right to self-defense under international law - an argument most people find a little incredible and hard to believe, but that's the argument they've made before in the context of those strikes.

KELLY: Do you find it incredible and hard to believe?

ANDERSON: I do. As I've written before in a couple different venues and talked about before with you folks, you know, that's an argument that really stretches beyond the breaking point how people have understood what an armed attack means in other contexts. Narcotics smuggling is simply not the equivalent of throwing a bomb or shooting a missile, and pretending that it is has hugely destabilizing consequences for the international system.

KELLY: Go back for a moment to the Article 2 powers that you mentioned and what exactly the president of the United States can do without congressional approval. I mean, the short answer is he just did this without congressional approval. But again, is that legal?

ANDERSON: The executive branch maintains its legal. That is a view that has never been vindicated by the courts, in part 'cause the courts very rarely confront - and when they do, often try and avoid ruling on the merits of - war powers-type questions. Notably, however, the executive branch, including the Trump administration, at least during its first term, has accepted one notable constitutional limit - maybe two - on this. One is the possibility that Congress could countermand it, and that raises novel constitutional questions that don't exist currently. But that's one possibility.

The other one is whether the armed conflict and expected hostilities would be of a nature, scope, duration that rises to what is called a war for constitutional purposes. That is a lot of terms of art that basically mean, is this going to be a major war like the Korean War, the Vietnam War? Which is where the executive branch has kind of drawn the line, saying, for those conflicts, we may well need to go to Congress for authorization. Anything shy of that, the president can do on his own.

KELLY: OK, so now we're here. We are told that the plan is that the U.S. will run Venezuela during some sort of transition. Speak to the law that would govern that. Under international law, can one country legally administer another, even temporarily?

ANDERSON: Setting aside the legality of how one entered into the state, there - in the state of being an occupation of a state - there is a set of international rules that govern when one country occupies another. But it's not clear to me those would apply here unless the Trump administration moves forward with a big ground campaign where they start exercising on-the-ground control. And it doesn't seem like that's actually what President Trump suggested they want. It seems like he's indicating they have an arrangement with Vice President Delcy Rodriguez where they're going to be able to make some demands, direct how certain things happen around oil and presumably drugs.

But otherwise, that regime, which is basically the Maduro regime sans Maduro, is going to be managing day-to-day affairs. Notably, that's really complicated because the United States has since 2019 recognized the 2015 National Assembly - the opposition movement - as the legitimate government of Venezuela, and that opposition movement controls Venezuelan assets in the United States, among other incidents of statehood. So it's not clear to me how exactly they're going to reconcile these two positions.

KELLY: Are - have you been looking for applicable historical precedent that might be instructive here?

ANDERSON: There certainly are historical precedents that are vaguely useful. You know, Panama is the one that's cited most frequently. In that case, you did have a government-in-exile that had been ousted by Noriega that the then-George H.W. Bush administration helped reinstate. But that's not clear that's what's happening here. Instead, they appear to be - have simply removed the head of state and are trying to create their own alternative regime or keep that regime in place but as a much more pliant client state. I don't know what a good parallel of that is off the top of my head. We'll have to wait and see what path they take.

KELLY: Indeed. One more question before I let you go, Mr. Anderson, and that is, given all the questions about is this legal, is it not, could U.S. officials themselves one day face accountability under international law for an attack like this?

ANDERSON: It's not entirely beyond the realm of possibility. There are huge obstacles to that, primarily political ones. The United States has historically pushed back very strongly against any idea that service members or officials can face international accountability. There's also international immunity, official immunity questions in that regard. But we've seen those been overcome in prior contexts, like the Pinochet context, and so it's not impossible. These are acts that many states are going to look at and are going to say these seem like human rights violations, maybe even crimes against humanity. And those are pretty severe violations that there are going to be calls for accountability for potentially for decades.

KELLY: Scott Anderson of the Brookings Institution, thank you very much.

ANDERSON: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",,N,,2026-01-04 02:56:22.325483

President Donald Trump said the U.S. will temporarily “run” Venezuela and work to tap the country’s massive oil reserves.

“We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” to new leadership, Trump said at a news conference in Florida. He didn’t provide more detail about how the U.S. would control Venezuela, saying a group of officials would be named to oversee it.

Trump said he didn’t want a new leader to take over in the wake of Maduro’s capture who would result in “the same situation that we had for the last long period of years.”

Follow live coverage.

“We can’t take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn’t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind,” he said.

'Not afraid of boots on the ground'

Trump added that the U.S. military was prepared to strike Venezuela again if needed.

“We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so. So we were prepared to do a second wave if we need to do so,” he added.

After reporters asked whether the U.S.’ running Venezuela will involve military personnel on the ground, Trump said, “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground.”

“We don’t mind saying it, but we’re going to make sure that that country is run properly. We’re not doing this in vain,” he added.

Trump’s remarks were delivered at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he was flanked by some of his top advisers — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Asked later Saturday whether he was prepared to have troops on the ground in Venezuela, Hegseth told CBS News that Trump would “set the terms, and ultimately, he’ll decide what the iterations are of that.”

“We’re going to control what happens next. Because of this brave decision, President Trump has shown American leadership, and he’ll be able to dictate where we go next,” he said.

Maduro flown to New York

Trump confirmed at the news conference that Maduro and his wife were en route to New York, where, he said, Maduro had been indicted. Maduro arrived in New York on Saturday afternoon and could appear in court as early as Monday.

Trump said that Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez “was sworn in as president just a little while ago” and that she had a “gracious” conversation with Rubio to offer her support.

But on state television later, Rodriguez told the Venezuelan public, “We demand the immediate liberation of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores,” calling Maduro “the only president of Venezuela.”

Venezuela's supreme court on Saturday night issued an order instructing Rodríguez to assume the role of acting president with immediate effect.

U.S. capture of Maduro was months in the making

The military operation, which officials said had been planned for months and took several hours, is the latest move that the Trump administration has described as part of a crackdown on drugs entering the U.S. It comes just weeks before the first anniversary of Trump’s second inauguration.

Two U.S. officials familiar with the planning told NBC News on Saturday that Trump approved the military and law enforcement actions in Venezuela more than a week ago.

In remarks Saturday, Caine confirmed that military forces waited over a week for the weather to clear up.

“Weather in Venezuela is always a factor this time of the year, and over the weeks through Christmas and New Year’s, the men and women of the United States military sat ready, patiently waiting for the right triggers to be met and the president to order us into action,” Caine told reporters.

“Last night, the weather broke just enough, clearing a path that only the most skilled aviators in the world could maneuver through,” he said.

Caine said that Trump gave the order to go at 10:46 p.m. ET Friday and that military forces arrived at Maduro’s compound by 1:01 a.m. ET Saturday. By 3:29 a.m. Saturday, Caine said, the military forces were back over water with Maduro and Flores.

Trump, who said he watched the operation unfold live from Mar-a-Lago, said Maduro “was trying to get into a safe place” made of steel as U.S. military forces stormed his compound.

“He was trying to get to a safe place, which wasn’t safe, because we would have had the door blown up in about 47 — I think, 47 seconds,” Trump said. “It was a very thick door, a very heavy door, but he was unable to get to that door. He made it to the door. He was unable to close it.”

Caine said the aircraft used in the operation included multiple types of military planes, as well as remotely piloted drones, all of which he said helped protect the helicopters and personnel in Caracas. Caine added that the U.S. helicopters were fired on and that U.S. forces “replied to that fire with overwhelming force in self-defense.”

Caine added that one U.S. military aircraft sustained damage but was still able to fly. Later Saturday, a U.S. official and a White House official told NBC News that the operation in Caracas resulted in several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom remain stable.

Vice President JD Vance was also involved in the military operations, according to a spokesperson.

Indictment allegations

Minutes before he spoke at Mar-a-Lago, Trump posted a photo on Truth Social appearing to show Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima wearing what appeared to be a blindfold and holding a bottle of water. Trump also posted a video of the U.S. strikes on Venezuela set to “Fortunate Son,” a famous anti-war song by Creedence Clearwater Revival.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X that Maduro would “face the full wrath” of the U.S. justice system.

The charges, in an indictment unsealed Saturday, include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.

In the indictment, federal prosecutors alleged Maduro “is at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.”

They also allege that Maduro and other members of the Venezuelan government sold passports, provided protection and enabled the sale and transportation of hundreds of tons of illegal drugs through their ports, including drugs from several recognized Mexican drug cartels.

In his remarks, Trump said he had seen the evidence that was gathered for the indictment, and he blamed Maduro for drug trafficking and crime in the U.S.

“I’ve seen what we have. It’s both horrible and breathtaking that something like this could have been allowed to take place for many years after his term as president of Venezuela expired,” Trump said. “Maduro remained in power and waged a ceaseless campaign of violence, terror and subversion against the United States of America, threatening not only our people, but the stability of the entire region.”

Maduro was first indicted, alongside 14 other people, in 2020, during Trump’s first administration, in the Southern District of New York. Maduro first came to power in 2013 and was sworn in to a third term as president one year ago, despite evidence that he did not win the preceding presidential election.

The future of Venezuela’s oil reserves

The U.S. action was a stunning culmination of months of rising threats from Trump and his administration toward Maduro. Carried out without congressional authorization, it immediately drew pushback and questions from lawmakers. In his remarks, Trump said U.S. oil companies were prepared to make major investments in the country.

“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” he said.

Trump said it wouldn’t cost the U.S. anything to “run” Venezuela, pointing to the country’s oil production, saying, “The money coming out of the ground is very substantial.”

Later, he told reporters, “We’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement for the damages caused us by that country.”

In her remarks on state television, Rodriguez accused the U.S. of instituting regime change solely for the purpose of extracting oil and other natural resources from Venezuela.

The U.S. “only had one objective: regime change in Venezuela. And that this regime change allows them to capture our energy resources, mineral resources and natural resources,” she said.

Operation draws praise from some but raises questions about legality

Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, said Saturday that Guterres was “deeply alarmed by the recent escalation in Venezuela” and that the U.S. operation had “potential worrying implications for the region.”

In a statement after the strikes, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, celebrated, writing, “Venezuelans, the hour of freedom has arrived.”

In the U.S., Trump’s allies celebrated the unprecedented incursion on Venezuelan soil as a win against drug trafficking and for the rule of law, while Trump’s foes — including Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill — lambasted him for striking Venezuela without approval from Congress and questioned whether his agenda is really “America First.”

For months, Trump has hinted at taking action in Venezuela, telling NBC News last month, “I don’t rule it out,” when he was asked about going to war with Venezuela.

Last month, the U.S. intercepted two oil tankers off Venezuela and the U.S. military continued its strikes on boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean Sea.

On Friday, just a day before he was captured, Maduro said in an interview on Venezuelan state television that he would be open to working with the U.S. to combat drug trafficking.

“The U.S. government knows, because we’ve told many of their spokespeople, that if they want to seriously discuss an agreement to combat drug trafficking, we’re ready,” he said.

On Saturday morning, Democratic lawmakers criticized the Trump administration for launching strikes on Venezuela, specifically pointing to the fact that the White House did not seek approval from Congress for the military action.

“Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, but I have seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization,” Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Saturday.

In a separate statement, Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said, “Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”

In the phone interview on Fox News late Saturday morning, Trump pushed back against Democrats’ criticism, calling them “weak, stupid people.”

""All they do is complain,” he said. “They should say, ‘You know what, we did a great job.’ ... They do say, ‘Oh, gee, maybe it’s not constitutional.’ You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years.”

Trump added that congressional leaders were not notified in part because “Congress has a tendency to leak.”

U.S. lawmakers were kept in the dark ahead of attack

Two U.S. officials told NBC News that information about the operation was so closely guarded that the Defense Department was not brought into its exact timing until Friday night.

Some of Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill defended his decision to execute the strikes and capture Maduro without congressional authorization.

“Today’s military action in Venezuela was a decisive and justified operation that will protect American lives,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., wrote on X.

The Trump administration informed top lawmakers on the Senate and House intelligence committees about the U.S. military action to capture Maduro after the operation was underway, three sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.

The Republican chairs and the Democratic ranking members on the intelligence committees were notified about the operation, the sources said.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in a statement that he had spoken to Rubio and is expecting further briefings next week when the Senate returns from the holiday recess.

Measure for congressional approval

In early November, a bipartisan group of senators voted in favor of a measure that would have required congressional approval for all future military action by the Trump administration in Venezuela. The measure fell short of the 50 votes needed for passage.

The effort behind that measure came after the Trump administration began to publicize declassified videos of the military conducting kinetic strikes on boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean Sea.

In October, Trump said the strikes were part of his administration’s fight against drug cartels but stopped short of saying he’d need a declaration of war to continue striking the boats.

He also confirmed that month that he had authorized covert action by the CIA in Venezuela but did not specify what the action was.

A source with knowledge of the matter said Saturday that the CIA had a small, clandestine team on the ground starting in August that was able to provide “extraordinary insight” into Maduro’s movements, which made capturing him “seamless.”

The clandestine team had the help of a human source inside the leader’s circle, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.

The New York Times first reported on the informant inside the regime.

Trump references Cuba

Near the end of his news conference, Trump called the situation in Cuba “similar” to that in Venezuela, responding to a question about potential military involvement in that country.

“I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now, a very badly failing nation, and we want to help the people,” he said. “It’s very similar in the sense that we want to help the people in Cuba.”

Rubio, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba, said, “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned.”

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Saturday on X that Cuba “denounces” the U.S. strikes on Venezuela.

His country “urgently demands the reaction of the international community against the criminal attack by the U.S. on #Venezuela. Our #ZonaDePaz [Zone of Peace] is being brutally assaulted. State terrorism against the brave Venezuelan people and against Our America. Homeland or Death We Shall Overcome!” he added.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260103-trump-conference-ch-1308-9340fe.jpg",N,,2026-01-04 00:12:36.414382

""I don't want us to be known as the ICE town.
My message to people is even if you support ICE, you don't want an ICE detainment facility in town.
What do local officials know?","ROXBURY — Protesters descended on this suburban Morris County town again on Saturday, reacting to a report that the Trump administration may be planning to open an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the community.

About 150 people gathered in sub-freezing temperatures near the intersection of routes 10 and 46 on Jan. 3 to make their opposition clear.

""No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!"" the group chanted, waving signs and cheering motorists who honked in support of the demonstration.

""No ICE in Roxbury!"" they declared.

Tom Kellerher, a Hope resident with the Warren County Visibility Brigade, said, ""I'm here because having an ICE facility in our area is appalling. I find a lot of about ICE appalling. It creates an air of threat.""

The protest unfolded as local, county and state officials continue to say they are in the dark about any such plans in Roxbury. The controversy arose after a Christmas Eve story in the Washington Post indicated that the federal government may site a detention facility to house immigrant detainees in town.

That outpost, the Post reported, would be part of a network of new facilities around the nation intended to accelerate the rate of deportations.

At the protest, Kelleher said members of Visibility Brigades from as far as Hackensack and Princeton were part of the demonstration. Launched in 2020 in Paramus, Visibility Brigades are known for posting anti-Trump political slogans on New Jersey overpasses. The group's website says its goal is to ""connect with and activate voters to demonstrate that resistance is possible.""

'This is who we are'

Most of the protesters carried signs. Some were dressed in inflatable costumes, including a unicorn and a T-Rex. Ann Mauro, a resident of the Succasunna section of Roxbury, helped to organize the event and served as the registrant for those making their way to the highway.

""This is the town I live in,"" Mauro said. ""When we talk about town character, it has to be about more than what people say we are. This is who we are and how we react to this.""

Officers from the Morris County Sheriff's Department joined Roxbury police to provide security. Volunteers handed out water and hand-warmers.

Another organizer, William Angus of Hackettstown, said he previously lived in Roxbury and ""knows the town and its people.""

""I don't want Roxbury to be known as the Attica of New Jersey,"" he said, referring to the New York state prison made notorious by a 1971 riot in which 33 inmates and 10 correctional officers died.

""I don't want us to be known as the ICE town. My message to people is even if you support ICE, you don't want an ICE detainment facility in town. A lot of people on the right don't understand the implications.""

What do local officials know?

On Dec. 30, dozens of protestors attended a routine year-end meeting of the Roxbury Township Council to voice their displeasure after the Washington Post report. Local officials told them the town had not been contacted by federal authorities.

""At this point, we're kind of operating off a newspaper article,"" said state Senate Minority Leader Anthony Bucco, a Republican who represents Roxbury in the Legislature and who also serves as the town's municipal attorney.

""No one from the federal government has contacted either Roxbury or the county to say that this is either something they are looking at, or that it's just information,"" Bucco said.

International law has witnessed numerous attempts by powerful states to justify military intervention in sovereign territories. The modern framework governing such actions emerged from centuries of conflict and diplomatic evolution, establishing clear boundaries that contemporary assertions of control must navigate. When Trump asserts US control over Venezuela, it triggers established legal frameworks that have evolved through decades of international jurisprudence.

Historical Analysis of Regime Change Justifications

The Monroe Doctrine, proclaimed in 1823, initially focused on preventing European colonisation of the Western Hemisphere but has undergone substantial reinterpretation over two centuries. Twenty-seven thousand US military personnel deployed during Panama's Operation Just Cause in 1989, resulting in an estimated 500-3,500 Panamanian casualties according to Human Rights Watch documentation. This intervention claimed authority under canal treaty provisions and drug trafficking concerns.

Similarly, Grenada's Operation Urgent Fury involved 7,600 US military personnel over a 10-day period in 1983. The legal justification rested on Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States authorisation, yet the UN General Assembly condemned the action as a flagrant violation of international law by a vote of 108-9-27. These historical precedents demonstrate the contested nature of unilateral intervention claims.

The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations establishes inviolability principles under Articles 29-31, requiring that any arrest of state officials follow either valid extradition treaty procedures or UN Security Council Chapter VII authorisation. Modern applications of intervention doctrine must conform to these established international legal frameworks.

Contemporary International Law Standards

UN Charter Article 2(4) prohibits the threat or use of force against territorial integrity or political independence of any state. The International Court of Justice reinforced this principle in the Nicaragua v. United States case (1986), establishing that military support for opposition forces constitutes prohibited intervention in internal affairs.

Legal scholar Carsten Stahn identifies four essential criteria for legitimate humanitarian intervention: imminent threat of large-scale loss of life, demonstrated failure of peaceful remedies, proportionality of force, and temporary duration with transfer to legitimate authority. Allegations of drug trafficking or political instability alone do not meet these stringent requirements.

The Permanent Court of International Justice's Lotus Case (1927) established that jurisdiction is generally territorial unless treaty provisions explicitly provide otherwise. This precedent becomes crucial when examining claims of extraterritorial law enforcement authority in sovereign states, particularly when executive order constraints limit domestic policy options.

Which International Bodies Could Respond to Sovereignty Violations?

Contemporary international architecture provides multiple institutional mechanisms for addressing sovereignty violations, though their effectiveness depends heavily on political consensus and enforcement capabilities.

UN Security Council Mechanisms

The UN Security Council operates under Chapter VII provisions, requiring nine affirmative votes for procedural matters and nine affirmative votes with no permanent member vetoes for substantive action. When examining the current Venezuelan situation, Russia and China maintain veto power over any retroactive authorisation attempts.

The Uniting for Peace Resolution, adopted November 3, 1950, has been invoked ten times historically, most recently regarding Yemen (2015) and Myanmar (2021). This mechanism allows the General Assembly to recommend collective action when Security Council deadlock prevents decisive response.

Historical patterns reveal enforcement inconsistencies. India's military intervention in East Pakistan (1971) faced Security Council emergency sessions but no enforcement action due to Soviet veto protection. Conversely, Iraq's Kuwait invasion (1990) triggered Resolution 678 authorising military force because permanent members reached unanimous agreement.

Regional Organisation Authority

The Organisation of American States Charter Article 21 explicitly prohibits member states from using coercive measures to force sovereign will of another state. OAS authority remains limited to mediation, negotiation, and recommendations to the UN. Unilateral member action cannot claim OAS authorisation.

The Rio Treaty (Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance) requires two-thirds majority vote of OAS members for collective security authorisation. The Venezuela policy shift prompted OAS Resolution AG/RES.2908 recognising opposition interim government, yet this carried no military enforcement authority and support subsequently eroded by 2025.

Regional Body Enforcement Authority Membership Requirement Legal Basis OAS Mediation/Recommendations Two-thirds majority Charter Article 21 UNASUR Consultative only Consensus Constitutive Treaty 2008 CELAC No enforcement mechanisms Declaratory Founding Declaration 2011 Rio Treaty Collective security Two-thirds majority TIAR 1947

The Contadora Group precedent (1983-1990) established principles including non-interference in internal affairs and prohibition of foreign military bases. This multilateral mediation effort for Central American conflicts demonstrated that consensus cannot be imposed unilaterally, directly applicable to current territorial control assertions.

How Do Energy Resource Claims Intersect with International Law?

Energy sovereignty intersects with territorial integrity through established international legal frameworks governing natural resource extraction and state authority over domestic industries.

Sovereignty Over Natural Resources Doctrine

UN General Assembly Resolution 1803 (December 14, 1962) affirms permanent sovereignty over natural resources, establishing that nationalisation or expropriation must serve public utility, security, or national interest with appropriate compensation. This doctrine protects Venezuela's right to control its petroleum sector, producing 700,000 barrels per day as of November 2025.

Venezuela's 1975 nationalisation via Decree Law 117 was considered lawful under prevailing international petroleum nationalism doctrine. However, subsequent taking of legitimate foreign investor property would constitute expropriation requiring fair compensation under bilateral investment treaty provisions.

Chevron currently imports 120,000 barrels per day from Venezuela under modified sanctions waiver, down from 200,000 barrels per day in early 2025. The US-Venezuela Bilateral Investment Treaty (1997) provides investor protections requiring just compensation determined by international arbitration for expropriation disputes.

Maritime and Territorial Jurisdiction Issues

The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea establishes clear maritime boundaries: 12 nautical miles of territorial waters with complete coastal state sovereignty, 200 nautical miles of Exclusive Economic Zone with natural resource rights, and extended Continental Shelf rights to seabed non-living resources.

Venezuela's maritime claims include disputed areas with Guyana affecting the Essequibo region, complicating energy security calculations. Any unilateral assumption of control over Venezuelan energy resources would violate UNCLOS coastal state sovereignty principles.

According to reports from NBC News, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Article XX(j) permits energy security exceptions for critical supply measures, yet these cannot justify appropriation of another state's resources. Legitimate energy security concerns require strategic reserves, diversified supply contracts, and efficiency measures rather than territorial control.

Libya's 1969 nationalisation under Muammar Gaddafi and Iran's 1951 nationalisation under Mohammad Mossadegh demonstrate that while controversial, petroleum sector nationalisation cannot be reversed through military force under modern international law. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company case established precedents for compensation negotiations rather than military intervention.

What Are the Constitutional Constraints on Executive Military Action?

Domestic constitutional frameworks create legal boundaries for military interventions, establishing separation of powers principles and congressional oversight requirements that constrain executive authority.

War Powers Resolution Applications

The War Powers Resolution requires 60-day congressional notification for military deployments and establishes clear distinctions between emergency powers and declared war authorities. Authorisation for Use of Military Force (AUMF) precedents demonstrate congressional involvement in sustained military operations.

Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Mark Warner (D-Virginia) criticised the Venezuela operation as lacking constitutional foundation, warning that military regime change could encourage similar actions by China and Russia. This reflects broader concerns about executive overreach in foreign military deployments.

Supreme Court precedents on executive war powers, including Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), establish that presidential authority reaches its maximum when acting with congressional authorisation and its minimum when acting against congressional will. Military action without legislative consultation falls into the uncertain middle category.

Separation of Powers Implications

Congressional oversight mechanisms include Senate treaty ratification requirements for territorial administration arrangements and House appropriations authority for occupation costs. The Constitution grants Congress exclusive power to declare war and regulate foreign commerce, creating potential conflicts with unilateral executive action.

Judicial review limitations during active operations reflect the political question doctrine, yet courts maintain authority to examine constitutional compliance. Federal court jurisdiction over foreign policy decisions becomes relevant when domestic legal obligations conflict with international commitments.

Immigration status implications for displaced populations create additional constitutional considerations, as territorial control assertions affect asylum and refugee processing procedures under existing US immigration law.

How Could International Economic Sanctions Reshape Regional Dynamics?

Economic coercion through multilateral sanctions regimes represents a primary tool for international response to sovereignty violations, yet effectiveness depends on coordinated implementation and enforcement mechanisms.

Multilateral Response Coordination

European Union Common Foreign and Security Policy mechanisms enable coordinated sanctions through qualified majority voting procedures. EU foreign affairs commissioner Kaja Kallas called for restraint while emphasising respect for international law and UN Charter principles in response to Venezuela developments.

G7 coordination traditionally provides framework for Western sanctions alignment, though emerging economies increasingly develop alternative financial architectures. Furthermore, the implementation of trade war strategies by major powers has accelerated development of alternative payment systems and currency swap arrangements to reduce dependence on dollar-dominated mechanisms.

Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's condemnation of Venezuela military action as crossing an unacceptable line demonstrates regional opposition to unilateral intervention. Colombian president Gustavo Petro's call for UN Security Council meetings reflects broader Latin American rejection of territorial sovereignty violations.

Energy Market Regulatory Responses

OPEC+ production quota adjustments could compensate for Venezuelan supply disruptions, with the organisation's core eight producers scheduled to review supply policy following recent developments. Venezuela's 700,000 barrels per day export capacity represents manageable market impact if alternative suppliers increase output.

Critical Market Insight: Alternative suppliers may face increased regulatory scrutiny over origin verification requirements, while OPEC+ spare capacity calculations must account for Venezuelan production uncertainty when setting output quotas.

China's 130,000 barrels per day imports from Venezuela demonstrate alternative market development outside traditional Western frameworks. Regional trade bloc realignment possibilities include increased South-South cooperation and reduced dependence on US-dominated financial systems.

Moreover, analysts examining tariff market impacts note how energy sector disruptions could cascade through global commodity markets, particularly affecting nations dependent on Venezuelan petroleum products.

What Precedents Exist for Transitional Government Administration?

Historical examples of territorial administration provide frameworks for understanding governance transitions, though each context presents unique legal and practical challenges.

Post-Conflict Governance Models

Iraq's Coalition Provisional Authority (2003-2004) operated under disputed legal authority, claiming UN Security Council Resolution 1483 legitimacy while facing widespread resistance. The CPA's dissolution demonstrated difficulties inherent in external administration of complex societies.

Afghanistan's International Security Assistance Force operated under UN mandate through multiple Security Council resolutions, yet ultimate withdrawal revealed limitations of external governance models. Bosnia Herzegovina's Office of High Representative continues operating under Dayton Agreement provisions, though effectiveness has declined over time.

East Timor's UN Transitional Administration (1999-2002) succeeded due to clear international consensus, legitimate self-determination claims, and Indonesian cooperation. This model required explicit Security Council authorisation and widespread international support rarely available in contested interventions.

Democratic Transition Mechanisms

Carter Center election monitoring standards require extensive preparation, neutral observation protocols, and post-election verification procedures. Legitimate transitions demand international consensus on monitoring organisation credibility and technical assistance framework design.

The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe maintains detailed election observation methodologies developed through decades of transition support. Inter-American Commission on Human Rights verification requires regional consensus rarely achievable during contested political transitions.

International Foundation for Electoral Systems technical assistance depends on host government invitation and international donor coordination. External election organisation without legitimate government consent lacks legal foundation under international law.

Which Legal Challenges Could Emerge from Territorial Administration Claims?

Territorial control assertions generate multiple legal challenge avenues through international and domestic judicial mechanisms, creating complex litigation environments.

International Court Proceedings

State-to-state dispute resolution under ICJ Statute Article 36 requires both parties' consent to jurisdiction unless compulsory jurisdiction declarations exist. Venezuela could seek advisory opinions on legal interpretation of territorial control assertions through UN General Assembly requests.

Provisional measures for immediate cessation orders become available under ICJ Article 41 when urgent circumstances threaten irreparable prejudice. Historical precedents include Iran v. United States regarding diplomatic personnel and Ukraine v. Russian Federation regarding territorial integrity.

Enforcement mechanisms for judicial decisions depend primarily on Security Council action under UN Charter Article 94. Permanent member veto power limits enforceability when intervening states maintain Council influence, as demonstrated in Nicaragua v. United States compliance failures.

Domestic Legal Ramifications

Federal court jurisdiction over foreign policy decisions creates potential conflicts between executive authority and judicial review. The political question doctrine limits court intervention in foreign relations, yet constitutional violations may require judicial examination.

State government cooperation requirements emerge when federal territorial administration claims conflict with state law enforcement and immigration authorities. Private sector compliance faces competing legal obligations when domestic and international law requirements diverge.

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado and candidate Edmundo González represent alternative legitimacy claims requiring legal recognition decisions. International law provides limited guidance on recognition timing and criteria during contested transitions.

How Do Regional Security Architectures Address Sovereignty Disputes?

Regional security frameworks provide collective defence mechanisms and confidence-building measures, though their effectiveness depends on member consensus and enforcement capabilities.

Collective Defence Treaty Obligations

NATO Article 5 applicability to Western Hemisphere situations remains theoretical, as no Latin American states hold alliance membership. ANZUS Treaty consultation mechanisms apply to Pacific region threats but lack direct Venezuelan relevance.

AUKUS partnership intelligence sharing protocols focus on Indo-Pacific security challenges rather than Latin American conflicts. Quad framework regional stability commitments similarly emphasise Asian maritime security over Western Hemisphere concerns.

Regional collective defence arrangements require careful distinction between legitimate security cooperation and intervention authorisation. No existing treaty framework provides legal basis for unilateral territorial control assertions in Venezuela.

Confidence-Building Measures

Arms control verification protocols established through various regional agreements provide frameworks for military activity monitoring and transparency enhancement. Military exercise notification requirements help reduce miscalculation risks during tense periods.

Diplomatic immunity protections during crises require careful balance between law enforcement objectives and international legal obligations. Humanitarian corridor establishment procedures could become relevant for civilian protection during extended conflicts.

The 28 million Venezuelan population presents massive humanitarian considerations for any territorial administration scenario. International law requires occupying powers to maintain civil order and provide essential services, creating enormous administrative and financial burdens.

What Role Do International Financial Institutions Play in Crisis Response?

International financial architecture provides multiple intervention mechanisms during territorial disputes, though institutional responses depend on governance structures and member state consensus.

World Bank and IMF Intervention Protocols

Emergency financing facility activation requires clear governance criteria and member state consensus on legitimate government recognition. The International Monetary Fund maintains strict conditionality requirements for governance improvements and anti-corruption measures.

Debt restructuring mechanisms for transitional governments demand international creditor coordination and legal framework establishment. Technical assistance for institutional capacity building requires sustained international commitment and legitimate government cooperation.

Venezuela's existing debt obligations, estimated at over $150 billion, complicate any transitional administration financing. External debt restructuring would require creditor committee negotiations and potential litigation resolution in multiple jurisdictions.

Alternative Financial Architecture Development

BRICS New Development Bank lending priorities increasingly emphasise South-South cooperation and infrastructure financing outside traditional Western frameworks. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank project financing provides alternative multilateral lending options.

Islamic Development Bank regional integration support and bilateral currency swap agreement utilisation offer additional financing mechanisms independent of US-dominated systems. These alternative architectures reduce traditional financial leverage during sovereignty disputes.

China's Belt and Road Initiative financing mechanisms demonstrate alternative development models that could support Venezuelan economic reconstruction through non-Western frameworks, potentially complicating traditional financial pressure applications.

Conclusion: Navigating Legal Complexity in Sovereignty Assertions

The intersection of domestic constitutional authority, international legal obligations, and regional security frameworks creates intricate jurisdictional webs when Trump asserts US control over Venezuela or similar territorial control situations emerge. Understanding these overlapping legal systems becomes essential for predicting institutional responses and long-term stability outcomes.

Current Venezuelan developments highlight fundamental tensions between executive war powers and congressional oversight, between national sovereignty principles and humanitarian intervention doctrines, and between regional collective security arrangements and unilateral action claims. These legal complexities extend beyond immediate military considerations to encompass energy sector control, financial institution responses, and transitional governance mechanisms.

However, examining broader patterns of tariffs and economic policy reveals how sovereignty assertions can impact global economic stability. When Trump asserts US control over Venezuela, it intersects with multiple policy frameworks affecting energy markets, trade relationships, and regional diplomatic arrangements.

The Guardian's analysis of Trump's Venezuela oil industry approach demonstrates how territorial control assertions connect to broader economic considerations. The 700,000 barrels per day Venezuelan production capacity and broader regional energy security implications demonstrate how territorial control assertions intersect with global commodity markets and international economic law.

Disclaimer: This analysis examines legal frameworks and precedents for educational purposes. International law applications evolve through state practice and institutional interpretation. Readers should consult current legal developments and expert analysis when assessing specific sovereignty dispute situations.

Future developments will likely test established precedents and potentially reshape international legal frameworks governing sovereignty, intervention, and territorial administration. When Trump asserts US control over Venezuela, it challenges existing international legal norms in ways that could influence future state practice and institutional responses to similar situations.

Further Analysis Considerations: Those seeking deeper understanding of sovereignty dispute mechanisms can explore academic resources on international law applications, regional security architecture evolution, and comparative studies of territorial administration precedents available through policy research institutions and international law organisations.

Trump and his administration have consolidated power and committed war crimes to seize Venezuelan oil and pursue regime change in line with their imperialistic agenda in the Western Hemisphere. And many Americans woke up to a sick sense of deja vu.

The homeland security department posted the image on X with the message “Protect the homeland”, highlighting Kinkade’s mid-century suburban landscape, complete with schoolchildren, vintage cars and people gathered around an American flag.

In a post on X on New Year’s Eve, the department posted a photo featuring a pristine and empty beach with palm trees and a vintage car. Written across the photo was “America after 100 million deportations,” along with a separate caption that said: “The peace of a nation no longer besieged by the third world.”

In response to the post, Hiroshi Nagai, a 78-year-old Japanese graphic designer known for his city pop and dreamscape artwork, said on X: “This image is being used without permission from the US department of homeland security. What should I do about this?”

Nagai is widely known for artwork inspired by 1950s Americana, often depicting lush palm trees, serene ocean scenes and dusky cityscapes. His pieces are typically devoid of people, instead presenting distant and contemplative views of urban landscapes.

In a statement to the Guardian, a DHS spokesperson said: “DHS will continue using every tool at its disposal to keep the American people informed as our agents work to Make America Safe Again.”

The use of Nagai’s work is the latest in a series of incidents in which the department has used various artists’ works to promote its immigration agenda, often without consent.

Last July, the department shared a painting by Thomas Kinkade, an American artist known for his idyllic depictions of American life. The homeland security department posted the image on X with the message “Protect the homeland”, highlighting Kinkade’s mid-century suburban landscape, complete with schoolchildren, vintage cars and people gathered around an American flag.

In response, the Kinkade Family Foundation issued a statement condemning the use of the painting, saying: “The use of his artwork was unauthorized, and we have requested that DHS remove the post.”

It added: “At the Kinkade Family Foundation, we strongly condemn the sentiment expressed in the post and the deplorable actions that DHS continues to carry out. Like many of you, we were deeply troubled to see this image used to promote division and xenophobia associated with the ideals of DHS, as this is antithetical to our mission.”

The department has also drawn the ire of pop stars for using popular songs to promote deportation efforts in upbeat TikTok-style videos.

Last November, Olivia Rodrigo criticized the White House for using her song all-american bitch in a video encouraging undocumented immigrants to self-deport.

“Don’t ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,” the 22-year-old Filipino American singer wrote. In response, the department said: “America is grateful all the time for our federal law enforcement officers who keep us safe. We suggest Ms Rodrigo thank them for their service, not belittle their sacrifice.”

A few weeks later, Sabrina Carpenter garnered headlines after she condemned the White House for using her song Juno to promote videos of immigration raids on X.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/000e71a68484a487cfa95df430f5018e92e9466f/0_607_4129_3303/master/4129.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd07b87b813e02a12687e689a2214923",N,,2026-01-03 13:12:42.581398

We will continue to monitor the Rebate Program litigation and implications for 340B compliance.","[co-author: Ivy Miller]*

On December 29, 2025—just three days before the 340B Rebate Model Pilot Program (the Rebate Program) was set to begin—the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine issued an order granting a preliminary injunction to block the government’s implementation of the Rebate Program on January 1, 2026, after determining that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) during the Rebate Program’s rollout.

Background

Under the 340B Program, drug manufacturers are required to offer their products for sale to certain safety-net health care providers at a discounted price. Since the 340B Program was established, HRSA has required that the discounts be offered to providers as “upfront” price concessions. Safety-net providers often rely on savings achieved from the upfront discounts to support programs to ensure access for the vulnerable patient populations they serve. On July 31, 2025, HRSA announced the Rebate Program, which would permit an approved group of drug manufacturers to offer 340B drug price reductions in rebate form rather than as an upfront discount. The Rebate Program would require safety-net providers to pay the full market cost of the drug and then claim a rebate to realize the discount. HRSA in part contends that the Rebate Program is intended to “de-duplicate” price concessions that certain safety-net providers may obtain via the 340B Program and the Inflation Reduction Act’s Drug Price Negotiation Program. Although only nine drug manufacturers were approved to participate in the Rebate Program, and the Rebate Program covers ten drugs, those manufacturers would be permitted under the Rebate Program to implement the rebate model with respect to all 340B safety-net providers—meaning, all 340B safety-net providers would be required to pay full price and implement the rebate model with respect to the ten drugs. Importantly, the announcement of the Rebate Program appeared to be a reversal of the 340B Program’s prior use of upfront discounts since the 340B Program’s inception in 1992. In fact, late in 2024, HRSA sent violation letters regarding proposed rebate models to some of the very same drug manufacturers who were subsequently approved for participation in the Rebate Program.

Complaint

On December 1, 2025, the American Hospital Association (AHA), the Maine Hospital Association (MHA), and four safety-net providers (collectively, the Plaintiffs) sued the federal government, alleging in their complaint that the rollout of the Rebate Program bypassed the requirements of the APA. The Plaintiffs claimed that HRSA did not address the issues raised by affected stakeholders during the statutorily required comment period, instead going ahead with the implementation of the Rebate Program as planned. On that same day, the Plaintiffs urged the court to temporarily block the January 1 start date for the Rebate Program, citing the potential for “hundreds of millions of dollars in costs” to 340B Program participants as a result of the Rebate Program, as well as “inevitable disruptions to patient care.”

On December 10, 2025, several drug manufacturers, including AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novo Nordisk, and the trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), moved to intervene in the suit as a matter of right, claiming the government could not adequately represent their interests in the case—namely, the potential for financial losses from duplicative discounts, as well as the government’s contrary position regarding 340B rebate models in other ongoing litigation. The Court, however, rejected the drug manufacturers’ bid to intervene in the case, noting that because the case (which consists of five alleged violations of the APA) “turns entirely” on the administrative record, the drug manufacturers would not feasibly be able to illuminate that record better than the government. Additionally, the Court stated that although the government does not itself face the financial implications alleged by the drug manufacturers, this does not inherently mean that the government cannot adequately represent the drug manufacturers’ interests.

Court’s Decision

In its decision to grant the preliminary injunction, the Court examined whether HRSA adhered to the APA’s arbitrary and capricious standard in its rollout of the Rebate Program. The Court explained that when a federal agency introduces new programs or policies impacting the rights and privileges of the public, those actions must be “reasonable and reasonably explained” in order to satisfy the arbitrary and capricious standard.

The Court noted that the Rebate Program represented a “departure from [HRSA’s] decades-long practice of requiring upfront discounts on 340B eligible drugs” and that the administrative record—which is central to the issue of whether HRSA violated the APA—was “rather threadbare.” The decision went on to conclude that the government “failed to follow the APA’s basic blueprint in assembling” the Rebate Program, thereby warranting a preliminary injunction to prevent its implementation nationwide.

The Court’s analysis centered on the following factors:

Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits. The Court noted that there was a paucity of information in the administrative record. In reviewing what information was produced, the Court indicated that HRSA must stand by its reasoning at the time it decided to establish the Rebate Program rather than relying on post-hoc rationalizations or documentation from manufacturers—i.e., they must “do their own homework” vis-a-vis building an administrative record demonstrating the thought process behind the Rebate Program. The Court also found that HRSA failed to provide a reasonable explanation regarding the design of the Rebate Program, and that there was no evidence that HRSA weighed the Plaintiffs’ decades of industry reliance on the upfront discount model against the stated goals of the Rebate Program and approach favored by manufacturers, or evaluated Plaintiffs’ costs to float the full cost of the drugs until receiving the 340B rebate. Further, the Court found “fatal” the HRSA’s failure to consider the costs and benefits of the Rebate Program, as it was only now reviewing administrative costs of the Rebate Program.

High Likelihood of Irreparable Harm. The Court concluded that Plaintiffs demonstrated irreparable harm if the Rebate Program were to be implemented, even without relying on “speculative concerns” about delays and denials of rebates for claims involving 340B drugs. Instead, the Court relied on Plaintiffs’ “estimate[d] $400 million in compliance costs, the downstream effect causing them to cut back services and suspend partnerships with drug distributors.”

Balance of Equities/Public Interest. The Court found that there was strong public interest in preserving the status quo and the reach of 340B covered entities to provide critical medical services, particularly in light of the Court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits of their APA claims.

Implications and Next Steps

Importantly, the Rebate Program is not impermissible under this Order, and in fact, the government has discretion under the 340B Program to opt for 340B rebates. However, any Rebate Program imposed on the public as a final agency action must withstand the requirements of the APA. In this regard, the decision indicates a more fulsome administrative record would need to be established addressing the basis for the Rebate Program compared to the prior policy, its design, and how it weighed Plaintiffs’ reliance interests and administrative costs of compliance. Although the Court declined to weigh in on policy arguments related to what would be less costly alternatives, dispute resolution mechanisms for rebate models, and the use of the rebate database, these questions will also likely need to be addressed in any future iteration of the Rebate Program. Finally, the Court was clear that the preliminary injunction is not limited to the Plaintiffs, and that the Court was authorized to preliminarily enjoin the whole agency action on a national level.

The federal government immediately appealed the order to the First Circuit seeking an emergency stay of the preliminary injunction, and it remains to be seen whether that appeal will prove successful on such a short timeline, as the Rebate Program was to begin January 1, 2026. The drug companies have separately appealed the denials of their motions to intervene, the resolutions of which may impact the suit’s timeline and progression. We will continue to monitor the Rebate Program litigation and implications for 340B compliance.

Most congressional Republicans, however, rallied around the president’s action, in keeping with the extraordinary deference they have shown to Mr. Trump even as he has trampled over congressional prerogatives.

In an initial post on Saturday morning, Mr. Lee said he wanted to know “what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action” in the absence of congressional authorization for military force.","While President Trump crowed on Saturday about the dramatic capture of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela by U.S. authorities, Democrats in Congress sounded alarms about the legality of the action and raised questions about recent briefings in which administration officials assured them that they were not seeking regime change in the nation.

Senator Andy Kim, Democrat of New Jersey, accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth of having “blatantly” lied to Congress when they said the administration’s objective in Venezuela was not about toppling Mr. Maduro. He called the move to oust the Venezuelan leader “disastrous,” arguing that it would further isolate the United States on the global stage.

“Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war,” Mr. Kim, a former national security official in the Obama administration, wrote on social media.

Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat who represents a district in which Venezuelan immigrants cheered for the news, said that Mr. Maduro’s capture was “welcome” but that the way it was done raised serious questions.

“I’ll demand answers as to why Congress and the American people were bypassed in this effort,” she said. “The absence of congressional involvement prior to this action risks the continuation of the illegitimate Venezuelan regime.”

Some Democratic candidates running for office in this year’s midterm elections were quick to condemn Republicans in Congress for failing to stand up to Mr. Trump when they could have, helping to set the stage for what they called an unauthorized large-scale strike on Venezuela.

Graham Platner, a veteran and a progressive Democrat running for Senate in Maine, noted that Senator Susan Collins, the Republican he is challenging, voted with most members of her party against a Senate resolution to block the president from invading Venezuela without congressional authorization. “From Iraq to Venezuela, you can count on Susan Collins to enable illegal foreign wars,” he wrote online.

Most congressional Republicans, however, rallied around the president’s action, in keeping with the extraordinary deference they have shown to Mr. Trump even as he has trampled over congressional prerogatives.

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said Mr. Maduro’s capture was “an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States.” He called the operation a “decisive action” by Mr. Trump.

And even Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who had raised constitutional concerns early Saturday morning over the lack of congressional authorization, later said he was satisfied with the explanation that Mr. Rubio had given him in a phone call.

In an initial post on Saturday morning, Mr. Lee said he wanted to know “what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action” in the absence of congressional authorization for military force. But in a second post hours later, he wrote that Mr. Rubio had told him that Mr. Maduro was “arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States.”

He added, “This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack.”

He also said that Mr. Rubio “anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in U.S. custody.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/03/multimedia/03us-venezuela-cong-topart-htwm/03us-venezuela-cong-topart-htwm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 11:12:17.240210

They were unsuccessful. However, the government’s vindictive prosecution of the 30-year-old construction apprentice continues, despite court rulings that his March 12 arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents violated a standing court order and his ensuing deportation back to El Salvador was illegal, lacking a valid removal order.

On Dec. 11, Ábrego García, a member of SMART union Local 100, was freed from immigration detention after U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ordered the government to release him. She issued a restraining order barring ICE from any further efforts to imprison him until and unless she changed her mind.

As Ábrego García, approached the courtroom door Dec. 22, hand in hand with his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, the 50 of us lined up to attend the hearing and support him broke into applause. Outside the hearing over 100 more supporters rallied in his defense. Many carried signs saying “Stand with Kilmar Ábrego García SMART,” given out by his union, which helped build the rally.

Filing into the packed courtroom with him were his brother César and mother Cecilia, as well as members of CASA, the immigration group that defends him. Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, his attorney, brought his two children.

Throughout the one-hour hearing, Judge Xinis repeatedly grilled Justice Department attorney Ernesto Molina. He repeatedly said he was unable to tell the court what the government planned to do next if authorities arrested Ábrego García again.

“Once again, I’m making a finding that these representations, which are misrepresentations, are in bad faith,” Xinis told Molina.

“Yet again for the seventh or eighth time, the government employed the tactic of sending an attorney into court who feigned ignorance as to what the government’s plan is,” Sandoval-Moshenberg told a cheering crowd after the hearing. Xinis said she will now decide whether or not to make her restraining order permanent.

“This decision means Kilmar gets to sleep in his own bed, without the fear of being separated from his family and community in the middle of the night,” CASA leader Lydia Walther-Rodriguez said. “No one should have to bear the weight and anguish of a family separation, at any random moment, just for demanding their constitutional rights.”

Fight for immigrant workers’ rights

Ábrego García’s fight is a flashpoint in the broader battle for the rights of undocumented workers and unity of the working class. The Trump administration seized and deported him to the notorious CECOT mega prison in El Salvador where he was beaten and tortured. His deportation violated an explicit 2019 court order prohibiting the government from doing so, because he and his family faced threats from violent gangs there.

Facing mounting public pressure and a direct order from the Supreme Court, the government brought him back to the U.S., but only after they had filed criminal charges of “human smuggling” in Tennessee. Ábrego García has steadfastly denied these charges and argues that prosecutors are vindictively and criminally targeting him. Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr., who is in charge of this case, has said he tends to agree with this.

The judge had set a trial date, but has now cancelled it. Instead, he will preside over an evidentiary hearing Jan. 28 where Justice Department witnesses will be questioned about their vindictive prosecution. The reason for this became clear Dec. 30 when the judge released a series of letters from top officials in the Department of Justice pressing Tennessee prosecutors to go after Ábrego García. All along they have denied this was true.

While at home, Ábrego García has to wear two electronic tracking devices, one on each leg. One is there as a condition of his parole in the government’s frame-up criminal case against him in Tennessee and the other was put there by ICE.

Still he managed to take the moral high ground, recording a TikTok video where he lip syncs “Himno de Victoria,” (Hymn of Victory), a biblical song of triumph.

Anyone who sees ICE agents in the area can call (707) 621-8220 to report sightings to the Mendocino County Rapid Response Network, which has volunteers trained and ready to quickly identify, verify, and inform the community if ICE is conducting raids or detaining immigrants locally.

The network also works to dispel false rumors of ICE sightings, share verified information with local news outlets, and post updates about ICE activity on social media. The network officially launched in early December, but the group has been recruiting volunteers and organizing trainings since spring of 2025.

Rapid response networks are volunteer-led community organizations that monitor ICE activity and support immigrant communities. These networks largely came to prominence during President Donald Trump’s first term, following his administration’s increased targeting and removal of immigrants lacking permanent legal status.

According to a press release from the Mendocino County network, “An important part of the network is the sharing of community education so people know their rights and how to protect themselves.”

Judy Abeja Hummel of Boonville, a volunteer and member of the network’s steering committee, said in an interview that one of their goals is to support local immigrant neighbors and friends who are fearful of ICE raids.

“I hope that ICE does not come to this community, but if they do, I want us to be ready to stand up in solidarity with all of our neighbors. To me this isn’t a question of immigration, this is a question of civil rights, human rights, and human decency,” Hummel said. “Many of my Latino neighbors have been afraid to leave the house, or they just go to work and come straight home. There have been many false alarms and rumors that keep re-traumatizing people. One important thing we offer is checking every rumor that comes along and verifying or debunking it as quickly as possible, so that people can go on living their lives.”

Hummel also said the network has trained 125 local volunteers to help monitor and verify ICE sightings. She said the steering committee has about six to eight people leading the group’s efforts. The network is still looking for a local volunteer coordinator for the Round Valley region.

“We are divided into five regions — Ukiah, Willits, Anderson Valley, North Coast, and South Coast, and each area has a local volunteer coordinator organizing, vetting, and bringing volunteers onboard,” Hummel said.

The Mendocino County Rapid Response Network will also be hosting “know your rights” trainings in Spanish and English, has a program to support businesses in being prepared for immigration raids, and is developing a group of volunteers to accompany immigrants to their court hearings.

If Mr. Trump wants to argue otherwise, the Constitution spells out what he must do: Go to Congress.
So how should the United States deal with the continuing problem that Venezuela poses to the region and America’s interests?","Over the past few months, President Trump has deployed an imposing military force in the Caribbean to threaten Venezuela. Until now, the president used that force — an aircraft carrier, at least seven other warships, scores of aircraft and 15,000 U.S. troops — for illegal attacks on small boats that he claimed were ferrying drugs. On Saturday, Mr. Trump dramatically escalated his campaign by capturing President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela as part of what he called “a large scale strike” against the country.

Few people will feel any sympathy for Mr. Maduro. He is undemocratic and repressive, and has destabilized the Western Hemisphere in recent years. The United Nations recently issued a report detailing more than a decade of killings, torture, sexual violence and arbitrary detention by henchmen against his political opponents. He stole Venezuela’s presidential election in 2024. He has fueled economic and political disruption throughout the region by instigating an exodus of nearly eight million migrants.

If there is an overriding lesson of American foreign affairs in the past century, however, it is that attempting to oust even the most deplorable regime can make matters worse. The United States spent 20 years failing to create a stable government in Afghanistan and replaced a dictatorship in Libya with a fractured state. The tragic consequences of the 2003 war in Iraq continue to beset America and the Middle East. Perhaps most relevant, the United States has sporadically destabilized Latin American countries, including Chile, Cuba, Guatemala and Nicaragua, by trying to oust a government through force.

Mr. Trump has not yet offered a coherent explanation for his actions in Venezuela. He is pushing our country toward an international crisis without valid reasons. If Mr. Trump wants to argue otherwise, the Constitution spells out what he must do: Go to Congress. Without congressional approval, his actions violate U.S. law.

The nominal rationale for the administration’s military adventurism is to destroy “narco-terrorists.” Governments throughout history have labeled the leaders of rival nations as terrorists, seeking to justify military incursions as policing operations. The claim is particularly ludicrous in this case, given that Venezuela is not a meaningful producer of fentanyl or the other drugs that have dominated the recent epidemic of overdoses in the United States, and the cocaine that it does produce flows mostly to Europe. While Mr. Trump has been attacking Venezuelan boats, he also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, who ran a sprawling drug operation when he was president of Honduras from 2014 to 2022.

A more plausible explanation for the attacks on Venezuela may instead be found in Mr. Trump’s recently released National Security Strategy. It claimed the right to dominate Latin America: “After years of neglect, the United States will reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American pre-eminence in the Western Hemisphere.” In what the document called the “Trump Corollary,” the administration vowed to redeploy forces from around the world to the region, stop traffickers on the high seas, use lethal force against migrants and drug runners and potentially base more U.S. troops around the region.

Venezuela has apparently become the first country subject to this latter-day imperialism, and it represents a dangerous and illegal approach to America’s place in the world. By proceeding without any semblance of international legitimacy, valid legal authority or domestic endorsement, Mr. Trump risks providing justification for authoritarians in China, Russia and elsewhere who want to dominate their own neighbors. More immediately, he threatens to replicate the American hubris that led to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump seemed to recognize the problems with military overreach. In 2016, he was the rare Republican politician to call out the folly of President George W. Bush’s Iraq war. In 2024, he said: “I’m not going to start a war. I’m going to stop wars.”

He is now abandoning this principle, and he is doing so illegally. The Constitution requires Congress to approve any act of war. Yes, presidents often push the boundaries of this law. But even Mr. Bush sought and received congressional endorsement for his Iraq invasion, and presidents since Mr. Bush have justified their use of drone attacks against terrorist groups and their supporters with a 2001 law that authorized action after the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Trump has not even a fig leaf of legal authority for his attacks on Venezuela.

Congressional debates over military action play a crucial democratic role. They check military adventurism by forcing a president to justify his attack plans to the public and requiring members of Congress to tie their own credibility to those plans. For years after the vote on the Iraq war, Democrats who supported Mr. Bush, including Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, paid a political price, while those who criticized the war, like Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama, came to be seen as prophetic.

In the case of Venezuela, a congressional debate would expose the thinness of Mr. Trump’s rationale. His administration has justified his attacks on the small boats by claiming they pose an immediate threat to the United States. But a wide range of legal and military experts reject the claim, and common sense refutes it, too. An attempt to smuggle drugs into the United States — if, in fact, all the boats were doing so — is not an attempt to overthrow the government or defeat its military.

We suspect Mr. Trump has refused to seek congressional approval for his actions partly because he knows that even some Republicans in Congress are deeply skeptical of the direction in which he is leading this country. Already, Senators Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski and Representatives Don Bacon and Thomas Massie — Republicans all — have backed legislation that would limit Mr. Trump’s military actions against Venezuela.

A second argument against Mr. Trump’s attacks on Venezuela is that they violate international law. By blowing up the small boats that Mr. Trump says are smuggling drugs, he has killed people based on the mere suspicion that they have committed a crime and given them no chance to defend themselves. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and every subsequent major human rights treaty prohibit such extrajudicial killings. So does U.S. law.

The administration appears to have killed defenseless people. In one attack, the Navy fired a second strike against a hobbled boat, about 40 minutes after the first attack, killing two sailors who were clinging to the boat’s wreckage and appeared to present no threat. As our colleague David French, a former U.S. Army lawyer, has written, “The thing that separates war from murder is the law.”

The legal arguments against Mr. Trump’s actions are the more important ones, but there is also a cold-eyed realist argument. They are not in America’s national security interest. The closest thing to an encouraging analogy is President George H.W. Bush’s invasion of Panama 36 years ago last month, which drove the dictator Manuel Noriega from power and helped set Panama on a path toward democracy. Yet Venezuela is different in important ways. Panama is a much smaller country, and it was a country where American officials and troops had operated for decades because of the Panama Canal.

The potential for chaos in Venezuela seems much greater. Despite Mr. Maduro’s capture, the generals who have enabled his regime will not suddenly vanish. Nor are they likely to hand power to María Corina Machado, the opposition figure whose movement appears to have won the country’s most recent election and who accepted the Nobel Peace Prize last month.

Among the possible bad outcomes are a surge in violence by the left-wing Colombian military group the ELN, which has a foothold in Venezuela’s western area, or by the paramilitary groups known as “colectivos” that have operated on the periphery of power under the Maduro dictatorship. Further unrest in Venezuela could unsettle global energy and food markets and drive more migrants throughout the hemisphere.

So how should the United States deal with the continuing problem that Venezuela poses to the region and America’s interests? We share the hopes of desperate Venezuelans, some of whom have made a case for intervention. But there are no easy answers. By now, the world should understand the risks of regime change.

It does not appear that Neff has any background working on cases related to federal election law.
One was the Konnech case.
Federal prosecutors are not reviewing the Konnech case, the spokesman said.
Court filings show Neff was involved in Galvan’s L.A. County case, but the prosecution was led by a more senior attorney.","Eric Neff’s tenure at the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office ended after he was placed on administrative leave in 2022 over accusations of misconduct in the prosecution of the CEO of Konnech, a software company that election conspiracy theorists said was in the thrall of the Chinese government.

Now, three years later, Neff is serving as one of the Trump administration’s top election watchdogs.

Late last year , his name began appearing on lawsuits filed by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, listed as “acting chief” of the voting section.

Neff’s appointment, first reported by Mother Jones, has prompted renewed scrutiny of his work at the L.A. County district attorney’s office.

The Times interviewed several of Neff’s former colleagues, who revealed new details about claims of misconduct that emerged from the Konnech case, and said they were alarmed that someone with almost no background in federal election law was named to a senior position.

Neff led the 2022 investigation of Konnech, a tiny Michigan company whose software is used by election officials in several major cities. In a criminal complaint, Neff accused the company’s CEO, Eugene Yu, of fraud and embezzlement, alleging the company stored poll worker information on a server based in China, a violation of its contract with the L.A. County registrar’s office.

Six weeks after a complaint was filed, prosecutors dropped the case and launched an investigation into “irregularities” and bias in the way evidence was presented against Konnech, the D.A.’s office said in a 2022 statement.

The county paid Konnech $5 million and joined a motion to find Yu factually innocent as part of a legal settlement.

The internal probe was focused on accusations that Neff misled supervisors at the district attorney’s office about the role of election deniers in his investigation, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the case who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

Neff also allegedly withheld information about potential biases in the case from a grand jury, according to the two officials.

In a civil lawsuit filed last year, Neff said the internal review by the D.A.’s office cleared him of wrongdoing. The two officials familiar with the probe who spoke on the condition of anonymity disputed Neff’s characterization of the findings.

A spokesman for Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman declined to comment or provide the results of the investigation into Neff, which the officials said was conducted by an outside law firm that generated a report on the case. Neff’s attorney also did not provide a copy of the report.

A Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment.

Neff’s attorney, Tom Yu — no relation to the Konnech CEO — said his client had no obligation to provide background information about the origins of the case to the grand jury.

Neff’s appointment comes as President Trump continues to remake the DOJ in his own image by appointing political loyalists with no criminal law background as U.S. attorneys in New Jersey and Virginia and seeking prosecutions of his political enemies, such as former FBI Director James Comey.

Trump has never recanted his false claim that he won the 2020 election.

When then-L.A. County Dist. Atty. George Gascón announced the charges against Konnech in 2020, Trump said the progressive prosecutor would become a “National hero on the Right if he got to the bottom of this aspect of the Voting Fraud.”

The Konnech case was centered on contract fraud, not voter fraud or ballot rigging. Six weeks after the charges were filed, the case disintegrated.

The D.A.’s office cited Neff’s over-reliance on evidence provided by True the Vote, the group that pushed the unfounded Chinese government conspiracies about Konnech and also appeared in a film that spread claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.

Gascón initially denied that True the Vote was involved in the case, but weeks later, a D.A.’s office spokesman said a report from the group’s co-founder, Gregg Phillips, sparked the prosecution. Phillips testified in court in July 2022 that it was Neff who first contacted him about Konnech.

The two officials who spoke to The Times said that Neff withheld True the Vote’s role from high-level D.A.’s office staff, including Gascón, when presenting the case.

Gascón declined an interview request, noting he is named in Neff’s pending lawsuit, which is slated for trial in early 2026.

Neff’s attorney insisted the case against Konnech was solid.

“He was let go because Trump tweeted a statement of ‘Go George Go’,” the attorney said. “That’s why Eugene Yu was let go. Because Gascón was so scared he was going to lose votes.”

Calls and emails to an attorney who previously represented Eugene Yu were not returned.

In his lawsuit, Neff claimed he had evidence that “Konnech used third-party contractors based in China and failed to abide by security procedures” to protect L.A. County poll worker data. The evidence was not attached as an exhibit in the lawsuit.

A DOJ spokesperson declined to describe Neff’s job duties. His name appears on a number of lawsuits filed in recent months against states that have refused to turn over voter registration lists to the Trump administration.

Neff is also involved in a suit filed against the Fulton County clerk’s office in Georgia seeking records related to the 2020 election, records show.

“We will not permit states to jeopardize the integrity and effectiveness of elections by refusing to abide by our federal elections laws,” Asst. Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon, the California conservative who now leads the civil rights division, said in a recent statement. “If states will not fulfill their duty to protect the integrity of the ballot, we will.”

Dhillon declined to comment through a DOJ spokesman.

The voting section “enforces the civil provisions of the federal laws that protect the right to vote, including the Voting Rights Act,” according to the DOJ’s website.

It does not appear that Neff has any background working on cases related to federal election law. He first became an L.A. County prosecutor in 2013 and spent years handling local crime cases out of the Pomona courthouse. He was promoted and reassigned to the Public Integrity Division, which investigates corruption issues, in 2020, according to his lawsuit.

While there, he handled only two prosecutions related to elections. One was the Konnech case. The other involved allegations of election rigging against a Compton city council member.

In August 2021, Isaac Galvan, a Democrat, was charged with conspiring to commit election fraud after he allegedly worked to direct voters from outside his council district to cast ballots for him. Galvan won the race by just one vote, but was booted from office when a judge determined at least four improper ballots had been cast.

Galvan’s criminal case is still pending; he recently pleaded guilty to charges in a separate corruption and bribery case in federal court. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles said there was no overlap between the D.A.’s election rigging case and the bribery case against Galvan. Federal prosecutors are not reviewing the Konnech case, the spokesman said.

Court filings show Neff was involved in Galvan’s L.A. County case, but the prosecution was led by a more senior attorney.

Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School who served in the civil rights division during the Obama administration, said section chiefs normally have decades of experience in the area of law they’re meant to supervise.

“The biggest problem with somebody with Neff’s history is the giant screaming red flag that involves filing a prosecution based on unreliable evidence,” Levitt said. “That’s not something any prosecutor should do.”

Neff’s attorney, Yu, scoffed at the idea that his client was not experienced enough for his new role in the Trump administration, or that he was selected due to his involvement in the Konnech case.

“Eric got the job because he’s qualified to get the job. He didn’t get the job for any other reason. He got the job because he’s an excellent advocate,” Yu said. “I think the Justice Department is very fortunate to have Eric.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/55862cf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5842x3067+0+414/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff9%2Fed%2F147d71991fffe61e1414af4642a9%2Fd26b356ebce5442386cfd08115aee8a0,N,,2026-01-03 06:56:34.635500

In December, the Washington Post reported on a draft solicitation by ICE that would use ""large-scale warehouses holding 5,000 to 10,000 each"" before deportation. Social Circle was one of seven cities named as being the proposed site for one of those warehouses, with the others located in Virginia, Louisiana, Texas, Arizona, and Missouri.

The plan would also include 16 processing sites that would hold up to 1,500 people each, the Post reported. One of those proposed sites could be located in Jefferson, Georgia.

The agency plans to modify the warehouses for human use, adding housing units, kitchens, a dining area, recreation areas, a medical unit, and more, the newspaper reported.

On New Year's Eve, Social Circle officials released a statement about the plan on Facebook that said they learned about ICE's draft solicitation through media reports.

""To date, no representative of the federal government, ICE, or the property owner has contacted the City in any way,"" the statement read.

Officials called the facility ""infeasible,"" arguing that the city did not have the water or sewer infrastructure to support the massive influx of people within its limits. With a current resident count slightly less than 5,000, the plan could triple Social Circle's population, they said.

City leadership also brought up security concerns, arguing there was no site within Social Circle that was a safe distance from homes and schools should a breach occur.

""City officials are evaluating what authority, if any, the City has in this matter and will continue to oppose any efforts of this kind through all appropriate channels.""

The changes to the H-1B lottery will take effect on February 27, 2026, in time for the next H-1B lottery in March 2026.
In addition to the Chamber’s lawsuit, the $100,000 fee is challenged in two additional lawsuits, including a lawsuit brought by a group of state attorneys general.
Strategy for Upcoming H-1B Lottery In light of the new H-1B lottery selection rule and the DC District Court upholding the $100,000 fee for new H-1B petitions, companies will need to be strategic in their selection of potential hires to include in the H-1B lottery in March 2026.
Akin attorneys are available to advise companies on these strategic considerations and help determine the list of potential hires for inclusion in the H-1B lottery.","In September 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposed to change the H-1B lottery selection process. The winners of the annual H-1B lottery are foreign national hires who can then be sponsored by U.S. employers to temporarily work in certain specialty occupations that require at least a bachelor’s degree. After accepting comments, DHS released its final rule on December 29, 2025, without any changes to the previously proposed language. The new rule will increase the odds of selection for highly paid beneficiaries and decrease the odds of selection for lower paid beneficiaries, including entry-level employees.

Impacts of the Rule

Beneficiaries assigned to the highest wage level will be entered into the lottery four times, increasing their odds of selection to 61% (an increase of 107%).

Beneficiaries assigned to the second highest wage level will be entered into the lottery three times, increasing their odds of selection to 46% (an increase of 55%).

Beneficiaries assigned to the third highest wage level will be entered into the lottery two times, increasing their odds of selection to 31% (an increase of 3%).

Beneficiaries assigned to the lowest wage level will be entered into the lottery one time, decreasing their odds of selection to 15% (a decrease of 48%).

DHS has discretion to deny H-1B petitions when it determines that the petitioner has made improper attempts to increase their chance of selection, so employers should plan carefully in advance of the H-1B lottery, to ensure that the wage selections and lottery entries withstand scrutiny under the new rule.

The changes to the H-1B lottery will take effect on February 27, 2026, in time for the next H-1B lottery in March 2026. For more details on how the lottery will operate, see Akin’s previous alert on the proposed rule.

Summary of Comments and DHS’s Responses

During the 30-day comment period, commenters in support of the new rule noted that it creates a more merit-based system that offers greater protection for U.S. workers and increases transparency in the selection process. However, other commenters expressed concern that the rule creates a “pay-to-play” system that favors well-funded petitioners while harming early career professionals and smaller companies. In response, DHS stated the changes are aimed at preventing the allocation of most H-1B visas to low-wage workers. DHS stressed that, while young professionals may have a reduced chance of selection, they at least still have a chance under the new rule, as opposed to a 2021 proposed rule that would have essentially barred the lowest wage earners from selection. Finally, DHS stated that although startups and other small companies relying on entry-level employees may face increased costs in bringing in workers through the new H-1B lottery selection process, their chances of hiring top talent will likely increase.

New $100,000 Requirement for H-1B Petitions Upheld by Court

During the same week as the DHS’s publication of the revised H-1B lottery selection process, the federal court in the District of Columbia ruled in one of the three lawsuits filed to enjoin the administration from imposing a $100,000 fee on new H-1B petitions.

In September 2025, President Trump issued Proclamation 10973, which requires a $100,000 payment in connection with new H-1B visa petitions filed for beneficiaries outside of the United States. The Chamber of Commerce and the Association of American Universities filed suit against DHS and the Department of State, seeking to enjoin the implementation of the Proclamation, claiming that it exceeds the scope of the President’s authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and, therefore, any action implementing the Proclamation is ultra vires and must be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). After hearing arguments on December 19, 2025, Judge Beryl A. Howell granted the government’s cross-motion for summary judgment, upholding the fee.

The Chamber’s primary argument was that the President exceeded his authority and introduced a fee requirement that contradicted the INA. In its opinion, the court repeatedly referenced the INA’s plain text that shows a broad delegation of authority to the President to impose “any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate” on the entry of immigrants. Although the court agreed that the grant of authority was very broad, it found that the Proclamation had appropriate limitations: it only lasts for twelve months and is limited to new petitions for prospective H-1B workers who are currently outside the U.S.. In response to the Chamber’s argument that the $100,000 requirement improperly competes with Congress’s determination of fees for immigration petitions, the court determined that the $100,000 requirement is separate from the fees permitted by Congress, and thus, not in contravention of the INA. The court also noted that while the Chamber credibly showed that the $100,000 requirement could harm the U.S. economy, the question before the court was ultimately one of constitutional and statutory analysis, not economic policy. In light of Congress’s broad delegation of authority to the President, the court held that the government’s implementation of the Proclamation was valid.

On December 29, 2025, the Chamber filed a notice of appeal in federal court in Washington, D.C. In addition to the Chamber’s lawsuit, the $100,000 fee is challenged in two additional lawsuits, including a lawsuit brought by a group of state attorneys general.

Strategy for Upcoming H-1B Lottery

In light of the new H-1B lottery selection rule and the DC District Court upholding the $100,000 fee for new H-1B petitions, companies will need to be strategic in their selection of potential hires to include in the H-1B lottery in March 2026. It will be important to evaluate the position requirements and the prevailing wages that those requirements correspond with, along with compensation structures that will provide the best odds for lottery selection. At the same time, considering exceptions to the $100,000 fee and focusing on the categories of beneficiaries that fall under those exceptions, including beneficiaries on other types of visas already in the U.S., will be important.

About 60 people showed up this week at the council's end of year meeting - normally a sleepy affair - and a protest is set for Saturday.

Before anyone even spoke - and all who did condemned the idea - Mayor Shawn Potillo read a statement, attempting to calm things down.

The bottom line:

Town officials have been told nothing. Moreover, neither have county and state officials.

This, in fact, may turn out to be nothing, or just an erroneous or unfulfilled proposal. But here is what people know.

A Washington Post story on Dec. 24 said that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is considering a significant expansion of its detention system. And that would include 16 ""processing sites"" nationwide, including one in Roxbury, N.J. These centers could hold up to 1,500 detainees.

That's all.

The story cautioned that this is a draft proposal, suggesting that the plan can change, or not happen at all.

Nonetheless, just the concept was enough to bring people - not all of whom were township residents - to a Dec. 30 council meeting.

The mayor and council did not engage with the speakers, or answer direct questions. They let the mayor's statement speak for itself.

First to speak was Shelly Morningstar of nearby Mount Olive who strongly opposed ""warehousing human beings."" She noted that the township has many immigrant business owners.

A township resident raised the spectre of masked ICE agents chasing individuals down the street.

Another resident wondered if the federal government could just do what it wanted, or if it would try to persuade the township by offering money.

Generally speaking, the federal government can develop what it wants, but given the fact some ICE centers are privately-run, that could complicate things.

The township council is all-Republican, which could make them sympathetic to the immigration aims of the Trump Administration. Still, holding ICE detainees in town is a different matter.

Here's an analogy for you. Many local officials want to put ""bad guys"" in jail, but that doesn't mean they'd want a state prison in their town.

As noted, a protest against the ""ICE plan for warehouse prisons"" is set for 11 a.m. Saturday near Ledgewood Historic Park.

What comes next likely will depend on what happens to this draft plan.

In his statement, the mayor did stress that the township is committed to public safety.

The agents promised that everything was fine and that he would be released in two hours after having an ankle monitor placed on him, Viktoriia Kungurtsev said in Russian through Google Translate and a phone interpreter. She said agents showed no warrant.

“When he took the phone and began looking at it, they grabbed him,” she said. “He was not even wearing shoes.”

Agents detained Svinchukov around 10 a.m. Dec. 27, according to James “Jimmy” Mathis II, a 72-year-old Vietnam veteran. Svinchukov, who is Aleksandr Kungurtsev’s nephew, works as a caregiver for Mathis.

Mathis said a man in a dark-blue uniform knocked on his door on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs campus in Vancouver. Mathis said the man identified himself as VA campus police. The man said he was there with a warrant with ICE and “just needed something signed,” Mathis said.

He said ICE was pinging Svinchukov’s ankle monitor during the interaction.

Svinchukov was monitored via SmartLINK, a smartphone app and monitoring system used by ICE’s Alternatives to Detention program. The system employs GPS-equipped ankle monitors for continuous location tracking and requires users to submit facial recognition check-ins on the app. Intended to ensure court appearances, these monitoring methods face criticism for the intense digital surveillance they impose on individuals awaiting legal proceedings.

After Svinchukov traveled to Texas for work, ICE placed an ankle monitor on him and restricted his travel to within the Pacific Northwest. The family says they don’t know why he was given the ankle monitor or why his travel was restricted.

When agents came to his home, Mathis let them in. Two other men who entered behind the first were wearing ICE flak jackets. The man in the blue uniform wore no ICE insignia, Mathis said.

Mathis said he felt deceived and began protesting and shouting. He said the agents told him, “Go to sleep, old man.”

A video of the incident shows that Svinchukov demanded a warrant, but agents did not present one. When they moved to restrain Svinchukov, he panicked and tried to run, he told The Columbian in a video call Tuesday.

Mathis told The Columbian he suspects the man in dark blue was an ICE officer posing as VA police. He said he spoke to VA campus police and was told the description he gave didn’t match anyone who worked on the campus.

Other people in Vancouver have reported seeing ICE dressed in a way that makes them appear as if they work for other law enforcement agencies.

Sofiia, Svinchukov’s wife, said officers tackled him and arrested him while the incident was caught on a video call with her.

“These are good people,” Mathis said. “They haven’t done anything wrong. I don’t want to live in a country like that.”

Shaneka Barfield, a spokesperson for the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, told The Columbian that VA police were not involved in this arrest and did not assist ICE.

The families said they tried to file a police report but local authorities refused to accept a report, stating they did not want to get involved with a federal agency.

The 2019 Keep Washington Working Act prohibits local authorities from working with federal immigration enforcement, punishable with a criminal violation and potential stripping of certification.

Potential death sentence

On Tuesday, the families of the men spoke with The Columbian with the help of a translation app and a phone interpreter. Candy canes and ornaments hung in their now-quiet home off Mill Plain Boulevard. A Christmas tree stood in the corner. The dining table held a spread of holiday sweets, resting beneath a wood carving of a church that reads, “Praise him.”

But the holiday atmosphere was broken by the sound of three women speaking with distress to one another in Russian, all wearing masks to mitigate the spread of germs to an immunocompromised teenager nearby. One comforted a whining amber Labradoodle. From the second floor, the mechanical whir of medical equipment drifted down the halls.

Aleksandr Kungurtsev is the sole provider for his wife and 16-year-old son, Egor. The boy recently underwent a 12-hour-long emergency brain surgery and is receiving chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He requires assistance with eating via a feeding tube and going to the bathroom. The family says he can no longer play soccer.

“Our child is physically unable to care for himself and urgently needs his father’s constant presence for both physical care and psychological support,” Viktoriia Kungurtsev said.

She said that following his father’s detention, Egor’s condition deteriorated sharply, resulting in severe vomiting and a hospital visit. Viktoriia Kungurtsev’s fear is that if she is also detained, Egor will have no caretaker and no funding for therapy and will enter the foster system.

The family exhausted their savings during two months of medical rehabilitation in Seattle. They attempted to retain an attorney, paying her $13,500, but said the attorney declared bankruptcy and never returned the funds.

“Right now, we have nothing,” Viktoriia Kungurtsev wrote in an appeal for aid. “No money for rent, food, transportation to the hospital or basic needs.”

The family has posted a GoFundMe to raise money for Egor’s medical expenses.

Beyond the immediate medical crisis, the family fears deportation could be a death sentence for Nikita Svinchukov.

Nikita Svinchukov and Aleksandr Kungurtsev entered the United States seeking asylum using the CBP One mobile app. They were allowed into the country three months after applying for asylum. Nikita Svinchukov has strong ties to the Anti-Corruption Foundation, a Russian organization established by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Russian authorities have labeled the group a “terrorist organization,” resulting in criminal cases against associates. Navalny died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, a death his widow and international leaders blame on the Kremlin.

“We really did come here seeking protection. We believed so much in the United States and its people,” Sofiia Svinchukov said. “We felt safe here and were confident my husband would be protected. He was detained in Russia because of politics, and now he’s being detained here because of politics.”

Nikita Svinchukov believes he will face execution if returned to Russia because of his ties to the Anti-Corruption Foundation.

In the video call with The Columbian, he said that when he and the others were transferred to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, agents told them they “are here because the policy in the country has changed” and instructed them to prepare for deportation.

“We have been asking what the new policy change is, but no one here seems to know what the policy is,” Nikita Svinchukov said.

He said the agents acknowledged that he and his uncle lack criminal history but said it didn’t matter anymore, and they would be placed in a low-risk portion of the detention center.

Nikita Svinchukov said he doesn’t feel safe and described the center as overcrowded, exceeding its 1,575-person capacity.

“There is clearly chaos going on here now with the courts, and it’s all in a deplorable state,” Nikita Svinchukov said. “There are at least 44 people sleeping on the floors of the corridor outside the cells, right now.”

He described the food as just barely edible and hygiene supplies as scarce. A 15-minute video call costs $53, draining what little money the families have left.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Columbian. The ICE media line is disconnected.

“Since Jan. 20, DHS has arrested more than 595,000 illegal aliens,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a Dec. 10 post on the DHS website. “Illegal aliens are hearing our message to leave now. They know if they don’t, we will find them, we will arrest them, and they will never return.”

The men’s families insist they are law-abiding and have complied with any regulations given to them.

“We wouldn’t have reached out to (The Columbian) if we had a criminal record or had done anything illegal,” Sofiia Svinchukov said. “That would have been foolish.”

The family doesn’t know why the women in the family weren’t taken, but reports from across the country show disproportionately more men than women are detained by ICE. On average, 90 percent of arrests by ICE are of men. Between 2012 and 2013, between 93 percent and 94 percent of arrests were men; 6 percent to 7 percent were women.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, in a memo released Thursday, said it would pause the review of all pending applications for visas, green cards, citizenship or asylum from immigrants from the additional countries. The memo also outlines plans to re-review applications of immigrants from these countries as far back as 2021.

The list, which is composed mostly of countries in Africa, includes Angola, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

Last month, the Trump administration expanded the list of countries with travel restrictions to the U.S. from 19 to 39, plus the Palestinian Authority. The move comes as the administration is bringing sharper scrutiny of those who have followed legal steps to seek permanent status in the U.S.

“USCIS remains dedicated to ensuring aliens from high-risk countries of concern who have entered the United States do not pose risks to national security or public safety,” the memo states as rational for the pause and reviews. “To faithfully uphold United States immigration law, the flow of aliens from countries with high overstay rates, significant fraud, or both must stop.”

There are some exceptions outlined in the memo, including athletes and members of their teams competing in the World Cup and Olympics.

The administration first suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.

Toward the end of 2025, DHS began taking steps to further pause and review these legal avenues of migration. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees processing of applications including for visas, naturalizations and asylum, announced it would re-review the status of everyone who had been admitted into the U.S. as a refugee under the Biden administration, essentially reopening those cases.

They didn’t know the definitive timeline, but local immigration organizations and officials are preparing for the anticipated influx of agents.
“No one is safe from the recklessness of this administration,” state Sen. Analise Ortiz told Phoenix New Times.
ICE, she said, has been “more egregious in their activity” and the “potential for even more enforcement is horrifying.” During the first year of the Trump administration, ICE has maintained a steady presence in the Phoenix area.
“These actions do not make us safer,” wrote Beth Strano, the director of Borderlands Resource Initiative, who said the community has been preparing for increased immigration enforcement.","After forceful, violent raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte throughout the first year of the Trump administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning on descending upon Phoenix next, according to reporting by The Bulwark.

On Jan. 2, The Bulwark, a political news organization, reported that the metro Phoenix area will be the next city targeted by the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration operations, in line with the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

Three former DHS officials in contact with their former colleagues told reporter Adrian Carrasquillo that the Democratic-led city will be the agency’s next focus of arrests, detentions and deportations. They didn’t know the definitive timeline, but local immigration organizations and officials are preparing for the anticipated influx of agents.

“No one is safe from the recklessness of this administration,” state Sen. Analise Ortiz told Phoenix New Times. ICE, she said, has been “more egregious in their activity” and the “potential for even more enforcement is horrifying.”

During the first year of the Trump administration, ICE has maintained a steady presence in the Phoenix area. Raids and arrests have occurred at work sites, immigration courts, Home Depot locations and individual homes. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and holiday visitors have been detained.

Neither ICE nor DHS would respond on the record to New Times’ request to comment.

As the new year approaches, these enforcement actions and detention facilities are expected to increase, as ICE is flush with cash following the Republicans’ passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The report that Phoenix will be targeted next also comes on the heels of a “joint enforcement operation” between ICE and the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office, which has resulted in a lot of activity in the San Tan Valley area, some 50 miles southeast of Phoenix.

“These actions do not make us safer,” wrote Beth Strano, the director of Borderlands Resource Initiative, who said the community has been preparing for increased immigration enforcement. “Instead, they create fear, divide families and erode trust in local leaders and law enforcement.”

“It’s been quiet out here, to an extent,” said Clarissa Vela, the founder of PeopleFirstProject. “It’s going to start turning into California.”

Vela was out on a community patrol tracking ICE activity when New Times reached her Friday morning — she said she’d seen nine arrests already before lunch. With activity expected to ramp up, she said, “I believe the community should be embracing one another right now. Regardless of your immigration status, get out and fight. We’re gonna be what stops this.”

The Bulwark wrote that the administration plans to turn the Valley into a “hub of removal” in the Southwest, significantly expanding operations in such cities as Denver, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. Specifically, this will include building more tent-like, soft-sided detention facilities of the sort that are holding thousands of detainees in Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz.”

As ICE attempts to expand its detention capacity nationwide, it appears to be aiming to make Arizona a significant part of that effort. New Times found that Maricopa County Sheriff Jerry Sheridan considered adding 1,000 ICE beds in the county’s jail system and Marana residents are currently fighting plans to turn a former prison into a detention center.

According to reporting by the Washington Post on Dec. 24, ICE is planning to renovate a warehouse site in Glendale to be used as a processing facility, where 500 to 1,500 people would be held. The specific location of that facility is not yet known. Ortiz, who represents the West Valley and parts of Glendale, said the city of Glendale was unable to provide her with any information about the potential facility, which “tells me that it is very, very early in the process,” she said.

In a statement to New Times, the city of Glendale said it was aware of the Post’s reporting, but “has not yet received any information or notice from the federal government about the plan,” spokesperson Lesley Miller wrote.

“If there is an opportunity for the city to block this, they absolutely should,” Ortiz said. “There will be an outpouring, an outcry of opposition to putting this type of death camp in our community.”

ICE’s facilities in Arizona have already come under scrutiny for having hazardous conditions, and Ortiz is worried about the safety of these temporary structures in Arizona’s extreme heat.

“The vast majority of Arizonans do not want to see their friends, family, neighbors or coworkers taken by ICE, people who are doing nothing wrong and are contributing to the community,” she said. “Trump lied to the voters when he said he would go after the most violent people. That is not what is happening.”",https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/10/ICE-Vest-Getty.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 01:56:41.684196

Soto said that at least 87 people were apprehended in Santa Maria, calling it the “epicenter of what they’re seeing over the holiday break.”

Immigrant rights groups also reported increased enforcement action in northern San Luis Obispo County in more recent days, with nearly 20 people in Paso Robles and San Miguel taken into custody on Tuesday, Dec. 30.

KSBY News has reached out to ICE representatives but has not been able to independently verify the number of detentions reported.

Soto added that increased ICE activity has also been seen in other parts of California and the country, saying, “The scale, speed and geographic expansion we are seeing is coordinated regional activity and not isolated incidences, and behind every number is a person.”

Cesar Vasquez, 805 Undocufund Rapid Response organizer, told the crowd that he has seen some of these incidents turn violent and that some U.S. citizens have been detained and questioned because of their race.

AFL’s client, Students Against Racial Discrimination (SARD), alleges that the UC system uses unlawful racial preferences under the guise of “holistic” admissions.

“The University of California tried to shut this case down before any real scrutiny of its admissions practices could take place,” said Ryan Giannetti, Counsel at America First Legal. “The court rightly rejected that effort and confirmed that public universities are not above federal civil-rights laws. UC has done a poor job hiding racial discrimination behind language about ‘holistic review,’ and now it has to answer for its unlawful use of race in admissions.”

America First Legal will continue its fight to end illegal discrimination in higher education, defend students from unlawful judgments based on their immutable traits, and save the American ideals of meritocracy and equal treatment under the law.

And the Washington Post reported recently that ICE is planning to construct seven large-scale industrial holding centers—including a facility in Glendale.
Share “Right now, if you put 5,000 more beds in Phoenix, you have more expansive throughput,” the former senior DHS official said.
As part of its growing presence in Arizona, DHS is expected to build controversial soft-sided facilities, the former official relayed.
The timeline of increased operations in the Phoenix area is unclear.","ALTHOUGH DONALD TRUMP’S IMMIGRATION AGENDA is becoming less and less popular with voters, the president has shown no interest in slowing it down or scaling it back in the new year.

In fact, the federal crackdown is likely to only grow in scope and intensity, as Reuters reported. And as three former DHS officials in contact with their former colleagues at the agency each described to me, the expectation among current officials is that one Democratic-led city in particular is about to become the next focus of arrests, detentions, and deportations: Phoenix.

A more robust DHS presence in the Phoenix metropolitan area would mark a new phase in the Trump operations—not just because it would take place in one of the country’s most significant swing states (and a border one, at that), but because it would likely involve a greater expenditure of federal resources than prior operations in other cities have required.

ICE is flush with cash following last year’s passage of the president’s signature piece of legislation, the “Big Beautiful Bill.” And the administration is looking to use that money to dramatically expand its detention capabilities. Residents in Arizona have already been fighting plans to turn the former Marana prison outside Tucson into a detention center. And the Washington Post reported recently that ICE is planning to construct seven large-scale industrial holding centers—including a facility in Glendale.

One of the three former senior DHS officials said that adding thousands more beds in the areas surrounding Phoenix would allow the administration to turn the city into a “hub of removal” in the Southwest.

“Right now, if you put 5,000 more beds in Phoenix, you have more expansive throughput,” the former senior DHS official said. An increase on that level would make it possible for federal agents to significantly expand their operations in other Western cities, including Denver, Las Vegas, and L.A.

“Arizona becomes another hub like [the Rio Grande Processing Center],” the official added.

As part of its growing presence in Arizona, DHS is expected to build controversial soft-sided facilities, the former official relayed. The tent-like structures are easier to put up quickly, but they are difficult to manage humanely because of their greater exposure to the elements, which contributes to a variety of serious problems for detainees. Soft-sided facilities have already been controversial during Trump’s second term: Florida opened a detention center in the Everglades, soon nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz” by the administration, and continues to operate it in spite of horrifying reports about the conditions being faced by the 6,725 men who have been or are currently being held there. (A court case is pending that could result in the closure of the detention camp; it has already survived multiple legal challenges to its continued operations.)

Elsewhere, the use of soft-sided detention centers has expanded. The $1.24 billion facility in Fort Bliss held 1,000 detainees when it opened in August; it is intended to hold up to 5,000 people.

The timeline of increased operations in the Phoenix area is unclear. While it’s a safe bet that the administration plans to use the same playbook it used in other cities, there could be some notable differences.

Andrea Flores, who served as the director of border management on the National Security Council during the Biden administration and oversaw coordination between ICE and CBP, warned that the use of soft-sided facilities as overflow immigration detention space raises significant humanitarian concerns.

“It’s extremely expensive, and these are not spaces people should be in for a long time, frankly—they were very poorly managed even under Biden,” she told me. “The concern is you expand soft-sideds to expand detention space, but just because you do doesn’t mean you can expand removals. Then you’re just going to have a bunch of people detained in the desert.”

Flores added that in its obsessive quest to remake immigration enforcement, the Trump administration has been treating every novel idea as a good one. That fixation on novelty has led to the implementation of some truly bad ideas.

“Alligator Alcatraz was unique and also a failure,” she said. “It didn’t necessarily ramp up deportations, it just put them in intensely inhumane conditions.”

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin did not respond to a request for comment on the prospect of an enforcement ramp-up in the Phoenix metro area in January.

A History of Opposition: From SB 1070 to a Blue-Hued Arizona

There is another reason that DHS’s Phoenix operations will be different from the ones the department has undertaken in other cities: Arizona’s history of wrenching political fights over immigration and the border.

Arizonans have many scars from these battles. Fifteen years ago, many fought State Sen. Russell Pearce’s show-me-your-papers law, SB 1070. Around that time, a constellation of activists and organizers mobilized against then–Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio. They, alongside Republicans who recoiled at the party’s embrace of Trumpism, turned Arizona from a ruby-red state—one that hadn’t gone blue since 1996—to a state Joe Biden won in 2020. Arizona now boasts two nationally known Democratic figures in Sens. Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly; it also has a Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs.

What Arizonans told me is they now see in Trump an Arpaio at the national level—and a threat to immigrants that is that much broader.

“Here, specifically in Southern Arizona, we’ve been anticipating something like this happening,” Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) told me. “In Tucson, the mayors met with Pima County elected officials and the Tucson police department, who have all taken strong positions that none of our government resources are going to be used to help ICE in any way.”

From the Marana prison in Grijalva’s backyard to the reports of future warehouses stuffed with immigrants, the congresswoman has many vectors of DHS’s operations in view, and she said she’s going to keep pushing back against all of the department’s encroachments in her state.

“I don’t want any kind of detention facility here, people languishing, given no kind of process at all,” she said. “I have not been able to see constituents in Florence and Eloy, so I think I’m just going to start showing up. They have to meet that quota, and the only way to do it is illegally.”

Representatives of grassroots groups preparing for the influx of federal agents say the groups are currently working as a loose network of organizations with no formal leadership structure. The members of the ad-hoc coalition include NDLON; LUCHA AZ, a mainstay in organizing as well as political work activating Latino voters in the state; most of the local labor unions; established groups like Chicanos Por La Causa; and some more radical entities such as the Party for Socialism and Liberation. To a person, the activists I spoke with say the state has been in this precarious place before.

“This has been tried before and failed with Joe Arpaio’s tent city and the Arizona experiment with early onset Trumpism changed the state from red to blue,” said Chris Newman, the general counsel of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON). Newman noted that even the current backlash to Trump’s immigration crackdown has reminded many Arizonans of what happened in their state during the Arpaio era. “Pretty much all of the activism that you see in the immigrant rights movement right now is emulating the type of response that civil rights leaders demonstrated in Arizona in 2010, which was the seminal year.”

“Linked Fates”

So what will the reaction in the Phoenix area be to more aggressive anti-immigration operations?

Alejandra Gomez, the head of LUCHA AZ, has picked up on several clues. She told me her group conducted a research study during the spring and summer of 2024 that included 1,400 Latino voters, from first generation to fourth, from the most traditional voter to the most skeptical ones. It found that Latinos in Arizona felt a sense of “linked fates” regardless of their immigration status or how long they’d been here.

She also recalled the march of tens of thousands of Arizonans on the state capitol in 2010 to protest SB 1070. More of that kind of resistance will be in order should Trump escalate enforcement in the state, she said.

“There’s a muscle memory that will come together when we begin to see the supercharged version of this,” she predicted. “If there is fear, people are still acting. If there is anger, people are still acting. If there is sadness, people are still acting. What is also true is people are still living and not allowing the intimidation from this administration to stop quinceañeras or weddings.”

Newman agreed.

“If the Trump administration escalates enforcement activities in Arizona, that will be met with an escalation of nonviolent protest,” he said.

But is it possible we live in a different time? Could it be that what worked in 2010 during a nascent anti-immigrant moment won’t succeed now? The state dealt more directly than others with more lax border policies under Joe Biden; could that history have helped prepare it to embrace something more extreme in the opposite philosophical direction?

One of the state’s top pollsters—who worked for one of the state’s more prominent conservatives—doesn’t think so.

Chuck Coughlin served as a campaign manager for former Republican governor Jan Brewer during the battle over SB 1070; today, he is the president of HighGround, a polling operation in Arizona. He told me increased enforcement in Phoenix won’t go over well with voters, and it especially won’t go over well with voters in Maricopa County, which is home to 60 percent of the state’s electorate.

“I don’t look at this as being a positive move in Maricopa county, it’s not going to play well,” Coughlin said. “Everybody believes the border control problem is under control. That was always the issue that created the angst back when I worked for Brewer. Back then it was that people were coming over the border with impunity, that’s not happening at all now, so that sentiment isn’t there.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDyi!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6601947b-5c4b-4c3b-8eb5-cae23d5133a1_6048x4024.jpeg",N,,2026-01-02 18:56:22.885970

HAVANA TIMES – US federal immigration agents are now routinely operating masked and without visible identification, exacerbating the abusive and unaccountable nature of the current administration’s mass-deportation campaign, the organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) has reported.

According to a report by the human-rights organization, “the indefinite and widespread nature of these practices is fundamentally incompatible with the United States’ obligations to ensure that abuses by law-enforcement forces are investigated and that there is accountability.”

Belkis Wille, associate crisis and conflict director at HRW, said that “this kind of concealment should be the exception, never the norm. Law-enforcement agents must be identifiable so that they can be held accountable for their actions.”

“And it is even more alarming given the widespread abuses that have occurred during immigration-related arrests in recent months,” she added.

HRW stated that since Donald Trump assumed the presidency again in January 2025, “his administration has carried out across the country an abusive campaign of immigration raids and arrests, primarily targeting people of color.”

“Many of the raids are deliberately carried out in places where people from the Latino community work, shop, eat, and live,” the report noted.

Agents have apprehended people in courthouses for routine appointments with immigration officials, as well as in places of worship, schools, and other sensitive locations, the text highlighted.

Many raids have been marked by the sudden and unjustified use of force, without provocation, creating a climate of fear in many immigrant communities.

These immigration-enforcement operations have often involved agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) who wear masks and, in some cases, are dressed in plain clothes.

It is common for agents to conceal agency badges and use unmarked vehicles to detain people in their cars as well as in courthouses, schools, workplaces, homes, on the street, and on public transportation.

On its website, ICE justifies the widespread practice of masking by stating that it is intended to “avoid being exposed.”

“This kind of broad and indiscriminate justification for concealing officials’ identities is not compatible with the United States’ human-rights obligations, except when the measure is necessary and proportionate to address specific security considerations,” HRW stated.

By contrast, when applied as a broad and automatic strategy, such measures “constitute an obstacle to accountability that is incompatible with the United States’ human-rights obligations,” it said.

It added that anonymity also weakens deterrence, fosters conditions for impunity, and inhibits the exercise of rights.

According to the Deportation Data Project at the University of California, nearly 220,000 people were detained by ICE agents in the first nine months of the Trump administration.

HRW interviewed 18 people who were arrested or witnessed arrests by unidentifiable individuals in five US cities since January 20. All described the incidents as terrifying, saying they felt they could do nothing if they suffered abuses, especially if the agents were not identifiable.

The organization also analyzed dozens of videos of stops and arrests involving masked agents that were posted on social media.

Many observers “have suggested that the terror these tactics instill is deliberate,” HRW noted.

Additionally, HRW reports that in recent months the media have covered cases of people impersonating federal agents who kidnap, sexually assault, and extort victims, exploiting the fear generated by immigration-control measures.

“This shows that the lines between criminals and law-enforcement agents can be blurred when federal agents themselves are not identifiable,” HRW said.

The organization maintained that “Congress must investigate the brutality in ongoing immigration-enforcement activities, including the specific impacts of unidentifiable agents carrying out stops and arrests.”

“Allowing masked and unidentified agents to roam communities and apprehend people without identifying themselves undermines trust in the rule of law, creates a vacuum in which abuses can spread, and exacerbates unnecessary violence and the brutality of arrests,” Wille concluded.

""I think that this is going to push a lot of trans rights litigation to state courts under state constitutions,"" she said.","-- In 2026, the fight for access to justice in the United States will be shaped by high-stakes legal and budgetary decisions affecting immigration, housing and civil rights. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear a challenge to President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to restrict birthright citizenship, a case that could deny federal recognition of citizenship to certain U.S.-born children and upend long-settled constitutional law.

At the same time, Congress is moving toward sharp cuts to funding for civil legal aid, threatening the Legal Services Corporation and the nonprofit legal aid providers that represent low-income Americans in cases involving eviction, benefits and family stability.

Efforts to expand the right to counsel for tenants facing eviction continue to grow, and studies show improved court outcomes, but chronic underfunding, attorney shortages and state preemption laws are limiting their reach.

Legal experts and advocates spoke with Law360 about these developments and what they signal for access to justice efforts in the year ahead, as state courts increasingly become the front line for civil rights enforcement.

The Showdown Over Birthright Citizenship

This year, the Supreme Court will decide whether the 14th Amendment guarantees a right to U.S. citizenship to all children born on U.S. soil with few exceptions, as has been the case since the amendment's ratification in 1868.

On Dec. 6, the court decided it will hear a legal challenge to an executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship that President Trump signed on his first day back in office.

Now in the hands of the justices, the case, Trump v. Barbara , has the potential to drastically reshape American immigration and could have a deep impact on the fabric of society, experts say.

The citizenship clause of the amendment says, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""

In his Jan. 20, 2025, executive order titled ""Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,"" Trump said that ""the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.""

With the executive order, Trump promoted an interpretation of the Constitution in which the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" excludes the children of noncitizens without a permanent status in the country. This interpretation, which is at odds with the majority of scholarship on the issue, has been proposed for decades, mostly in conservative legal circles.

Under the executive order, the federal government would deny recognition of U.S. citizenship to certain children born in the United States based on their parents' immigration status at the time of birth. The order applies only when both parents lack U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident status, but it sweeps in two distinct categories of births.

One category covers children born to mothers who were unlawfully present in the United States at the time of delivery, when the child's father was neither a U.S. citizen nor a lawful permanent resident. A second category applies to children whose mothers were lawfully in the country on a temporary basis, such as on a visa, but whose fathers likewise did not hold U.S. citizenship or green cards when the child was born.

In practical terms, the order directs federal agencies to treat children born under those circumstances as noncitizens, despite their U.S. birthplace. As a result, affected individuals would be unable to obtain federal documentation recognizing U.S. citizenship, including passports and Social Security numbers, even if they were issued birth certificates by state or local authorities.

Overall, at least 11 lawsuits have been filed to challenge the executive order, according to a litigation tracker run by Just Security, a digital law and policy journal housed in the Reiss Center on Law and Security at the New York University School of Law.

In four of those cases, federal district courts issued nationwide preliminary injunctions last year. The Supreme Court ruled in June in one of them, Trump v. CASA , limiting federal courts' power to issue universal injunctions, but did not rule on the issue of birthright citizenship.

In Trump v. Barbara , a federal court in New Hampshire temporarily prohibited federal officials from implementing the executive order as applied to a class of infants born on or after Feb. 20, 2025.

Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor at Cornell University Law School, said that although the Supreme Court has been largely deferential to President Trump on most immigration issues, the birthright citizenship case might present an opportunity to distance itself from his administration's policies.

""The court wants at least one case, I think, to show that it does have some independence from President Trump by ruling against him,"" he said. ""I think this is an example of such a case.""

Funding for Legal Aid Uncertain

Funding for legal aid is one of the most pressing access to justice issues facing the country, with the legal needs of millions of people going unmet.

According to a 2022 study by the Legal Services Corporation — a nonprofit, federally funded organization established by Congress in 1974 to ensure equal access to justice by providing civil legal aid to people who can't afford lawyers — low-income Americans lack legal help for 92% of their substantial civil legal problems.

In its budget proposal for fiscal year 2026, which ends on Sept. 30, the White House called for eliminating the LSC, which provides funding to 131 independent nonprofit legal aid organizations in every state, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories for issues like housing, wages and benefits.

Congress declined to follow the White House's proposal to shut down the LSC, but the organization is now facing a reduction in federal funding. While the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $6 million increase in July, the House Appropriations Committee passed legislation that would decrease the LSC's funding by 46% from its current level — earmarking $300 million. The current funding will remain flat through January, but cuts are coming.

In a call with Law360, LSC President Ronald S. Flagg said the current budget environment presents significant challenges for civil legal aid. At the same time, at a time when federal agencies are eliminated altogether or their budgets are slashed, actions by Congress signal that there is bipartisan support for the LSC and the need for funding civil legal aid overall.

""Flat funding in this environment can be viewed as a win when many federally funded institutions saw deep cuts or were eliminated entirely,"" Flagg said. ""That said, flat funding still leaves enormous unmet need.""

About half of people seeking assistance from legal aid organizations are turned away because of lack of funding, Flagg said.

If the House's proposed budget cut, which would take LSC's funding back to 1999 levels, is signed into law, an estimated 2.9 million more Americans would be left without legal help each year, according to the organization.

""As all of these budget negotiations are going forward, legal service organizations across the country have already seen reduced revenues and staffing layoffs at the same time as demand for their services are surging for help with housing, and family, and safety, and economic stability,"" Flagg said. ""In that setting of economic pressure, actually, investment in legal aid is one of the highest value investments communities can make.""

Studies conducted by the LSC estimate that each dollar invested in civil legal aid results in $7 in economic returns by reducing homelessness and the need for emergency services and shelters, and by preserving employment.

""It's all very much dependent on our continuing to make investments in civil legal aid, which is why the current debate over the federal budget, and in particular the legal funding for LSC, remains so important,"" Flagg said.

Right to Counsel's Expansion and Challenges

A nationwide movement to expand the right to an attorney in civil legal matters will continue to gain new ground in 2026, opening avenues for thousands of Americans who struggle on issues directly impacting their lives, in particular tenant-landlord disputes.

John Pollock, the coordinator of National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel, told Law360 that right-to-counsel, or RTC, for tenants facing eviction has continued to expand geographically in 2025, with Los Angeles adopting tenant right to counsel and Bozeman, Montana, joining the list, bringing the total to 27 jurisdictions.

Reports published in 2025 showed both the impact and the challenges involved in expanding the right to a lawyer. Some of the challenges have to do with implementation, which often lags behind the legislative timelines lawmakers set when passing RTC laws.

One of the studies, which looked at RTC programs for tenants implemented between 2017 and 2024, show that, on average, RTC programs became operational more than six months after passage, with much longer delays in large jurisdictions or those that phased programs in gradually.

In practice, many programs could not serve all eligible tenants, even where laws promised universal coverage. Legal aid providers often lacked sufficient staff, leading to waitlists, triage systems or limited-scope representation that fell short of full counsel representation. The study also identified chronic underfunding and attorney shortages as the most serious obstacles to effective RTC implementation.

But the same study also showed evidence that, when implemented well, RTC is able to improve the legal system as a whole and lead to better outcomes for litigants. For example, the study found that in jurisdictions where RTC was meaningfully integrated, default eviction orders against tenants decreased, tenant protections like habitability laws were enforced more consistently and there was a shift away from ""eviction mill"" court practices that litigants and attorneys have lamented for years.

Pollock said the availability of counsel ""is changing the game."" RTC laws created streamlined processes to access attorneys.

""Before right to counsel, a lot of tenants were lost in the maze of trying to get legal assistance,"" he said.

Courts in jurisdictions that have RTC laws began to change the way they behaved towards tenants, informing them about their right to a lawyer and shifting the culture of tenant courts from one where evictions were often rubber-stamped by judges to one where they are litigated. Issues like needed repairs in the home appear more routinely where RTC exists, compared to the past, Pollock said.

The studies found that legal representation can help reduce harm, even when eviction occurs. Lawyers can help tenants address those issues in court where they can ask courts to order landlords to make repairs or mitigate them. Attorneys can also help tenants negotiate extra time to move when an eviction order is issued and avoid getting eviction records. These outcomes reduced trauma, family disruption and risk of homelessness, the studies show.

Looking ahead to 2026, Pollock said uncertainties over the federal budget are concerning. He warned that potential cuts to Medicaid, expiration of healthcare subsidies under Obamacare and cuts to rent assistance programs funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development could trigger cascading effects.

""They're going to cause health problems. But health problems don't stay health problems, they lead to housing problems, they lead to employment problems, they lead to child custody problems, and all of those then ripple and flow into the civil justice system,"" Pollock said.

Pollock described state preemption — the use of state law to bar cities and counties from enacting, or even considering, local ordinances in certain policy areas — as another threat to access to justice people will face in 2026.

In the housing context, preemption means states could pass legislation that prohibits municipalities from adopting measures such as right-to-counsel laws, rent regulations, eviction protections or other landlord-tenant reforms, even where local officials and voters support them.

Pollock said conservative states are increasingly using preemption not just to strike down specific policies but to remove local authority altogether. He pointed to Texas and Florida, which in 2024 enacted laws preempting the entire field of landlord-tenant regulation, effectively preventing cities from passing any new tenant-protective measures regardless of local conditions.

As the federal government pulls back from enforcing civil rights protections across the executive, legislative and judicial branches, state courts and state constitutions have increasingly emerged as the front line for civil rights litigation, said Kasia Szymborski Wolfkot, a senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Judiciary Program.

Szymborski Wolfkot said a broad federal retrenchment has pushed civil rights advocates to turn to state courts and state Legislatures to vindicate rights that once found protection in federal law. In response, she said, states have begun ""filling the gap.""

That has included interpreting state constitutions more expansively, creating new causes of action and developing remedies that go beyond what is currently available in federal courts. As a result, Szymborski Wolfkot said, state constitutional law has become an increasingly important battleground for civil rights enforcement — one that will likely see important developments in 2026.

Outrage over aggressive immigration enforcement has prompted state lawmakers in immigration-friendly states to consider new accountability mechanisms for federal agents.

Currently, most states lack remedies for violations of state constitutional rights equivalent to those available under Section 1983 of Title 42 of the U.S. Code, the federal civil rights statute, which allows plaintiffs to seek damages against state officials.

But that landscape is changing, Szymborski Wolfkot said.

The Illinois Legislature, for example, recently passed the ""Illinois Bivens Act,"" a law that would allow individuals to sue federal officials for constitutional violations during civil immigration enforcement activities and expand remedies for violations of state constitutional rights. Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the legislation into law on Dec. 9.

Similar proposals are being considered in other states, including New York, where immigration enforcement has increased dramatically since the beginning of the second Trump administration.

""They've really started to introduce and think about introducing some legislation that gives people private causes of action,"" Szymborski Wolfkot said. ""This is exciting, because while they may be focused on ICE enforcement, it also allows for a cause of action for violations of the state constitution.""

In another growing trend, more states are passing laws barring immigration enforcement in sensitive locations, such as courthouses, schools and hospitals.

Szymborski Wolfkot said that, after the federal government rescinded internal limits on immigration arrests in these places, states like New York stepped in with their own protections. She said additional states are now adopting similar restrictions, framing them as civil rights measures designed to ensure that people can safely access courts, education and medical care without fear of arrest.

State courts are also at the forefront of legal challenges involving the rights of transgender persons.

Following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in June in United States v. Skrmetti upholding Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, trans rights litigation is increasingly moving to state courts, Szymborski Wolfkot said. Montana's Supreme Court struck down a similar ban under its state constitution's privacy protections, and challenges are pending in state courts in Ohio and North Dakota.

Szymborski said ""healthcare freedom"" constitutional amendments, originally adopted to limit the Affordable Care Act, are being used by litigators as tools to challenge restrictions on gender-affirming care and abortion.

""I think that this is going to push a lot of trans rights litigation to state courts under state constitutions,"" she said.

They have stood by while conservative presidential absolutists have framed the debate with labels, shibboleths, and catchphrases that, while misleading or outright false, have tilted the playing field rightward.
Here lies the textualist/originalist case for absolutist unitary executive theory; rest in peace.
Very unfortunately, despite the empty legal grounding and practical horrors of unitary executive theory, liberal advocates have allowed proponents like Kavanaugh to frame and dominate the public narrative.
“Unitary executive theory,” for example, is a mind-numbing, impenetrable abstraction calculated to induce 99 percent of the populace to tune out of the debate altogether.","The media’s takeaways from the December oral arguments in the Trump Justice Department’s bid to the Supreme Court to invalidate multimember “independent agencies” were unanimous: They were a big win for Trump and for legal conservatives’ decades-long drive to free presidents from congressionally imposed checks on presidential control over executive agencies and personnel. The widely anticipated result would render two dozen commissions and boards that have wielded political authority for decades unconstitutional at a stroke.

To provide a modicum of insulation from political interference, these bodies’ governing statutes prescribe that the president may only remove commissioners or board members for “cause”—usually defined as “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Such limitations on presidential removal authority run counter to the “unitary executive theory” treasured by the conservative legal movement. On all sides, pundits heard all six conservative justices signaling that they would likely apply that theory to uphold Trump’s unexplained dismissal of Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, eliminating for-cause removal safeguards and with it, multimember agency independence.

This consensus take is accurate as far as it goes. But beneath the conservative justices’ convergence around that bottom line, the lengthy session exposed reservations, confusion, and differences across the conservative bloc, potentially heralding divergence, uncertainty, proliferating lawsuits, and regulatory gridlock in years ahead—perhaps even this term.

The right-wing justices’ emergent disarray seemed to reflect their awareness of pitfalls lurking in and around their hitherto unquestioned unitary executive gospel—including logical, legal, and most of all, real-world consequences that menace the economy, the nation, and the court itself. With these threats suddenly hoving into view, the conservative justices were flailing to figure out credible strategies to head it off.

Obviously, the gritted-teeth dogmatism of the conservative justices is the engine that has driven this kooky theory forward, despite its evident lack of grounding in constitutional text and history. But liberals also deserve blame. They have stood by while conservative presidential absolutists have framed the debate with labels, shibboleths, and catchphrases that, while misleading or outright false, have tilted the playing field rightward.

Since first hoisted by President Ronald Reagan’s second-term Attorney General Edwin Meese, the unitary executive banner has flown as an originalist imperative, catchily articulated by wordsmith-in-chief Justice Antonin Scalia. Quoting the so-called vesting clause of Article 2 of the Constitution—“The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States”—Scalia spun that text to “not mean some of the executive power, but all of the executive power.” Scalia’s chestnut bred an asserted (though not demonstrated) corollary: that to effectively deploy this sweeping authority, presidents must hold an indefeasible power to remove senior executive officials, certainly agency heads, at will, for any reason or no reason.

But in the oral argument testing this claim, the conservative justices seemed to reckon with the fact that recent scholarship had obliterated unitary executive theorists’ claims to an originalist birthright. Here, hammer blows had been struck by both eminent conservative as well as liberal-leaning academics. In the courtroom, the justices’ grudging recognition came across in a variety of ways.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, perhaps because she repeatedly vaunts her originalist fidelity, tried two countertactics, neither of which seemed to resonate with her conservative colleagues. First, she attempted to trivialize the real-world importance of the several agencies enacted in the 1790s with leadership structures recently shown to lack untrammeled presidential removal authority. Even if this was factually accurate, her contention would have little or no legal probative weight. But Barrett was, indeed, demonstrably wrong on the facts.

In postrevolutionary America, the agencies that Congress saw fit to wall off from presidential at-will removal wielded significant economic and societal power. An example was the Revolutionary War Debt Commission, enacted in 1790, in response to a proposal by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. He called for an entity to be run by “commissioners, vested with … final authority,” not “with the President … nor Hamilton himself as Secretary of the Treasury,” as noted in Georgetown administrative law expert Victoria Nourse’s friend-of-the-court brief. Hamilton estimated that this Commission was tasked with distributing over $25 million, a “tremendous” sum, according to Nourse, more than $880 million today.

Acknowledging that the War Debt Commission and other similarly independent eighteenth-century entities render the vesting clause a thin reed for presidential absolutist unitary executive theorists, Barrett offered a second alternative approach. She observed to Trump’s lawyer, Solicitor General John Sauer, that constitutional provisions other than the vesting clause could plausibly ground a decision to trim Congress’s power to constrain presidential firing discretion. Then she whisked to her point, “Is there any reason to be specific [about which provision the court relies on] in this case?”

Barrett’s stratagem would have the court bless Trump’s unreasoned dismissal of Slaughter without specifying a reasoned basis for its own decision. Would that ploy pass any relevant smell test? Should six unelected, life-tenured justices wipe out over a century of precedent structuring vast sectors of the economy—without bothering to explain where and how they derive the authority to engineer such an epochal upheaval? Unsurprisingly, no takers spoke up to endorse this approach.

The principal constitutional provision Barrett had in mind as an alternative textual basis for Trump’s purported removal of Slaughter was the so-called “take care” clause. This clause prescribes that the president “shall take care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Presidential absolutists have often cast that clause as a grant of power paralleling or reinforcing their Scalian gloss on the vesting clause. Without unbounded power to fire all agency heads, they insist, the president will be unable to ensure their faithful execution of the law.

Thus, as Justice Neil Gorsuch grilled Slaughter’s counsel, Amit Agarwal: “You agree, I assume, the president is vested with all the executive power [echoing Scalia’s 1988 proclamation] (emphasis added),” and that “he has a duty to faithfully execute all the laws.” But Gorsuch, reiterating decades-old assertions by presidential absolutists, misstated the text of both clauses. The vesting clause does not actually say “all” the power; Justice Scalia did. His spin is plausible, but that text certainly permits more nuanced interpretations. In a rare slip during an otherwise on-the-mark performance, Agarwal acquiesced in the Scalia-Gorsuch distortion.

Much more telling, the terms of the take care clause do not direct the president to execute the laws, faithfully or otherwise; the clause requires him to “take care that the Laws be faithfully executed”—that is to say by others; namely, his subordinates. Further, this language prescribes a duty, not a grant of power, and one which he is obligated to “take care” to fulfill.

In practical fact, are presidents disabled from performing that good-faith oversight role if they are authorized to fire agency heads for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance”? On the contrary, such a mandate could more plausibly be understood to affirmatively ensure that a president could use removal authority to further fidelity to law by agency heads—as distinguished from pushing his own political agenda, which is expressly what this administration argues should be a president’s prerogative.

Moreover, Barrett’s (correct) assertion that more than one constitutional provision pertains to presidential removal authority underscores that the vesting clause cannot be read in isolation but must be contextually interpreted in the light of all such relevant constitutional provisions. (The lifting of discrete words or phrases out of context is a common maneuver by conservatives to twist the meaning of legal texts.) Such other provisions would, necessarily, include Article 1’s foundational grant of power to Congress “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing [enumerated] Powers [specifically assigned to Congress], and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.” (Emphasis mine.) Here lies the textualist/originalist case for absolutist unitary executive theory; rest in peace.

To work around the collapse of this long-standing foundation for presidential absolutism, Barrett’s colleagues on the right took a different tack: They ignored it. They never invoked constitutional text or Framers’ design at all. Instead, they reverted to two strategies. The first was a constitutional policy argument, untethered to constitutional text or original design. This claim was that independent agencies are democratically unaccountable, a failing remediable only by axing removal restrictions and subjecting multimember agencies like the FTC to unlimited control by the elected national chief executive. As Justice Brett Kavanaugh challenged Slaughter’s counsel:

How do you answer the accountability theme.... Independent agencies are not accountable to the people? They’re not elected as Congress and the president are and are exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries?

Reinforcing this “accountability” riff, conservative justices trotted out a second tack—parades of hypothetical horribles, far-fetched in the manner of the fantasies that law professors contrive to bedevil first-year law students. As Kavanaugh, echoing suggestions by Barrett, lectured Slaughter’s counsel:

Your position would allow Congress to ... maybe convert some of the existing executive agencies into independent agencies with no political balance requirement, with a long term, say, 10 or more years.... So you can imagine ... when both houses of Congress and president are controlled by the same party ... so as to thwart future presidents of the opposite party, and ... I don’t think we can just say, oh, that hasn’t happened, so it’ll never happen.

What the “accountability” and parade of horribles gambits both show is that the court’s conservatives, desperate to pull their limping unitary executive theory at-will removal package across the finish line, have leapt from abandoning constitutional text or original meaning to conjuring real-world consequentialist claims that similarly have no connection to on-the-ground reality.

Anyone familiar with the actualities of how nominally “independent” agencies shape and adopt rules and policies, implement, and enforce them—especially those targeting the “billion dollar industries” for which Kavanaugh shed crocodile tears—knows that they are in fact democratically accountable. Their officials are necessarily aware and wary of Congress, where powerful committees and individual members are responsive to interests the agencies regulate, of the federal courts, and of the White House as well. Especially in the current environment, no one who reads newspapers or views newscasts can consider, say, the Federal Trade Commission or the Federal Communications Commission “unaccountable.”

Quite apart from such such agencies’ subservience to the current White House, screeds like Kavanaugh’s, against the “headless fourth branch,” leave out the landmark accountability regime that the post–New Deal Congress enacted. This is the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, which gives targets of agency actions statutory rights, enforceable in court—to receive notice; to be heard; to present factual, legal, and policy contentions, before significant agency actions can be undertaken or finalized. To such contentions, agencies must provide “reasonable,” record-based responses or risk getting initiatives scrapped in court.

Those requirements impel agencies to invest years of effort, involving chunks of personnel, revenue, and other resources. Riding on their success, agency leaders, including presidential appointees and presidents themselves, can have significant reputational, ideological, or political stakes. And in terms of democratic accountability, APA-mandated procedures are orders of magnitude more marked by meaningful participation for affected interests, and more transparent to the media and politicians with relevant constituencies and interests, than many secrecy-shrouded backroom maneuvers on Capitol Hill or in the White House—none of which are covered by the APA or equivalent open-government safeguards.

Very unfortunately, despite the empty legal grounding and practical horrors of unitary executive theory, liberal advocates have allowed proponents like Kavanaugh to frame and dominate the public narrative. Their errors and omissions are why liberals have often come up short in the half-century-old war over the courts and the Constitution.

To begin with, liberals have not challenged labels that their conservative adversaries have crafted to frame the debate their way. “Unitary executive theory,” for example, is a mind-numbing, impenetrable abstraction calculated to induce 99 percent of the populace to tune out of the debate altogether. This of course is precisely the impact UET theorists seek.

Liberals should be opening ordinary people’s eyes to the real-world consequences for them of gutting autonomy for, say, the FCC, with its power to grant, deny, condition, or withdraw broadcast licenses, or the FTC, with its power to scotch power-concentrating mergers, rooting out deceptive and abusive marketing schemes, and engineering restitution to victimized consumers.

To do that liberal advocates could begin by replacing the soporific “unitary executive theory” label with one more sharp-edged—perhaps “presidential absolutists” or “politicizers” or “corruption coddlers.” They need to constantly highlight concrete examples of abuses, threatened and actual, and of corruption that could or has already caused attention-getting damage, and spotlight the beneficiaries of agency programs and actions. They could be saying that absolutists are out to “Make America Corrupt Again” or “bring back the swamp.” This should and could be a debate liberals will enjoy having; one that conservatives shall run from.

Too often, liberals counter unitary executive theory with a defense of the need for “impartial experts,“ lauding agency missions in hopelessly abstract terms, such as health or competition or fairness. To be sure, highlighting expertise or critical agency missions is valid and necessary. But taken alone, such frames can reinforce the right’s portrayal of regulatory and other officials as denizens of a remote “administrative state,” distant and undemocratic, performing esoteric duties that don’t speak to the real-world benefits being provided.

Indeed, the very term “independent agency,” which sets the framework for the entire public, political, and constitutional debate, is a misleading misnomer. Presidents have ample means of influencing multimember agencies, notwithstanding that agency leaders can be terminated before their statutorily fixed terms expire (only) for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.” After all, who can, with a straight face, cast that formula as impeding the president’s duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed?

Anyone who has served in a White House and been involved in efforts to nudge agencies like the FTC or FCC toward a president’s policy priorities—as I was in President Jimmy Carter’s White House—knows that presidents have ample legitimate levers, from the authority to select chairpersons from among commission members; to appoint members on a staggered, fixed-term basis; to formally advocate before or in appropriate circumstances contact agency officials; and even to use the president’s bully pulpit.

The claim made by the absolutists, that these agency heads are “unaccountable,” is ahistorical. In addition to ignoring the accountability to the judicial branch created by the APA, that slander leaves out of account the multidecade reform process that turned notoriously timid agencies, which were often cozy with the industries they were assigned to regulate, into agencies that are qualitatively more conscientious, aggressive, and even innovative instruments of the missions Congress created them to serve.

That reform process was sparked by Ralph Nader and his legions of young reform-minded lawyers. Their initial target was the very entity that the Trump White House and its acolytes seek to bring to heel by firing Slaughter simply because she was appointed by Trump’s Democrat predecessor. In 1969, “Nader’s Raiders,” as they were dubbed by The Washington Post’s William Greider, famously delivered an 185-page report, which described the FTC as hobbled by “cronyism, institutionalized mediocrity, endemic inaction, delay, and secrecy ... an iceberg of incompetence and mismanagement.”

The report set off a tidal wave of public demand for reform, such that the new Republican president, Richard M. Nixon, requested a follow-up report from the American Bar Association. When the ABA substantiated and even supplemented Nader’s Raiders’ criticisms, Nixon sent a “Special Message on Consumer Protection” to Congress, elaborating his “belief [that] the time has now come for the reactivation and revitalization of the FTC.”

In addition to proposing a raft of statutory enhancements of the FTC’s jurisdiction and authority. Nixon’s message also detailed an internal reform agenda for the agency. He noted, “The chairman-designate of the FTC has assured me that he intends to initiate a new era of vigorous action as soon as he is confirmed by the Senate and takes office.” Nixon “urge[d] the FTC to give serious consideration” to the ABA report and remedies it proposed, and laid out several specific actions for the agency, including “reduc[ing] its unacceptably large backlog of cases” and “more energetic field investigations.”

Moreover, he noted that his Bureau of the Budget (precursor of the current Office of Management and Budget) would assist in diagnosing problems and shaping solutions, and provide or recommend additional funding if necessary. When Jimmy Carter ascended to the White House in 1976, he solidified and intensified Nixon’s “revitalization” effort, by appointing and naming Michael Pertschuk, a Nader ally, as chairman, and appointing an additional new commissioner—Columbia law professor Robert Pitofsky, the author of the ABA’s report.

Precisely because presidents, Congress, and public opinion held the dysfunctional mid-twentieth-century FTC accountable and enabled its “revitalization,” major businesses invested massive resources to reverse that progress. That backlash campaign has now been capped by this bid to the Supreme Court to overturn long-standing precedent, ignore or misconstrue legal text enacted by Congress or embodied in the Constitution—all in order to give an unabashedly corrupt president direct authority to squelch measures inimical to his or his allies’ interests.",https://images.newrepublic.com/3e105d11127d1a51080ff7949fba987a9ab7991c.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2026-01-02 16:57:31.067912

Why it matters: Throughout 2025, the administration downplayed the potential for broad worksite raids and labor enforcement. It received public pushback in instances when it did happen and the administration apologized after a major raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.

The Department of Homeland Security's social media campaign hasn't typically highlighted the worksite enforcement arm of ICE's operations.

But in a post sharing video of a business site visit in Minnesota, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote, ""More coming.""

Driving the news: The most recent wave of enforcement comes after a popular video from YouTuber Nick Shirley claimed that there was fraud at multiple day care centers in the area. Both Noem and FBI director Kash Patel responded to the allegations.

Earlier in December, the local U.S. Attorney's Office charged six people and secured a guilty plea from one woman in ongoing fraud schemes.

""We've already heard many businesses who have received some subpoenas for documents,"" said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of Minnesota's chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, commonly known as CAIR.

Zoom in: In one DHS video, officers can be heard asking an employee at a convenience store about E-Verify, a federal program that helps business owners check employees' work authorization status.

The HSI officers also say that a few days prior to the visit that a ""notice of inspection"" was delivered, which starts the I-9 audit process to verify the legal status of a business's workforce force.

Zoom out: The attention on fraud in Minnesota has been a months-long project for DHS with Operation Twin Shield, starting in September, and President Trump calling attention to the issue at a Cabinet meeting in early December.

According to an online database last week, Oneida-Stantec JV LLC was awarded a $3.9 million contract to work with the federal government on construction of ICE detention facilities. Native Americans across the country have voiced backlash to these types of deals, pointing out their ancestors were once the subject of government-forced removals.

During a news conference Friday, Jeff House, CEO of the Oneida ESC Group, apologized for greenlighting the contract and said ""it was a huge mistake.""

You may not agree or appreciate the decision, but I do want you to know that when I made the decision, the scope of work was really about inspecting facilities, making sure they’re up to code, making sure that they meet humane standards, making sure it’s properly engineered, and while I don’t approve and am appalled by ICE activities, these people are being detained and put in a facility somewhere, and what had gone through my mind was, 'Who is taking care of them? Who is looking out for their best interest?'

Oneida Nation Chairman Tehassi Hill says the Oneida Business Committee was not aware of the contracts and the Nation does not oversee the day-to-day decisions of its corporations.

In response, the Oneida Business Committee adopted a resolution indicating the Nation now requires its divisions, entities and tribal corporations to disengage from grants, agreements or contracts that involve Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""Passing this resolution is an initial step to implementing clarity about the Nation’s expectations that our employees, representatives, businesses and tribal corporations align with our core values. The Oneida Business Committee will consider other appropriate steps needed to prevent future misalignment with balanced measure using our Good Mind Principles,"" Hill wrote Wednesday.

House agreed he will meet with the tribe quarterly on projects to ensure they align with the Nation's values.

Additionally, late Friday afternoon, the Oneida Nation announced its Business Committee has replaced the board of managers for the Oneida Engineering Science and Construction Group with an interim board manager -- Debra Powless, the Nation's director of commerce development.

The now-former board managers are Chairman John Breuninger, Jacquelyn Zalim and Leslie Wheelock.

Tribal leaders said two more resolutions have been passed by the Oneida Business Committee to ""provide further policy guidance to the OESC Group"" and require all of the Nation’s corporations to adopt a corporate social responsibility policy.

""Taking this action is a step to ensuring that the future OESC Group Board of Managers and other Nation owned corporate boards practice due diligence in their roles, and active communication with their Nation assigned liaisons,” said Hill.

Online documents show Oneida-Stantec is based in Milwaukee and was formed in 2024 to receive government contracts in the environmental market. Stantec has six Wisconsin offices, including in De Pere and Sturgeon Bay.

The same online database says the business was awarded a $2.6 million contract on Sept. 19. House says he thinks that contract came out of the Biden Administration, but it didn’t get signed until Sept. 22. Work has already begun on that project.

“I have to get more information on that particular contract. I’m just focused on this one that was awarded on the [December] 26th,"" House said.

The $3.9 million contract was to perform construction and design quality assurance services through Aug. 28, 2026, to support ICE's office of asset and facility management on a project in El Paso, Texas, according to the online database. The $2.6 million contract is to provide facility condition assessments and property inventory information for ICE over a three-year period ending in September 2028.

In addition to the two recent ICE contracts, Oneida-Stantec has received six other contracts from the U.S. Department of Defense since September 2024, totaling more than $27.6 million.",https://fox11online.com/resources/media2/16x9/1299/1320/54x0/90/c4aaaefd-25a0-4436-83f5-11b45ff712b9-Screenshot20251231151655.png,N,,2026-01-02 17:57:00.152728

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, in a memo released Thursday, said it would pause the review of all pending applications for visas, green cards, citizenship or asylum from immigrants from the additional countries. The memo also outlines plans to re-review applications of immigrants from these countries as far back as 2021.

The list, which is composed mostly of countries in Africa, includes Angola, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

Last month, the Trump administration expanded the list of countries with travel restrictions to the U.S. from 19 to 39, plus the Palestinian Authority. The move comes as the administration is bringing sharper scrutiny of those who have followed legal steps to seek permanent status in the U.S.

""USCIS remains dedicated to ensuring aliens from high-risk countries of concern who have entered the United States do not pose risks to national security or public safety,"" the memo states as rational for the pause and reviews. ""To faithfully uphold United States immigration law, the flow of aliens from countries with high overstay rates, significant fraud, or both must stop.""

There are some exceptions outlined in the memo, including athletes and members of their teams competing in the World Cup and 2026 Olympics, both hosted by the U.S. this year.

The administration first suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.

Towards the end of 2025, DHS began taking steps to further pause and review these legal avenues of migration. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees processing of applications including for visas, naturalizations and asylum, announced it would re-review the status of everyone who had been admitted into the U.S. as a refugee under the Biden administration, essentially reopening those cases.

The agency also previously announced an indefinite pause in all processing of asylum applications while it works through its backlog.

“The Oneida Business Committee will consider other appropriate steps needs to prevent future misalignment with balanced measure using our ‘Good Mind Principles’.”","Oneida Nation officials apologized for contracts between a tribal subsidiary and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Tribal leaders stated they were unaware of the contracts, which total over $6 million, until after they were signed.

The CEO of the subsidiary, Oneida ESC Group, called the decision a ""huge mistake"" and is working to cancel the agreements.

The business deals sparked backlash from tribal members who said the contracts do not align with the nation's values.

Oneida Nation officials apologized for entering into contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency after facing backlash from tribal members for the business ventures.

In a Jan. 2 video broadcast on social media, Oneida Chairman Tehassi Hill said he and the rest of the tribal council weren’t aware until Dec. 29 of the contracts between ICE and the tribe’s subsidiary Oneida Engineering, Science and Construction Group (ESC).

“I was very upset when I learned about this,” Hill said in the video broadcast.

Hill said the business venture with ICE does not align with the tribe’s values and the Oneida Nation Business Committee would have never entertained the idea. He added that the tribe's business committee does not engage in the day-to-day decisions of its corporations, but only provides high-level oversight. The Oneida ESC and some of the tribe’s other business entities are kept separate from tribal government to help insulate the tribe from any potential litigation.

Jeff House, CEO of Oneida ESC, also apologized for approving the contracts with ICE, saying it was a mistake.

House said the Dec. 26 contract with ICE was for inspecting facilities and ensuring they are up to code and provide humane standards.

He said he doesn’t approve of what ICE is doing, but he thought the contract would ensure immigrants were being treated properly.

The Federal Procurement Data System, an online database of federal contracts, shows Oneida-Stantec JV LLC (OESC Group) was awarded a $2.6 million contract by ICE on Sept. 19 and a $3.7 million contract by ICE on Dec. 26. The information was first reported by Fox 11 News in Green Bay.

House said he is focused on canceling the Dec. 26 contract as well as gathering more information on the September contract. The contracts are engineering and technical services and for maintenance of government facilities.

A similar situation of a tribal nation facing the ire of Indian Country after it entered into a contract with ICE occurred earlier this month with the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation of Kansas.

Dallas Goldtooth, a popular Indian Country actor, comedian and activist spoke out against the nearly $30 million contract.

“This is a clear example of where economic development without any base values grounded in Indigenous philosophy and human dignity leads you into some dark places,” he wrote on social media about the issue.

In response, Prairie Band officials fired the senior members of the tribe’s LLC, which made the contract with ICE. Potawatomi tribal officials later announced they were able to cancel the contract with ICE.

House said he was aware of the Prairie Band situation, but he believes that tribe’s contract was for building a detention facility on or near the reservation whereas the Oneida contracts were only for inspections.

Oneida officials have faced vocal opposition from hundreds of tribal members after news of the contracts broke.

“This reflects a clear misalignment with the values I expect our elected officials to uphold,” posted tribal member and former Oneida Nation attorney Rebecca Webster on social media. “This is mind boggling that anyone thought this was a good idea.”

Others posted in reply that ICE is targeting mostly Indigenous people from Turtle Island (North America) who happen to be from Mexico or Central America.

There have been incidents in which ICE briefly detained tribal members of reservations in the U.S. in apparent cases of racial profiling. These incidents have drawn a lot of ire from Indian Country because the ones being arrested have ancestors who were among the first people in what is now the U.S., going back at least 10,000 years. ICE agents, on the other hand, typically have ancestors who have been here only a few generations.

Hill said the Oneida Business Committee also passed a resolution in response to the situation to clarify on the tribe’s position.

“Passing this resolution is an initial step to implementing clarity about the Nation’s expectations that our employees, representatives, businesses and tribal corporations align with our core values,” Hill said in a statement.

“The Oneida Business Committee will consider other appropriate steps needs to prevent future misalignment with balanced measure using our ‘Good Mind Principles’.”","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/presto/2020/03/17/PGRB/31dd4a66-a373-48ec-ad0d-9fb01b269842-GPGCasino02377.JPG?crop=3044,1713,x0,y154&width=3044&height=1713&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-02 16:57:24.870762

Tuccille, Billy Binion",,,,,https://reason.com/volokh/2026/01/02/presence-of-probable-clause-precludes-claim-that-immigration-arrest-was-retaliation-for-first-amendment-protected-speech/,"Under Nieves, plaintiffs must also show the defendant had no probable cause to arrest the plaintiff.
And even the Bello-Reyes court noted that § 1357 has a probable cause requirement.
Thus, the two factors considered by the Bello-Reyes court are unsound or inapplicable.
[T]he Court's focuses on whether Respondents had probable cause and whether Petitioner's advocacy was the but-for cause of his arrest.
Rather, as stated earlier, Petitioner only argues that Nieves probable cause requirement should not be required.","The First Amendment ""prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions for engaging in protected speech. If an official takes adverse action against someone based on that forbidden motive, and non-retaliatory grounds are in fact insufficient to provoke the adverse consequences, the injured person may generally seek relief by bringing a First Amendment claim."" Nieves v. Bartlett (2019) (citation modified).

To prove First Amendment retaliation, Petitioner must show: (1) he engaged in constitutionally protected activity, (2) Respondents actions injured him such that a person of ordinary firmness would be chilled from engaging in that activity, and (3) Petitioner engaging in his constitutionally protected activity substantially motivated Respondents' retaliatory actions. Under Nieves, plaintiffs must also show the defendant had no probable cause to arrest the plaintiff. Only then may courts analyze the substantial motivation prong. But Nieves exempts the ""no-probable cause"" requirement when ""officers have probable cause to make arrests but typically exercise their discretion not to do so."" A plaintiff must present ""objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.""

Petitioner argues—for the first time in his reply—that the Court should not require him to show Respondents had no probable cause to arrest him, following the Ninth Circuit's approach in Bello-Reyes v. Gaynor (9th Cir. 2021). In Bello-Reyes, the Ninth Circuit ruled the plaintiff did not need to show the defendants had no probable cause for his immigration bond revocation. The Ninth Circuit so ruled for two reasons. First, the Ninth Circuit noted that unlike Nieves, which arose from a § 1983 claim, Bello-Reyes involved a habeas petition. And while it is necessary, in § 1983 suits, ""to identify the particular state official or officials who violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights,"" not so in habeas. Since a habeas petitioner ""need not identify a particular violator, only that his confinement is unconstitutional,"" the Ninth Circuit deemed the ""problems of causation that may counsel for a no-probable cause standard are less acute in the habeas context.""

Second, the Ninth Circuit noted that while ""a probable cause requirement exists for initial immigration arrests,"" there is ""no equivalent benchmark"" when ""ICE is revoking bond rather than arresting in the first instance."" Since there was no objective benchmark for bond revocations, which are fully discretionary, the Ninth Circuit concluded that those whose immigration bond was revoked could never be released on habeas if they were required to show no-probable cause. The Court finds Bello-Reyes unconvincing.

First, while Petitioner need not identify a particular official (who violated Petitioner's rights) in the habeas context, he must still show that engaging in constitutionally protected activity was the but-for cause for the Respondents to arrest him. Thus, the same ""problems of causation"" that exists in § 1983 contexts also appear in the habeas context.

Second, unlike Bello-Reyes, involving a petitioner subject to bond revocation, this case involves Petitioner's arrest, which involves 8 U.S.C. § 1357. And even the Bello-Reyes court noted that § 1357 has a probable cause requirement. Thus, the two factors considered by the Bello-Reyes court are unsound or inapplicable.

Third—and most importantly—Bello-Reyes is on a collision course with Nieves. Nieves lays the general framework to establish First Amendment retaliatory arrest claims. And while that suit was brought using § 1983, this Court does not see why the same claim would have a different framework solely due to a different cause of action. Nieves—and Gonzalez v. Trevino (2024)—suggest the same. In Gonzalez, the Court reiterated that Nieves ""recognized a narrow exception to [the no-probable cause] rule. The existence of probable cause does not defeat a plaintiff's claim if he produces 'objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.'"" This language does not suggest First Amendment retaliatory arrest elements differ based on the cause of action. And ""when the highest court in the country has spoken clearly on a matter of federal constitutional law,"" this Court ""is not at liberty to disregard or parse that decision"" in an inconsistent way….

To reiterate, Petitioner must show, to prevail on his retaliatory arrest claim: (1) he was engaged in constitutionally protected activity, (2) Respondents arrested him, (3) Respondents had no probable cause to arrest Petitioner or would not have arrested other similarly situated individuals who did not engage in such constitutionally protected activity, and (4) Petitioner engaging in his constitutionally protected activity was the but-for cause of his arrest….

[T]he Court's focuses on whether Respondents had probable cause and whether Petitioner's advocacy was the but-for cause of his arrest.

Respondents produced an immigration warrant signed a day before Petitioner's arrest, showing DHS had ""probable cause to believe that [Petitioner] is removable from the United States."" Furthermore, Respondents aver that Petitioner was arrested to place him in removal proceedings.

Petitioner provides no evidence showing Respondents had no probable cause to arrest him. Rather, as stated earlier, Petitioner only argues that Nieves probable cause requirement should not be required. Nevertheless, Petitioner could overcome Nieves general rule ""if he produces 'objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.'"" But Petitioner has not done so. Even if he does, the existence of probable cause that Petitioner was unlawfully present in the United States means that Petitioner's advocacy could not be the but-for cause of his arrest. As such, Petitioner's retaliatory arrest claim is not likely to succeed on the merits….",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/reason-logo-featured-placeholder.jpg.webp,N,,2026-01-02 13:57:16.927132

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) is leaving her coastal 1st District seat to run for governor, opening a Republican-leaning district seat.
Reps.

Members from both parties are announcing retirements, resignations, and bids for higher office — developments that could play a pivotal role in determining which party controls the U.S. House next year.

Republicans are defending a razor-thin majority, and several of the lawmakers heading for the exits have been among President Donald Trump’s most outspoken allies. For Democrats, every retirement represents a potential opening as they work to retake the majority.

Retirements are often viewed as an early barometer of political headwinds, signaling churn, internal frustration, or a strategic calculation about the road ahead. And so far, the list is long — stretching across senior committee chairs, high-profile party figures, and members from battleground districts.

Among the most notable departures:

Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) said he will retire after more than three decades, citing redistricting changes upheld by the Supreme Court.

Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) will step down after three terms and is backing his twin brother to succeed him.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) stunned colleagues with a resignation announcement amid a public break with Trump.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) joined a crowded field for governor, leaving his Bay Area seat open.

Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.), a pioneering figure and longtime mentor to progressives, emphasized the need for generational change.

Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) will retire despite Trump’s endorsement, stepping away after helping push through major tax legislation.

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) will end her historic tenure as the first Black woman to represent her state in the House.

Rep. Chuy García (D-Ill.) will leave Congress to focus on family health concerns and a gubernatorial bid.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) is leaving her coastal 1st District seat to run for governor, opening a Republican-leaning district seat.

Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will retire after nearly 40 years, closing a chapter on one of the most influential careers in modern congressional history.

Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), one of the most moderate Democrats in the House, is stepping aside amid rising incivility and threats.

Dozens more are departing to run for Senate or gubernatorial seats — including Iowa’s Ashley Hinson, Massachusetts’ Seth Moulton, Texas’ Wesley Hunt, Wisconsin’s Tom Tiffany, Arizona’s David Schweikert, Texas' Jasmic Crockett and New Hampshire’s Chris Pappas.

Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) stunned the political world by announcing she would not seek reelection in 2026 — a move that quickly scrambled Iowa’s political map, leading Hinson to vacate her competitive northeastern House seat to run for Ernst’s Senate seat, billing herself as “President Trump’s top ally in the United States Senate.”

In northwest Iowa, Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, jumped into the race for governor after both Ernst and Gov. Kim Reynolds signaled they wouldn’t seek new terms.

Crockett’s entry to run for Senate, leaving behind a safely Democratic House seat, highlights a broader national trend: a wave of House members pursuing higher office as both parties brace for a major midterm election year.

Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), former chair of the House Freedom Caucus and one of Trump’s staunchest defenders, is running for governor with Trump’s blessing.

Reps. Byron Donalds (Fla.), Chip Roy (Texas), Barry Moore (Ala.), Buddy Carter (Ga.), and others are trading House seats for high-stakes Senate, governor, or statewide races.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) was in the race for New York governor after her withdrawn U.N. ambassadorship and public rift with GOP leadership, but announced in December that she would be suspending her campaign for governor.

Ambitious climbs on both sides of the aisle

Running for governor:

David Schweikert (R-Ariz.)

Tom Tiffany (R-Wis.)

Ralph Norman (R-S.C.)

Byron Donalds (R-Fla.)

Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.)

Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.)

John James (R-Mich.)

Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) already successfully made the jump after announcing her 2024 gubernatorial run and winning the election.

Running for Senate:

Angie Craig D-(Minn.)

Haley Stevens (D-Mich.)

Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.)

Robin Kelly (D-Ill.)

Chris Pappas (D-N.H.)

Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas)

Wesley Hunt (R-Texas)

Andrew Barr (R-Ky.)

Buddy Carter (R-Ga.)

Barry Moore (R-Ala.)

Other statewide races

In Texas, Rep. Chip Roy is seeking to succeed Attorney General Ken Paxton, while Paxton himself runs for Senate — another example of how Trump-era figures are reshuffling the GOP bench.

Others are leaving politics altogether, like Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), a longtime foreign policy hawk warning of rising global threats, and Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who has struggled to balance a bipartisan brand with a changing district.

With familiar names like Mace, Ernst, Nadler, Pelosi, Velázquez, Doggett, and McCaul either moving on or setting off statewide domino effects, the 2026 midterms are shaping up as a test not just of Trump’s influence, but of how both parties manage generational turnover on Capitol Hill.

However, attorney David Schoen, who formerly represented President Donald Trump, shared that it would require an ""extraordinary circumstance” for a person to become denaturalized, which is a rare occurrence.
“The rules are clear, both the rules for entry and the rules for dismissing those people from the country.” The denaturalization process can only occur through a judicial order either through civil proceedings or a criminal conviction for naturalization fraud.

Just days ago, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that it would be conducting an audit of the immigration and citizenship cases of individuals from 19 countries, including Somalia. The audit comes in response to concerns raised that the 98 people charged with defrauding Minnesota’s social welfare programs may have also lied and presented fraudulent documentation during the naturalization process. At least 85 of those charged are of Somali descent; however a vast majority of them are United States citizens. Although it is uncertain how many of them were born in the United States.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared on Fox & Friends that the Trump administration is “""not afraid to use denaturalization.” She also shared that a joint effort is underway between the State Department and DHS to determine steps necessary to revoke citizenship status of Somali immigrants charged or convicted in the Minnesota fraud scandal.

""Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

However, attorney David Schoen, who formerly represented President Donald Trump, shared that it would require an ""extraordinary circumstance” for a person to become denaturalized, which is a rare occurrence.

There's a mechanism in place for people who are still green card holders, who are fomenting violence on campus and all of that, to be deported,” Schoen told Fox News Digital.

Judge Jackson also concluded that the preliminary injunction provision precluding the CFPB from instituting an agency-wide mass reduction-in-force (“RIF”) remains in full force and effect.
We have previously argued that “combined earnings” means combined profits and won’t belabor our argument in this blog.
Judge Jackson’s opinion may also affect the CFPB’s Regulatory Agenda, which the industry largely supports.
In light of Judge Jackson’s opinion, perhaps it will be unnecessary to use interim final rules as its path for accomplishing the bureau’s Regulatory Agenda.","In a case of first impression, in clarifying her injunction issued in the lawsuit brought by the National Treasury Employees Union and others challenging the planned reductions in force and other efforts to reduce functions at the CFPB, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the DC Federal District Court vigorously rejected the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice (“OLC”) that the CFPB may not be funded by the Fed because (1) the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the CFPB may only be funded by the Fed out of “combined earnings of the Federal Reserve System”, (2) the term “combined earnings” means combined profits and not combined revenues and (3) the Federal Reserve System has incurred losses since September 2022. Instead, Judge Jackson held that “combined earnings” means simply combined revenues.

As a result of reaching this opinion, Judge Jackson concluded that the preliminary injunction issued by her earlier this year, as slightly modified by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, remains in full force and effect and that the CFPB may not refuse to request additional funds from the Fed in order to perform statutorily required functions. Judge Jackson also concluded that the preliminary injunction provision precluding the CFPB from instituting an agency-wide mass reduction-in-force (“RIF”) remains in full force and effect.

In reaching her opinion about the funding issue, it is noteworthy that Judge Jackson based her opinion on the assumption that the Federal Reserve Banks are still losing money even though the plaintiffs argued that they are now turning a profit on a combined basis and that, even if OLC’s interpretation of “combined earnings” is correct, that argument would be moot under existing circumstances. As a result, the Court avoided having to conduct a hearing to determine whether the Federal Reserve Banks now are profitable on a combined basis and, if so, whether the Fed would be required to honor certain funding requests from the CFPB.

Judge Jackson addresses in her opinion among other things, prior CFPB and Fed statements regarding interpretations of the funding language in Dodd Frank.

As recently as 2024, the CFPB took the position in CFPB enforcement litigation that the “plain meaning” of “combined earnings.”

refers to the System’s income.” Chair Jerome Powell reiterated this position interpretation in testimony before Congress; he explained that the Fed “looked at th[is] question very carefully” and determined that “it’s very clear on the law and legislative history” that the Fed is “required to make those payments” even when the Fed is operating at a loss.

Judge Jackson further relied on dictionary definitions of “earnings” which defined the word as revenues. Judge Jackson noted that the Federal Reserve Act used the term “net earnings” and (and not “earnings) to mean profits. Finally, Judge Jackson argued that Congress could not have intended to subject the CFPB’s survival to the vagaries of the Fed’s financial situation from time to time.

We have previously argued that “combined earnings” means combined profits and won’t belabor our argument in this blog. Suffice it to say, we would expect the CFPB to take an immediate appeal of Judge Jackson’s opinion to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. There is already pending before the that Court en banc an appeal from Judge Jackson’s issuance of the preliminary injunction (A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court had reversed Judge Jackson’s earlier decision, but that decision was vacated when the Circuit Court granted a petition for rehearing en banc.) In order to shorten the review time for any appeal of Judge Jackson’s new opinion dealing with the funding issue, it would make sense for that appeal to be combined by the en banc Circuit Court with the already pending appeal without the new appeal first being heard by a three-judge panel. It seems likely that the funding issue is headed to the Supreme Court. `

Things are further complicated by two other recently filed lawsuits filed by Public Citizen in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California (see here) and another by 21 state attorneys general in the Federal District Court for the District of Oregon, which raise the same funding questions (see here ).

In the meantime, unless the CFPB is able to obtain a stay of Judge Jackson’s clarification, Acting Director Vought may need to request funds from the Fed since, according to the Acting Director, the CFPB is on the verge of running out of money and would be in violation of the preliminary injunction if he still refuses to request funds from the Fed. Judge Jackson’s opinion may also affect the CFPB’s Regulatory Agenda, which the industry largely supports. That agenda includes, among other things, proposed rules regarding the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Section 1033 of Dodd Frank (open banking), and Section 1071(small business loans data collection). Since Vought announced that the CFPB would soon be running out of funds and that he felt legally unable to request funds from the Fed, the industry has been deeply concerned about how the CFPB would be able to accomplish its ambitious regulatory agenda.

There had been rumors, and in some court cases’ status reports filed by the CFPB, indicating that the bureau would issue one or more Interim Final Rules before it ran out of funds.

In light of Judge Jackson’s opinion, perhaps it will be unnecessary to use interim final rules as its path for accomplishing the bureau’s Regulatory Agenda. Using interim final rules would have significantly increased the risk those rules would not survive a legal challenge.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.13365_00.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 12:56:53.948720

Even if the money is not withheld, the predicament foreshadows other changes in SNAP funding the state will have to confront later this year.
Twenty eight states have shared their SNAP recipient data with the USDA, Rollins said.
The demand for SNAP data echoes the administration’s efforts to obtain historically confidential personal information, such as taxpayer and Medicaid records.
Some estimates are that the changes could cause 13,000​​ Hawaiʻi residents to lose at least some SNAP benefits.","Hawaiʻi is one of 22 states that have called the USDA’s demand for food stamp recipients’ information unprecedented and unlawful.

After declining to turn over data on residents who use food stamps to the federal government, including their immigration status, Hawaiʻi faces the threat of losing tens of millions in funding to operate the food aid program.

Brooke Rollins, secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, vowed in December to withhold the federal funds used to administer the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from states that have not complied.

The state chose not to provide the data because it “is committed to protecting the personal information of individuals applying for and receiving SNAP,” said Scott Morishige, who heads the Department of Human Services division that manages the program.

For Hawaiʻi, that could mean a loss of up to $33 million in federal funding in 2026.

“DHS is currently reviewing potential options if federal funds are withheld,” Morishige said.

Such an event would force the state to make tough decisions about hiring freezes, delays in technology upgrades and perhaps layoffs of administrative staff and eligibility workers, said Colin Moore, a political scientist at University of Hawaiʻi Mānoa.

Even if the money is not withheld, the predicament foreshadows other changes in SNAP funding the state will have to confront later this year.

“I don’t think you would see the effect necessarily on SNAP recipients immediately,” Moore said. “It’s about slow erosion of the infrastructure that supports the program.”

‘Strategic Pressure On States’

The USDA in February first demanded that states share five years of details including names, addresses and immigration status about SNAP recipients. Rollins said it was necessary to root out fraud.

She leveled her latest threat in early December at Hawaiʻi and 21 other states that sued the department in July over what they called an unprecedented and unlawful request. The states said they already verify beneficiaries’ eligibility and never share such “large swaths” of personal data with the federal government. Those states, and the District of Columbia — which also joined the legal challenge — all are led by Democrats.

Rollins targeted administrative funding, not funding that goes directly to recipients, which Moore called “a very strategic way for the federal government to put pressure on states; it’s both evil and clever.”

“It avoids the political backlash of cutting benefits that would probably be unacceptable to the vast majority of voters,” he said. “It targets the state level bureaucracies, and that means it really puts pressure on the governors of these blue states and their bureaucratic leaders, which is a far less sympathetic constituency than families who need food.”

The legal challenge to the USDA request is ongoing. In October, a federal judge in San Francisco temporarily barred the USDA from collecting the data from states that had not yet turned it over; Rollins did not address that order when she made her December statements at a Trump administration cabinet meeting. Twenty eight states have shared their SNAP recipient data with the USDA, Rollins said.

The demand for SNAP data echoes the administration’s efforts to obtain historically confidential personal information, such as taxpayer and Medicaid records. Those moves have been explicitly framed as ways to bolster Trump’s anti-immigrant campaign as well as to cut waste and fraud.

And the push has been in the works starting soon after inauguration day, if not before. The conservative Project 2025 blueprint that Trump disclaimed knowledge of during the election but has taken full pages from — co-author Russell Vought is a top administration official — outlined information sharing between federal and state agencies as a way to enhance immigration enforcement.

“It is essential to use all available legal authority to end any incentives in (USDA) benefit programs that encourage illegal immigration,” Rollins wrote in a February letter to state and local governments.

Changes On The Way

Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for SNAP, but their children are if born in the U.S. COFA citizens — those from the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau who are in the U.S. under the Compacts of Free Association agreements — Cuban and Haitian immigrants and certain lawful permanent residents also can qualify for benefits. In Hawaiʻi, at last count, there were 13,190 people with unspecific citizenship or identified as non-citizens receiving SNAP, Morishige said.

Yet a 2025 Congressional Research Service report found fraud in the $100 billion program rare. For example, in 2021, it said, states tried to recover $54 million in benefits that were “trafficked” — sold for cash — or where fraud was committed during the application process. Errors made by state agencies, in the form of SNAP benefit payments that were too large or too small, were a greater source of financial loss – some $10.5 billion in 2023.

Hawaiʻi had an error rate of 8% in fiscal year 2024, down from about 21% the previous two years. That’s compared to a nationwide error rate of 11.7% in 2023.

Rollins said that based on information from states that have submitted the requested data, 186,000 dead people are receiving SNAP benefits nationally and 500,000 people are getting double benefits. That reflects .4% and 1.2% respectively of the 42 million people receiving the benefits monthly.

About 162,000 Hawaiʻi residents rely on SNAP and, in September, received an average of $343 each.

Even if the USDA does not follow through on Rollins’ promise to withhold funding, Hawaiʻi will face a somewhat similar scenario in late 2026. At that point, changes to SNAP outlined in the domestic budget bill Trump signed in July will take effect and states will be forced to pick up a larger share of the program’s administrative costs.

Now, the federal government pays 50% of the state’s administrative costs. Under the changes that are to take place in October, that share drops to 25%.

Other changes the bill contained included stricter eligibility requirements and work requirements that kicked in in November.

While in Texas, Tavi said, J.A.L.L.
Tavi said the need is dire for her office and other legal service organizations to help children like J.A.L.L.","A 17-year-old Massachusetts teen was recently released from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in Connecticut and returned home to his family for the holidays after he was detained by agents in New York in August.

The teenager, identified by his initials, J.A.L.L., was detained on Aug. 3 while in Buffalo, with his 18-year-old brother and a friend, according to attorney Chris Mattei, a member of his legal team from Bridgeport-based Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, PC.

According to Mattei, the three were stopped while leaving a CVS in Buffalo, New York. Local police officers approached them asking for identification. All three reportedly showed identification and were told they were free to go. Before traveling too far, the vehicle was pulled over.

“They were held for a period of time until the Department of Homeland Security arrived,” Mattei said. For reasons that are not clear and certainly not lawful they then came and scooped all three of these guys, including an American citizen.”

“They detained all three of them and quickly processed our client and his brother to Texas,” Mattei said. “You can imagine the unexpected nightmare of one second being in the car with your brother and your friend just living out your normal high school life and then the next thing you’re on a plane to Texas facing deportation.”

According to Mattei, the friend, an American citizen, was released and J.A.L.L.’s brother was ordered deported to Ecuador because he was 18. J.A.L.L, a minor, was put in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Massachusetts teen remained in an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in Texas until Oct. 9, according to Mattei. After that he was transferred to a shelter in Groton, Noank Community Support Services, where he was held until Dec. 23 when he was released after his lawyers filed a successful habeas petition on Dec. 19.

“Once he was arrested, and when he informed the Department of Homeland Security officials that he had status in the United States and was living with his father, they apparently coerced him into signing papers consenting to be deported to Ecuador until it was put on hold,” Mattei alleged.

According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, its mission “is to promote the health, well-being, and stability of refugees, unaccompanied alien children, and other eligible individuals and families, through culturally responsive, trauma-informed, and strengths-based services.” The shelter in Groton reportedly runs a federal program shelter separate from ICE’s detention or enforcement roles

Mattei said he was contacted by the Center for Children’s Advocacy in early December.

“They started to become quite concerned with this particular child’s situation because he had been separated from his father for about four months … two of those months were spent in Texas,” Mattei said.

“He was then brought back to the Northeast and, despite his father having already been approved as a ‘sponsor,’ that is somebody for him to live with in this country, and despite the fact that he had lived with his father in the United States for five years, there was just this bureaucratic nightmare that seemed intentional preventing him from being reunited with his father,” according to Mattei.

“With the situation becoming increasingly dire, the Center for the Children’s Advocacy and my law firm decided to get involved to see if we could raise the issue of his detention with a federal judge to see if we could get him out,” Mattei said.

‘A Christmas miracle.’ CT honor high school graduate welcomed home after six months in ICE detention

Sabrina Tavi, director of the Immigrant Children’s Justice Project for the Center for Children’s Advocacy, said she and Mattei went to work on the case about three weeks ago. Mattei works for the same law firm that helped free Kevin, a Meriden teenager who was also released from ICE custody right before Christmas.

Mattei said he had no idea detained children were being housed in Connecticut. According to Mattei, the Noank Community Support Services is contracted by the Department of Health and Human Services. The facility is to provide shelter and to meet the daily needs of children who are in the Department of Health and Human Services custody.

“We were convinced that there was really nothing about his either initial arrest in August or his four-month detention that was lawful,” Mattei said. “Once we were retained and we familiarized ourselves with the facts we filed a habeas petition and a motion for a preliminary injunction quickly as we could.

“We were so disgusted by the fact that this child had been forcibly separated from his father. He lived with him for five years uninterrupted with no issues. He was a full-time high school student and for reasons that are not clear, and the government did not defend, he was arrested in August and separated from father,” Mattei added. “He was not one of these children who had nowhere to go and nobody to take care of him. To the contrary, his father had been approved by the government to be his sponsor in the United States, so he should have never been there.”

Mattei said J.A.L.L. and his father are not U.S. citizens but aren’t here unlawfully and are seeking permanent status.

“It’s just like a family that comes to the United States under different circumstances that are going through the lawful channels of trying to establish residency here,” Mattei said.

J.A.L.L. was released to his father on Dec. 23 after driving through a snowstorm.

“We spoke to him soon after and they were both in tears and I think in some ways, it was bittersweet because they were thrilled to be together and they’re going to be going back to Massachusetts to celebrate Christmas with family,” Mattei said. “But his brother was not going to be there. I think it was obviously a great relief to be reunited and also both felt pain for going through something like that.”

Tavi said she learned about J.A.L.L.’s case in early December. She said the high school junior’s father was previously approved for him to live with during the time when he was granted Special Immigrant Juvenile status and deferred action, which is reportedly the government’s agreement that, while he awaits the availability of a visa, they won’t take any action to deport him in recognition of the fact that he has approved SIJ.

According to Tavi, J.A.L.L. had employment authorization, a Social Security number and has been an excellent high school student taking advanced classes in preparation for college. While in Texas, Tavi said, J.A.L.L. was teaching other students how to speak English.

“He’s lost a half of a year of his education and the harm and drama he experienced can’t be overstated,” Tavi said. “He’s been home about a week and hasn’t been to school yet because of the holidays. He had a joyful reunion with his father and family but is readjusting and ready to start the new year.”

Connecticut does not have any detention centers for adults detained by ICE, but there are several contracted facilities for detained children.

“There are other children being detained and we have heard anecdotally that under this administration there’s been an increase in interior enforcement actions against children who are already residing in the U.S. like J.A.L.L,” Tavi said.

Tavi said the need is dire for her office and other legal service organizations to help children like J.A.L.L.

“We are so relieved to have him reunited with his family. That is the goal,” Tavi said. “What we did was put a stop to the harm that the government was inflicting on him. But there is nothing there that makes this child whole again. There’s nothing there that heals him and his family from the harm and trauma that was inflicted on this child. It is still there, and it still exists.”",https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thc-l-IMMIGRATION-AGENT.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-02 15:56:37.791995

In 2025, California became the frontline of a federal playbook for more militarized immigration enforcement.

Raids on California streets and lawsuits that followed helped rewrite the ground rules for how agents can operate. What began as before-dawn operations in Golden State farm towns quickly expanded into a broader nationwide strategy: surprise workplace and neighborhood sweeps and roving patrols miles from the border.

CalMatters reporters across California documented how tactics first seen in Kern County, such as warrantless traffic stops and a heavy reliance on appearance-based profiling, spread statewide and then across the country. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld these methods.

Early in the second Trump administration, the federal government sent Marines to the border, citing a crisis. Those troops have since quietly gone home.

Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles following civil unrest about immigration arrests. President Donald Trump threatened to send forces to the Bay Area, then backed off. State officials objected, while federal leaders characterized the moves as necessary. The standoff deepened long-running tensions between California and the White House over the state’s sanctuary policy and federal authority.

All this fell most heavily on families with deep roots in California. CalMatters found deportations increasingly reached people who have decades-long residence, U.S.-citizen children, stable employment, and even those following legal pathways. ICE detained people at green-card interviews and routine check-ins. The changes destabilized school systems, the agricultural economy, and health care.

A federal lawsuit over a deaf asylum seeker’s prolonged detention exposed gaps in medical care and disability accommodations in immigration facilities. Under Trump, asylum seekers with pending claims lost protection from arrest. A new system is emerging where people trying to follow the rules are easier targets than those evading them. Detention centers drew scrutiny as local authorities shied away from conducting health and safety inspections, while advocates reported worsening conditions inside.

A quieter but equally consequential trend has emerged: The immigrant population shrank. Love them or hate them, Trump’s immigration policies were achieving the administration’s goals. Pew Research found the national immigration population shrank by about 1.4 million people in the first half of 2025, the first decline in half a century. Economists warned about slower growth. State leaders weighed long-term impacts on the workforce, schools, and social service systems.

Enforcement grew more data-driven. Drone surveillance expanded in urban areas, and advocates warned about new uses of artificial intelligence to identify deportation targets and analyze asylum and visa applicants’ digital histories.

2026 outlook: California expects further interior enforcement, additional legal battles over sanctuary laws, funding, and renewed attempts to expand detention capacity. School districts and employers are preparing for more mass removals, while lawmakers are considering new privacy protections.",https://www.edhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/071025-Camarillo-Raid-LV-CM-19-e1767032968290.webp,N,,2026-01-02 15:56:41.886947
