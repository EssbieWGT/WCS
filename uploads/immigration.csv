U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has seen some 3,000 heavily armed masked federal officers deployed to the city of Minneapolis, rounding up suspects they say are dangerous criminal immigration violators, while sometimes ensnaring law-abiding U.S. citizens and immigrants.

The city is on edge after an immigration officer shot and killed Renee Good, 37, a U.S. citizen and mother of three on January 7. Vice President JD Vance delivered a broad defense on Thursday, saying that ""far-left agitators"" and uncooperative local officials were to blame for chaos on the streets.

U.S. immigration enforcement operations have used what appears to be unnecessary or disproportionate force, Turk said. Such measures should only be used as a last resort if an individual posed an immediate threat to life, he added.

Turk said the U.S. must comply with international law and that migration enforcement must respect due process, voicing concern that, in some cases, people arrested or detained had not been granted timely access to legal advice.

He called for an independent investigation into the rising number of deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. He cited 30 deaths reported in 2025 and six recorded so far this year.

Turk condemned what he called the routine denigration of migrants and refugees in the United States that portrays them as criminals or a burden on society, saying it increased their ""exposure to xenophobic hostility and abuse"".

In more than a handful of recent encounters, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, has said its agents acted in self-defense during violent encounters, even as eyewitness testimony and video footage raised questions about whether those accounts fully matched what happened.

And in a ruling for a recent civil lawsuit, a U.S. district judge said federal immigration officials were not forthcoming about enforcement efforts, citing discrepancies between official DHS statements and video evidence.

“We’re now in a situation in which official sources in the Trump administration are really tying themselves quite strongly to a particular narrative, regardless of what the widely disseminated videos suggest,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University.

The cases come amid an aggressive expansion of federal immigration enforcement and increasing scenes of violent and intimidating arrest tactics. President Donald Trump’s administration has sharply increased the hiring of immigration agents, broadened enforcement operations and accelerated deportations, as protests have spread across major cities.

The use of force, paired with conflicting official statements and evidence, has raised questions about whether federal immigration officials can be held accountable and highlighted the steep hurdles victims of excessive force might face in seeking legal recourse.

States, cities are hard-pressed to fight violent ICE arrest tactics

The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to multiple requests from Stateline for comment on discrepancies between official accounts and publicly available evidence.

Since last July, there have been at least 17 open-fire incidents involving federal immigration agents — including fatal shootings, shootings with injuries and cases in which shots were fired — according to data compiled by The Trace, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news outlet investigating gun violence. A recent Wall Street Journal investigation also found 13 incidents since July in which immigration agents fired at or into civilian vehicles.

One of the most prominent examples unfolded in Minneapolis this month: Good’s fatal shooting by a masked ICE agent. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the agent, Jonathan Ross, fired in self-defense after Good, 37, allegedly tried to run over officers. Videos taken by bystanders show Good’s vehicle reversed, shifted and began to turn away from officers after one yelled and pulled on her car handle. Ross positioned himself near the hood of her car, and he began firing.

Minnesota officials later stated the footage did not support DHS’ description of an imminent threat, prompting renewed scrutiny of how the Trump administration is characterizing use-of-force encounters.

Similar discrepancies have surfaced in other cases. The Department of Homeland Security recently revised its account of a December shooting in Glen Burnie, Maryland, after local police contradicted its initial version. DHS first claimed both men injured in the incident were inside a van that ICE officers fired at in self-defense, but later said that one of the injured men had already been arrested and was in custody inside an ICE vehicle when he was hurt. The other man was shot twice and is facing two federal criminal charges.

In August, federal immigration agents fired at a family’s vehicle three times in San Bernardino, California. DHS maintained the shooting was justified after at least two agents were struck by the vehicle, but available footage shows an agent breaking the driver-side window moments before gunfire erupted. Surveillance footage from the street does not show agents being struck by the vehicle.

“I can’t think of another time in my lifetime — I’m 50 years old — where we’ve seen this sort of force in the streets in the United States,” said Mark Fleming, the associate director of federal litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center. Fleming has been an immigration and civil rights attorney for the past 20 years.

García Hernández, the law professor at Ohio State University, echoed Fleming’s point, saying that what also stands out is how often agents are deploying less‑lethal weapons in ways that would generally be prohibited — including firing rubber pellets and similar projectiles at people’s faces or heads.

In its use-of-force policy, DHS agents may use force only when no “reasonably effective, safe, and feasible” alternative exists and only at a level that is “objectively reasonable.” DHS policy emphasizes “respect for human life” and directs officers to be proficient in de-escalation tactics — using communication or other techniques to stabilize or reduce the intensity of a potentially violent situation without, or with reduced, physical force. The policy also states that deadly force should not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.

ICE, as an agency under DHS, is bound by this guidance, but the policy on shooting at moving vehicles differs from what many law enforcement agencies nationwide now consider best practices. While DHS prohibits officers from firing at the operator of a moving vehicle unless it is necessary to stop a serious threat, its rules do not explicitly instruct officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles when possible.

Use of force

A growing pattern of aggressive tactics and conflicting evidence has raised serious questions about how federal immigration agents use lethal and less-lethal force, and how DHS officials describe the incidents to the public.

In September, 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González was fatally shot during a traffic stop in Franklin Park, a suburb near Chicago. DHS claimed that one agent was “seriously injured” after being dragged by González’s car as he tried to flee. But body-camera footage shows the agent telling a Franklin Park police officer that his injury was “nothing major.”

In a statement, DHS said the agent responded with lethal force because he was “fearing for his own life” — a narrative very similar to the department’s description of the fatal shooting of Good in Minneapolis.

In recent months, DHS officials have claimed that immigration agents have been repeatedly attacked with vehicles.

“We’ve seen vehicles weaponized over 100 times in the last several months against our law enforcement officers,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during an interview with CNN this month.

In court filings related to a civil lawsuit about Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, the department provided body-camera footage and other internal records to bolster their claims of self-defense.

An ever-larger share of ICE’s arrested immigrants have no criminal record

But U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis found the evidence “difficult, if not impossible to believe.” In her lengthy opinion issued in late November, Ellis acknowledged that agents sometimes encountered aggressive drivers but also found that agents treated cars that were merely following them as potential threats.

In October, an ICE agent shot a community observer, Marimar Martinez, five times during a confrontation in Chicago. DHS claimed that she rammed the ICE vehicle with her car and boxed it in, but surveillance footage does not show the agents were trapped.

Martinez survived, but the Trump administration quickly labeled her a “domestic terrorist” — the same label used to describe Good. Martinez’s criminal charges were dropped in November after the federal Department of Justice abruptly moved to dismiss the case.

In Ellis’ ruling on the civil lawsuit, she wrote that federal officials “cannot simply create their own narrative of what happened, misrepresenting the evidence to justify their actions,” and that the violence used by federal agents “shocks the conscience,” a legal standard meaning a situation that seems grossly unjust to an observer.

Ellis also explicitly questioned the conduct and leadership of Greg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol during the Chicago immigration operation. Bovino, who has led the administration’s big-city campaign, was deposed under oath, and in her November ruling, Ellis described him as “not credible,” writing that he “appeared evasive over the three days of his deposition, either providing ‘cute’ responses … or outright lying.”

In a footnote, Ellis also noted an instance in which an agent asked ChatGPT to draft a use-of-force report from a single sentence and a few images — further undermining the credibility of official DHS accounts.

A narrow path to accountability

Holding federal immigration agents accountable for misconduct is difficult, even as video evidence and police or court records increasingly contradict official government accounts.

With more evidence surfacing and legal claims already underway, some experts say it’s likely that even more lawsuits will emerge this year.

Under pressure, some immigrants are leaving American dreams behind

“We should expect to see more examples, more instances in which cellphone video is used to bolster legal claims against DHS, ICE, Border Patrol and specific officers as well,” said García Hernández, of Ohio State University.

Federal officers are shielded by legal doctrines such as qualified immunity and U.S. Supreme Court rulings that restrict when people can sue federal officials for constitutional violations. In recent years, the courts have narrowed the circumstances under which individuals can bring claims for excessive force or wrongful death.

Suing individual federal immigration agents is nearly impossible.

People can, however, pursue claims against the federal government under the Federal Tort Claims Act if a government employee causes financial or bodily harm. These cases, which can include claims for wrongful death, face significant hurdles: no punitive damages, no jury trials, state-specific caps on compensation and protections for discretionary government decisions.

Internal DHS investigations can lead to discipline or policy changes, but their findings may not be made public.

Several state lawmakers in California, Colorado, Georgia, New York and Oregon are pursuing measures that would allow residents to sue federal immigration agents for constitutional violations. Illinois has a similar law already in place, but this pathway remains largely untested, and experts say it faces significant legal and logistical hurdles.

Several students from Franklin County school districts including Worthington Schools, Hilliard Schools, Upper Arlington Schools, Westerville Schools, and Dublin Schools have walked out of school this month in protest.

These walkouts come after more than 280 people in central Ohio were detained by ICE in one week during Operation Buckeye, which ICE launched from Dec. 16-21.

“Our immigrant kids are afraid to come to school,” Columbus Education Association President John Coneglio said to the Capital Journal.

Ohio schools are required by law to provide free public education to all children, regardless of immigration status.

The Trump administration last year rescinded a policy directive that banned ICE from operating in “sensitive areas” like schools, places of worship, and hospitals.

Some Ohio teacher unions have recently condemned ICE activity near school buildings.

“ICE’s presence in central Ohio is causing fear, upheaval and panic in immigrant communities,” South-Western Education Association Faculty Representatives Spokesperson Emmalee Harding said in a statement.

“This will predictably harm the school environment by causing increased absences, decreased student achievement, and parental disengagement.”

The Hilliard Education Association said denying any child the chance to attend public school is harmful.

“Depriving any child of an opportunity to attend public school puts them at a disadvantage, making it difficult for them to gain the skills they need to contribute fully to society,” HEA said in a statement.

The Ohio Education Association “strongly opposes any presence or enforcement actions” by ICE in or around public schools, OEA President Jeff Wensing said in a statement.

“Schools must remain safe, welcoming spaces where every student — regardless of immigration status — can learn, grow, and thrive without fear,” Wensing said.

“No child should be afraid to go to school, and no school employee should be placed in the position of navigating immigration enforcement. The presence of ICE in schools undermines trust, disrupts learning, and creates trauma for children and families.”

Maqueli Eldredge, a paralegal at Legal Immigration Services in Dublin, said she has not seen ICE try to detain parents when they pick-up or drop-off their children at school.

“Sometimes people see (ICE) around the schools in the neighborhoods, but we haven’t seen ICE trying to detain parents when they take the kids to school,” she said.

Some parents are choosing to keep their students at home and are trying to figure out distance learning, Eldredge said.

“It’s very hard for the kids to miss school and also for the parents to miss work,” she said.

Ohio Immigrant Alliance reported last month that at least 214 people detained were in detention as of Dec. 24. Ninety-three percent were men and 80% appear to be Latino, according to a report from the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.

Ohio House Bill 42 would require various agencies and departments, including the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce, to collect and report citizenship and immigration status to the governor. For the department, that would mean reporting how many students are citizens and how many are not citizens.

Ohio State Reps. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, and Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., introduced the bill, which has had three hearings so far and received much opposition.

“Schools are not immigration enforcement agencies,” Honesty for Ohio Education Executive Director Christina Collins said in her opponent testimony.

“Students who fear that their personal or family information could be used against them are less likely to participate in school, less likely to ask for help, and less likely to report safety concerns.”

“My understanding is that he’s concerned about Trump and what he would do to New Jersey,” Watson Coleman said.
As governor-elect, Sherrill offered some praise for the Immigrant Trust Directive and suggested she’d keep it in place.","As Gov. Mikie Sherrill settles into office, state legislators and advocates are looking to try again on a pair of immigrant-rights bills vetoed by former Gov. Phil Murphy, and they’ll have congressional allies in the effort.

Reps. LaMonica McIver (D-Newark), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing), and Rob Menendez (D-Jersey City), who have formed something of an unofficial progressive trio ever since their now-famous May visit to the Delaney Hall immigrant detention center, had privately pushed Murphy to sign the legislation. They expressed disappointment regarding Murphy’s vetoes, but told the New Jersey Globe they plan to discuss the legislation with Sherrill.

“We have to do everything that we can in New Jersey to protect our residents from ICE,” McIver said. “While I’m disappointed [in Murphy’s veto], I am hopeful that in the new Assembly, with our new governor, we will see the bill come back, and we’ll be able to sign it into law.”

The three House members also have a major immigration-related vote of their own coming up in Congress today, on a bill funding the Department of Homeland Security for 2026. All three said they plan to join most of their fellow Democrats in opposing it — “I’m a hell no,” Menendez said — and went further to suggest that ICE needs to be dismantled and completely reshaped.

“ICE as it exists today should be abolished,” Watson Coleman said, a sentiment that was echoed by both of her colleagues. “What they’re doing is illegal, harmful, and disgusting.”

“Everything’s on the table with respect to ICE,” Menendez concurred. “I don’t see it being something that people can look to and trust in this administration, or in any future administration. And so it will take an entire rethinking and restructuring starting from the ground up.”

During the most recent lame duck session, state legislators passed a trio of bills meant to protect immigrants. Murphy, however, signed just one of the three, legislation directing New Jersey’s attorney general to develop policies requiring “sensitive” locations — like schools, hospitals, and courthouses — to remain accessible to all residents. On the other two bills, Murphy issued pocket vetoes, which cannot be overridden.

One bill that would have prohibited government agencies and healthcare facilities from collecting personal information like immigration status, Murphy said, featured a “drafting oversight [that] could jeopardize billions of dollars of federal funding,” but he expressed optimism that the legislature could quickly fix the issue and pass it again. The other bill would have codified the Immigrant Trust Directive, a policy that bars New Jersey police from cooperating with federal agents on civil immigration enforcement; Murphy’s longtime position had been that putting the directive into state law would make the state more vulnerable to legal challenges.

Murphy’s pocket vetoes, which came less than three hours before Gov. Mikie Sherrill took the oath of office, angered advocates who had been pushing the legislation since the Trump administration’s expansion of deportation operations. Watson Coleman, McIver, and Menendez said they understood Murphy’s reasoning but disagreed with his conclusion.

“My understanding is that he’s concerned about Trump and what he would do to New Jersey,” Watson Coleman said. “I guess he thought he was between a rock and a hard place. I know where his heart is. It’s always to protect New Jerseyans. I’m sorry that we just didn’t bite the bullet and do it.”

The effort to bring the bills back to the fore is likely to start again almost immediately; Assemblywoman Ellen Park (D-Englewood Cliffs), the original bill’s prime sponsor, promised to reintroduce the legislation after Sherrill’s inauguration.

“While these bills were not signed into law this time, our efforts do not end here,” Park said in a release.

As governor-elect, Sherrill offered some praise for the Immigrant Trust Directive and suggested she’d keep it in place. During last year’s gubernatorial campaign, Sherrill expressed concerns about the Immigrant Trust Act — a separate but related piece of legislation more aggressive than the similarly named Directive; she said the Act could pose legal peril to the Directive — but hasn’t commented specifically on the two bills vetoed by Murphy.",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Menendez-McIver-Watson-Coleman.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 04:57:38.246541

Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to testify before Congress about the memo.","With an Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo that allows officers to enter homes without a judicial warrant, the Trump administration is seeking to usurp guardrails that are enshrined in the Fourth Amendment and have protected Americans’ civil liberties for centuries, experts in constitutional law and immigration policy told CNN.

Even in an administration that has always pushed an expansive vision of its law enforcement authority, the directive is notable for the way it tosses aside longstanding prohibitions against warrantless searches on private property — a legal concept that predates the creation of the United States and is among the country’s most foundational principles.

“The Bill of Rights, we thought, were the first 10 amendments,” said Mark Graber, a constitutional law scholar and University of Maryland professor.

With the newly discovered memo, he said: “I guess now we’re down to nine.”

Immigration officials had typically sought the arrests of undocumented people through two means: a judicial warrant, which is signed and authorized by a judge, or an administrative warrant, which is signed by people who work in the executive branch and fall under the purview of the president.

A critical difference between the two is that judicial warrants allow law enforcement to enter and search a person’s home or a non-public area of a business, while administrative warrants do not.

Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants because they require a lower bar to issue, and Trump administration officials have long harbored frustrations over limitations on officers pursuing targets on private property.

The internal memo, which was issued in May 2025 but revealed by a whistleblower complaint and first reported by the Associated Press on Wednesday, authorizes ICE officers to forcefully enter homes using only administrative warrants, essentially bypassing the neutral, third-party arbiters who would have reviewed evidence before signing a judicial warrant.

Administrative warrants are signed by ICE officers after an immigration judge orders the removal of an undocumented immigrant. But these immigration judges work for the Department of Justice at the pleasure of the attorney general, and the Trump administration refers to them as “deportation judges.”

“It would essentially be the same as if you were at the local police department, and the police officer that is both collecting the evidence and arresting you then goes and types up his own warrant to search your house because he thinks he has probable cause,” said Emmanuel Mauleón, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota.

“It’s deeply concerning, because there’s absolutely no safeguards and no accountability built into the system,” he said.

The history of the Fourth Amendment is rife with examples of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies seeking to challenge or whittle away its protections.

But this memo, Mauleón said, is “not the sort of incremental wearing down that we’ve seen over time.”

“It is what you might think of as crossing the Rubicon,” he said. “It is declaring that the fundamental protections that every court has recognized up to this point just don’t apply to DHS and to immigration stops.”

The Department of Homeland Security defended the directive in a statement in which spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said people who are served administrative warrants already had “full due process and a final order of removal.”

The administration’s own data shows hundreds of thousands of people last year were issued removal orders in absentia by immigration judges after they failed to show up to court.

The memo was not broadly distributed to ICE field offices in a departure from the way major policy chances have been typically announced internally.

Instead, in at least some cases, the guidance appeared to only be shared verbally, according to a source familiar. Some ICE officials learned about the guidance for the first time only after the Associated Press reported the change.

News of the memo prompted widespread alarm among civil liberties advocates and Democratic lawmakers. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to testify before Congress about the memo. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whose state is experiencing the most intense surge of immigration enforcement in DHS’s history, said in a post on X “every American” should be “outraged by this assault on freedom and privacy.”

A Trump administration official told CNN the directive is “not a green light to randomly kick down doors.”

But it comes after months in which officers carrying out the president’s massive deportation mandate have used brutish tactics, largely unchecked, to detain immigrants and citizens alike.

“This administration’s general stance is that immigrants are ‘invaders’ and immigration officials should be allowed to expedite their arrest, detention and deportation,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. In doing so, she said, “they are pushing so many legal boundaries and doing things that have not been tried before in this way.”

Liam Ramos was taken into custody on Tuesday as he and his father arrived home from school in Columbia Heights, a Minneapolis suburb. According to school officials, an ICE agent used the child to knock on the family’s front door to determine if anyone else was inside, before detaining father and son.

Joaquin Castro, a representative from Texas, said his office has been working to locate the boy and demand his release, but that ICE has not provided information despite acknowledging the inquiry. Castro said his office suspects Liam may have been sent to the Dilley detention center, a family detention facility about 90 minutes from San Antonio.

“Ice and the other federal agencies under Donald Trump have gotten super secretive,” Castro said in a video statement. “This is the least transparent that an administration has been in generations.”

Castro said he was scheduled to visit the facility next week, and said he believes ICE “should be disbanded” and get “zero funding”.

“They’ve become reckless, they’ve become lawless,” he said, “and it’s not about immigration enforcement any more. It’s about abusing people.”

Ruben Gallego, a senator from Arizona, questioned whether the operation made Americans safer to begin with. “These are the ‘violent criminals’ Trump is going after. Liam Ramos is 5 years old. He was used as bait to knock on doors to see if anyone else was inside. Then they took him and shipped him to Texas. This is fucked up and it doesn’t make anyone safer,” he wrote on X.

Yassamin Ansari, a representative from Arizona, on Thursday said it was “absolutely disgusting that they used a 5-year-old child as bait so that they could arrest his father”. She added: “Murdering US citizens and kidnapping children in front of our eyes is pure evil.”

Jimmy Gomez, a representative from California, echoed similar sentiments. “ICE just used a 5-year-old boy as bait, forcing him to knock on his own door so they could arrest his father,” he wrote. “Trump, ICE and CBP don’t see these families as people, and that’s exactly how they’re treating them.”

Marc Prokosch, an attorney representing the family, said the Ramos family had followed proper legal procedures. They have an active asylum case and entered the United States at an official port of entry, he said.

“The family did everything they were supposed to in accordance with how the rules have been set out,” he said. “They did not come here illegally. They are not criminals.

Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a representative from California, said: “This isn’t about criminals. It’s about cruelty.”

The homeland security department defended the raid, with assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin saying ICE was conducting a targeted operation to arrest the father and did not target the child. She alleged the father fled on foot, abandoning his child, and that an officer remained with Liam for his safety.

School superintendent Zena Stenvik disputed that account, saying the father’s car was still running when she arrived at the scene and that both had already been apprehended. She said another adult at the home had pleaded to take care of Liam but was denied.

“Why detain a five-year-old?” Stenvik said at a press conference. “You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”

Liam is one of four children in the Columbia Heights school district who have been detained by federal immigration agents during an enforcement surge in the region over the past two weeks, according to district officials.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/806c6b5dc1841119905b9d9e6b735f5df4b8b8d6/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f8782cb28b4363650c800d7e6ca5fcb",N,,2026-01-23 05:57:32.091549

The $64.4 billion bill, which includes roughly $10 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), passed the House by a vote of 220-207.
The measure contained a few targeted reforms, including a reduction in funding for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, a decrease in ICE detention beds and a cut in Border Patrol funding, which were seen as attempts to placate Democrats.
“Let us be clear: this bill is about funding FEMA disaster relief, about stopping child trafficking and the spread of fentanyl in our communities and strengthening our cybersecurity and law enforcement,” Gillen said.
“I’m shocked my colleagues would vote to cut off national and community security funding while leaving ICE to operate under the status quo,” she added.","Several House Democrats joined with nearly all Republicans to approve a bill funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Thursday, as anger grows over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.

The $64.4 billion bill, which includes roughly $10 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), passed the House by a vote of 220-207. All but one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie (Ky.), voted for the measure.

The seven Democrats who sided with Republicans were Reps. Henry Cuellar (Texas), Jared Golden (Maine), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), Laura Gillen (N.Y.), Don Davis (N.C.), Tom Suozzi (N.Y.) and Vicente Gonzalez (Texas).

The bill also provides billions of dollars in funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the U.S. Secret Service, the Disaster Relief Fund and other programs and agencies.

Suozzi explained his vote earlier Thursday, writing that the measure was the product of “bipartisan negotiations and responsible governing,” framing the vote as necessary to avert a potential government shutdown.

“I am voting for the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, not to expand ICE enforcement or add more agents, but to fund the core operations Americans rely on every day, FEMA disaster response, TSA security, Customs and Border Protection, the Coast Guard, passport processing, and other essential services,” Suozzi wrote on the social platform X.

“I strongly oppose allowing another shutdown to disrupt the lives of working families. We saw the damage of a shutdown last year: millions of Americans lost pay and access to essential services,” he added. “Congress has a responsibility to govern, not to lurch from one manufactured crisis to the next.”

Gillen offered a similar justification, saying she supported “funding our immigration enforcement and the commonsense guardrails” included in the package.

The measure contained a few targeted reforms, including a reduction in funding for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, a decrease in ICE detention beds and a cut in Border Patrol funding, which were seen as attempts to placate Democrats.

“Let us be clear: this bill is about funding FEMA disaster relief, about stopping child trafficking and the spread of fentanyl in our communities and strengthening our cybersecurity and law enforcement,” Gillen said. She also pointed to money included for the Office for Civil Rights and security grants for houses of worship.

Federal agents took the child, Liam Conejo Ramos, from a running car while it was in the family’s driveway on Tuesday afternoon, Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik said during a news conference on Wednesday.

The officers then told the child to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a five-year-old as bait”, Stenvik said.

Stenvik said the family, who came to the United States in 2024, has an active asylum case and had not been ordered to leave the country.

“Why detain a five-year-old?” she asked. “You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE did NOT target a child”.

She said ICE was conducting an operation to arrest the child’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who McLaughlin said is from Ecuador.

“For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” McLaughlin said, adding that parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing.

Liam is the fourth student from Columbia Heights Public Schools who has been detained by ICE in recent weeks, said Stenvik. A 17-year-old student was taken on Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, she said.

The family’s lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said on Thursday that Liam and his father were taken to an immigration lockup in Dilley, Texas, and that he assumes they were being held in a family holding cell.

“We’re looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or moral pressure,” he said at a news conference.

A lawyer who visited the Dilley detention facility last week, as part of an ongoing lawsuit to ensure the safekeeping of immigrant children in federal custody, said conditions were deteriorating.

“The conditions were worse than ever,” said Leecia Welch, chief legal counsellor at the advocacy group Children’s Rights.

“The number of children had skyrocketed, and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,” Welch said.

“Nearly every child we spoke to was sick – and it seemed there was an epidemic of illnesses going around. Families reported that their children were malnourished, extremely ill, and suffering profoundly from prolonged detention,” Welch said.

During a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, US Vice President JD Vance said he heard the “terrible story” about Liam, but said he was not sure what the federal agents could have done differently.

“Well, what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death? Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?” said Vance, noting that he was also the parent of a five-year-old.

US federal agents have arrested some 3,000 people in immigration raids across Minnesota in recent weeks, according to Greg Bovino, a US Customs and Border Protection official.

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.

Also on Thursday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said that three people have been arrested in Minneapolis after they protested at Cities Church in St Paul, where they alleged one of the pastors, David Easterwood, was the acting field director for the St Paul ICE field office. Those arrested included Minneapolis civil rights activist Nekima Levy Armstrong and St Paul school board member Chauntyll Louisa Allen, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper.

Reached by phone Thursday, Corey Oliver, the CEO of the Strength in Management property company, wouldn’t answer questions about his next steps or whether he planned to cooperate with the investigation.
Hightower, the former resident, said he and others had seen hints that the property manager or owner had tipped off federal officials.
“It’s well overdue that somebody investigates this situation, but it’s taken years for this to be even noticed,” Hightower said.
Penalties can include orders to end discriminatory practices, compensation to tenants and fines starting at $16,000, the state says.","As Illinois officials investigate whether a landlord and property manager prompted a massive federal immigration raid on their South Shore building, former residents and organizers say that’s what they’ve long suspected.

Tenants had faced squalid conditions for years, long before the arrival of Venezuelan migrants in the building, and they said the property could be so unsecured at times that it felt open to the public and to squatters. Residents have accused the manager of failing to address complaints of disturbing conditions, and some suspected the owner and manager of calling the feds as a back door way of clearing the building.

The Illinois Department of Human Rights announced late Wednesday that it would investigate the claims when it filed a formal housing discrimination charge against Wisconsin-based real estate investor Trinity Flood, her company 7500 Shore A LLC, and Strength in Management LLC, the property management company she hired at the South Shore building.

WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times have previously reported observations from tenants and a map found in the building that detailed each unit, suggesting federal agents may have received inside information before the Sept. 30 raid.

Jonah Karsh, with the Metropolitan Tenants Organization, called the investigation “a big step” to getting justice for the tenants, who “have been through hell — between helicopters showing up on their roof, and then the remaining tenants having to leave on 2½ weeks notice in the cold.”

Former resident Darren Hightower was glad to hear about the inquiry but was far less enthusiastic.

“It’s never too late, I guess, but sometimes it feels like it’s too late,” he said. “Look where we are today: Some of the tenants from that building still don’t have a place to stay — myself included.”

State officials said they would look into the allegation that the landlord and property manager “tipped federal officials” that Venezuelan nationals were living in the building without leases and had “threatened other tenants.”

“7500 S Shore building management sought to intimidate and coerce the building’s Black and Hispanic tenants into leaving their apartment units, based on stereotypes about Venezuelan immigrants,” the state complaint read.

“Within hours after the raid, workers employed or contracted by 7500 S Shore building management were tossing tenants’ belongings in the trash and clearing out units vacated by the raid.”

Signed by James Bennett, director of the state’s human rights department, the housing discrimination charge alleges that the landlord and property manager “blamed Venezuelan tenants for their own failure to provide needed locks and security service, as well as other needed maintenance and repairs, and perpetuated stereotypes about Venezuelan gang members to send a message that tenants born outside of the United States were considered gang associates, even if they were law abiding.”

The charge document also states that building management unlawfully discriminated against longtime tenants when they refused to make maintenance and repairs.

Flood didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.

Reached by phone Thursday, Corey Oliver, the CEO of the Strength in Management property company, wouldn’t answer questions about his next steps or whether he planned to cooperate with the investigation.

“I have nothing to give you,” he said. “I can’t tell you anything.”

One resident previously told the Sun-Times and WBEZ that he saw someone he believed to be a worker from the building taking pictures of the units “where the Venezuelans lived” before the raid.

WBEZ and Sun-Times reporters also found a crumpled map on a hallway floor days after the raid. It marked each unit inside the five-floor building as “vacant,” “tenant” or as having “firearms.” The units marked “vacant” on the map had clearly been raided, with doors broken down and items scattered everywhere. Most units marked as “tenant” appeared intact, though not all.

Hightower, the former resident, said he and others had seen hints that the property manager or owner had tipped off federal officials.

“It was a lot of facts that we gathered as tenants to back up our theory … that this was a [coordinated] hit,” said Hightower, who said he had seen stickers with an “X” placed over doors to units occupied by either migrants or squatters just before the raid.

Hightower said he’s staying with a friend and applying to apartments. He moved out of the building Dec. 12 without a place to live after a Cook County judge ordered the building to be vacated, citing dangerous conditions.

Hightower, who along with his neighbors had dealt with numerous issues in the building long before the raid, said the state human rights department should not only investigate the months leading up to the immigration raid, but “[go] back years, go into [the owner’s and property managers’] books,” to probe other ways in which tenants were mistreated and ignored.

“It’s well overdue that somebody investigates this situation, but it’s taken years for this to be even noticed,” Hightower said. “It’s not OK to manipulate the system for your own gain. You’re playing with people’s lives.”

Karsh, the housing organizer, said former residents deserve material compensation, and the landlord and property manager “need to be put on notice that this kind of behavior is not acceptable” through fines, penalties and a reputational hit “for not caring about their tenants’ safety, and being willing to literally have them arrested, kidnapped, kicked out outside of an eviction process.”

The state human rights department is likely to gather evidence and seek interviews with former residents and other witnesses, including Flood and Oliver, as part of its inquiry. If investigators find substantial evidence of housing discrimination, they can refer the case to the Illinois Human Rights Commission, which conducts public hearings in front of an administrative law judge.

Whether through a settlement or a judge’s ruling, the property owner and manager could be held liable and ordered to make tenants whole, “as if the discrimination had not occurred,” according to the commission’s website, which adds that the process can take years.

So far, almost all Republicans have declined to put checks on Trump through the war powers votes.
Last week, Senate Republicans were only able to narrowly dismiss the Venezuela war powers resolution after the Trump administration persuaded two Republicans to back away from their earlier support.
But Bacon still expressed frustration with Trump's aggressive foreign policy and voted for the war powers resolution even though it only applies to Venezuela.
The war powers debate The War Powers Resolution was passed in the Vietnam War era as the U.S. sent troops to conflicts throughout Asia.","On the House floor, Democrats responded with shouts that Republican leaders were violating the chamber's procedural rules. Two Republicans — Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — voted with all Democrats for the legislation.

The war powers resolution would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. The Trump administration told senators last week that there are no U.S. troops on the ground in the South American nation and committed to getting congressional approval before launching major military operations there.

But Democrats argued that the resolution is necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and since Trump has stated plans to control the country's oil industry for years to come.

The response to Trump's foreign policy

Thursday's vote was the latest test in Congress of how much leeway Republicans will give a president who campaigned on removing the U.S. from foreign entanglements but has increasingly reached for military options to impose his will in the Western Hemisphere. So far, almost all Republicans have declined to put checks on Trump through the war powers votes.

Rep. Brian Mast, the Republican chair of the House Armed Services Committee, accused Democrats of bringing the war powers resolution to a vote out of ""spite"" for Trump.

""It's about the fact that you don't want President Trump to arrest Maduro, and you will condemn him no matter what he does, even though he brought Maduro to justice with possibly the most successful law enforcement operation in history,"" Mast added.

Still, Democrats stridently argued that Congress needs to assert its role in determining when the president can use wartime powers. They have been able to force a series of votes in both the House and Senate as Trump, in recent months, ramped up his campaign against Maduro and set his sights on other conflicts overseas.

""Donald Trump is reducing the United States to a regional bully with fewer allies and more enemies,"" Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said during a floor debate. ""This isn't making America great again. It's making us isolated and weak.""

Last week, Senate Republicans were only able to narrowly dismiss the Venezuela war powers resolution after the Trump administration persuaded two Republicans to back away from their earlier support. As part of that effort, Secretary of State Marco Rubio committed to a briefing next week before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Yet Trump's insistence that the U.S. will possess Greenland over the objections of Denmark, a NATO ally, has alarmed some Republicans on Capitol Hill. They have mounted some of the most outspoken objections to almost anything the president has done since taking office.

Trump this week backed away from military and tariff threats against European allies as he announced that his administration was working with NATO on a ""framework of a future deal"" on Arctic security.

But Bacon still expressed frustration with Trump's aggressive foreign policy and voted for the war powers resolution even though it only applies to Venezuela.

""I'm tired of all the threats,"" he said.

Trump's recent military actions — and threats to do more — have reignited a decades-old debate in Congress over the War Powers Act, a law passed in the early 1970s by lawmakers looking to claw back their authority over military actions.

The war powers debate

The War Powers Resolution was passed in the Vietnam War era as the U.S. sent troops to conflicts throughout Asia. It attempted to force presidents to work with Congress to deploy troops if there hasn't already been a formal declaration of war.

Under the legislation, lawmakers can also force votes on legislation that directs the president to remove U.S. forces from hostilities.

Presidents have long tested the limits of those parameters, and Democrats argue that Trump in his second term has pushed those limits farther than ever.

The Trump administration left Congress in the dark ahead of the surprise raid to capture Maduro. It has also used an evolving set of legal justifications to blow up alleged drug boats and seize sanctioned oil tankers near Venezuela.

Democrats question who gets to benefit from Venezuelan oil licenses

As the Trump administration oversees the sale of Venezuela's petroleum worldwide, Senate Democrats are also questioning who is benefiting from the contracts.

In one of the first transactions, the U.S. granted Vitol, the world's largest independent oil broker, a license worth roughly $250 million. A senior partner at Vitol, John Addison, gave roughly $6 million to Trump-aligned political action committees during the presidential election, according to donation records compiled by OpenSecrets.

""Congress and the American people deserve full transparency regarding any financial commitments, promises, deals, or other arrangements related to Venezuela that could favor donors to the President's campaign and political operation,"" 13 Democratic senators wrote to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles Thursday in a letter led by Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.

The White House has said it is safeguarding the South American country's oil for the benefit of both the people of Venezuela and the U.S.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-15T220006Z_1555299427_RC2X1JA00B0I_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-VENEZUELA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 04:57:50.944922

Voters are demanding a response to the most recent deployment in Minnesota, where residents and local leaders say federal immigration patrols are disappearing people, brutalizing protesters and bystanders, and intentionally sowing chaos in the icy streets.

A pair of Democrats announced a bill on January 21 that would defund ICE’s rapidly expanding detention system and redirect resources toward repairing the damage caused by immigration raids on local communities.

The Melt ICE Act would remove the authority from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to incarcerate immigrants and dismantle the ICE’s rapidly expanding network of roughly 200 jails, privately run prisons, and makeshift detention halls holding at least 73,000 people on any given day. It was introduced by Rep. Delia Ramirez and Rep. Yvette Clarke, representing districts in Illinois and New York hard-hit by Trump’s so-called “immigration enforcement” surges.

Designed to hamper Trump’s mass deportation campaign as protests erupt nationwide, the bill comes as the House advances bipartisan legislation that would continue robust funding for ICE and deportations. Facing a January 30 deadline to fund the government, House Republicans advanced the DHS funding bill to a vote on January 22. If approved, the bill will be sent to the Senate.

While some Democratic lawmakers say the budget bill essentially keeps funding for ICE flat compared to last year, Rep. Pramila Jayapal said it effectively amounts to an increase when additional funding from 2025 is considered. Specific numbers aside, Jayapal said she could not vote to fund ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) without placing strict limits on the behavior of immigration officers to protect the public.

“The core issue here is that there really are no guardrails on ICE and CBP. I can’t vote for it,” Jayapal said in a video statement on January 20. “I can’t be complicit in continuing to allow them to violate the constitutional rights of people across this country.”

The House funding bill provides funding for ICE for more training and body-worn cameras, which critics say amount to optics rather than meaningful reforms designed to prevent violence by federal immigration officers. Immigrant rights advocates note that Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by a law enforcement veteran who was recording the interaction.

“Any realistic effort to rein in ICE and DHS’s lawlessness should start with the blank check they have enjoyed since Donald Trump retook power,” Clarke said in a statement on January 21 introducing the Melt ICE Act.

Since taking office, Trump has transformed ICE into the nation’s largest law enforcement outfit. At least 36 people have died in ICE custody since Trump took office. Along with viral videos of ICE agents acting violently in neighborhoods across the country, the fatal shooting of Renee Good by ICE officer Jonathan Ross on January 7 has struck a nerve far beyond Minnesota. The public is demanding accountability as backlash builds in the streets — and lawmakers are taking notice.

In Minnesota, some lawmakers are answering the call by joining constituents in protest.

“The answer to authoritarianism unfortunately is not in the halls of the statehouse, it is in the streets of our country, standing shoulder to shoulder with Americans resisting the violations of constitutional rights that we are seeing dozens and dozens of times every day now,” Rep. Aisha Gomez, a Minnesota state representative from Minneapolis, told Truthout in an interview.

The surge in Minnesota is among the largest and most recent invasions of major U.S. cities by newly emboldened immigration officers, who left a trail of death and disruption in Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, and elsewhere. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat, said the Trump administration has deployed 3,000 federal immigration officers to the Twin Cities, nearly triple the number of local police officers.

Ellison, who is challenging Trump’s immigration deployment in federal court, pointed to the recent arrest of an elderly U.S. citizen who was removed from his home in St. Paul in a bathrobe and underwear by federal immigration officers despite sub-freezing temperatures. The man’s family says his case was one of mistaken identity.

“Are agents of the state — that you don’t even know who they are because they are masked — can they kick your door in, beat you down, and kill you?” Ellison said during a press call on January 21, suggesting the Trump administration has crossed a line. “Once that happens, you know without any doubt that you are in a tyrannical society.”

ICE’s leadership continues to argue its officers are doing nothing wrong despite a growing pile of video evidence to the contrary. Following the playbook his agency has used in other cities, Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino blames local police and the residents of Minneapolis when asked about videos showing his agents assaulting people. Asked about tear gas and other crowd-control weapons deployed against protesters, Bovino accused Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Gov. Tim Walz of colluding with “anarchists.” Both Democrats have repeatedly called for protests to remain peaceful.

“What we do is legal, ethical and moral, well grounded in law,” Bovino told reporters on January 20.

The Justice Department is now investigating Frey, Walz, and other Minnesota Democrats who have encouraged residents to document and report abuses.

“We need people to keep standing up for the protesters,” Ellison said, addressing a national audience. “The protesters are a living, breathing example that Minnesotans are not quietly going into the dark night … and this effort needs to continue to be supported.”

Back in Washington, Democrats at the federal level are debating how best to hold ICE accountable while Republicans still control the majority. The Melt ICE Act is perhaps the most robust proposal from Democrats to block the rampage of federal immigration agents across the country. The bill is unlikely to gain traction in the GOP-controlled Congress but still offers Democrats an option for framing as they respond to the outrage over heavily armed, masked immigration officers patrolling the streets. It also responds to the increasingly popular demand to abolish ICE, which has the support of nearly half of the country.

Meanwhile, proposals from Democrats such Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and the measures in the House funding bill have been roundly criticized for suggesting that state violence can be prevented with “transparency” and providing ICE officers with better training.

In addition to continuing DHS funding, the House bill does not include reforms to ICE demanded by many activists and Democrats in Congress, including bans on detaining U.S. citizens and conducting immigration enforcement in the interior of the country.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, which released the budget package, said on January 21 that she shares the frustration of her fellow Democrats with “the out-of-control agency.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced his personal opposition to the funding bill but was criticized by progressives for failing to whip other Democratic votes against it.

“ICE must be reined in. There must be accountability for the countless abuses, acts of violence, and lawless behavior we have seen on our streets,” DeLauro said in a statement on January 20, encouraging fellow Democrats to base their vote on what is best for their constituents. “The bill takes several steps in the right direction … but it does not include broader reforms Democrats proposed.”

Lindsay Koshgarian, the program director at the National Priorities Project and an expert on federal appropriations, said the bill amounts to Congress giving ICE more money to “terrorize communities and break our laws.”

“ICE shouldn’t get one more penny, especially since the GOP took from healthcare and food programs last year to give billions more to ICE in their Big Bad Bill,” Koshgarian said in an email. “The immediate thing Congress needs to do is stop giving ICE more funding and legislate real accountability, like not allowing racial profiling and violence against protestors.”

With the funding bill likely to pass, local and state leaders are scrambling to offer their own legislative protections against Trump’s immigration forces. Lawmakers in multiple states are now pushing legislation known as “universal constitutional remedies” that would allow individuals to sue any official — local, state, or federal — when their constitutional rights are violated. Currently, Renee Good’s surviving wife and family have little legal recourse for holding Ross accountable for the deadly shooting that took Good’s life.

Cameron Kistler, a counsel at the watchdog group Protect Democracy, said state laws allow people to sue state and local law enforcement when their rights are violated, but there is no similar federal statute for holding federal officers accountable.

“Ms. Good’s killing really drove home to legislators how unfair and frankly anti-constitutional that system is,” Kistler told reporters on January 21. “Whether Ms. Good’s family has a remedy for her killing should turn on whether her constitutional rights are violated, not what badge the officer had when he shot her.”

Kistler said Illinois has already passed a “universal constitutional remedies” bill into law, and similar legislation has been announced or introduced in California, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, and Virginia. Kistler expects more states to take up similar bills as more lawmakers seek to close the “loophole” shielding ICE agents from lawsuits.

“These are not messaging bills, these are not stunts,” Kistler said. “State law has long been a critical source of protection [against] unconstitutional actions by federal officers.”

Representative Gomez said lawmakers in Minnesota are working on constitutional remedy legislation and other efforts to keep their residents safe despite the invasion of immigration officers, but that state and local leaders can only do so much when the federal government is openly violating the Constitution.

“The reality is that many people want state policy and local policy and law to protect us in the face of a federal government that is basically an authoritarian tyrannical regime on the march, so I understand the impulse,” Gomez said.

State lawmakers passing a ban on masking for law enforcement or opening up legal avenues for lawsuits alone will not stop Trump’s rampage. That is why Gomez is joining her constituents in the icy streets to protest ICE’s invasion of her city.

“We are not the first and we are not going to be the last,” Gomez said, referring to ICE operations in other cities. “Everyone needs to be organizing in their communities and building up that web of care for each other, which is the only answer to a regime that doesn’t care about the law and doesn’t care about the truth.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255546468-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 22:57:36.232666

America's judicial system is undergoing one of its most consequential stress tests in decades, as the president pushes the limits of executive power and strains the nation's system of checks and balances.

Over the past year, the courts have moved to the center of the country's most significant political fights, while the Trump administration has increasingly challenged the authority of judges, whose rulings have stalled key parts of its agenda.

As we mark a year into President Trump's second term, we're returning this week to guests from our On Democracy series, which explores the laws, institutions, and norms that have shaped this country and the different pressures they face today.

We're joined now by Steve Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University.

Welcome back to the program.

Steve Vladeck, Georgetown University Law Center:

Thanks, Geoff. Thanks for having me.

Geoff Bennett:

I want to start with immigration enforcement because it's raising the most immediate constitutional questions.

As you well know, there is this newly revealed internal ICE memo that authorizes federal agents to forcibly enter homes with an administrative warrant, instead of a warrant from a judge. And the whistle-blowers who presented this memo to Congress says this goes not just against their training, but also the law.

How do you assess the constitutional legitimacy of this policy?

Steve Vladeck:

Yes, it's not legitimate. I mean, the whistle-blower is right.

So the Supreme Court, even as it has poked holes in the Fourth Amendment over the last 35, 40 years, the one thing it has kept coming back to is that an American's home is their castle. And so there are exigent circumstances in which law enforcement officers are allowed to enter a home without a warrant.

We just had a case about that a couple of weeks ago. There are circumstances where a law enforcement officer might have probable cause to believe that there's a crime being under way in a home.

But this notion that an ICE officer can simply sign a piece of paper called an administrative warrant and use that as a basis for entering someone's home without any probable cause, without any exigency, without a federal judge signing off has no precedent in our jurisprudence and is, frankly, flatly inconsistent with everything the Supreme Court has said about the Fourth Amendment.

Geoff Bennett:

Our team reached out to DHS and received a statement, part of which reads this way.

""The officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause. For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement.""

Is that the case?

Steve Vladeck:

No.

So, administrative warrants, when there is a basis for believing that there is a crime under way or when there's a basis for believing that you're definitely going to find someone who's immediately arrestable and subject to mandatory detention, that's closer.

But, Geoff, you can't put the cart before the horse. You can't say, we went into the house without a judicially signed warrant and then found someone who we could arrest on an immigration violation. That's bootstrapping.

The reality is that the government's not supposed to be able to go door to door without warrants, barging into American's homes. I mean, just to go way back, this was one of the grievances against King George III that we list specifically in the Declaration of Independence. There's a reason why we have a Fourth Amendment. There's a reason why it applies even to folks who are suspected of and may well be out of status from an immigration perspective.

Geoff Bennett:

If immigration enforcement in particular is pushing the limits of executive power, where does the president's constitutional authority begin and where does it end?

Steve Vladeck:

So, I mean, at least historically, we have viewed immigration enforcement inside the country not as part of the president's exclusive Article II powers, but as a shared authority between the president and Congress.

Maybe, Geoff, it's different at the border, because the president could have an argument at the border that now I'm engaged in my Article II self-defense function. But once we're talking about law enforcement on a house-by-house basis in American cities, that's where it has historically been up to the president to carry out what Congress has provided for.

Congress hasn't provided for this. And this dovetails with this broader push by the Trump administration, also dating back to last summer, to treat anyone who's in the country who was never lawfully admitted, even if they have been here 30 or 40 years, as if they were stopped at the border, so that the government can then try to deny them a bond hearing if they're arrested.

It really is a categorical wholesale rethinking of immigration law that, Geoff, so far federal courts have been blocking overwhelmingly judges from across the geographical and ideological spectrum.

Geoff Bennett:

When we spoke almost a year ago about this very topic, whether the courts could meaningfully act as a check on executive power, we didn't really know much because it was so early into the second term.

But looking back over that year, what has stood out? What has surprised you the most?

Steve Vladeck:

I think a couple of the points that stand out, one is, the federal courts, I think, have done a really remarkable job of at least serving as a speed break on many of this administration's more aggressive tendencies.

The Alien Enemies Act, for example, was never successfully deployed because of the federal courts. President Trump's birthright citizenship executive order still hasn't gotten into effect because of the courts. But the courts can't do it alone.

And some of that's because we have had all these interventions from the U.S. Supreme Court that have allowed the administration to carry out a bunch of these policies while these cases are going forward. But even in the cases where there hasn't been Supreme Court intervention, the courts are more of a rearguard action here, Geoff, right?

And you really need multiple institutions holding each other accountable.

Geoff Bennett:

Are we in the midst of a constitutional crisis?

Steve Vladeck:

That question, I think, is -- sort of has different meanings to everybody.

I don't know what the -- where the line is, where you cross the line and say, hey, now it's a crisis. I think we're in the middle of an institutional crisis, and we have been for the better part of a year. And it's a crisis caused largely by the fact that we have an ambitious executive, we have a, I think, fairly well-functioning judiciary, and we have a completely sort of indolent Congress.

And the founders set up our constitutional structure so that the branches would work the best and our rights would be best protected when the branches were all pushing against each other. With an ambitious executive and ambitious courts and no Congress, I think we're seeing the problem, which is everything comes down to injunctions, temporary restraining orders, and whether the executive branch is going to comply.

I don't know that it's a constitutional crisis, but also I'm not sure that that's the relevant question. Our institutions are under pressure in ways that they really haven't been in American history. And although I think the courts have done a very good job of holding the line to this point, you know, there's going to come a point where they need some help.

And whether that's going to be from Congress perhaps on the far side of this year's midterm elections or from some other actors, I think that's going to be the critical question as we look toward the next 12 months of this presidency.

""Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,"" the attorney general wrote on X.

Cities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads the local ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.

Attorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.

""The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,"" said Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, which calls itself a public interest civil rights firm, in a statement.

Vance threatens the protesters with prison terms

Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and prominent local activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a ""fundamental moral conflict.""

""You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,"" she said Tuesday. ""When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renée Good's, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.""

WATCH: Border Patrol and ICE leaders defend tactics used in Minneapolis operations

Prominent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have come to the church's defense, arguing that compassion for migrant families affected by the crackdown cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.

Vance, speaking in Toledo ahead of his Minnesota visit, warned the church protesters: ""Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so. We're going to do everything we can to enforce the law.""

Arrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation

A longtime activist in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, Levy Armstrong has helped lead local protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP's Minneapolis branch.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.

FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking reproductive health services or seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.

It's unclear which attorneys would represent Allen and Kelly.

Saint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a member of the board of education, is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters, according to district spokesperson Erica Wacker.

Allen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists who have protested the deaths of African Americans at the hands of police.

Kelly defended the protest during a news conference Tuesday, criticizing the church for its association with a pastor who works for ICE.

The Justice Department's swift investigation into the church protest stands in contrast to its decision not to open a civil rights investigation into the killing of Good. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said last week there was ""no basis"" for a civil rights investigation into her death.

Administration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in ""an act of domestic terrorism"" when she pulled toward him. But the decision not to have the department's Civil Rights Division investigate marked a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.

The Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Judge rejects charges against a journalist

A magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors' bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the ongoing investigation.

Lemon was among those on who entered the church. Lemon has said he is not affiliated with the protest organizers and was there chronicling as a journalist.

""Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,"" Lemon said in a video posted on social media. ""That's it. That's called journalism.""

It wasn't immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge's decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.

CNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.

VP visits Minnesota

Vance, a Republican, arrived amid tense interactions between federal immigration law enforcement authorities and residents. State and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.

His visit comes less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good's death a ""tragedy of her own making.""

Vance said early Thursday that the ""far left"" has decided the U.S. shouldn't have a border.

""If you want to turn down the chaos in Minneapolis, stop fighting immigration enforcement and accept that we have to have a border in this country. It's not that hard,"" Vance said.

A federal appeals court this week suspended a decision that barred immigration officers from using tear gas or pepper spray against peaceful protesters in Minnesota. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals froze the ruling that had barred retaliation, including detaining people who follow agents in cars.

After the court's stay, U.S. Border Patrol official Greg Bovino, who has commanded the administration's big-city immigration campaign, was seen on video repeatedly warning protesters on a snowy Minneapolis street ""Gas is coming!"" before tossing a canister that released green smoke into the crowd.

Bovino, speaking Thursday during a news conference, urged better cooperation from local and state officials in Minnesota, and blamed an ""influx of anarchists"" for the anti-ICE sentiment.

""The current climate confronting law enforcement ... is not very favorable right now in Minneapolis,"" he said. The Associated Press left messages for the Minneapolis Police Department requesting its response to Bovino's comments.

Trump himself weighed in during the proceedings, using social media to call for Smith to face criminal charges, though he did not offer any evidence that would justify a prosecution.

“Based on his testimony today, there is no question that Deranged Jack Smith should be prosecuted for his actions,” Trump wrote. “He destroyed the lives of many innocent people, which has been his history as a prosecutor. At a minimum, he committed large scale perjury!”

All the while, Smith told the committee his investigations were nonpartisan — and that there were, indeed, grounds to bring two federal indictments against Trump during the period between his two terms in office.

“I made my decisions without regard to President Trump’s political association, activities, beliefs or candidacy in the 2024 election,” Smith told the congressional panel.

“President Trump was charged because the evidence established that he willfully broke the law — the very laws he took an oath to uphold.”

Formerly a war-crimes prosecutor at an international tribunal in The Hague, Smith was selected to serve as special counsel in 2022, under former Democratic President Joe Biden.

Special counsels are tapped to operate independently, without the usual day-to-day oversight from politically appointed Justice Department leadership.

But Smith’s mandate was particularly sensitive. He was charged with investigating Trump, Biden’s 2020 election rival whom the Democrat would face again in the 2024 race.

Inside the investigations

The 2020 election was a central part of Smith’s investigation. So were Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021, when thousands of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in an apparent attempt to disrupt the certification of the election results.

Smith ultimately determined that Trump had intentionally attempted to subvert the vote. In August 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on four charges: conspiracy to defraud the country, obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against the free exercise of rights under the US Constitution.

A separate grand jury, this time in the state of Florida, issued a second federal indictment in June 2023, related to another probe Smith led.

That investigation focused on Trump’s decision to withhold classified documents after leaving office and defy a subpoena for their return. Trump was ultimately charged with 40 counts, including conspiracy to obstruct justice, making false statements, and failing to adhere to standards concerning sensitive documents under the Espionage Act.

Both federal cases were dropped after Trump was re-elected in 2024. It is Justice Department policy not to investigate or prosecute sitting presidents. Smith himself resigned shortly before Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.

Nevertheless, at Thursday’s hearing, Smith defended the indictments and suggested his cases would have been successful had the circumstances been different.

“I want to be clear: I stand by my decisions as special counsel, including the decision to bring charges against President Trump,” Smith told the committee.

“Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in criminal activity. If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Democrat or a Republican.”

He added that the evidence compelled him to move forward with the indictments, regardless of the high-profile defendant.

“The law required that he be held to account,” Smith said. “So that is what I did. To have done otherwise on the facts of these cases would’ve been to shirk my duties as a prosecutor.”

Later on in his testimony, he emphasised his stance: “ We were ready, willing and able to go to trial in the case.”

Republican criticisms

But Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee sought to portray Smith as a partisan shill whose mission was to take down Biden’s political rival.

Some of the most aggressive questioning came from Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California, who cast doubt on Smith’s independence as special prosecutor.

“You, like the president’s men for Richard Nixon, went after your political enemies. Maybe they’re not your political enemies, but they sure as hell were Joe Biden’s political enemies, weren’t they?” Issa asked.

“They were the enemies of the president. And you were their arm, weren’t you?”

Smith replied to the accusation with a single word: “No.”

Issa went on to assert that, in spreading false statements denying his 2020 election defeat, Trump was simply expressing his First Amendment right to free speech.

“ You understand the Constitution? Do you understand the Bill of Rights that someone has the absolute right to believe something, whether it’s true or not, and to advocate for something whether it’s true or not?” Issa said at one point.

“So if you know that people have a right to opine, lobby for, assert [and] do everything they can legally to ask for people to make different decisions, then why is it you saw criminal conduct on behalf of a president who believed he didn’t win?”

Smith was not able to respond to that question, but his indictment asserts that Trump went beyond simply voicing his disagreement with the results.

Rather, it argues that Trump and his allies attempted to recruit “false electors” to submit fraudulent Electoral College votes for certification, and it highlights evidence that Trump pressured elected officials to reject unfavourable vote outcomes.

Another key point of criticism among Republicans was Smith’s decision to seek “limited toll records” from the telephones of nine lawmakers who communicated with Trump during his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

Then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, was among the Congress members targeted.

Such toll records do not include the content of the calls in question. Rather, they identify where the call originated from, who it was received by, and how long the connection lasted.

Republicans argued that subpoenaing the telephone records amounted not only to a violation of privacy but also to an infringement of the Constitution’s Speech and Debate Clause, which protects lawmakers from legal action stemming from their legislative duties.

Conservative members of the committee also questioned the secrecy of the subpoenas, something Smith argued was necessary.

“The subpoenas that we secured, we secured with non-disclosure orders from a judge because I had grave concerns about obstruction of justice in this investigation,” Smith responded.

“Specifically with regards to Donald Trump, not only did we have the obstruction of justice that we were investigating in the classified documents case, but I was aware during the course of our investigation of the targeting of witnesses.”

Smith defends team’s work

While Republicans blasted Smith for what they perceived to be prosecutorial missteps, Democrats praised him as a paragon of integrity.

“I want you to lean in today. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You did everything right, sir,” Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell told Smith.

He then proceeded to accuse his Republican colleagues of hypocrisy, particularly after the 2021 attack on the Capitol.

“These guys are so lucky they’re not under oath because they would have to tell you what they really think of Trump,” Swalwell said, gesturing to the Republicans on the panel. “ They call him crooked. They call him cruel. They call him a scumbag. I’ve heard you all say it.”

Swalwell invited Smith to reflect on the Capitol attack and how he felt watching Trump supporters break into the legislature while lawmakers fled. At the time, Smith was in Europe on behalf of the State Department, working on the war-crimes tribunal.

“ I was shocked by it. Being in Europe and not following things as closely, I was not frankly up to speed on the events leading up to it,” Smith replied. “ I just had never seen anything like that happen in our country.”

Smith also denied that he faced any pressure from the Biden administration to come to any foregone conclusion.

“ I was given the independence to conduct my investigation,” he said.

Since being named special prosecutor, Smith has become a frequent target for criticism on the political right. Just this week, Trump himself called Smith a “sick son of a b****” who led a group of “ handpicked radical-left Marxist prosecutors”.

Over the past year, the Trump administration has largely removed the nonpartisan federal employees who were involved in the two federal investigations Smith led.

Smith used Thursday’s committee hearing to lash out at those employment decisions, accusing Trump of seeking retribution against government workers who served presidents of both parties.

“ I’m proud of the work my team did, and I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to correct false and misleading narratives about our work,” Smith told the panel.

“President Trump has sought to seek revenge against career prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff simply for having worked on these cases,” he added. “To vilify and seek retribution against these people is wrong. Those dedicated public servants are the best of us.”

President responds to Smith’s testimony

Trump, meanwhile, appeared to be watching Smith’s testimony live. In the midst of the committee’s back-and-forth dialogue, the president posted on Truth Social a message applauding Republicans for their takedowns of Smith.

“Deranged Jack Smith is being DECIMATED before Congress. It was over when they discussed his past failures and unfair prosecutions,” Trump wrote. “He destroyed many lives under the guise of legitimacy. Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”

Trump also suggested Smith should face professional penalties or even prosecution, in a message seemingly directed at the Justice Department.

“If he were a Republican, his license would be taken away from him, and far worse! Hopefully the Attorney General is looking at what he’s done,” Trump continued.

“The whole thing was a Democrat SCAM — A big price should be paid by them for what they have put our Country through!”

Trump has deployed a similar tactic in the past, using his social media account in September to direct the Justice Department to indict other critics of his actions, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey.

Smith was subpoenaed by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in early December and testified later that month in a closed-door hearing, despite his protestations that the proceedings should be public.

He is currently under a gag order barring him from divulging evidence about the classified documents case, though US District Judge Aileen Cannon indicated she would allow his report to be released on February 24. The Trump administration has appealed that decision.

As part of his prepared remarks, Smith implored his audience to defend the rule of law, regardless of which party might seek to undermine it.

“After nearly 30 years of public service, including in international settings, I have seen how the rule of law can erode,” Smith said.

“My fear is that we have seen the rule of law function in our country for so long that many of us have come to take it for granted. The rule of law is not self-executing. It depends on our collective commitment to apply it.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022567122901-1769097525.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-22 22:57:44.221238

Key takeaways

Religious leaders in Minnesota have been both publicly and quietly tending to their communities in the wake of ICE and DHS surges to the state as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

Many view this moment as a time for moral clarity and resistance. But not every congregation or denomination is responding in the same way.

There’s every reason to believe this dynamic will intensify so long as ICE continues to operate in the state.

In Chicago last year, religious leaders were pepper sprayed or shot with pepper balls. In Minneapolis this month, they’ve joined protesters in calling for restraint from federal agents and humane treatment of immigrants. And nationally, there is growing realization from some leaders of the need for moral clarity and pushback to the Trump administration.

But religious leaders and their followers aren’t all reacting in the same way to the federal government’s mass deportation surges.

A recent anti-ICE protest in St. Paul, which interrupted a service at a Southern Baptist church with alleged ties to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, grabbed national attention, sparked outrage from the religious right, and impelled the White House to promise arrests and investigations. And it also triggered responses from some Christian leaders who have been more reticent to criticize the administration.

To break down these divisions and the different ways that religious leaders in and beyond Minnesota are responding, I decided to ask an expert. Jack Jenkins is a national reporter for the Religion News Service, where he covers religion and politics. He spoke to me in between trips to Minneapolis, where multifaith leaders will be meeting this week to organize and discuss ways to tend to their communities and respond to ICE’s presence.

Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

I want to start off with a bird’s-eye view. Can you describe how religious communities, both believers and their leaders, are responding to ICE’s presence in Minnesota right now?

I spent most of my time in Minneapolis and it is much easier to find someone who is vehemently opposed to ICE than the opposite. I think for a lot of faith communities there’s an immediate concern for the people they serve.

For instance, pastors that oversee immigrant-heavy congregations. I spoke to a pastor out there; that’s a lot of stress. They are also very much organizing, but for a variety of reasons that organizing isn’t necessarily public. And it’s relatively rare for a lot of those pastors to be even as public or talking to the press because of concerns for their community. And that’s not just Christian pastors, that’s also imams because the Somali American community also has become a target of this administration.

Then there is also this piece of religious communities that are not as at risk, not as vulnerable, who’ve been very involved in pushback to ICE and to DHS agents. That runs the gamut. There’s one church in particular who helps gather food and supplies to feed large numbers of immigrant families that are afraid to leave their homes in the midst of heavy DHS presence in the region. A lot of churches are involved in that kind of effort.

There’s also more direct acts of resistance too, though, aren’t there?

Yes. I rode along with a pastor who was involved in patrolling the neighborhood where she lives, which happens to be the same neighborhood where Renee Good was killed, looking for DHS agents. In the hour and a half that I rode along with her, we spotted likely DHS agents at least twice as they were driving by being tailed by other cars that were honking horns and blowing whistles to alert the community.

Even after Renee Good was killed, there were multiple clergy that ran to the site of the killing, including that same Unitarian minister, Reverend Ashley Horan, who lives a block away, to try to provide some level of immediate response. Both that pastor and another were shot at or hit with pepper spray or pepper powder.

But when I was patrolling that area with that pastor, every other corner had somebody with a whistle around their neck looking out for DHS. Faith groups are very much a part of that.

Does there seem to be any difference in how faith leaders or communities within the state are responding compared to how voices nationally are talking about this?

“We are seeing far more faith leaders get directly involved as cities are targeted.”

Religious pushback to President Trump’s mass deportation agenda began on day one.

There was that sermon that Bishop Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, gave at the Washington National Cathedral with Trump sitting in the pews in front of her asking the president to have mercy on immigrants. That drew headlines. Religious pushback to his immigration policies hasn’t let up since. We’ve had two popes criticize Trump’s immigration policies. Pope Leo specifically addressed concerns about whether detainees in Chicago were being granted access to faith leaders.

But what’s interesting is what has happened as the administration has launched concentrated efforts in various cities. Early on, I covered a pastor in Southern California where apparent DHS agents showed up on her church property. She ran out and filmed them, demanding they leave. Similarly in California, a pastor got a call that two parishioners were being detained. He ran out and filmed the DHS agents while questioning them.

As these campaigns moved from LA to Portland to DC to Chicago to North Carolina, faith leaders have told me they were in conversation with clergy in cities targeted earlier, training them and sharing information about how to push back against ICE and DHS. When Border Patrol had an influx of agents in Charlotte, within 24 to 48 hours, hundreds of people packed churches hosting ICE watch trainings. Those trainings had actually been planned months earlier.

We are seeing far more faith leaders get directly involved as cities are targeted. Chicago was a good example, where faith leaders were arrested at one protest outside a DHS facility. That likely wouldn’t have happened without these concentrated campaigns.

I want to ask about the outrage after the ICE protest that interrupted a church service in St. Paul. What happened?

The allegation, which I cannot independently confirm, is that one of the pastors of that church is also head of a local ICE or DHS office. Old versions of the church website list him as having been involved in law enforcement. That appears to have been the impetus for that protest.

What followed was interesting. Even religious leaders critical of DHS were uneasy with the nature of that protest and said so publicly. At the same time, many were frustrated by the administration’s reaction and by conservative Christian responses, because dozens of faith groups have opposed DHS actions, have signed onto lawsuits against the administration for claims of violations of religious freedom.

In Chicago last year, viral footage showed DHS agents shooting a Presbyterian minister in the head with pepper balls. I’ve spoken to several pastors who’ve been hit with pepper spray or pepper balls. By my count, between eight and 10 pastors over the last year. That Presbyterian minister, Reverend David Black, was part of a lawsuit that won a temporary restraining order based on religious freedom claims.

Some faith leaders argue there’s a selective concern for religious liberty. One activist involved in that St. Paul protest said, paraphrasing, that houses of worship are either sanctuaries or they’re not. Who gets attention for religious freedom concerns has become a running theme.

What about Catholic leaders? I’ve seen criticism about when they do or don’t speak up, against Trump, specifically some of the most vocal Catholic bishops, like Robert Barron, a conservative leaning Catholic media mogul, and the bishop of the diocese of Winona-Rochester in Minnesota.

It’s very rare to see a bishop involved in a protest. That’s why it stood out when an auxiliary bishop in Chicago participated in a demonstration outside a DHS facility over detainees being denied access to priests. There is also a lawsuit filed by Catholic organizations, priests, and nuns on that issue.

There’s been an awkward dance where the pope has often spoken louder and faster than local bishops. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued a critical statement and video opposing the administration’s immigration policies, and the conference has sued the administration before.

Now Bishop Barron is an interesting figure. He sits on the president’s Religious Liberty Commission and has enormous influence. When concerns were raised about detainee access to priests, Barron joined in voicing concern, but later emphasized that he was not criticizing the administration.

There’s increasing tension inside the bishops’ conference. Groups of bishops are issuing statements independently on immigration. That didn’t use to happen. It reflects deeper division over how to respond to the president’s immigration agenda.

Why does that division exist?

Some bishops occupy different institutional positions. Sitting on a federal religious liberty commission is different than leading a diocese. Holding leadership within the USCCB conference matters. Since Pope Francis and now Pope Leo, the pope has often been more vocal than the conference as a whole, which creates tension. Now that there is an American pope from Chicago, those tensions are sharper.

Let me ask you about a quote from a bishop in New England. You spoke to him because he attracted attention for telling other faith leaders that the time is coming when they may have to to “put [their] bodies on the line.” What did he mean by that?

When I spoke to the Episcopal bishop of New Hampshire, who said clergy should get their “wills in order,” he told me he’s said similar things in the past around gun control advocacy. He was seconded by the Episcopal bishop of Minnesota. In Chicago, more than 200 faith leaders signed a letter referencing putting their bodies on the line.

Many reference Selma, the protests and marches of the civil rights movement, clergy who were killed there, and figures like Bonhoeffer, the Lutheran pastor who was ultimately killed for his part in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Many faith leaders I speak to say those in more privileged positions should go first because they are least vulnerable. If faith leaders aren’t doing it, they argue, then who will?

Should we expect more of this?

I’m about to return to Minneapolis for a gathering of clergy from around the country. They are explicitly likening it to a call to Selma. As long as the administration continues targeted campaigns in cities, I would expect more of this.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-2255294223.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.852336924521%2C100%2C78.295326150957&w=1200,N,,2026-01-22 23:37:43.932136

Senate Bill 4, a measure signed by Governor Greg Abbott amid rising tensions over border security, has been on hold since a federal district judge in Austin issued a preliminary injunction in February 2024, ruling it likely violates federal supremacy over immigration. At the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans Thursday, Texas Solicitor General William R. Peterson urged a full panel of federal judges to toss out the injunction, arguing that challengers like the plaintiff immigrant advocacy groups — Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and American Gateways — don’t even have the legal standing to sue. He leaned on precedents such as FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine to argue nonprofits have no standing based on indirect harms or resource diversion.

“Like Las Americas, Alliance challenged that governmental action impaired its ability to provide services and achieve its organizational mission,” Peterson said, drawing a parallel to the recent Supreme Court case on abortion pills. “The Supreme Court [said] that argument does not work.”

El Paso County joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff. Together, they argue SB4 oversteps by creating a parallel state system for immigration enforcement, potentially clashing with federal laws that govern entry, asylum and removal. Penalties under the law range from misdemeanors for first-time unauthorized entries to felonies carrying up to 20 years in prison for repeat offenses or failing to comply with removal orders.

Peterson likened the nonprofits’ claims to “spending [their] way in” by diverting resources to fight SB4, calling it self-inflicted rather than a true injury. He contrasted this with Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman , a 1982 housing discrimination case where a group had standing because defendants directly lied to its employees about apartment availability.

“Havens was an unusual case,” Peterson told the judges. “The court has been careful not to extend [its] holding.”

The en banc panel of judges peppered Peterson with questions, with Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod drawing an analogy to the abortion pill case, asking why emergency room doctors there lacked standing despite a “flood of new patients,” while immigrant groups here claim harm from SB4’s changes. U.S. Circuit Judge Stephen A. Higginson pressed on Texas’ earlier “invasion” argument under the Constitution’s state self-defense clause, which allows states to act in war-like scenarios without congressional approval.

Peterson downplayed it, saying standing was the “easiest” path to victory, but added that if the court reached the merits, federal laws don’t preempt SB4 because they are “straightforward criminal statutes” that Texas merely supplements.

Higginson also quizzed Peterson on practical conflicts, including whether Texas would drop SB4 prosecutions if suspects couldn’t be deported. Peterson said the law’s text was open to ongoing interpretation, but he highlighted a potential for foreign policy snarls — a key concern for challengers who say SB4 could strain foreign relations.

Cody Wofsy, an ACLU attorney arguing for the nonprofits and El Paso County, countered that SB4 inflicts real harm. He cited District Court findings that the law “will completely change the manner in which plaintiffs must reach counsel and represent noncitizens as they navigate the federal immigration process while in state prison.”

Wofsy argued this isn’t speculative but a direct blow to groups like Las Americas, which help migrants seek asylum.

“If your goal as the organization is trying to make sure people have access to the protections that are available,” he said, SB4 forces a total overhaul.

Wofsy invoked Arizona v. United States , where the Supreme Court in 2012 struck down parts of Arizona’s similar law for intruding on federal turf. He emphasized field preemption — the idea that immigration entry and removal are exclusively federal domains — and conflict preemption, where SB4 clashes with federal laws, including those which guarantee asylum opportunities for those entering without inspection.

“Texas is stepping in and saying, ‘actually, we agree that people should be expelled from the country with no opportunity to apply for asylum,” Wofsy told the judges. “That could not be a more straightforward supremacy clause [violation].”

The panel probed Wofsy, too. One judge asked about the “newness” of SB4, questioning if updating pamphlets or advising clients in state jails truly creates novel requirements. Another asked, “Where’s the constitutional right to file an asylum application?”

Wofsy responded that while states can cooperate with federal efforts, SB4’s unilateral arrests and deportations go too far, echoing rulings against similar laws in Iowa, Florida and Oklahoma.

Elrod returned to standing, noting the nonprofits’ reliance on the law’s novelty. Wofsy distinguished it from the* Alliance* abortion case.

“There’s nothing like that [chain of causation] here,” he said. “Obviously, SB4 is directly affecting the clients of Las Americas’ operation.”

The en banc hearing — involving all 17 active Fifth Circuit judges — follows a rollercoaster appeal. A three-judge panel initially stayed the injunction, allowing SB4 to take effect briefly in March 2024, but the full court reinstated the block.

A ruling could come in months, potentially heading to the Supreme Court.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2023/05/Fifth-Circuit-Court-of-Appeals-New-Orleans-LA2.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2026-01-22 21:39:11.790964

(WRIC) — Plans to convert a 550,000-square-foot warehouse into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facility are underway in Hanover County.

County officials said they received a letter on Jan. 22 from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirming the agency’s intent to buy and operate an ICE processing facility in Hanover. The warehouse, spanning 552,587 square feet and 43.49 acres, is located at 11525 Lakeridge Parkway in Ashland, right off Interstate 95.

According to county property records, the facility is owned by Jim Pattison Developments, a Canadian-based property management and development company. The one-story warehouse was built in 2023.

According to the letter, DHS has plans to modify the warehouse “in support of ICE operations.” These proposed modifications include construction of holding and processing spaces, addition of security equipment, upgrades in several areas like the parking lots and fencing and more.

ICE said it has asked for feedback on the project from the Department of Historic Resources (DHR) and the Hanover County Department of Planning. Several federally recognized tribes were also invited to consult on the project, including the Catawba Indian Nation, the Delaware Nation, the Pamunkey Indian Tribe and the Upper Mattaponi Tribe.

County officials said they did not initiate the project. Hanover and the tribes now have 30 days to respond to ICE.

The county’s board of supervisors will meet to discuss the notice at the next regular meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 28. Hanover said it will provide a statement on the issue after the meeting.

Richmond Mayor Danny Avula said on Jan. 22 that he understands residents are concerned about the planned ICE facility, and that he wants to remind residents of their rights and options when engaging with law enforcement agencies.

“It’s incredibly important to us that we keep this line of demarcation between local law enforcement and federal agents,” Avula said. “We’ve been very clear that we’re not participating in deportation activities, we’re not coordinating with ICE in any way, and that our local law enforcement exists to do the work of local public safety, to keep the community safe.”

Avula issued a statement on Jan. 21 reiterating his support for the immigrant community as federal agencies ramp up immigration activities across the country.

The vote was 220-207, with seven Democrats breaking with their party and voting yes. The House also passed a separate package of bills to fund other federal agencies in a broad, bipartisan vote in a bid to avert a partial government shutdown on Jan. 31.

In a twist, the House unanimously voted to add an amendment to the package repealing a law crafted by the Senate that allows eight particular Republican senators to sue the government for a minimum of $500,000 in damages after their phone records were collected as part of a Jan. 6 investigation.

House members in both parties have criticized that law since it passed as part of the deal to end the government shutdown two months ago. Thursday's vote puts the Senate in a jam, forcing it to accept repeal or shut down the government next week, when the House is scheduled to be on recess.

The House has combined the repeal amendment and six of its approved spending bills into one package. It now heads to the Senate, where Appropriations Committee leaders have signed off on the funding deal. The package represents the final tranche of the 12 spending bills Congress needs to pass every year to keep the government open, and it will fund it through the end of September.

House Republicans were in a celebratory mood after the vote, and aides were seen taking Champagne bottles to a private room just off the chamber floor.

""Despite the noise, despite our slim margins, despite the fact that most members in the House have never gone through a regular, member-driven appropriations process before, this team got it done,"" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., flanked by GOP colleagues, said at a news conference after the vote. ""The House has now passed all 12 appropriations bills, the Senate will soon do the same, and the president is going to sign them into law — what a concept.""

Some on the far left called on Democrats to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman and U.S. citizen, this month.

And in a sign of how the ICE issue has become a major political issue for Democrats, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and his top lieutenants joined rank-and-file Democrats in voting no on the DHS funding bill, saying it lacked sufficient guardrails and accountability for ICE.

Liberal Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., a lead negotiator of the broader funding deal, also voted no on the DHS bill — an unusual move for House Democrats' top appropriator.

Jeffries told reporters, “ICE is out of control and operating, in far too many ways, in a lawless fashion.” He accused ICE of “using taxpayer dollars to inflict brutality on the American people,” including by killing Good “in cold blood.”

The leaders made that decision even after DeLauro and other top Democratic appropriators — who work closely with leadership — struck the bipartisan, bicameral deal to fund the government through the 2026 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.

“You have to ask every individual member who’s going to vote the best interest of their district why they’ve chosen to vote one way or the other,” Jeffries said when he was asked about the decision over ICE.

The seven Democrats who voted in favor were: Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, both of Texas; Jared Golden of Maine; Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington; Don Davis of North Carolina; and Laura Gillen and Tom Suozzi, both of New York.

Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote no.

Some Democrats lamented that their party had not fought for ICE as hard guardrails as they had for an extension of Affordable Care Act funds, when they forced a 43-day shutdown last fall. (Eight Senate Democrats ultimately relented without ACA concessions.)

“Instead of explaining to the American people where we are and what the immigration system is and why it is broken — it is broken, but why it’s broken and what are fixes for it — we just have a bunch of Democrats who have gone around trying to be tougher on immigration than Republicans. It’s never worked,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. “You can’t out-Republican Republicans, because you’re going to lose your base and you’re not going to get any of the Republicans to come over to you.”

She said many Democrats are afraid to lean in to pro-immigrant stances after President Donald Trump used immigration in his 2024 campaign victory.

Jayapal suggested that DeLauro and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top two Democratic appropriators, negotiated DHS funding as part of the broader bill because “they wanted to get this all done. Appropriators often — they just care about getting the bills through.”

DeLauro and Murray have pointed out that Democrats did secure $20 million for body cameras for ICE personnel, as well as cuts in ICE funding for enforcement and removal operations and the number of detention beds.

While most Democrats are treading carefully on immigration, others in the party are going all out in opposition to ICE as they seek to channel the public backlash to the agency. Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., facing a fierce primary challenge from the left, has introduced the Abolish ICE Act, which would dismantle the agency.

Meanwhile, Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., this week introduced the MELT ICE Act, which would end DHS’ funding to detain or monitor immigrants, and redirect that money to health care, housing and other social services in local communities.

Neither stands a chance of passage under Republican majorities in the House and the Senate.

Murray, instead, focused on a series of victories she said Democrats scored in the wider government funding package, including funding for child care, housing assistance, mental health and Pell Grants — in many cases defeating Trump’s proposed cuts.

“There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for,” Murray said. “But the hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260121-ice-officer-vl-502p-2332ad.jpg",N,,2026-01-22 21:38:42.703985

The Trump administration’s surge in Minnesota has emerged as the focal point of the national conversation over ICE’s aggressive enforcement tactics.
Vance, too, said he was struck by the image of the child, remarking that he is a father of a 5-year-old himself.
“Many of the most viral stories of the past couple of weeks have turned out to be, at best, partially true,” Vance said.","Vance on Thursday focused on public safety and crime, and his desire to lower the temperature and support law enforcement. He acknowledged the viral videos circulating on social media could concern many Americans even as he said they often don’t tell the whole story.

“It doesn’t mean there aren’t occasionally stories, there aren’t occasionally videos that suggest that these guys or at least some of the people who work for them are not doing everything right, but very often if you look at the context of what’s going on, you understand these people are under an incredible amount of duress, an incredible amount of chaos,” Vance said, blaming “far-left agitators and local and state officials’ lack of cooperation with the federal government.”

He added that the administration wants to enforce the country’s immigration laws, while also ensuring “people in Minneapolis are able to go about their day.” But, he said, some mayors and police officers refuse to help ICE agents under assault or federal officials locate allegedly violent criminals.

Spokespeople for Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who have repeatedly called for ICE to de-escalate their aggressive tactics or even leave the city, did not respond to requests for comment.

Vance’s trip to Minneapolis comes as Republicans struggle to coalesce around a message that explains their tactics to an increasingly anxious public uneasy with armed agents patrolling communities.

The vice president billed the trip as an opportunity to better understand why Minneapolis has devolved into chaos, and comes as hundreds of military police troops remain on alert for potential deployment if President Donald Trump decides to invoke the Insurrection Act — a move that Democrats warn will spur more unrest in the city.

“Right now, we don’t think that we need that,” Vance said. “The president could change his mind, of course things could get worse, but right now we think that federal law enforcement officers can do the job of federal law enforcement.”

His remarks also followed Trump’s appearance in the White House briefing room this week, when the president said his administration needs to do more to highlight the criminals they’ve arrested in Minnesota during their enforcement crackdowns. Trump, who said he felt sorry for Good’s family, spent several minutes showing photos of immigrants who had committed violent crimes, including murder, saying people “don’t know” who ICE is detaining.

And a new POLITICO poll found that nearly half of all Americans — 49 percent — say Trump’s mass deportation campaign is too aggressive, including one in five voters who backed the president in 2024, the poll finds. And more than one in three Trump voters say that while they support the goals of the president’s mass deportation campaign, they disapprove of the way he is implementing it.

The Trump administration’s surge in Minnesota has emerged as the focal point of the national conversation over ICE’s aggressive enforcement tactics. The Trump administration has repeatedly had to explain why federal immigration agents have arrested U.S. citizens and attempt to justify agents’ actions captured in other captivating and controversial videos and photos, including one of a 5-year-old boy that circulated on the internet Thursday.

Vance, too, said he was struck by the image of the child, remarking that he is a father of a 5-year-old himself. But he said it’s a good example of the false narratives rippling through social media, and that when he did more research, he learned that the father was in the country illegally and ran from law enforcement, leaving the child behind. He said ICE stayed with the boy, though school officials claimed the boy was used as bait to lure in the father — a claim Democrats amplified and spread widely.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Good in Minnesota two weeks ago. While the Trump administration has tried to paint the 37-year-old US citizen and mother of three as a ""domestic terrorist,"" and argue that the ICE agent was acting in self-defense, videos, eyewitness accounts, and analyses of the shooting have fueled calls for Ross' arrest and prosecution.

The independent autopsy provides ""strong evidence against Agent Ross, given what it means about [his] second or third shot through [the] left-side window"" of Good's vehicle, Goodman wrote on social media. Those shots make the ""easiest criminal case of a willful killing.""

The Chicago-based law firm Romanucci & Blandin said in a Wednesday statement that it commissioned a ""highly respected and credentialed medical pathologist"" to conduct the autopsy at the request of Good's family, and the expert found:

There were three clear gunshot wound paths to Renee's body;

One gunshot wound struck the left forearm, causing soft tissue hemorrhage;

One gunshot wound traversed the right breast without penetrating major organs;

One gunshot wound entered the left side of her head near the temple and exited the right side of her head;

The breast and left forearm wounds were not immediately life-threatening; and

A fourth wound was a graze wound consistent with a firearm injury, but with no penetration.

""We believe the evidence we are gathering and will continue to gather in our investigation will suffice to prove our case,"" said lead Attorney Antonio M. Romanucci. ""The video evidence depicting the events of January 7, 2026, is clear, particularly when viewed through the standards of reasonable policing and totality of circumstances. Additionally, our legal team will continue its unwavering and proactive advocacy for Renee's life and her family.""

The firm noted that ""the results of the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office autopsy have not yet been released to the family or legal team.""

The DHS bill will be bundled alongside three other spending bills, totaling a combined $1.2 trillion in federal spending. The entire package’s passing is a significant step toward averting a government shutdown come Jan. 30.

Lawmakers in the House of Representatives voted on two separate packages on Thursday afternoon. One groups together three spending bills to fund the departments of War, Education, Labor, Transportation and Health and Human Services. The second is a standalone bill funding DHS, which includes ICE.

ILHAN OMAR VOWS 'NOT TO GIVE ICE A SINGLE CENT' IN HEATED CONGRESSIONAL FUNDING FIGHT

The DHS bill passed by a 220-207 vote with the help of seven Democrats. Only one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted in opposition. The larger package passed with much broader bipartisan support in a 341-88 vote, with 149 Democrats joining Republicans to pass it.

Most Democrats bucked the DHS funding legislation after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and other top Democrats said they were opposed to the bill due to insufficient restrictions against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

With the legislation in the rearview mirror, the House advanced the last pieces of the puzzle needed to avoid a government shutdown by the end of the month. It’s also the first time in nearly 30 years that Congress has avoided funding the government through one massive spending bill known as an ""omnibus"" or through short-term incremental funding extensions called ""continuing resolutions"" (CRs).

CONGRESS UNVEILS $1.2T SPENDING BILL AS PROGRESSIVE REVOLT BREWS OVER ICE FUNDING

With the passage of Thursday’s package, lawmakers will have advanced four small bundles of two to three of their 12 annual appropriations bills.

While some conservatives still called for the 12 bills to be passed as individual pieces of legislation, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., framed the GOP effort as a step toward returning Congress to the way the process is supposed to work on paper.

""This is a big thing,"" Johnson told Fox News Digital. ""We will be making history this week, having moved 12 [appropriations] bills through the process. A lot of people thought it would be impossible. But we stuck to it, stuck together — it’s a big thing.""

House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., echoed Johnson’s framing.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: PROGRESSIVES EYE SHUTDOWN LEVERAGE TO REIN IN ICE, VENEZUELA OPERATIONS

""We aren’t here for just another stopgap temporary fix,"" Cole said on the House floor. ""We are here to finish the job by providing full-year funding. This measure is a product of sustained engagement and serious legislation.""

If passed by the Senate, the bills will eliminate the possibility of a government shutdown for the remainder of FY 2026.

Despite eventually drawing support from Democrats, the final DHS bill faced fierce opposition from most of the party. In their view, the bill failed to shore up safeguards against ICE abuses in the wake of a fatal confrontation between an ICE agent and a woman named Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. Good was shot and killed in her car and was accused by Republicans of impeding ICE operations just before her killing.

""Kristi Noem and ICE are out of control. Taxpayer dollars are being misused to brutalize U.S. citizens, including the tragic killing of Renee Nicole Good. This extremism must end,"" Jeffries said in a statement ahead of the vote.

While the final bill does include some new safeguards — such as requiring ICE agents to adopt body cameras and to undergo additional training on how to interact with the public — Democrats said those measures fell woefully short.

HOUSE PASSES NEARLY $180B FUNDING PACKAGE AFTER CONSERVATIVE REBELLION OVER MINNESOTA FRAUD FEARS

""All the guardrails in the world don’t make sense if the administration isn’t going to follow the law and the language that we pass. Members have to take that into account,"" Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 3 Democrat in the House, said. ""Ultimately, members are going to vote [for] what’s in the best interest of their districts.""

The Senate will move on the package next week, with the deadline to avert a partial government shutdown fast approaching at the end of this month.

Senate Republicans and Democrats have reached a tenuous truce in the upper chamber after having just exited the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, with neither side inclined to once again shut the lights off in Washington, D.C.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and the bulk of his caucus, contend that the best way to rein in some of the administration’s actions, particularly with Trump’s usage of ICE, was through the government funding process.

But despite the four-bill package being constructed with a bipartisan touch, its passage in the upper chamber isn’t guaranteed.

That’s because there is a cohort of Senate Democrats frustrated with the restrictions in the DHS funding bill who contend, like their colleagues in the House, that they do not go far enough.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Committee, signaled that he would not support the package once it comes to the Senate despite being a part of negotiations on the final product.

The woman, Nekima Levy Armstrong, also appears to have darker skin in the altered image. Armstrong was one of three people arrested on Thursday in connection to a demonstration that disrupted church services in St Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday. Demonstrators alleged that one of the pastors, David Easterwood, was the acting field director of the St Paul Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office. Bondi announced the arrests on social media on Thursday morning.

The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, posted an image of Armstrong’s arrest at 10.21am on Thursday, less than an hour after Bondi’s announcement. The image shows a law enforcement agent, face blurred out, escorting Armstrong, who appears to be handcuffed. Armstrong, dressed in all black, appears to be composed in the picture.

A little more than 30 minutes later, the White House posted another image of Armstrong’s arrest in which she is crying. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reposted the image. The image posted by the White House is altered, a Guardian analysis found.

The Guardian overlaid the White House photo with the Noem photo and found that the law enforcement agents in both pictures line up exactly, confirming they are the same image. There are other similarities between the photos. An unidentified person can be seen in the same place behind the arresting agent. And the arresting agent’s arm appears to be behind Armstrong’s back in exactly the same position.

Asked whether the image had been digitally altered, the White House responded by sending a post on X from Kaelan Dorr, the deputy communications director.

“YET AGAIN to the people who feel the need to reflexively defend perpetrators of heinous crimes in our country I share with you this message: Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue. Thank you for your attention to this matter,” he said.

United States

WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed an appropriations bill that would renew ICE’s excessive budget, with no strings attached, adding to the over $170 billion in taxpayer funds already allocated for immigration enforcement in July 2025. This bill also comes amidst public fear and outrage in response to widespread abuses and violence by ICE and Border Patrol, including their continued, escalating assault on Minneapolis. Recent public opinion polling in the wake of the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis shows ICE’s approval rating is at its lowest since President Trump took office in January 2025.

If passed in the Senate, the bill would signal a stamp of approval for ICE, even as the agency continues to operate with impunity and growing disregard for constitutional rights.

In response to this news, Kate Voigt, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, had the following reaction:

“The House vote in favor of excessive funding for ICE with no meaningful accountability measures is wildly out of touch with polling that shows the majority of voters oppose ICE and Border Patrol’s attacks on our communities. The bill fails to rein in ICE and Border Patrol at a time when they are engaged in an unprecedented assault on our rights, safety, and democratic way of life. The billions in funding in this bill will only embolden ICE and CBP to continue arresting our neighbors – immigrant and U.S. citizen alike – no matter the costs to our communities, economy, and integrity of our Constitution.

“While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the Members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation. Now we need our Senators to hold firm and refuse to be complicit in fueling ICE’s reckless abuses in our communities.”

The House approved the funds with overwhelming bipartisan support – with one exception.

Just seven House Democrats voted for the bill funding the Department of Homeland Security through September, citing Immigration and Customs Enforcement tactics in Minneapolis and elsewhere.

""ICE is totally out of control using taxpayer dollars to brutalize American citizens and law-abiding immigrant families,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Thursday.

Despite the paper-thin Republican majority in the House, the measure still passed 220-207. Democrats saw the vote as an opportunity to rebuke the Trump Administration's immigration crackdown after an ICE officer shot and killed 37 year-old Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.

The Senate is expected to vote next week on these remaining funding measures as a group, forcing Democrats to choose between approving or opposing the full slate of funding, which also include billions of dollars for defense, health, transportation and housing.

Democrats had attempted to insert more stringent measures to reign in ICE, such as prohibiting the agency from deporting or detaining American citizens, banning officers from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from conducting raids at places of worship, hospitals and schools.

The Democrats who begrudgingly backed the final package said they won dedicated funds to provide body cameras for ICE officersfor the first time and allocated more money for oversight and de-escalation training. The final legislation also holds funding for ICE flat, while reducing the budget for enforcement and removal operations by $115 million and cutting detention bed capacity.

""This bill is not perfect,"" said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat whose district covers a long stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border. ""However this bill is better than the alternatives of either funding the department under a continuing resolution or shutting down the government.""

Democratic leadership concluded that these concessions were not sufficient, though they did not stop members from voting in favor of the measure.

The top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), ultimately decided that grave concerns over ICE outweighed gains in the bill, like increases for funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Transportation Security Agency and pay raises for air traffic controllers and members of the Coast Guard.

""We have to deal with what's happened in this country and we cannot turn a blind eye,"" she said. ""Make the decision based on where your heart is and what you believe in.""

Rep. Tom Cole, (R-Okla.), Appropriations Committee chair, said Democrats were ignoring most of the contents of the funding measure, which includes appropriations for a host of agencies Americans rely on.

""You're voting against the people that will help you in a hurricane or a tornado or disaster of some sort,"" Cole said. ""Why in the world should they be penalized?""

House members are departing Washington ahead of a forecasted winter storm for a week-long recess, leaving the Senate to finish the appropriations process before the deadline at the end of next week.

Funding ran out for the federal government at the end of last September. The government remained shuttered for a record 43 days as Democrats fought to renew expiring health insurance subsidies. The shutdown ended with a deal to fund three of twelve appropriations packages through September 2026, but only provided a short-term extension through Jan. 30 for the remaining funding categories.

Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she will be voting in favor of the remaining funding measures, which keep funding mostly flat and stave off the steep cuts the Trump Administration had called for.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2000x1125+0+104/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff7%2F65%2F918409a9447e9a05a236db087a99%2F021025-capitol-zayrharodriguez-4-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 21:39:03.010790

Leaked ICE memo asserts authority to enter homes without a judge’s warrant

A leaked memorandum dated May 2025 but revealed publicly on January 22, 2026 has ignited a legal firestorm around U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) practices. First reported by the Washington Post, the document instructs deportation officers that they may enter private residences to make arrests using only an administrative removal order (Form I-205), bypassing the long-standing requirement for a judicial warrant.

Civil-liberties advocates and former ICE officials say the policy runs head-on into Fourth-Amendment protections, which make the home the apex of privacy expectations. While courts have allowed warrantless entry at the U.S. border, they have traditionally required a judge’s signature to breach a residence door. The memo’s disclosure follows recent heavily publicised ICE operations in Minnesota and Texas in which agents forced entry and detained individuals later found to be U.S. citizens.

For corporate mobility programs, the stakes are high. Hundreds of thousands of employees on temporary visas live in mixed-status households; surprise home raids could chill workforce morale and raise security concerns for company-provided housing. Employment lawyers are advising HR teams to refresh “Know-Your-Rights” trainings, ensure emergency hotlines are staffed, and review privacy clauses in relocation leases.

Amid this atmosphere, VisaHQ can serve as a practical resource for employers, HR teams, and individual travelers who need up-to-date guidance on U.S. entry documentation and compliance. Through its online platform (https://www.visahq.com/united-states/), users can quickly check visa requirements, obtain application support, and receive alerts on regulatory changes—helping to minimize the risks that arise when enforcement policies shift overnight.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have demanded hearings, and litigation is expected. If courts strike down the policy, prior arrests made under the memo could also face challenges, adding further uncertainty. Until then, employers should assume increased enforcement activity and counsel foreign national staff on how to respond if agents arrive at their door.

VisaHQ's expert visas and immigration team helps individuals and companies navigate global travel, work, and residency requirements. We handle document preparation, application filings, government agencies coordination, every aspect necessary to ensure fast, compliant, and stress-free approvals.

""These initiatives pose significant legal challenges and risk straining relationships with third countries,"" Grande-Marlaska told Reuters, adding that Spain’s approach of working closely with transit nations before migrants reach Europe had proven more effective.

A different political approach to migration

Spain’s position sets it apart from many EU countries that have tightened immigration policies amid the rise of far-right political movements. The country’s center-left government has framed migration as an economic asset, promoting legal pathways for entry while seeking to reduce irregular arrivals.

That strategy appears to be delivering results. Irregular arrivals to Spain fell by 42 percent last year to around 36,000, compared with Italy’s largely unchanged figure of approximately 66,000.

""I believe that our figures and migration policy overall greatly strengthen Spain’s role in defining migratory policy within the European Union,"" Grande-Marlaska said.

Unlike many of its European neighbors, Spain's government has credited migration with helping to lead the country out of a long recession that lasted over a decade, with foreign workers making up over 14 percent of the workforce. However, it is worth noting that Spain’s migration landscape is shaped overwhelmingly by Latin American migration, a trend that researchers and official data trace over years. This might generally flatten out some of the integration and employment challenges facing migrants in other countries, who might not necessarily have a shared language and some similar cultural practices, as Spain shares with many Latin American countries.

PorCausa’s research has highlighted that a large majority of irregular migrants historically come from Central and South America -- around 77 percent in earlier analyses -- while Africans accounted for only about 9.2 percent of irregular immigrants, with Moroccans being the largest group among them.

Official Spanish figures show that as of late 2025, nearly 20 percent of the population was foreign-born, with Latin Americans representing roughly 60 percent of registered foreign residents, including large communities from Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador -- a composition that reinforces the importance of cultural and linguistic integration in Spain’s labor market and society.

Broader EU debate on migration policy

The debate comes as Denmark announced last month that a majority of EU countries support processing asylum claims in what it called ""safe third countries"" to deter arrivals. The European Parliament is also expected to move toward more restrictive migration rules later this year.

To reinforce its own approach, Spain has expanded its presence in West Africa, particularly in Mauritania, Senegal and The Gambia. Nearly 100 Spanish police officers have been deployed alongside surveillance equipment aimed at preventing dangerous sea crossings to Spain’s Canary Islands.

Analysts say regional politics are also shaping migration partnerships. Morocco has positioned itself as a key partner for European governments, including Spain and France, in exchange for financial support and diplomatic backing -- including recognition of its claims over Western Sahara, a move strongly opposed by Algeria. Observers say this rivalry has added momentum to Algiers’ own efforts to strengthen ties with international and European migration agencies.

Human rights concerns and official response

Human rights groups, however, have raised concerns about the impact of such measures. Human Rights Watch has alleged that support from Spain and the EU to West African authorities has led to abuses, particularly in Mauritania, where Spanish police were reportedly present during the detention of migrants under abusive conditions.

In an August 2025 report, Human Rights Watch documented broader concerns about European Union and Spanish cooperation with Mauritania, a key transit country on the Canary Islands route. The group alleged that Mauritanian security forces carried out violence, arbitrary arrests, inhumane detention and collective expulsions of migrants and asylum seekers between 2020 and early 2025, while continuing to receive equipment, training and funding from the EU and Spain.

The report cited Spain’s deployment of police and civil guard units to Mauritania and pointed to a 2024 EU-Mauritania migration partnership backed by a 210 million euro EU funding package, which it claimed lacked adequate human rights safeguards.

Grande-Marlaska denied any wrongdoing, saying Spain had ""not seen any illegal action or action against refugees' fundamental rights."" He added that Madrid was working to strengthen its teams in Mauritania and Senegal and to provide additional drones and vehicles to local forces.

Human Rights Watch has raised similar concerns about EU migration cooperation with Tunisia, where it says security forces have carried out collective expulsions of migrants to desert border regions, despite EU and member state funding and equipment support.

According to Spanish government data, migrant arrivals to the Canary Islands fell by 62 percent last year from record levels seen in 2024.

European Commission response and 'innovative solutions'

Speaking to InfoMigrants at the end of December, a European Commission spokesperson said the Commission had received the joint letter signed by ministers of 19 Member States ""on new and innovative solutions to counter and prevent irregular migration to Europe,"" calling it ""a welcome sign of support for our comprehensive approach to migration management.""

The spokesperson said the EU was strengthening its internal migration framework through the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum, while also focusing on cooperation with third countries.

""Externally, we work with partners to address the root causes of migration, fight migrant smuggling, strengthen readmission cooperation and promote legal pathways,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the Commission was ""stepping up work on returns and with partner countries as well as to explore innovative solutions when it comes to managing migration.""

According to the Commission, the approach is already showing results. Irregular arrivals ""are down another 26 percent this year. And our ambition is to strengthen it further,"" the spokesperson told InfoMigrants.

Return hubs and legal framework

The Commission also highlighted its proposal for a New Common European System for Returns, including a legal framework for so-called return hubs. These would apply only to people with enforceable return decisions who have ""exhausted all appeals and still found to have no legal right to remain in the EU,"" the spokesperson said.

Any such hubs, the Commission added, would have to be established through international agreements with third countries that ""respect international human rights standards, including the principle of non-refoulement,"" and would exclude unaccompanied minors and families with children.

The spokesperson also stated the framework would require an independent monitoring mechanism, clear conditions for stays in the hubs, defined procedures for what follows, and provisions for addressing any breaches of the agreements.

The spokesperson confirmed that the proposal is currently with the Council and the Parliament.

On funding, the spokesperson told InfoMigrants the Commission has proposed a new multi-annual financial framework reflected its determination ""to support our intentions and defend our interests with the necessary firepower,"" while urging EU co-legislators to reach a swift agreement on the legal framework.

As EU lawmakers weigh the Commission’s proposals, the debate over return hubs and external partnerships is likely to test the limits of how far member states are prepared to externalize migration management, amid growing calls from countries such as Denmark to revisit or sidestep existing European human rights constraints.

The Memo, signed in May 2025 by Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, asserts that administrative warrants (Form I-205 Warrants) may be relied upon as a basis to enter a place of residence and conduct immigration arrests. Notably, administrative warrants may be issued by ICE agents directly and are not issued or approved by federal district court or magistrate judges. An ICE administrative warrant must be supported by a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge (also a member of the executive branch, not a federal district court or magistrate judge). The Memo instructs ICE officers to knock and announce and “use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter” if admittance is refused.

This policy departs from past practice and raises significant constitutional and legal questions. Historically, administrative warrants were limited to supporting arrests in public places, and only warrants issued by a “neutral and detached magistrate” (a judicial warrant) could authorize ICE agents to enter nonpublic areas like residences. The memorandum itself acknowledges that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) “has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone” for this purpose, but states that DHS’s Office of General Counsel has “recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.” The Memo does recognize at least some constitutional and policy- or practice-based limitations to its position, but it is not clear whether and how even those acknowledged limitations are applied in practice.

This Memo was made public through a whistleblower complaint brought by two anonymous U.S. officials. According to that complaint, the Memo has not been formally distributed to all personnel—although it is addressed to “All ICE Personnel”—but rather apparently has been provided to select DHS officials who were then directed to verbally brief on the policy when training others.

In a court hearing today, Friends of the Everglades continued its legal fight to get public records about the Florida Division of Emergency Management’s arrangement with federal agencies to fund an ICE detention center known as “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades. The court ordered the agency to comply with Friends’ records requests within 21 days.

The failure to disclose those records violates Florida’s Government-in-the-Sunshine Act, which requires agencies to make official records available to the public. Florida and federal agencies have been withholding information about federal involvement and funding to claim they were not required to comply with federal environmental law before building the facility.

The lawsuit was filed in the Second Judicial Circuit for Leon County.

Friends of the Everglades, represented in this matter by Earthjustice and attorney Paul Schwiep of the Coffey Burlington law firm, has been requesting public records about the hastily constructed Everglades detention center, under Fla. Stat. Ch. 119, since June 24, 2025. The detention center is still operating because an August 2025 court injunction to shut it down over environmental violations was paused while the state and federal agencies appeal. The court of appeals has scheduled a hearing on that case for April 2026.

In the federal lawsuit challenging the government’s failure to account for the detention center’s environmental impacts, Florida and federal agencies claimed in September that there was no federal involvement — including any federal funding decision — that would require compliance with federal environmental law.

But new evidence produced in response to this lawsuit confirms that state and federal officials agreed as early as June, before the facility opened, that the facility would receive millions of dollars in federal funding. The Department of Homeland Security provided an official “notice of award allocation” to Florida for $608.4 million in July. These facts were not disclosed to the public, while the agencies continued to claim in court that no funding application or decision had been made. There is every reason to believe that more records exist that have yet to be produced.

“The State and the Trump Administration have taken the untenable position that Florida constructed a 5,000-bed immigration detention facility in the Everglades for federal use without any coordination or communication between them. That claim defies common sense. Documents exist, and under the Florida Constitution, they belong to Florida’s taxpayers and should be disclosed,” said attorney Paul Schwiep of Coffey Burlington.

“Alligator Alcatraz was shrouded in secrecy from the start, as the government tried to dodge its legal duty to protect the Everglades. If the state won’t voluntarily comply with public records laws about this ICE detention center, we must insist on accountability through the courts,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/everglades-detention_daniel-torok.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 18:39:10.238208

But the court has not yet ruled on whether Mr. Trump’s use of the act is itself legal.
memo rejects one of the core claims of Mr. Trump’s March Alien Enemies Act proclamation — that Mr. Maduro’s government controls the actions of Tren de Aragua.","A federal appeals court on Thursday considered whether the United States was in fact suffering an “invasion” by the “hybrid criminal state” of Venezuela, as President Trump argued in March when he invoked an 18th century war power to deport migrants.

In what is known as an “en banc” hearing, all 17 active-status judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard roughly an hour of arguments about whether the administration could lawfully use Mr. Trump’s proclamation to summarily deport immigrants it accused of having ties to a violent Venezuelan gang under the Alien Enemies Act, a 227-year-old wartime law.

In September, a three-judge panel of the court ruled 2 to 1 that Mr. Trump’s proclamation had wrongly declared an “invasion or predatory incursion,” but the full court agreed to rehear the matter this week.

Mr. Trump’s deportations under the Alien Enemies Act represent a small but highly contested fraction of the roughly 500,000 immigrants he has expelled since returning to office. The effort to put his military and national security powers in the service of his immigration agenda represents one of his most aggressive assertions of presidential power, one that has led to a prolonged clash with the courts.

When the United States is in a declared war, or faces invasion or predatory incursion, the Alien Enemies Act gives the president the power to arrest and deport citizens of hostile nations who are at least 14 years old. The Trump administration has argued that members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, have taken over apartment complexes and committed enough acts of violence that their presence amounts to an “invasion,” one that is backed by the Venezuelan state.

On Thursday, the government argued that Mr. Trump’s proclamation was “conclusive” and that the judges would be overstepping their role to second-guess its findings about what constituted an invasion.

That prompted a hypothetical question from Chief Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod, an appointee of President George W. Bush’s. “What if the proclamation said we’re having a British invasion? They’re sending all these musicians over to corrupt young minds, and the Prime Minister is in on it?” she asked, referring to the influence of the Beatles and other British rock groups on U.S. popular culture during the 1960s.

“Is there some point where it becomes preposterous on its face?” she continued. “Or is it always defer, defer, defer?”

Drew Ensign, a lawyer for the Trump administration, responded that it would be up to Congress, not the courts, to push back.

“That is a question for the political branches,” he said. “The solutions are political.”

While the law has been used by presidents only during three declared wars, Mr. Ensign noted that its text also gave the president special deportation powers if an invasion were merely “attempted” or “threatened.” He cited a case in which the Supreme Court allowed President Harry S. Truman to expel a German immigrant and Nazi propagandist using the act after World War II had already ended.

Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been representing three Venezuelan detainees and sued over the administration’s effort to use the statute, argued that Mr. Trump was misusing a wartime authority and that the courts had the power to step in.

The Alien Enemies Act, he said, was not “a blank check” from Congress “for the president to use his war powers any time he considers it valuable.” He noted the array of other tools, such as criminal prosecution and immigration courts, that the government had to deal with members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang.

The A.C.L.U. has also questioned how the administration has gone about identifying members of Tren de Aragua on the basis of their “urban street wear” and tattoos. After the administration rushed to send planeloads of deportees to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, a district court judge in Washington opened an inquiry into whether administration officials might be guilty of contempt for refusing to turn three of the planes around.

The Supreme Court has made two preliminary rulings on the Alien Enemies Act, first requiring the government to give detainees more due process and then pausing the deportations altogether while litigation over the statute’s use proceeded through the courts.

But the court has not yet ruled on whether Mr. Trump’s use of the act is itself legal. A majority of the justices said they wanted to first hear from the judges of the Fifth Circuit on that question. The hearing on Thursday offered a preview of arguments that were likely to reach the Supreme Court — the appeals court is expected to rule in the coming weeks.

Judge James C. Ho, one of the six Trump appointees on the court, said that for the purposes of the Alien Enemies Act, Mr. Trump’s proclamation was itself sufficient to satisfy the statute’s requirements, comparing it to a congressional declaration of war. “Declaration comes from Congress,” he said. “Invasion from the president.”

Since the March proclamation, Mr. Trump has taken further steps to militarize his approach to Venezuela. The United States began attacking boats, some off the coast of Venezuela, that it alleged were trafficking in drugs. Experts say the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings that violate the laws of armed conflict. In January, U.S. forces captured President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and spirited him away from Caracas in the middle of the night to be prosecuted for alleged drug trafficking and other crimes.

Other national security claims that the administration has made about Venezuela have turned out to be dubious. A declassified C.I.A. memo rejects one of the core claims of Mr. Trump’s March Alien Enemies Act proclamation — that Mr. Maduro’s government controls the actions of Tren de Aragua.

In its filings, the government argued that Mr. Maduro’s arrest made “even clearer that the president’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act was part of a high-level national security mission that exists outside the realm of judicial interference.”

That argument was discussed only briefly at Thursday’s hearing. Mr. Ensign reiterated that Tren de Aragua “is intimately tied up with the Maduro regime,” while Mr. Gelernt pointed out that Mr. Maduro’s removal from power could therefore serve to lessen the threat.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22dc-immig-pfhv/22dc-immig-pfhv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 17:38:21.371169

Divisions over DHS funding have only deepened as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, even far from the border.
Democrats were hoping to put significant guardrails on the conduct of ICE and CBP officers in the spending bill.
The compromise bill that includes funding for body cameras and additional training did not satisfy most on the Democratic side.","It was a victory for House GOP leaders, who overcame attendance issues and concerns about the overall size of the spending package within their ranks. The chamber has now passed all 12 annual appropriations bills.

Democrats demanded a standalone vote on the DHS funding bill so that their caucus could voice their objection to the Trump administration’s harsh enforcement tactics — a concern that has been amplified by recent ICE and CBP operations in Minnesota.

The bills passed Thursday rejected many of the steep funding cuts to major domestic agencies that the Trump administration sought in the White House budget request earlier this year, but neither do they offer significant funding boosts. The Department of Housing and Urban Development would see a 9 percent boost over current funding levels, totaling $84.3 billion for HUD.

The Education Department would receive $79 billion, a slight increase of $217 million above current funding. The Department of Health and Human Services would be funded at nearly $117 billion, a $210 million increase, while the Department of Labor would get $13.7 billion, a $65 million hike.

As recently as Tuesday morning, it was not clear that the two parties would be able to strike a compromise on funding DHS.

“That was really negotiated right to the end,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democratic appropriator in the House, told reporters. “And I believe that portion of the negotiation had to go to the White House, where you had Stephen Miller and somebody who was really making a determination on it.”

DeLauro was among the Democrats who voted against the bill, announcing on the floor that she had too many misgivings about the Trump administration’s immigration agenda. Only seven Democrats ended up voting for the bill; some argued that the negotiated bill was preferable to the alternatives — a stopgap measure that would give Trump a freer hand to run the department, or a shutdown that would affect key nonimmigration agencies such as TSA. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only Republican opposed.

Divisions over DHS funding have only deepened as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, even far from the border. Coming to an agreement only got harder as Democrats stepped up their criticism after two incidents in Minnesota: one where an ICE agent shot and killed U.S. citizen Renée Good and another when an ICE officer shot an undocumented man during an arrest.

Democrats were hoping to put significant guardrails on the conduct of ICE and CBP officers in the spending bill. The compromise bill that includes funding for body cameras and additional training did not satisfy most on the Democratic side.

House Democratic leaders, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, spoke out against the bill during a closed-door caucus meeting Wednesday. Leadership heard “overwhelmingly” from their caucus members ahead of the vote that this bill did not do enough to rein in ICE following recent clashes in Minnesota.

Some Democrats wanted more than guardrails, calling instead for defunding and dismantling ICE altogether.

“It has some additional provisions for body cameras, for extra training, things like that, that we think will increase the professionalism, but it’s a good, solid bill,” House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said Wednesday.

The final compromise would keep ICE funded at $10 billion for the fiscal year and would reduce the agency’s budget for enforcement and removal efforts. It would require DHS to use $20 million to outfit immigration enforcement agents with body cameras, direct the department to give officers more training on defusing conflict while interacting with the public and provide a separate $20 million for independent oversight of DHS detention facilities.

The House voted separately on the three-bill measure to fund the Pentagon and other departments through the end of September. Under a procedural measure approved earlier Thursday, those bills will be bundled together with the DHS measure and a previously approved two-bill package before being sent to the Senate.

Lawmakers voted down two amendments from conservatives before final passage. The chamber voted 291-136 to reject a proposal from Rep. Ralph Norman (R-Ark.) to eliminate all earmarks in the Labor-HHS-Education portion of the bill.

It also rejected, in a 268-164 vote, a proposal to overturn a mandate that automakers equip new vehicles with technology that prevents drunk driving. The amendment from Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Scott Perry (R-Pa.) would scrap the mandate Congress enacted in 2021 for the Department of Transportation to create those regulations.

The package also includes a scaled back attempt at reining in drug middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers and renewals for several major public health programs, along with $4.6 billion in funding for community health centers pushed for by Democrats.

The measure also includes the customary payment to the widows or heirs of lawmakers who have died in office, this time to Jill LaMalfa, widow of Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.), who died earlier this month.

The Senate is expected to consider that six-bill package when the chamber returns from recess next week.

Ignore his egomaniacal addition of his name on the Kennedy Center. Such travesties are easily undone once he’s gone.

Alas, the same can’t be said for the incalculable damage that Trump has done in just one year to the nation’s precious intangibles: its character and constitutional protections at home, and its alliances and reputation globally.

Trump’s is a perversely remarkable achievement in so short a time. The havoc he’s brought — in lost healthcare coverage, unfunded medical research to cure diseases, crackdowns on academia, higher prices from tariffs, inflated debt, erosion of the rule of law and the tarnishing of America’s credibility and leadership abroad — is worse than many, myself included, expected. The impacts of many actions will outlast him. Some losses will be irreparable.

Americans knew what cruel coarseness Trump was capable of, knew that he promised retribution and a makeover to some backward-looking imagined American greatness devoid of diversity. But what most people didn’t bank on was just how unchecked he would be by Congress or, so far, the Supreme Court — his constitutionally coequal partners, or so the founders thought.

As it happens, never has Trump’s unhinged radicalism and affinity for force been so plain and threatening as it’s been in this month of the first anniversary of his return to power, looking from Minnesota to Greenland and Venezuela.

He has Minneapolis under siege: Thousands of masked, armed agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement outnumber local police about 6 to 1. More than in Trump’s militarization of Los Angeles, Chicago and other Democratic-run cities before, in Minneapolis Americans are seeing countless witness videos of the abuses of his “mass deportations” campaign by newly created paramilitary forces. After the killing of citizen protester Renee Good, the officer who shot her three times is going uninvestigated, let alone punished, while Trump’s Department of Injustice served subpoenas on Minnesota’s governor and five other Democratic officials, accusing them of obstructing operations.

Thanks to a compliant Republican-run Congress, Trump has tens of billions more for the rest of his term to hire additional storm troopers, ill-trained in police tactics or the Constitution. Meanwhile, he repeatedly threatens to invoke the Insurrection Act, a 219-year-old law, rarely used (contrary to Trump’s claims), allowing him to deploy military troops domestically. Red states apparently need not fear.

Trump’s reshaping of domestic law enforcement to emphasize force and his politicization of the military will be hard to unwind. Civil liberties and essential respect for law enforcement and the military will be the loser if they’re not.

Consider the declaration on Sunday of Trump’s resident White House brownshirt, Stephen Miller, that “only federal officers are upholding the law” in Minnesota and that local and state police must “surrender.” Back the blue? Nah, only the ones in fatigues or plainclothes, tactical vests and masks. It’s madness. He and Trump have it backward.

One member of Minneapolis-area law enforcement, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley, on Tuesday stood flanked by other area police chiefs to say they’d all had “endless complaints about civil rights violations in our streets from U.S. citizens, including local cops — all people of color.” Bruley told of one of his off-duty officers who was stopped without cause by ICE agents, guns drawn, and asked for proof of citizenship. When the encounter grew threatening, she started to record. An agent slapped her phone away. The feds left when she finally told them she was a police officer. Said Bruley: “If it is happening to our officers, it pains me to think how many of our community members are falling victim to this every day. It has to stop.”

Yes, it does. But here’s a safe bet: It won’t. Even after Trump, that lawless attitude will persist among federal agents who were hired during his term.

Simultaneously, there are the Trump-provoked events abroad. In his grubby grab for North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally Denmark’s autonomous island of Greenland, after his takeover of Venezuela, Americans and the globe see that Trump aspires to be not the leader of the free world, like American presidents for 80 years, and not even a mere king of America, but emperor of the Western Hemisphere, unbound by alliances and international law.

Even as Trump falsely claims U.S. possession of Greenland is necessary for national and world security against China and Russia — the United States has long had the right to use Greenland for security bases and operations — he repeatedly acknowledges that he simply covets the icebound island the way he did big properties in his Manhattan real estate days. Ownership is “psychologically important for me,” he told the New York Times this month. That’s crazy.

Meanwhile, at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, allied leaders served notice that they’re fed up with mollycoddling the needy American president to maintain the U.S.-led system, notably NATO, that’s prevented a third world war.

As Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney put it in his address, “We are in the midst of a rupture.” He got a standing ovation. Meanwhile, for the first time in a century, Canada’s military has reportedly created a hypothetical model of an invasion by the United States. A model friendship between two neighbor nations, broken.

On Wednesday the man all of Davos was talking about — just as Trump likes it — arrived. The U.S. president seemed to rule out using force against Greenland and Denmark (and other NATO allies) but nonetheless played the mob boss: “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember.”

The only folks enjoying his chaos more than Trump himself are Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. Kremlin lieutenant Kirill Dmitriev reposted one of Trump’s diatribes against U.S. allies and added approvingly, “Collapse of the transatlantic union.”

Not yet, but Trump has time: 1,095 days to go. Who’s counting?

Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) is calling on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem to provide a full and detailed accounting of the legal basis for arrests made during her agency’s expanded immigration enforcement operation in Maine. In a letter to Noem on Thursday, Pingree expressed her outrage over the operation, which DHS has disturbingly dubbed “Catch of the Day.”

“While Congress has given the Department of Homeland Security the authority to enforce federal immigration law, that authority is neither unlimited nor exempt from oversight,” Pingree wrote. “Enforcement actions that result in hundreds of individuals being abducted, serious and numerous apparent violations of due process rights, and widespread fear in immigrant communities require immediate, forthright answers.”

Pingree is demanding answers about who DHS has detained and why, where they were taken, whether their due process rights are being protected, and more pressing questions the Administration has so far not answered.

Beyond the conduct of the operation itself, Pingree said DHS’s name for the operation is “dehumanizing, offensive, and wholly inappropriate for a federal law enforcement action involving real people, families, and communities.”

“Referring to human beings as something to be caught in a net reflects a disturbing disregard for human dignity and reinforces the perception that this operation was designed to intimidate and degrade rather than to uphold the law responsibly,” Pingree said. “Such language is not humorous, and not consistent with the Department’s supposed commitment to professionalism and civil rights.

The letter is available HERE and is copied below.

+++

Dear Secretary Noem,

I write to express my profound outrage regarding the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation underway in my home state of Maine. The execution of this operation and the Department’s related public messaging represent a deeply troubling breakdown in accountability, transparency, and respect for the Constitution.

While Congress has given the Department of Homeland Security the authority to enforce federal immigration law, that authority is neither unlimited nor exempt from oversight. Enforcement actions that result in hundreds of individuals being abducted, serious and numerous apparent violations of due process rights, and widespread fear in immigrant communities require immediate, forthright answers.

In my capacity as a Member of Congress, I demand a full accounting of the legal basis for arrests made during this operation.

I am requesting a comprehensive report of “Operation Catch of the Day” that answers:

How many individuals were taken into custody pursuant to valid judicial warrants signed by a federal judge or magistrate;

how many were arrested without such warrants;

of those detained, how many had prior convictions for violent or otherwise dangerous crimes; and

how is the Department defining “dangerous criminal” when publicly characterizing this operation?

Alarming reports suggest that basic due process protections may have been disregarded. Please explain, in detail:

How ICE ensured that individuals were informed of their constitutional and statutory rights at the time of arrest;

how many detainees were provided timely access to legal counsel; and

how many were placed into expedited or summary removal proceedings without a meaningful opportunity to present claims for relief under U.S. law.

The Department must also account for the immigration status of those detained:

How many individuals taken into custody possessed documentation demonstrating authorization to remain in the United States, including pending asylum claims, Temporary Protected Status, lawful permanent residency, or other valid authorization?

What verification procedures were followed prior to detention, and how many lawfully present individuals were nevertheless detained, even temporarily, as a result of this operation?

Additional transparency is necessary regarding where detainees were taken following arrest.

Where are these individuals currently being held, and under what custody classifications?

Were families, legal representatives, or local officials notified prior to or following such transfers, or were individuals effectively disappeared from their communities without notice?

I am also outraged by multiple reports from Maine indicating that ICE agents engaged in brazenly intimidating and threatening behavior toward bystanders and local residents. According to local reporting, an ICE agent drove to the home of a resident who was observing and documenting an operation that morning and told her, “This is a warning. We know you live right here.” Residents also reported that agents threatened bystanders with pepper spray, creating a climate of fear and coercion. Agents’ visible presence during a school commute alarmed parents and community members, sending a clear message that ordinary citizens could be targeted simply for lawfully observing activity. You state that you are no longer allowing American citizens to be terrorized, yet that is exactly what your agents are doing: terrorizing everyday Americans for practicing their legal rights. This, yet again, suggests your operation was never intended to be a targeted enforcement activity, but rather an attempt to sow confusion, disrupt daily life, and create a pervasive atmosphere of cruelty.

Beyond the conduct of the operation itself, I am deeply disturbed by its name, “Operation Catch of the Day.” This terminology is dehumanizing, offensive, and wholly inappropriate for a federal law enforcement action involving real people, families, and communities. Referring to human beings as something to be caught in a net reflects a disturbing disregard for human dignity and reinforces the perception that this operation was designed to intimidate and degrade rather than to uphold the law responsibly. Such language is not humorous, and not consistent with the Department’s supposed commitment to professionalism and civil rights.

Finally, I am appalled that ICE appears to have prioritized a partisan media narrative over communication with the communities and officials most directly impacted by this operation. It appears Fox News received an exclusive look into the operation, as local officials, community leaders, legal service providers, and impacted families went without basic information. This approach gives the unmistakable impression that the operation was designed to generate political optics rather than to carry out careful, targeted, and lawful immigration enforcement. If the Department is prepared to publicly showcase this operation to the press, it should have no difficulty providing Congress, and therefore the affected communities, with full transparency and accountability.

Let me be clear: congressional oversight of federal law enforcement is not discretionary, and it is not subordinate to public relations strategy. I expect full and prompt cooperation. I look forward to your written response to all questions posed above within the next 48 hours, along with all relevant documentation.

Because immigrant communities often face discrimination, harassment, and violence, ACP identifies these harms as public health issues.

ACP advocates for evidence-based policies to reduce disproportionate harm to racial and ethnic communities and upholds longstanding principles: physicians’ ethical duty to care for all, society’s obligation to ensure equitable and universal access to health care, and the need for ongoing U.S. health reform to expand access.

ACP affirms health as a human right grounded in the dignity and equality of all patients and emphasizes that strengthening patient–physician relationships and building health systems that ensure equitable access can help the United States better respect, protect, and fulfill everyone’s opportunity for health.

ACP’s Ethics Manual states that medical and professional ethics should be based on the principles that include the duty to promote good and act in the best interest of the patient; respect for patient autonomy; the duty to do no harm to the patient; and a duty to protect and foster a patient’s free, uncoerced choices.

Dear Representative:

On behalf of our 3 million members and the 50 million students they serve, we urge you to VOTE NO on the Fiscal Year 2026 funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Votes on this issue may be included in NEA’s report card for the 119th Congress.

We strongly oppose any increase in DHS funding due to the deeply troubling violations of civil liberties by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol (USBP) agents—and the lack of accountability for behavior that has traumatized students, interrupted learning, and eroded trust in public safety. Educators are seeing the impact firsthand—in increased anxiety, absenteeism, and a mounting need for counseling and mental health support.

Recently, a federal immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis resulted in the fatal shooting of Renée Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, by an ICE agent. A few miles away, federal agents assaulted and pepper-sprayed high school students on school grounds—a clear violation of the basic premise that schools are safe places to learn.

Good was killed during a large-scale DHS action that has since drawn national scrutiny and widespread protests. But her senseless death is not an isolated incident. The ongoing deployment of federal agents throughout the country has included thousands of arrests, aggressive confrontations with civilians, and racial profiling. Schools, medical facilities, places of worship, and other community spaces have been invaded. Over the last year, ICE and USBP have taken more than 325,000 people; at least 24 of them suffered gunshot wounds, resulting in six fatalities.

This is no longer solely an immigration issue. It has become a matter of human rights, civil rights, and the safety of our communities.

We urge you to oppose any increase in DHS funding that enables the continued deployment of armed and masked federal agents by a lawless agency lacking adequate oversight and accountability.

In press releases, media interviews, and in court, Trump administration officials have said repeatedly that ICE agents and their families are at risk of being doxed.","Last week, a website called ICE List went viral after its creators said that they had received what they described as a leak of personal information about nearly 4,500 Department of Homeland Security employees. However, a WIRED analysis of the site found that the database relies heavily on information that apparent DHS employees have posted publicly online themselves. This comes at a time when DHS has characterized reporting on or publicizing the identity of ICE officers as “doxing” and has threatened to prosecute perceived offenders to the fullest extent of the law.

ICE List operates as a crowdsourced wiki maintained by volunteers, who have discretion over who is added and what is marked as “verified.” Like Wikipedia, with which it has no affiliation, ICE List has category pages that feature a link to every page included in that category. Not everyone on the list is an ICE employee or even affiliated with a federal agency; former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, for example, whom DHS told the Associated Press is not an ICE agent, is included in the wiki’s “Agents” category. On his actual page, his “Agency” is listed as “N/A” and his “Role” is listed as “Propagandist; Agitator.” (Tarrio posted on X that he wished he worked for ICE, but called the ICE List page disinformation.)

Dominick Skinner, the owner of ICE List, says he does not believe that what ICE List does is doxing. ICE List doesn’t post the home addresses of identified agents, and says on its About page that “false submissions, harassment, or attempts to misuse the platform will be removed.”

“If this were doxing, then we dox ourselves by simply being present in online environments,” Skinner says, “which is just rather ridiculous.”

WIRED reviewed individuals’ pages that were included in the “Agents” category on ICE List as of January 22. Of the 1,580 pages, nearly 90 percent mention LinkedIn as a source of information, though some of the links cited now appear to be broken, and not all of the links support claims made on the wiki. (Someone listed as “active” on ICE List may, for example, have a LinkedIn depicting them as a former legal advisor for ICE. On its About page, ICE List says that “errors may occur.”) Other linked profiles lack photos and don’t appear to be very active. Some of the links, however, appear to match federal immigration agents who have previously been named in official ICE press releases and court records.

Like other LinkedIn users, those who self-identify as ICE deportation officers and other types of DHS employees are in many cases posting New Year’s resolutions, reacting to meandering motivational posts about the meaning of leadership, and letting people know they’re #opentowork.

The DHS did not respond to requests for comment.

Some individuals’ pages on the ICE List wiki cite OpenPayrolls, a searchable database of public employees’ salaries that includes some ICE employees, and SignalHire, a data broker that specializes in lead generation, as sources of information.

A spokesperson for OpenPayrolls wrote in an email that it has no affiliation with ICE List and that the ICE-related payroll records on its site were released by the US Office of Personnel Management in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The spokesperson also said, “To date, we have not received outreach from any government agency expressing concerns regarding the display of public records on our transparency website.”

SignalHire did not respond to a request for comment, but it also includes direct links to the LinkedIn profiles of people representing themselves as ICE officers on its website.

Got a Tip?Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about US immigration enforcement? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at mvarner.01.

There’s no fancy trick to finding ICE officers on LinkedIn. WIRED was able to surface hundreds of profiles belonging to people who say they are ICE employees by simply clicking the “Show more results” button on the “People” tab of ICE’s LinkedIn page. LinkedIn did not respond to a request for comment.

In press releases, media interviews, and in court, Trump administration officials have said repeatedly that ICE agents and their families are at risk of being doxed. In October, a DHS press release said that ICE officers were “facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them and their families are being doxxed and threatened online.”

Last week, DHS secretary Kristi Noem admonished a CBS News journalist interviewing her for saying the name of Jonathan Ross, a deportation officer in ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division who shot and killed Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good. Federal officials aided the identification of Ross, apparently inadvertently, by telling news outlets that the officer, who hadn’t yet been identified, had been previously dragged by a car during an immigrant enforcement operation in June. (“DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told WIRED earlier in January in response to questions about Ross. “Doxing our officers put their lives and their families in serious danger.”)

As part of their duties, ICE deportation officers are expected to support prosecutions or administrative actions by helping prepare investigative reports. Like other deportation officers, Ross has given court testimony and submitted declarations to support court cases, including the one linked to the incident during which he was dragged. Court filings that detail his appearances in court and his written declarations are a matter of public record.

Agents also have their own responsibilities when it comes to maintaining their online presence. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein has reported on US Border Patrol–branded documents that instruct employees, “Be mindful of what you post on social media.” CBP did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.

The federal government has used federal agents’ purported fear of doxing as an argument for why they should be allowed to wear masks and other facial coverings, a practice the state of Minnesota has sought to suspend in its lawsuit against Noem in her capacity as secretary of DHS.

In a declaration filed in the Minnesota lawsuit, Kyle Harvick, a CBP official who oversees Border Patrol operations for El Centro Station in California, said that “the rise of doxing, the advancement of facial recognition technologies, and the proliferation of bad actors on social media has created an unprecedented operational risk for federal law enforcement officers that necessitates appropriate protective steps such as wearing masks in public to protect their identities.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/696fa182d1a0acbc27fdeb0e/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/012025-ice-dox-ice.jpg",N,,2026-01-22 16:40:15.169825

Many of the building’s residents were rounded up and detained, regardless of citizenship status, as their homes were ransacked by members of the U.S. Border Patrol, the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies.

The Illinois Department of Human Rights announced Wednesday it would launch a new investigation of the building’s landlords. The state alleges the raid in the city’s South Shore neighborhood came after the building’s owner and management tipped off federal authorities, claiming the 130-unit apartment building was becoming overrun by members of Tren de Aragua — a violent Venezuelan gang.

Shortly after the arrests, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said two confirmed gang members were arrested. But according to reporting by ProPublica and others, no one arrested during the raid was ever charged with a crime. Federal officials have not provided evidence that any Venezuelans arrested were members of Tren de Aragua.

The complaint alleges that the building’s owner, a Wisconsin-based firm, according to state records, “sought to intimidate and coerce the building’s Black and Hispanic tenants into leaving their apartment units based on stereotypes about Venezuelan immigrants” in violation of state law prohibiting discrimination and intimidation against tenants based on their race, ancestry and national origin.

IDHR said violations also occurred when the landlords refused to carry out maintenance.

“7500 S. Shore building management blamed Venezuelan tenants for their own failure to provide needed locks and security service, as well as other needed maintenance and repairs, and perpetuated stereotypes about Venezuelan gang members to send a message that tenants born outside the United States were considered gang associates, even if they were law abiding,” IDHR’s complaint states.

The complaint adds building management began clearing units within hours of the raid that left many people’s doors off the hinges and their belongings destroyed. Residents who remained at the apartment building were forced to move out in December after the building was deemed unsafe by a Cook County judge, according to Block Club Chicago.

“These allegations of housing discrimination raise serious concerns for people struggling to maintain housing – and the communities that have been profiled and relentlessly targeted by the federal government during its violent immigration enforcement operations,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement.

The owners could be subject to civil penalties if found in violation of the Illinois Human Rights Act.

Details of the raid

The raid was part of Operation Midway Blitz, the federal immigration enforcement campaign that began in the Chicago area in early September and lasted through mid-November.

The raid was the subject of a video produced by DHS and set to dramatic music that shows federal agents led by Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino searching through apartments and detaining residents in vans. Homeland Security’s social media caption read: “To every criminal illegal alien: Darkness is no longer your ally. We will find you.”

Thirty-seven immigrants were arrested and several were eventually deported, according to ProPublica, while U.S. citizens were also detained with zip ties for several hours during the raid.

In raw video footage released by NewsNation, Bovino said U.S. citizens living at the apartment were temporarily detained because it was a “high-risk operation” and “no rights have been violated today.”

Several residents said in interviews with ProPublica that agents hit them in the head with guns, pushed them up against the wall, and threw flash-bangs into their units. Others said their children were taken outside with few clothes on.

The state additionally alleges that people were separated based on their race, ancestry and national origin, and children were among those detained with zip ties. Federal agents also did not honor any requests to see warrants or speak to attorneys.

Apartment issues

The apartment had issues before the feds arrived, however. The building failed 18 of 21 inspections over the last two years and the city sued its owners in 2024 for failing to maintain the building, according to ProPublica.

ProPublica also reported several tenants described positive relationships with Venezuelans who lived there, many of whom arrived in Chicago in 2022 during an influx of migrants to Texas’ southern border who were sent to Chicago via bus.

But other residents describe issues with guns, parties, drugs and prostitution by both citizens and immigrants. Conditions in the building were also generally abhorrent with water leaks, trash piling up, bug and rodent infestations and damaged walls, according to ProPublica.

The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act would establish clear standards on the use of force by federal immigration enforcement, limit the use of face coverings and specific crowd control equipment, and require the use of body and vehicle cameras during enforcement activities.","Washington, D.C.—Today, Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49) released the following statement on his vote against the Fiscal Year 2026 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill due to the exclusion of guardrails on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from the legislation:

“Congress cannot continue writing blank checks to any federal agency that fails to meet basic standards of accountability, transparency, and respect for constitutional rights.

“I want to be clear at the outset: the vast majority of law enforcement officers, including our local police and sheriffs, serve their communities with professionalism and integrity. They earn public trust every day by following clear rules, respecting due process, and accepting oversight.

“Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for ICE under the direction of DHS Secretary Noem. Multiple documented incidents have raised serious concerns about ICE’s conduct. We have seen repeated cases involving excessive force, mistaken detentions, and enforcement actions affecting U.S. citizens and lawful residents. At the same time, ICE continues to operate with fewer safeguards than most major law-enforcement agencies.

“In response, we have proposed straightforward, commonsense accountability measures: requiring judicial warrants for home entries, setting clear limits on use of force, mandating body-worn cameras, and explicitly prohibiting the detention or deportation of U.S. citizens. These are standard professional practices across law enforcement and are rooted in the Constitution.

“Every one of these protections was rejected by Republican leadership.

“ICE was created after September 11 to strengthen national security and public safety. That mission depends on public trust and strict adherence to the law. When an agency operates without adequate guardrails or oversight, it undermines both.

“DHS is responsible for other critical functions that I fully support, including disaster response, port and border security, and cybersecurity. But Congress also has a duty to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not used to excuse misconduct or evade accountability.

“My position is simple: federal agencies must follow the law and operate transparently. Until meaningful safeguards are in place, I will not support funding that enables ICE to operate without proper oversight.

“Congress must insist on reforms that restore professionalism, accountability, and public confidence. This legislation does not do that, and that is why I oppose it.”

Background About Rep. Levin’s Actions on Immigration

Since entering Congress in 2019, Rep. Levin has taken action to reform our nation’s immigration system, protect communities, and strengthen border security. His actions include signing four amicus briefs regarding birthright citizenship and data sharing for immigration enforcement to push back against the Trump Administration; conducting oversight visits to ICE detention facilities; and championing bills that would tackle our nation’s immigration and border challenges. Those bills include:

The Dignity Act is a comprehensive bipartisan immigration package that would expand enforcement at the border in exchange for increased pathways to legal status and substantive changes to our nation’s immigration system.

The American Dream and Promise Act would provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders, and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) recipients. It would establish a permanent resident status for Dreamers for 10 years and grant individuals with TPS or DED a full lawful permanent resident status.

The American Families United Act would provide the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security the power to prevent the deportation of certain individuals if such a deportation would result in hardship for that individual’s American citizen spouse, parent, or child.

The Farm Workforce Modernization Act would improve the H-2A visa program, establish a new Certified Agricultural Worker (CAW) status, and provide support for farmers and farmworkers.

The National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants (NO BAN) Act would strengthen the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion and limits the broad executive authority to issue future travel bans.

The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act would make comprehensive reforms to our nation's immigration detention system by ending the use of private, for-profit detention facilities, prohibiting the practice of detaining families, repealing mandatory detention, and increasing oversight, accountability, and transparency of the immigration detention system.

The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act would establish clear standards on the use of force by federal immigration enforcement, limit the use of face coverings and specific crowd control equipment, and require the use of body and vehicle cameras during enforcement activities.

Trump’s persistent desire to acquire Greenland raises the question of how international law treats the acquisition of another State’s territory, whether by force or by other means.
Finally, U.S. threats to acquire Greenland by conquest already constitute a violation of international law.
Cession: When it is Permissible Under International Law While international law prohibits the acquisition of territory through force, it does not prohibit territorial change altogether.
This is so under both domestic Danish law and international law.","In early 2026, President Donald Trump renewed a goal he had set in his first term, acquiring Greenland, a territory over which Denmark exercises sovereignty. Trump escalated the situation by threatening to use force to do so, warning that he was “going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not,” and that while he “would like to make a deal the easy way, … if we don’t do it the easy way we’re going to do it the hard way.” He later told reporters aboard Air Force One, “one way or the other, we’re going to have Greenland.” The president’s threats have also taken the form of Truth Social posts showing him planting the U.S. flag on Greenland and chairing a meeting with European leaders, with a map in the background showing Canada and Greenland covered in an American flag. Taking a less bellicose stance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has informed members of Congress that the United States is trying to buy Greenland, although he, too, has at times left the door open to using force.

As we’ll explain below, the acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force is not only prohibited under international law binding on the United States, but that rule forms the backbone of the entire international system and constitutes the major achievement of the post-WWII era. While sometimes violated, to be sure, naked threats to acquire territory by threat or use of force without even purporting to justify that action under international law (say, as an act of self-defense) are rightfully seen as belonging to a bygone era that was less secure and less prosperous than one in which sovereignty and stability are valued over sheer military might – and perhaps most important, in which self-determination is recognized as a foundational right, while imperial conquest is outlawed.

Danish Prime Minister Frederiksen has responded to the threats by unambiguously stating, “Greenland is not for sale. Greenland is not Danish. Greenland belongs to Greenland.” Other leaders have echoed her stance. For instance, seven European heads of State issued a joint statement on Greenland that noted “Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.” They emphasized that all NATO Allies were obligated to “uphold the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.” European Union leaders likewise pointed to “territorial integrity and sovereignty,” confirming the “EU stands in full sovereignty with Denmark and the people of Greenland.” In the hope of deterring a U.S. attack, a number of European States also deployed small troop contingents to Greenland as a military “trip wire” (although framed as an “exercise” to avoid unduly escalating the situation), one that would presumably draw those countries into any conflict between Denmark and the United States.

Whether because the world rallied around the bedrock principles of international law in response to Trump’s threats or for other reasons, on Jan. 21 at Davos, the president shifted towards appearing to rule out the use of force – “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force” – while still insisting that the United States must acquire the territory, stating:

We want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won’t give it. We’ve never asked for anything else … So, they have a choice. You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember.

Following a subsequent meeting with NATO Secretary General Rutte, Trump announced on Truth Social that they “formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,” one that, “if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations.”

At this point, it is unclear whether Trump is willing to shelve his desire to acquire Greenland, including the use of force to achieve that objective, if he finds the European response unsatisfactory. The track record thus far demonstrates that his hunger for Greenland is something he has difficulty shaking. Moreover, as Trump’s positions frequently vacillate, little is certain at this point. The risk of cleaving the transatlantic alliance, which has benefitted the Western world (and globally, all who value global goods like open shipping lanes) for over 75 years, remains real.

Trump’s persistent desire to acquire Greenland raises the question of how international law treats the acquisition of another State’s territory, whether by force or by other means. There are two general methods. The first is “conquest,” which the Permanent Court of International Justice defined in 1933 as “a cause of loss of sovereignty when there is war between two States and by reason of the defeat of one of them sovereignty over territory passes from the loser to the victorious State” (Eastern Greenland case, page 47). Note that war, or “international armed conflict” as it is labeled today, can be triggered even by an unopposed occupation of the territory of one State by another (Common Article 2, Geneva Conventions I-IV), as could be the case if U.S. troops seized a remote area of Greenland. The second is “cession,” which denotes the consensual transfer of territory from one State to another. Historical U.S. examples include the purchase of Louisiana from France in 1803 or Alaska from Russia in 1867.

In this essay, we examine these modalities of territorial acquisition in general and with respect to Greenland. Before doing so, however, it is essential to emphasize that Denmark unquestionably exercises sovereignty over Greenland. As one of us (Mike) explained in a previous Just Security article, Greenland

enjoys broad autonomy under Denmark’s 2009 Self-Governing Act, especially in internal affairs. However, that autonomy is an issue of domestic law. Under international law, Denmark undeniably enjoys sovereignty over Greenland. In 1933, the Permanent Court of Justice, in a dispute between Norway and Denmark, found that Greenland was a Danish possession (Legal Status of Eastern Greenland). Subsequently, Denmark listed Greenland as a non-self-governing territory under Chapter XI of the UN Charter. In 1953, Greenland was incorporated into Denmark through domestic legislation, a status recognized by the General Assembly the following year (GA Res. 849). The United States has long acknowledged Danish sovereignty over Greenland (see, e.g., the 1916 Secretary of State declaration, the 1951 Defense of Greenland Agreement, and the 2004 Amendment to the Defense of Greenland Agreement).

Therefore, military action into Greenland would be a use of force against Denmark, which would destroy the NATO alliance from within. Cessation would also be a matter to be negotiated at the inter-State level between Denmark and the United States, although, as will be explained, the people of Greenland would have a say in any such negotiations.

Conquest and its Prohibition

Although international law historically recognized that title to territory could be transferred through conquest, as we referenced above, that premise was put to rest in the 20th century (see here). Most notably, Article 2(4) of the UN Charter addresses the issue head-on:

“All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations” (emphasis added).

It is a prohibition that undeniably reflects customary international law (Paramilitary Activities, ¶ 190).

A U.S. military operation, even if unopposed, to seize Greenland would qualify as a violation on both grounds. First, the mere presence of U.S. troops (or even operations into Greenland from outside the territory, such as missile strikes) would amount to a violation of Danish territoriality. Second, the annexation of Greenland as a result of a U.S. use of force (or any alteration in the territory’s governance) would violate 2(4) on the basis that the force was directed at Denmark’s political independence.

During the decolonization that followed the immediate post-WWII period, the international community reaffirmed this prohibition in several forms. In 1970, the General Assembly, in its Declaration on Friendly Relations (adopted by consensus), famously confirmed the prohibition: “The territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force” (GA Res. 2625(XXV)). Along the same lines, the 1974 Definition of Aggression Resolution states that “no territorial acquisition or special advantage resulting from aggression is or shall be recognized as lawful” (art. 5(3)). And in its 1986 Frontier Dispute judgment, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) emphasized that even where States have effective control over territory, they do not acquire title if that control was secured through unlawful means (¶ 63).

Since any forcible action against Greenland would trigger an international armed conflict between the United States and Greenland, the prohibition on the permanent transfer of territory during occupation under the law of armed conflict is also relevant. Specifically, Article 47 of Geneva Convention IV provides that the rights of protected persons in occupied territory are inviolable. It is a fundamental LOAC rule that occupation of territory is temporary and is not permitted to morph into annexation. Another way of stating this prohibition is that the rights of protected persons in occupied territory would be violated if title to that territory changed hands. The ICRC’s Commentary to Article 47 explains,

The law of occupation is predicated on the temporary and provisional nature of occupation; it thus follows that the Occupying Power does not acquire sovereign rights over the occupied territory.

Although international humanitarian law does not expressly prohibit the forcible acquisition of territory, any such annexation during an ongoing occupation would inescapably lead to violations of that law. For example, the annexed territory would, by definition, be subject to the legislation of the annexing State, which would exceed the limited scope of the Occupying Power’s legislative competences in the occupied territory. More broadly, unilateral annexation would entail the exercise of sovereignty over the occupied territory and purport to create a permanent situation that would eliminate the status quo ante. In the ICRC’s view, both of those consequences are inconsistent with the law of occupation’s underlying principles, namely that the Occupying Power does not acquire any sovereignty over the occupied territory and that it must maintain the status quo ante.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Law of War Manual makes the same point: “Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the GC by any change introduced…by any annexation…of the whole or part of the occupied territory” (§ 11.6.3).

The prohibition on acquiring territory through conquest is likewise supported in case law. Perhaps most notably, in United States v. Ulrich Griefelt et al. (the RuSHA case), the U.S. Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held that

Any purported annexation of territories of a foreign nation, occurring during the time of war and while opposing armies were still in the field, we hold to be invalid and ineffective. Such territory never became a part of the Reich but merely remained under German military control by virtue of belligerent occupancy.

Treaties to which the United States is not Party, but that represent further testament to the extent to which international law condemns the acquisition of territory by conquest, are in accord. The 1977 Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions expressly provides that “occupation of a territory… shall [not] affect the legal status of the territory in question” (art. 4). Moreover, under international criminal law, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court criminalizes “annexation by the use of force of the territory of another State or part thereof” (art. 8bis(2)(a)).

The Duty of Non-Recognition of Annexed Territory

Importantly, even if the United States seized Greenland and annexed it, other States would be prohibited from treating the territory as if it were the United States. As noted in the Declaration on Friendly Relations, “No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.” In its Wall advisory opinion, the ICJ recognized this statement as reflecting customary international law (¶ 87, implemented at ¶ 159).

In Paramilitary Activities, the ICJ noted that the United States has long recognized the principle of non-recognition of territory unlawfully seized. In doing so, it pointed to the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States (¶ 189). Article 11 provides,

The contracting states definitely establish as the rule of their conduct the precise obligation not to recognize territorial acquisitions or special advantages which have been obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measure. The territory of a state is inviolable and may not be the object of military occupation nor of other measures of force imposed by another state directly or indirectly or for any motive whatever even temporarily.

As the United States is Party to the Montevideo Convention, other Parties (States in Central and South America) would be prohibited by the terms of the treaty from recognizing the unlawful U.S. acquisition of Greenland. More significantly, as noted by the ICJ, Article 11 reflects the customary law principle of non-recognition, which would bind all States from recognizing the U.S. action.

UN organs, with the support of the United States, have likewise emphasized the obligation not to recognize unlawful seizure of territory. For instance, in 1990, following Iraq’s annexation of occupied Kuwait, the Security Council “call[ed] upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize that annexation and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as an indirect recognition of the annexation” (SC Res. 662). Following Russia’s unlawful annexation of Crimea in 2014 following its occupation and a sham referendum, the General Assembly did the same, “Calling upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol on the basis of the above-mentioned referendum and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status” (GA Res. 68/262).

What about Self-Defense?

Might the seizure of Greenland be justified on U.S. security grounds? After all, administration officials have suggested that taking control of Greenland is necessary in the face of threats by Russia and China in the Arctic (we must note here that working within NATO to address any security concerns would be a lawful, legitimate, and likely effective course). While self-defense is a “circumstance precluding the wrongfulness” of a use of force under Article 51 of the UN Charter (Articles on State Responsibility, art. 21), forcible defensive actions may only be directed at a State that has engaged in an “armed attack” against the State taking them. Accordingly, even if U.S. security were threatened by Russia or China moving into the Arctic, that fact would not, in itself, legally justify any action against Denmark.

It should not be lost in the current discussion that Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted to employ pretextual self-defense claims in his war of attempted conquest against Ukraine. That attempt remains ongoing but has been resoundingly and repeatedly rejected by the United States, the United Nations General Assembly (but not the Security Council due to Russia’s veto), the European Union, notable international law associations, and scholars. Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea (undertaken largely without firing shots in 2014) and parts of Ukraine’s Donbas region are not recognized by the majority of States, owing to their obligation not to do so as described above.

Solely for the sake of discussion, let us assume that a State had a valid self-defense claim, was involved in an international armed conflict as a result of an armed attack against it, and attempted to lay claim to territory it seized during that conflict. This raises the question of whether a State legitimately acting in self-defense may acquire territory. In this regard, the International Law Commission (ILC) has concluded, correctly in our view, that “States may not recognize as lawful, for example, a unilateral acquisition of territory procured by the use of force, even if the use of force was arguably lawful” (Third Report on State Responsibility, page 107). This conclusion also bears on the earlier point regarding other States’ recognition of territory acquired through conquest.

Finally, U.S. threats to acquire Greenland by conquest already constitute a violation of international law. As we explained in an earlier Just Security article, “Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary law prohibit States from even threatening to use force unlawfully if the threats are communicated to the threatened State, coercive, and capable of being carried out.” Administration officials have repeatedly indicated a willingness to resort to force if Denmark does not cede Greenland to the United States (though they have see-sawed on these threats in recent days, it is difficult to discount them once issued so repeatedly and forcefully by a sitting head of State); the coercive nature of the threats is evidenced by the alarm they have caused in Europe, Canada, and beyond; and the U.S. military has recently demonstrated its substantial capacity to employ significant force abroad. Perhaps most notably, the U.S. willingness to attack Venezuela in clear violation of international law renders the threats against Greenland much more credible than they would otherwise be.

Cession: When it is Permissible Under International Law

While international law prohibits the acquisition of territory through force, it does not prohibit territorial change altogether. Instead, a sovereign may transfer parts of its territory by cession, usually through a treaty or other international agreement. When that happens, the transferring State relinquishes title, and the acquiring State assumes sovereignty. The practice is quite rare in the contemporary (post-WWII) era and is generally limited to minor border adjustments or resolving longstanding ambiguities in inherited post-colonial borders. Such exchanges typically result in compensation or form part of a broader political agreement.

Contemporary international law subjects such transfers to two conditions. First, the State making the transfer must give its consent freely; it cannot be coerced. Second, the transfer must be consistent with the right of self-determination under international human rights law.

Lack of coercion: Since any transfer would likely be concluded by treaty, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties establishes the framework for determining the validity of consent to transfer. Article 52 of the instrument provides, “A treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.”

That is precisely what has happened in the case of U.S. demands for Greenland. It is almost unimaginable that the threat of U.S. military action would not have significantly influenced any agreement by Denmark to transfer Greenland, or portions of the territory, to the United States. Although the United States is not a Party to the Vienna Convention, Article 52 is well recognized as reflecting customary law (Fisheries Jurisdiction, ¶ 24).

Self-determination: The second condition is that a transfer be consistent with the principle of self-determination. Article 1(2) of the UN Charter recognizes the principle, which also plays a prominent role in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). They provide, in identical Articles 1(1), “All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.” The United States is Party to the ICCPR (but not the ICESCR).

The ICJ has applied the principle of self-determination in the context of territory on multiple occasions. In its Western Sahara advisory opinion, the Court “confirm[ed] and emphasize[d] that the application of the right of self-determination requires a free and genuine expression of the will of the peoples concerned” (¶ 54). Similarly, in its East Timor judgment, the Court labeled the assertion that the right is of erga omnes character (owed to all States) as “irreproachable,” and called self-determination “one of the essential principles of contemporary international law” (¶ 29).

Denial of a right to participate in the decision to transfer territory is a paradigmatic example of a violation of the right to self-determination. It is a right that applies to “peoples.” That term is not well-defined in international law. However, as a general matter, it refers to a significantly large group of individuals who share common characteristics such as history, language, ethnicity, or religion; have a connection to the territory concerned; and consider themselves a distinct community.

Despite the imprecision of the term “peoples,” it is clear that it applies to Greenland’s inhabitants. Indeed, the 2009 Act on Greenland Self-Government expressly recognizes that “the people of Greenland is a people pursuant to international law with the right of self-determination” (pmbl). Importantly, this is a legally binding acknowledgment that the people of Greenland have a right to participate in determining their political status. Moreover, the act provides, “Decisions regarding Greenland’s independence shall be taken by the people of Greenland ((art. 21(1)). If they enjoy a legal right under Danish law to decide on independence, they surely enjoy no lesser right vis-à-vis the transfer of sovereignty.

Moreover, as noted, Greenland was formerly a non-self-governing territory and has been moving towards independence. As such, it is subject to the decolonization principles outlined in the 1960 UN General Assembly Resolution 1541(XV). Those principles emphasize the “freely expressed wishes” of a territory’s people concerning the status of the territory upon which they reside. In its Chagos advisory opinion, the ICJ observed that although the resolution was formally a recommendation, “it has a declaratory character with regard to the right to self-determination as a customary norm” (¶ 152). That means under international law, the principle of self-determination prohibits the transfer of sovereignty over a territory inhabited by a “people” without their consent.

Finally, the Declaration on Friendly Relations repeatedly highlights the right of self-determination. It provides,

By virtue of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, all peoples have the right freely to determine, without external interference, their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development, and every State has the duty to respect this right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.

The establishment of a sovereign and independent State, the free association or integration with an independent State or the emergence into any other political status freely determined by a people constitute modes of implementing the right of self-determination by that people.

The Declaration then ties together the right of self-determination and the use of force: “Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of their right to self-determination and freedom and independence.” The principle would apply equally to the threat of the use of force that might, in turn, lead to non-consensual cession.

As discussed above with respect to territory secured by force, other States would be barred from recognizing the transfer of Greenland through cession, given that it was secured by coercion and failed to respect the right of the Greenlandic people to self-determination. The ILC has acknowledged as much in Article 41(2) of its Articles on State Responsibility: “No State shall recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach within the meaning of article 40, nor render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation.”

As a consequence of the above, any transfer of Greenland to the United States would require the freely given consent of both Denmark and Greenland. This is so under both domestic Danish law and international law. That consent is unlikely.

Finally, if Denmark were to cede Greenland to the United States in violation of the right of self-determination of the Greenlandic people, under principles of the law of State responsibility, the United States arguably would also shoulder responsibility for that “internationally wrongful act.” Article 18 of the Articles on State Responsibility, which in significant part reflects customary international law binding on the United States, provides that “a State which coerces another State to commit an act is internationally responsible for that act if: (a) the act would, but for the coercion, be an internationally wrongful act of the coerced state; and (b) the coercing State does so with the knowledge of the circumstances of the act.” Threats of the use of force clearly qualify as coercive (“conduct which forces the will of the coerced State”) according to the Article’s commentary. Moreover, as the right of self- determination is customary, all States shoulder the obligation. And, of course, the United States is aware of the circumstances, for it is their author.

Concluding Thoughts

It is indisputable that, under current circumstances, any acquisition of Greenland by the United States–whether by force or through coerced agreement–would directly violate fundamental principles of international law, including the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the principle of non-recognition of territorial acquisition by such means, the invalidity of agreements secured through coercion, and the right of the people of Greenland to self-determination. These are insurmountable legal barriers to the legitimacy of such an action. Accordingly, consistent with long-standing legal norms, any U.S. effort to claim sovereignty over Greenland, or parts of the territory, must continue to be met with international non-recognition and political condemnation.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257168580.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 17:38:25.407366

The hotline, managed by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, received significantly more calls than usual on Tuesday, Ruben Torres, the organization’s advocacy and policy manager, told NBC News.
Reports of immigration enforcement activity around Portland on Tuesday morning led to a brief lockout at two high schools in the area, with the school not allowing anyone to come into the buildings.
The lockouts were lifted after it was determined that the activity did not affect the schools, according to NBC affiliate WCSH of Portland.
DHS did not say how long the ongoing operation across the state of Maine would last.","A new immigration enforcement operation is underway in Maine, the Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin did not say how many arrests were made during the first day of the Maine operation, dubbed “Catch of the Day.” In a statement Wednesday, she only said DHS “arrested illegal aliens convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child.”

On Tuesday, as residents in the cities of Portland and Lewiston noticed a heightened presence of immigration officers in their communities, they began posting videos on social media and calling a community hotline to report the sightings and some arrests.

The hotline, managed by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, received significantly more calls than usual on Tuesday, Ruben Torres, the organization’s advocacy and policy manager, told NBC News.

On Tuesday evening, the advocacy group said they were only able to verify two of the reports because they didn’t have enough volunteers who could quickly verify all the reports from the hotline.

The two verified incidents “seemed to be very targeted,” Torres said. In one, officers appeared to be serving a warrant to someone at a house, and in the other officers arrested one individual outside a Home Depot.

Reports of immigration enforcement activity around Portland on Tuesday morning led to a brief lockout at two high schools in the area, with the school not allowing anyone to come into the buildings. The lockouts were lifted after it was determined that the activity did not affect the schools, according to NBC affiliate WCSH of Portland.

“It really is a very stressful moment in time,” Torres said. “We have people who are unsure if it’s safe to go out in public because they may get picked up.”

This has resulted in a rise in residents volunteering to do grocery runs and drive children with immigrant parents to school, according to Torres. He added that many families who have relatives with different types of immigration status are also having difficult conversations about who would care for their children if their parents get picked up by ICE.

“Those aren’t fun conversations to be having, especially with one’s children,” Torres said. “They’re laying down the emergency planning at home.”

Immigrants make up about 4% of Maine’s population (compared to 14% nationally) and nearly half of them have been in the U.S. for over 20 years, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute. Almost half of Maine’s immigrants are from Asia and Europe, 20% from Africa, 19% from Northern America — mainly Canada — and about 10% from Latin America and the Caribbean.

DHS did not say how long the ongoing operation across the state of Maine would last. They stated they’re “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.”

Patricia Hyde, deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Fox News in an exclusive interview that they planned on targeting about 1,400 individuals in Maine.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills made statements last week anticipating the incoming ICE activity.

Mills said she directed the Maine State Police “to work closely with local law enforcement, as necessary, to provide whatever support is needed in advance of and during any potential federal operations.”

“I want any federal agents — and the president of the United States — to know what this state stands for. We stand for the rule of law. We oppose violence. We stand for peaceful protest,” the governor said. “We stand for compassion, for integrity and justice.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251211-ice-badge-gk-49c6c7.jpg",N,,2026-01-22 15:37:44.086919

It was unclear if the agents had arrested anyone.

A woman who gave her name only as Olivia said she lives nearby, and responded when she heard that ICE agents were in the area.

""Came out, walked around, found them. There are a lot of other folks out here with whistles and bull horns trying to alert folks,"" she said.

Olivia said she witnessed an immigration arrest earlier that day just up the block.

""I just feel like it's insane that this is allowed to be happening,"" she said.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed Wednesday it is undertaking an enforcement operation in Maine, dubbed ""Catch of the Day,"" saying it was focused on the ""worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.""

The agency cited four examples of arrests, including one person convicted of an OUI.

An agency spokesperson did not immediately answer questions about how many people had been arrested, but Fox News reported Tuesday that officials said nearly 50 people had been detained so far.

Cassandra Linton, who runs a company that supports adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities, said one of the people arrested on the first day of the surge was one of her employees.

""One of our house managers had stepped out to go grab something to eat. He was on the phone with his friend when he was detained by ICE,"" she said.

Linton said the man, originally from Burundi, has a pending asylum claim and was working at her company's Saco location. According to ICE's online detainee locator system, he's currently being held at an ICE facility in Massachusetts.

Linton said the vast majority of her direct support professional employees are immigrants, who go through multiple rounds of screening.

""It's just a huge mess of fear for people who are here legally,"" Linton said. Her employee who was detained, she said ""is legal. We've done all the checks. He is not a criminal, and he's just gone.""

Now, Linton said, she's also concerned about what would happen to her clients, some of whom are nonverbal, should their caregiver be arrested while they're out in public.

Another arrest was an Angolan man living in Portland taken into custody Tuesday during a routine ICE check-in in Scarborough, according to court records. Those filings say the man's family is not sure where he is, but believes he's still being held in Scarborough, and a federal judge has ordered ICE not to transfer him out of state.

The enforcement surge has elicited mixed reactions from Maine's elected leaders at the state and federal level, including from state Senate President Mattie Daughtry, a Democrat, who said the name of the operation itself is reason for concern.

""Language that compares people to fish to be caught and hauled in is dehumanizing and dangerous,"" Daughtry said in a statement, adding that ""The rhetoric being used feels less like law enforcement and more like people are being hunted for sport.""

Local officials in the cities experiencing what appears to be the brunt of ICE activity, including Portland, Lewiston, and Westbrook, were unified in their condemnation, with some of the harshest words coming from Portland city councilor Wes Pelletier.

""I want to be really clear, this is a war of terror that's being waged on our city by the federal government,"" Pelletier said. Speaking alongside fellow councilors at a press conference on Wednesday, he rejected the need for increased ICE activity in the first place.

""No one asked the federal government to come here,"" Pelletier said. ""This is one of the safest cities in the country.""

And as some immigrant advocacy groups warned families to stay home and Portland school officials report a drop in attendance districtwide, Pelletier said some locals are forming networks to deliver food and other necessities to those sheltering in place.

While the duration and intensity of the crackdown remain to be seen, ICE deputy assistant director Patricia Hyde told Fox News earlier this week her agency has a target list of 1,400 people in Maine. That would represent about 10% of all immigrants without permanent legal status in the state, according to figures from the Migration Policy Institute.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fd214da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3024+0+408/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2Ff4%2F5631b7d14c8d944db215c571f291%2F01212026-icefieldoffice-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 17:38:13.004635

A five-year-old boy, wearing a blue tuque with droopy ears, carrying a Spider-Man backpack, was reportedly apprehended by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in his Columbia Heights driveway on Tuesday.

Liam Ramos was essentially used ""as bait,"" said Columbia Heights Public Schools (CHPS) Superintendent Zena Stenvik in a statement Wednesday.

""Another adult living in the home was outside and begged the agents to let them take care of the small child, but was refused,"" Stenvik said.

""Instead, the agent took the child out of the still-running vehicle, led him to the door, and directed him to knock on the door, asking to be let in, in order to see if anyone else was home — essentially using a five-year-old as bait.""

Liam and his father are being held at the Dilley Immigration Processing Centre in Dilley, Texas, the family’s lawyer Marc Prokosch told CBC News Thursday.

Columbia Heights is a suburb of Minneapolis, where a massive immigration crackdown has seen thousands of officers sent into the Twin Cities. It's become a powder keg of protests and aggression ever since an ICE shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, a mother of three.

Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBC News in a written statement that ICE didn't target Liam Ramos, but was conducting a ""targeted operation"" to arrest his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who she described as an ""illegal alien from Ecuador.""

“ICE did NOT target a child,"" McLaughlin said.

""As agents approached the driver Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot — abandoning his child. For the child's safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias.""

She added that parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, ""or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates.""

The statement did not say what happened to Liam after the arrest or where he is now. The Department of Homeland Security has yet to respond to CBC's requests for that information.

'Why detain a 5-year-old?'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz criticized Liam's reported detainment, writing on X Thursday that ""this campaign of retribution has got to stop.""

Minnesotans want safety. They want freedom. They want what’s best for our kids. Masked agents snatching preschoolers off the street and sending them to Texas detention centers serves none of those purposes,"" he wrote.

The photos of Liam, which were provided to CBC News by Columbia Heights Public Schools, were taken by ""known and confirmed community members who were on site,"" school officials said.

Twenty minutes after Liam and his father were taken, an older son in middle school arrived home ""to a missing dad, a missing little brother and a terrified mother,"" said Stenvik .

""Why detain a five-year-old? You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal,"" she said.

In her statement, Stenvik said the family ""is following U.S. legal parameters"" and has an active asylum case with no order of deportation.

""I have viewed the legal paperwork with my own eyes,"" she said.

According to the school district officials, three other children have also recently been detained by ICE.

On Tuesday, a 17-year-old high school student was taken by armed and masked agents while on their way to school, with no parents present, Stenvik said. Two weeks ago, a 10-year-old and her mother were arrested on their way to school, she added.

""By the end of the school day, they were already in a detention centre in Texas, and they are still there,"" Stenvik said.

She also said that last week, another 17-year-old high school student in the district was detained.

According to the ICE Flight Monitor, a project by the organization Human Rights First, ICE used Willow Run as a stop for flights, usually to major immigration detention hubs in the South, regularly throughout the second half of 2025.

Steve Conn, an activist with the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, called the airport “a key link in the chain, down to Texas or Louisiana overnight” during the public board meeting.

Chad Newton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Wayne County Airport Authority, said in his report to the board during the meeting that he is often asked if the airport authority has any contracts with ICE.

“Our response remains, the Wayne County Airport Authority does not have any involvement in the agreements between airlines and their partners, including federal agencies, as long as those agreements meet legal and safety requirements,” he said.

But many present did not find Newton’s argument about the authority’s lack of responsibility convincing, arguing that no activity takes place at an airport without approval and urging those in attendance to use their power to stop such activity and make it more difficult for it to continue.

George Washington, a lawyer in the Detroit area, similarly said that, while the board may not have made the decision to initially permit ICE to use the airport, they should be acting on it now.

“We know that this board did not set up that system that was set up by the Trump administration, but we know also that by allowing Willow Run to do this, you’re collaborating with this system,” he said. “You’re collaborating because you said nothing about it, because even till this day, you will not condemn it. You will simply say it’s not our problem.”

Colorado airline operates flights for ICE, records show

Washington also criticized the board for not mentioning the usage of the airport by ICE during the main portion of the meeting, a significant portion of which focused on upgrades to restrooms in the McNamara terminal.

Airlines conducting ICE flights out of Willow Run include Colorado-based Key Lime Air, as well as Eastern Air Express. Photos shared with Michigan Advance by the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, showed people with shackled wrists boarding a plane at Willow Run. Additionally, online records from the Federal Aviation Administration show that the tail number on one of the aircraft seen in the pictures matched up with a plane operated by Eastern Air Express.

A report by Human Rights First said there were 88 outbound ICE flights from Willow Run in 2025. According to the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, the planes then usually flew “from Ypsilanti to major immigration detention hubs in the South, such as Alexandria, Louisiana,” where ICE maintains a deportation staging facility operated by the GEO Group. That’s the same corporation which operates the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, ICE’s largest detention facility in the Midwest.

Jessi Hanson-DeFusco, an assistant professor of public policy at Lawrence Technological University, also shared the potential risks for airports like Willow Run that are being used by ICE.

“Anyone who comes through one of our airports who has damages, suffers personal injuries, property damage, or was wrongfully detained, or has medical malpractice, will legally be able to sue any partners or entities, including counties like Wayne County for having taken part in that,” she said. “Are you sure, out of the thousands of people who have come through our airports, that each individual has received due process and was detained legally, lawfully and ethically?”

Conn also urged the broader Wayne County community to protest the use of the airport by ICE, adding that he urged airport employees to shut the airport down if needed.

“You must act. You must do everything you can, and you can do so much,” he said. “When this is such an injustice and so critical to the future of our country, we must take action. We must do everything we can.”

The new Mexico City policy decision deepens the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown on DEI efforts, and rights for transgender and nonbinary people.
Fox News Digital first reported on the news of the extended Mexico City policy.","The Trump administration will block organizations from using US foreign aid to subsidize diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and what the administration calls “gender ideology”. The new policy will affect about $30bn in foreign assistance.

The decision, confirmed to the Guardian by a state department spokesperson on Thursday morning, marks a dramatic expansion of the so-called “Mexico City policy”, which blocks non-US non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from receiving some forms of US funding if they provide abortion-related services or advocate for abortion rights overseas. Now, that policy – which abortion rights supporters call the “global gag rule” – will also apply to international organizations and US-based NGOs operating abroad.

“President Trump continues to deliver on his promise to end woke foreign assistance,” the state department spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

First introduced by Ronald Reagan in 1984, the Mexico City policy is typically rescinded whenever a Democrat wins the White House and reinstated whenever a Republican wins. Usually, the policy applies only to dollars that have been set aside for family planning assistance, which account for about $600m worth of aid.

However, during his first administration, Trump extended the policy to apply to all global health assistance, changing the terms of an estimated $7.3bn worth of aid. The effect was ruinous, advocacy groups say. MSI Reproductive Choices, a global family planning organization that works in nearly 40 countries, has said that the policy led it to shutter services in countries like Uganda, Madagascar and Nepal.

“You then end up with a whole generation of women and girls who are growing up in this stigmatized environment with no notion of where to go to find out information about their health and their rights,” said Sarah Shaw, Marie Stopes International’s associate director of advocacy. “Any effort to expand this is even more catastrophic.”

After returning to power in January 2025, Trump reinstated his version of theMexico City policy. Now, his newest expansion of the policy will affect not only money earmarked for global health aid, but vast swathes of foreign assistance.

It will also block groups from using foreign assistance funds to pay for what the state department spokesperson called “abortion as a form of family planning”. The spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for clarification about how that requirement differs from past versions of the Mexico City policy.

The new Mexico City policy decision deepens the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown on DEI efforts, and rights for transgender and nonbinary people. (“Gender ideology” is the rightwing shorthand for the idea that gender is fluid and trans and non-binary people exist.) Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders that generally ended the federal government’s support for DEI initiatives, proclaimed that there are only two genders and attacked government efforts to recognize trans people. His administration has also undermined research that worked to further racial and gender equity.

Fox News Digital first reported on the news of the extended Mexico City policy.

The state department will officially release three final rules outlining the new policy on Friday, when thousands of anti-abortion activists are expected to gather in Washington DC for an annual gathering called the March for Life.

Without those final rules, experts say, it is difficult to know how the policy will work or how many people it will affect.

“The impacts could be endless.

The analysis covers 12 key areas, including threats to electoral integrity, due process, and assembly, mirroring global patterns where leaders manipulate elections to consolidate power.

“We are all witness to a dangerous trajectory under President Trump that has already led to a human rights emergency. By shredding norms and concentrating power, the administration is trying to make it impossible for anyone to hold them accountable,”

warns Paul O’Brien in the report, underscoring how these policies close civic space and undermine the rule of law. Trump's aggressive policies on voting access, despite constitutional limits on federal overreach, amplify these risks, with courts blocking several initiatives amid lawsuits from 19 states.

Authoritarian Playbook Targets Electoral Integrity

Trump's policies echo Amnesty's warnings by targeting mail-in voting and voter data, aiming to reshape the electoral landscape before November 2026. A March 2025 executive order cut federal funding to states accepting mail ballots postmarked after Election Day—except for military and overseas voters—sparking legal challenges and judicial blocks. This policy, defended as essential for “maintaining clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards for ensuring free and fair elections” by Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K.

Dhillon, affects roughly 48 million voters who used mail-in options in 2024. Federal judges, including U.S. District Judge John Chun, have ruled to

“restore the proper balance of power among the Executive Branch, the states, and Congress envisioned by the Framers,”

halting provisions like proof-of-citizenship requirements on voter forms. The Justice Department's requests for state voter data, including Social Security numbers, further heighten Human Rights concerns over privacy and potential disenfranchisement of naturalized citizens.

These moves dismantle anti-corruption safeguards and scapegoat migrants, aligning with Amnesty's documentation of broader Human Rights rollbacks, such as expanded surveillance and weakened non-discrimination protections. Local officials like Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows note a lack of federal support, while Minnesota's Steve Simon urges vigilance against efforts to

“extend his legal authority and interfere with state elections”.

With the U.S. exiting the Human Rights Council, WHO, Paris Agreement, and 63 other bodies last month, international Human Rights norms face parallel erosion, intensifying domestic vulnerabilities.

Midterm Redistricting and Power Consolidation

Mid-decade redistricting emerges as a pivotal policy tool, with Republican-led states like Texas, Missouri, Florida, Indiana, and Louisiana redrawing maps to gain GOP seats and protect Trump's agenda on immigration and fiscal issues.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott's August 2025 map targets five additional Republican seats, while Missouri faces voter referendums on changes approved by Governor Mike Kehoe. Democrats counter in California, Virginia, Maryland, and Illinois, but these battles risk entrenching power imbalances that Amnesty flags as authoritarian consolidation. Trump's floated idea of canceling elections—later retracted—paired with insistence on voter ID, reflects skepticism rooted in 2020 claims, as he stated to the House Republican Conference:

“The election was rigged... You ought to have voter ID. You ought to insist on it... When somebody says, ‘No, we don’t want voter ID,’ that means they’re crooked,”

without evidence.

Legal expert Derek Clinger affirms “the Constitution gives no authority to the president to do any of these things,” yet the push persists, threatening Human Rights like voting access ahead of midterms that will test Republican unity. Ohio's repeal of mail-in grace periods exemplifies state-level victories for these policies, potentially disenfranchising millions and mirroring global tactics of electoral manipulation.

Amnesty ties this to risks for journalists, protestors, students, and voters, especially after federal responses like deploying 300 Marines to Los Angeles protests.

Assault on Mail-In Voting and Election Infrastructure

Restrictions on mail-in ballots form the core of Trump's policy assault, with an August 2025 threat of a nationwide ban stalling due to legal barriers, shifting focus to congressional allies. A Supreme Court review on late-postmarked ballots looms, critical for the 30% of voters relying on this method. The March executive order also disrupted voting machines and froze funding for the Election Assistance Commission, facing injunctions.

Election security falters as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency lost one-third of its staff by June 2025 amid initiative halts, while the DOJ's Civil Rights Division pivots from protections to roll ""cleaning,"" misapplying laws per recent rulings.

Local officials prepare for federal interference, eroding public trust in a process vital for Human Rights like free expression and assembly. Amnesty's report links these policies to a human rights emergency, urging Congress, states, and international actors to intervene, much like French President Emmanuel Macron's Davos critique of a “lawless world” with “imperial ambitions”. PolitiFact notes stalled promises like paper ballots only, highlighting executive limits, but the cumulative effect risks democratic backslide.

International Echoes and Domestic Stakes

Global exits from Human Rights bodies compound domestic policies, isolating the U.S. as midterms approach and amplifying Amnesty's 12-point warnings on freedoms from expression to asylum rights. Federalizing the National Guard for protests foreshadows suppression of voting dissent, while detaining activists like Mahmoud Khalil signals chilling effects. Election law expert Richard Hasen warns of efforts to reshape democracy, with Republicans eyeing sustained control through DOJ probes, infrastructure cuts, and gerrymandering.

Human Rights Watch echoes ""sliding towards authoritarianism"" via institutional capture, as these policies challenge separation of powers. If unchecked, they could imperil core Human Rights, transforming midterms into a referendum on America's democratic resilience one year post-inauguration.

Broader Implications for 2026 and Beyond

Trump's multifaceted policy arsenal—executive orders, redistricting, and security disruptions—tests constitutional guardrails, potentially entrenching power beyond 2026.

President Barack Obama refused to enforce a substantial part of the immigration law.
And why should successors follow the law if some presidents exempt whole classes of people from the immigration law, what is to prevent others from not enforcing the tax code against other classes?
When a president of Party A refuses to enforce a law that his party’s activists dislike, he angers members of Party B.
The administration has signaled its determination to enforce immigration laws by taking steps that no administration has before and that are likely to provoke political backlash.","Stuck in traffic last fall as a “No Kings” rally in Chicago brought our car to a standstill, I listened to a familiar charge: President Donald Trump was acting like an unrestrained monarch. Many signs and chants particularly complained about his immigration policy: his detaining and deporting immigrants who had no legal right to remain in the country. But whatever one thinks of the soundness of our immigration laws, it is clear that they are, indeed, laws. What struck me was how strange it was that enforcing a duly enacted law can plausibly be confused with royal prerogative.

Enforcing immigration law is not an act of political discretion on the part of a king but an obligation of a republican executive simply implementing congressional directives. Such legal restrictions may be debatable, but it is up to Congress to change them. And it is likely that some of Trump’s agents are not complying with constitutional requirements in rounding up illegal immigrants, but that would be a complaint primarily about methods, not their objectives.

Far from reflecting a regal prerogative, the enforcement posture now inspiring such protests was partly a response to an earlier presidential claim of one. President Barack Obama refused to enforce a substantial part of the immigration law. First, he bestowed “lawful presence” on children who were in the country illegally and then extended these rights to their parents. Indeed, lawful presence went beyond a mere failure to enforce and granted permission to work in the country. Congress has consistently failed to pass laws incorporating these judgments despite their being proposed on many occasions. Texas v. United States indeed dismissed a challenge to the Biden administration’s deportation priorities. But the decision did not validate the Obama administration’s DACA or DAPA programs. While DACA and DAPA affirmatively conferred lawful presence and eligibility for benefits on large, predefined classes, the Biden guidance challenged in Texas largely involved prioritizing whom to arrest and remove. The Court emphasized that such prioritization reflects necessary enforcement triage discretion given resource constraints. But the majority underscored limits on discretion, warning against executive “abdication” and distinguishing non-enforcement from programs that alter legal status that were at the core of the Obama program.

As it happens, the Constitution specifically memorializes the republic’s prohibition of the prerogative of abdication. It requires that the president “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed”—a direct repudiation of executive dispensing power. Thus, the Clause was designed at least in part to deny the president the so-called dispensing power by which English monarchs had sometimes claimed the authority to refuse to enforce the laws of Parliament.

The Framers were particularly familiar with James II’s refusal to enforce the Test Act by exempting army officers from the prohibition on Catholics holding office. It was one of the acts that sparked the “Glorious Revolution” that dispensed with James. After James had fled in 1688, the English Bill of Rights abolished this executive prerogative “as it hath been assumed and exercised of late.” This history was the background against which the Take Care Clause was written.

The exemption of certain classes of people from the enforcement of the immigration laws has not been the only act in recent times when our recent presidents have brazenly refused to enforce the law. For instance, the Affordable Care Act established explicit statutory deadlines for the enforcement of the individual mandate. Yet the Obama administration delayed enforcement, no doubt for fear of the political backlash it would cause. As with immigration, this was not case-by-case discretion but a categorical, prospective refusal to enforce a statute.

Another instance of disdain for carrying out the law emerged in the Biden administration’s treatment of federal student loans. Even after the formal pandemic emergency had ended, the executive continued to suspend loan repayment and interest accrual. While the student loan statute required both repayment and accrual, the Biden administration abrogated these requirements. Again, this cannot be analogized to case-by-case prosecutorial discretion. The suspension was not limited to hardship cases or individualized determinations of inability to pay. It applied to tens of millions of borrowers instead. As with immigration and health care, the executive substituted its own policy judgment for that of the legislature by failing to enforce statutory obligations in a comprehensive manner.

More recently, President Donald Trump refused to enforce legislation requiring that TikTok either give up its Chinese ownership or be banned in the United States. The statute used mandatory language, leaving no room for presidential discretion once statutory predicates were satisfied.

These unilateral actions by presidents in both parties are lawless and dangerous. First, they suggest that policy imperatives can trump the law. It is the bedrock of limited government that respect for the deliberate process of law is more important than any passing policy interest. Such disrespect for the law by the chief magistrate can ripple outward. Why should citizens respect the law when the president does not? And why should successors follow the law if some presidents exempt whole classes of people from the immigration law, what is to prevent others from not enforcing the tax code against other classes?

Second, it makes the president more important than Congress. Most obviously, it makes his judgments more decisive than those of past Congresses, because he can make their enactments a dead letter.

Third, it sidelines the current Congress. In each of these cases, Congress could have acted. It has the authority to pass immigration reform. It could have delayed the Affordable Care Act or amended it so that a delay was not needed. It could have modified the prohibition on TikTok to give President Trump time to pursue his “art of the deal.”

But the consequences are worse than the distortion of the formal separation of powers. When the president declines to enforce the law against a class of persons or a company, the law ceases to provide the legal framework that stabilizes a republic. Law becomes just a temporary policy choice, reversible by the next executive who disagrees with it.

Presidential elections then become much more momentous and divisive because they determine far more than how the president may exercise discretion within the interstices of the law. Instead, they determine whether laws, laboriously created by the bicameral process and reflecting bipartisan buy-in, will be enforced at all.

Moreover, the law loses its settlement function when the executive can dispense with it. Many issues, like immigration, elicit intense disagreement. The way to resolve disagreements in a pluralist society is for Congress to reach a compromise that best represents conflicting interests. Non-enforcement destroys that compromise and makes people less interested in compromise in the future.

Moreover, non-enforcement abets political polarization. When a president of Party A refuses to enforce a law that his party’s activists dislike, he angers members of Party B. Such polarization can lead to two unfortunate reactions. First, when a president of Party B takes power, he may also choose not to enforce laws his party dislikes, but that Party A supports. Second, he may resort to drastic enforcement measures of the law that the president of Party A refused to enforce, using unreasonable means to signal his disagreement with the non-enforcement of the previous administration.

It is at least plausible that this dynamic explains the Trump administration’s unusually aggressive approach to immigration enforcement. The administration has signaled its determination to enforce immigration laws by taking steps that no administration has before and that are likely to provoke political backlash.

One problem with policing the fundamental issue of non-enforcement is that citizens often lack standing to complain. The failure to enforce the law injures the public at large but does not give rise to the kind of concrete grievance necessary to bring a suit in federal court. Moreover, courts are concerned about issuing injunctions to enforce the law because the executive does need some enforcement discretion to reflect priorities and budgetary constraints. Courts are not well-positioned to evaluate these. As a result, while the Take Care Clause is both an essential and express restraint on the executive, current limitations on standing render judicial enforcement implausible in many circumstances. And in our closely divided political era, it is unlikely that Congress will have the substantial majorities necessary to discipline the president for particular failures to enforce.

But perhaps Congress could include as an appropriation rider that would defund parts of the executive office of the president for failure to enforce, so long as it would take effect after the next presidential election. In that way, Congress could restore the stickiness of its legislative judgments under a veil of ignorance as to which party would be immediately disadvantaged.

Americans should, of course, be vigilant when enforcement of the law threatens individual constitutional rights. But another corrosive danger lies in the president’s failure to enforce the law. It weakens Congress. It dissolves the law’s settlement function. It accelerates political polarization by teaching citizens that legality depends on electoral outcomes. A republic cannot endure if its laws bind only when the executive approves of them.",https://lawliberty.org/app/uploads/2026/01/No_Kings_protest_in_Chicago_145043-1060x596.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:57:33.991883

WATCH LIVE: Jack Smith testifies about Trump criminal investigations

House Democratic leaders Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Rep. Pete Aguilar of California announced in a closed-door meeting that they would oppose the Homeland Security bill. Their members are demanding a forceful stand in response to the Republican president's immigration crackdown, most recently centered in the Minneapolis area, where more than 2,000 officers are stationed and where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot Renee Good, a mother of three.

""There's a very big concern about ICE being out of control,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democratic lawmaker on the House Appropriations Committee.

But Democrats have few good options to express their opposition. DeLauro said that passing a continuing resolution to fund Homeland Security at current levels for the remainder of the budget year would cede spending decisions to Trump. There's also little appetite for another shutdown, even if it would affect only a portion of the federal government.

""There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for. But the hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.

This year's Homeland Security bill holds spending for ICE roughly flat from the prior year. It also restricts the ability of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to unilaterally shift funding and allocate federal dollars as she sees fit.

""It's not everything we wanted. We wanted more oversight. But, look, Democrats don't control the House. We don't control the Senate or the White House. But we were able to add some oversight over Homeland,"" said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, a member of the Appropriations panel. He said he intends to vote for the bill.

Democrats voice their concerns privately and publicly

But most Democrats who emerged from the closed-door caucus meeting on Wednesday had a different view.

""I never support lawless operations,"" said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio.

""If it's the status quo, I'm a no,"" said Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill.

DeLauro, along with Cuellar, made a presentation about the bill to House Democrats during their closed-door meeting. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said she told her colleagues why she thought it was a mistake. Others who spoke up agreed, she said.

""I think this is just a really horrific time, and people understand what's at stake,"" Jayapal said. ""We can't treat this like it's anything else. Our eyes are not lying to us.""

She explained that extra money for body cameras and other changes was insufficient. The bill provides $20 million that must be used for ICE and Customs and Border Protection officers when conducting enforcement actions.

She said she told her colleagues, ""Nobody should try to sell this as an improvement. It's not an improvement.""

But some Democrats in key swing districts will likely be seeing campaign ads targeting them if they vote against the Homeland Security funding bill. The campaign arm for House Republicans issued press releases on Wednesday targeting some 20 Democrats, saying they ""will do anything to appease the 'defund ICE' crowd even if it means risking national security.""

Meanwhile, liberal advocacy groups are also applying pressure, saying Congress must take clear, immediate action to rein in the department.

""The DHS bill that was released clearly falls far short, and should be roundly rejected. Every Democrat should be voting against this funding bill, and Democratic leadership in both chambers should be actively whipping their caucus in opposition,"" said Andrew O'Neill, national advocacy director for the group Indivisible.

Republicans are confident the bill will pass

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was optimistic that the funding bills would pass, including the Homeland Security measure. He can afford a few defections given the GOP's razor-thin majority.

""All we do is win,"" Johnson said.

The overall funding package before the House on Thursday contains roughly $1.2 trillion in spending. About two-thirds of that will go to the Defense Department.

Other departments that are funded through the package include Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. Most federal spending is unaffected by the yearly battles in Congress, most notably Social Security and Medicare.

Staying connected with constituents is essential as we work to confront these challenges and prepare for what lies ahead.”

In his opening remarks, Sherman reviewed the Trump administration’s record over the past year, focusing on aggressive immigration enforcement policies that have torn families apart and spread fear throughout Los Angeles–area communities and beyond. He addressed widespread outrage following the fatal shooting of Minnesota mother Renee Good by an ICE officer earlier this month, calling the incident a tragic consequence of an administration that has abandoned oversight and restraint. Sherman said he will refuse to vote for any federal appropriations bill that funds ICE and noted that he has joined efforts to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whom he has described as the “worst cabinet secretary in U.S. history.”

Sherman also discussed what he described as reckless actions by the Trump administration on the world stage, including repeated threats and rhetoric regarding Greenland. As a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Sherman warned that such actions undermine U.S. alliances as well as global peace and security. Congressman Sherman highlighted his recent unveiling of the “Hands Off Greenland” Act to block any unilateral effort to seize or acquire the territory.

Throughout the event, Sherman answered questions and addressed concerns about immigration enforcement, rising costs, threats to civil rights, and the broader direction of the country under the Trump administration. He reiterated his commitment to holding the administration accountable and continuing to fight for the values and interests of California’s communities.

The Town Hall also featured California Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo, representing the Northwest San Fernando Valley in the 40th Assembly District, as a special guest. Assemblymember Schiavo discussed priorities in the State Legislature and the importance of coordination between state and federal leaders to protect families and uphold fundamental rights during a period of political uncertainty.

During the Town Hall, Sherman requested input from residents by asking a series of survey questions about their thoughts and concerns.

The results of the survey questions are as follows:

- Should the House of Representatives debate articles of impeachment against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem?

Yes: 91%

No: 6%

Unsure: 4%

-Do you support or oppose President Trump’s proposal to annex Greenland, including by force?

Support: 7%

Oppose: 88%

Unsure: 6%

-Should your Member of Congress vote in favor of any new funding for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)?

Yes, fund ICE: 4%

No, vote against ICE funding: 93%

Unsure: 3%

Chad Newton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Wayne County Airport Authority, said in his report to the board during the meeting that he is often asked if the airport authority has any contracts with ICE.

According to the ICE Flight Monitor, a project by the organization Human Rights First, ICE used Willow Run as a stop for flights, usually to major immigration detention hubs in the South, regularly throughout the second half of 2025.

Steve Conn, an activist with the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, called the airport “a key link in the chain, down to Texas or Louisiana overnight” during the public board meeting.

Chad Newton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Wayne County Airport Authority, said in his report to the board during the meeting that he is often asked if the airport authority has any contracts with ICE.

“Our response remains, the Wayne County Airport Authority does not have any involvement in the agreements between airlines and their partners, including federal agencies, as long as those agreements meet legal and safety requirements,” he said.

But many present did not find Newton’s argument about the authority’s lack of responsibility convincing, arguing that no activity takes place at an airport without approval and urging those in attendance to use their power to stop such activity and make it more difficult for it to continue.

George Washington, a lawyer in the Detroit area, similarly said that, while the board may not have made the decision to initially permit ICE to use the airport, they should be acting on it now.

“We know that this board did not set up that system that was set up by the Trump administration, but we know also that by allowing Willow Run to do this, you’re collaborating with this system,” he said. “You’re collaborating because you said nothing about it, because even till this day, you will not condemn it. You will simply say it’s not our problem.”

Colorado airline operates flights for ICE, records show

Washington also criticized the board for not mentioning the usage of the airport by ICE during the main portion of the meeting, a significant portion of which focused on upgrades to restrooms in the McNamara terminal.

Airlines conducting ICE flights out of Willow Run include Colorado-based Key Lime Air, as well as Eastern Air Express. Photos shared with Michigan Advance by the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, showed people with shackled wrists boarding a plane at Willow Run. Additionally, online records from the Federal Aviation Administration show that the tail number on one of the aircraft seen in the pictures matched up with a plane operated by Eastern Air Express.

A report by Human Rights First said there were 88 outbound ICE flights from Willow Run in 2025. According to the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, the planes then usually flew “from Ypsilanti to major immigration detention hubs in the South, such as Alexandria, Louisiana,” where ICE maintains a deportation staging facility operated by the GEO Group. That’s the same corporation which operates the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, ICE’s largest detention facility in the Midwest.

Jessi Hanson-DeFusco, an assistant professor of public policy at Lawrence Technological University, also shared the potential risks for airports like Willow Run that are being used by ICE.

“Anyone who comes through one of our airports who has damages, suffers personal injuries, property damage, or was wrongfully detained, or has medical malpractice, will legally be able to sue any partners or entities, including counties like Wayne County for having taken part in that,” she said. “Are you sure, out of the thousands of people who have come through our airports, that each individual has received due process and was detained legally, lawfully and ethically?”

Conn also urged the broader Wayne County community to protest the use of the airport by ICE, adding that he urged airport employees to shut the airport down if needed.

“You must act. You must do everything you can, and you can do so much,” he said. “When this is such an injustice and so critical to the future of our country, we must take action. We must do everything we can.”

“This is a threat to you and you and me, every single person here,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-21-at-3.14.21-PM-scaled-e1769033638717-2048x1144.png,N,,2026-01-22 16:40:06.626991

We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,” Bellows said.
“The Trump administration has deployed ICE agents to Portland, Lewiston, and possibly other Maine communities.","The Trump administration is now targeting its mass deportation campaign on Maine, a state with relatively few residents in the United States illegally but notable African refugee communities in its largest cities.

The Department of Homeland Security named the operation “Catch of the Day,” an apparent play on Maine’s seafood industry, just as it has done for other enforcement surges, like “Patriot” in Massachusetts, “Metro Surge” in Minnesota and “Midway Blitz” in Chicago.

Reports of a surge in immigration arrests have struck fear in immigrant communities of Portland and Lewiston and prompted backlash from Gov. Janet Mills and other Democrats, including a refusal to help ICE agents obscure the identity of their vehicles by issuing undercover license plates.

Mills said Wednesday that if federal agents have warrants, they should show them, but if they are separating parents who have committed no crime from their children, they are ""only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors.”

Citizens have formed networks to alert neighborhoods to the presence of ICE agents and bring food to immigrants in their homes. Portland's superintendent said the school district is developing an online learning plan for its students — more than half of whom aren't white. Many businesses have posted signs saying ICE agents aren't welcome.

“While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach,” Portland Mayor Mark Dion said at a news conference Wednesday where he was joined by other local officials. “This council doesn’t stand apart from our immigrant communities, we stand with them.”

Portland and Lewiston have thousands of residents of African descent. Somali immigration accelerated in the early 2000s, leaving Maine with one of the nation’s highest Somali populations.

Now the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents is causing great anxiety in Portland, said city council member Pious Ali, a native of Ghana.

“Our schools have seen about a quarter of immigrants not showing up,” Ali said, and many fear going to work as well: “There are immigrants who live here who work in our hospitals, they work in our schools, they work in our hotels, they are part of the economic engine of our community.”

ICE agents don't need to spread trauma by smashing doors and windows, he said: ""The federal government has the ability to contact these people without unleashing fear into our communities.”

Portland Councilor Wes Pelletier said business owners, teachers and college students have shared information to alert neighborhoods to enforcement activity, while volunteers have delivered groceries and diapers to families too afraid to go outside.

“Every arrest feels like a wound to Portland,” the councilor said.

Gov. Janet Mills speaks about increased ICE presence in Maine

Mills held a press conference Thursday afternoon, addressing the ICE presence in Maine and the fear that is spreading across the state.

""This target of 1,400 people seems pretty broad and we're hearing that there's a lot of fear within schools, within the employment community, among businesses who are losing employees who have either been detained or are not showing up...businesses are very worried about being able to carry on, all kinds of businesses who rely on employees who are here legally, lawfully, and who have a good work ethic and a good work record with these employers.""

Mills said she's hearing that many of the people who are being detained or who are on the target list are family members here in Maine, people who are working here in Maine, people who have children in the school system, people who have children in homes in Maine, and people with no criminal records: ""And that's concerning.""

""Obviously it's very disruptive to a child's life, disruptive to a business, disruptive to a school, to a city and town, and tends to engender a lot of fear and anxiety naturally on the part of these families and these communities,"" Mills said. ""And think what it does to the children to think of their parent being hauled away, a parent with no criminal activity, no criminal charges, no criminal record, being hauled away in their presence and not being told when is mom or dad is coming home. Where do I go next? Who do I turn to? Pretty tough.""

Mills said she'd love to know the numbers of arrests in real time but that it would be hard to determine that without following ICE around, which she's not going to be doing. The governor said they try to keep track of a lot of anecdotal reports, as do police departments and mayors, who are getting those reports also.

She also noted that people are freely using their cell phones, which is their absolute right, to record incidents they see, as long as they don't interfere or obstruct.

Mills, a former district attorney and state attorney general, said she knows about crime in the state. She says they take crime very seriously, and are proud of the fact that Maine has one of the lowest crime rates in the country, certainly one of the lowest violent crime rates.

""We take allegations of criminal activity seriously, no matter who the person is. I don't sense that there's any greater incidence of crime among non citizens than there is among citizens, in fact I think probably the opposite,"" Mills said. ""But that's not what we're hearing about. We're hearing about perhaps a handful of people with criminal convictions who, I don't know what their status is, but you know what I've asked for, if you have warrants, show the warrants. In my experience you've gotta get a judicial warrant to arrest somebody. It's not automatic. And they have warrants to come here and arrest people, then that should be public record.""

Mills said in America, we don't believe in secret arrests or secret police. She said as for Maine, she knows the state's law enforcement are subject to professional training, substantial qualifications and high expectations or performance standards.

""And I'll tell ya, they don't wear masks to hide their identity, they don't need to wear masks, they don't need to hide their identity, and they don't go out and set numbers and goals and quotas and detain people subject to some quota wherever that may come from. That's not very professional.""

As for why is ICE targeting Maine? Mills could only surmise.

""Well [Trump's] gone to a lot of blue states, hasn't he? He went to Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, all democratic governors. I happen to be a democratic governor. Ostensibly they're coming here, they say, because of an immigrant population that they find in disfavor, so I don't know, you'll have to ask them why they're here.""

As for there allegedly being 1,400 people in Maine with criminal backgrounds, Mills says, ""Let's see the documents.""

""I'd be shocked if they found 1,400 people with criminal charges against them but what we're hearing is not that anyway,"" Mills continued. ""What we're hearing is that people with no criminal backgrounds are being detained and subject to perhaps deportation, or at least arrest, people who are being torn from their families and from young children, people who are part of the workforce here in Maine, a workforce that we desperately need and desperately value, and that's a shame, you know? It's disruptive and it's causing a lot of fear, unnecessary anxiety in the community and among families who don't deserve this kind of treatment.""

Mills said school superintendents are very much on alert, particularly in Portland and Lewiston where schools have a fairly high number of children of immigrant families.

When asked about a recently leaked memo, dated May 2025, that shows ICE told officers they can forcibly enter homes during immigration operations without a judicial warrant, Mills said: ""That's very disturbing news assuming it's true.""

""Look the Fourth Amendment, the basic premise of our Bill of Rights, for god's sake its words couldn't be plainer, you've got to have a judicial warrant before you enter somebody's home.""

Dozens of arrests

The enforcement action is arriving in Maine, a mostly rural state with about 1.4 million residents, as confrontations between ICE and demonstrators continue in Minnesota, where ICE is under scrutiny following an agent’s fatal shooting of Renee Good.

ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the agency’s plans for Maine, where the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that increased enforcement began on Tuesday.

“We have approximately 1,400 targets here in Maine,” Patricia Hyde, the ICE deputy assistant director, told Fox News, adding that agents had made 50 arrests by Tuesday.

“We have launched Operation Catch of the Day to target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in the state. On the first day of operations, we arrested illegal aliens convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child,” added Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.

No new undercover license plates

Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said state officials received a request from U.S. Customs and Border Protection for confidential, undercover Maine license plates and decided against issuing them. The licenses plates are used on unmarked vehicles, and Bellows said she wants more assurance they will be used appropriately.

ICE’s use of license plates in other states has raised concerns: Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, a Democrat, issued a warning to ICE agents last year that swapping or altering license plates is illegal.

“These requests in light of rumors of ICE deployment to Maine and abuses of power in Minnesota and elsewhere raise concerns. We have not revoked existing plates but have paused issuance of new plates. We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,” Bellows said.

Bellows, a Democrat who has repeatedly clashed with the Trump administration, cited accountability concerns.

Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request seeking comment, but a top Maine Republican said withholding the undercover plates would jeopardize public safety.

“That really, one, puts us at odds as a state. Puts us at one end of an extreme that we really shouldn’t be on,” Senate Leader Trey Stewart said.

Maine’s top federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson, joined Democrats in calling for any demonstrations in the state to remain peaceful and civil. Benson, a Trump appointee, warned people to stay out of the agents' way or be prosecuted.

Schools, Democrats call for caution

Portland Public Schools, the largest and most diverse school district in the state, said in a statement Wednesday that it conducted a “lockout” at two schools to prevent anyone from entering the building during the school day Tuesday because of concerns about ICE activity nearby.

“It was quickly determined that there was no threat to our school communities and the lockouts were lifted within minutes. This is an understandably tense time in our community, as reports and rumors of immigration enforcement actions grow,” the district's statement said.

Maine Democrats have condemned the ICE activity.

“The Trump administration has deployed ICE agents to Portland, Lewiston, and possibly other Maine communities. This is not about public safety. It is about fear, control, and political theater,” Devon Murphy-Anderson, executive director of the Maine Democratic Party, said in a statement Wednesday.

Tensions appeared unlikely to subside after school officials in a nearby suburb said ICE agents had detained a 5-year-old boy. Federal authorities showed little sign of softening their approach, announcing on Thursday the arrest of two people in connection with a protest that disrupted a church service in St. Paul on Sunday.

Minneapolis has remained on edge as heavily armed federal officers roam the streets, rounding up suspects they assert are dangerous criminal immigration violators while sometimes ensnaring law-abiding U.S. citizens. They have been met with throngs of demonstrators conducting their own patrols, blowing warning whistles and chanting at the agents.

4 CHILDREN DETAINED THIS MONTH: SCHOOL

In Columbia Heights, a Minneapolis suburb, school officials said at a press conference that immigration officers had detained at least four children this month, including a 5-year-old boy on Tuesday.

A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, said ICE had not targeted the child but his father, who she said left his son behind when he fled on foot after agents attempted to stop him. An officer remained with the child for his safety while others arrested the man, she added.

Parents targeted by ICE are asked if they want their children to be placed with someone they designate or removed with their parents, she said. She did not address the school district's allegation that three other children were detained.

Separately, Trump administration officials said on Thursday they had arrested at least two people involved in a demonstration that interrupted a Sunday service in a St. Paul church, where protesters alleged a pastor has been assisting ICE.

FBI Director Kash Patel said one of the organizers was charged with violating a federal law that bars physical obstruction of reproductive health centers and houses of worship.

VANCE'S LEADING ROLE IN DEFENDING ICE

Vance has taken a leading role in defending the Minnesota ICE shooting. Less than 24 hours after Good's death, Vance made a rare appearance in the White House briefing room, where he defended the officer involved, blamed the woman who was killed, and said the incident should be a political test ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

Even some Republican supporters have grown wary of President Donald Trump's approach to immigration enforcement, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll.

But the administration has expressed no intention of backing down after Trump deployed some 3,000 federal law enforcement officers to the Minneapolis area in what DHS described as its largest immigration operation ever. The city is the latest Democratic-leaning jurisdiction that Trump has targeted with a federal show of force.

Trump has said he acted partly in response to fraud allegations against some members of the state's sizable Somali American community; the president has described Somali immigrants as ""garbage"" and said they should be thrown out of the country.

While Trump officials say the operations are a necessary response to lax Democratic policies on immigration, local Democratic leaders have accused ICE agents of racial profiling and argued that Trump is intentionally fomenting chaos to justify his aggression.

In a speech in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday, ahead of flying to Minneapolis, Vance blamed protesters for the unrest.

""If you want to turn down the chaos in Minneapolis, stop fighting immigration enforcement and accept that we have to have a border in this country,"" he said. ""It's not that hard.""

Vance is scheduled to host a roundtable event with local leaders and community members in Minneapolis, where he will discuss ""restoring law and order in Minnesota"" and meet with officers in a show of support, the White House said.

The vice president is also planning to discuss Trump's vow to cut off federal funding from sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with the administration's immigration crackdown, starting on February 1.

'POLITICAL THEATER'

Richard Carlbom, chair of Minnesota's Democratic Party, said he hopes Vance will promote calm but fears political agitation.

“I think he is simply coming here for political theater. This entire situation we're being faced with is a retribution campaign by him and the president of the United States against Minnesotans,"" Carlbom told Reuters.

Trump faulted Minnesota's leaders during his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, saying, ""We actually are helping Minnesota so much, but they don’t appreciate it.""

Patty O'Keefe, a 36-year-old Minnesotan and non-profit worker who was pepper-sprayed and detained by federal agents in January after documenting ICE movements in the city, did not welcome Vance's visit.

""He's calling for law and order when it's his federal agents who are creating chaos and escalating violence,"" O'Keefe said. “His divisive rhetoric is not welcome here.""

The president and the White House have tied the ICE operation to allegations of welfare fraud in the state. Since 2022, at least 56 people have pleaded guilty, according to the Justice Department.

“Minnesota reminds us that the West cannot mass import foreign cultures,” Trump said in Davos.

State Rep. Leonora Dodge, a Democrat from Essex and Essex Junction, said she and her constituents have been horrified by recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions across the nation.

“As a Latina legislator, I know personally how fear and uncertainty ripple through immigrant families when enforcement crosses the line into abuse. My friends and family are afraid.”

As a result, Dodge has helped draft legislation to protect state residents from federal actions. She outlined these proposals during a “No Secret Police” press conference at the State House in Montpelier this week.

“The bills include requiring law enforcement to be clearly identifiable, strengthening protections against vigilantes impersonating immigration agents, keeping ICE out of our schools, health facilities and libraries and guaranteeing access to legal counsel for people facing deportation. Our constituents have been loud and clear: defend Vermont from the chaos and violence of federal assaults on immigrants, on their allies and on anyone unlucky enough to land in the middle of ICE operations.”

State Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, a Progressive and Democrat from the Chittenden Central District, says her chamber has introduced similar legislation.

“We believe from the testimony from a constitutional law professor at Columbia that we do have the right to do this. We do not have the right to say only federal law enforcement, but we do have the right to say all law enforcement. We are working to continue crafting that language so it is as strong and protective and as defensible as possible because in Vermont we do not want secret police.”

The Senate also plans to expand the list of sensitive locations in Vermont, where civil arrests without a judicial warrant are prohibited. Vyhovsky said she is frustrated about how little the state can do, but says she and other members of the Judiciary Committee are determined to protect residents.

“We will not let our civil rights be eroded upon. We will not let our neighbors be rounded up and sent to concentration camps. We will not allow the death of democracy and the erosion of the rule of law because this brave little state says no to hate, says no to white supremacy and says no to extrajudicial secret police.”

Wednesday’s event at the State House drew dozens of people – support that Falco Schilling, Advocacy Director for the ACLU of Vermont, said he was overwhelmed to see.”

“We have all seen the images coming out of Minnesota and around the country of heavily armed and unidentified federal agents ignoring basic human rights and violently targeting people based on the color of their skin, their accents, or because they simply exercise their First Amendment rights. We are here today to say enough is enough. Vermont can and will act to protect our communities.”

Sen. Becca White, a Democrat from Windsor County, said ICE activity hits close to home. She was with Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student and legal resident of Vermont and the United States, when he was detained by ICE last April.

“I'm really, really angry. A few months ago, I had a friend who was detained by ICE when we were outside of his citizenship interview. And when I asked the men with masks, and I said I'm a state senator, who are you? They said, I don't need to tell you who I am. It was shocking to me that even in a position of privilege when I demanded information, I was told I don't have to do that.”

Olga Cruz is an immigrant worker and leader with Migrant Justice. Speaking through an interpreter, she urged support of the House and Senate bills.

This tragedy is not an isolated event; the Trump administration has been killing and disappearing people of color long before this tragedy came to light.

As a formerly undocumented immigrant, a woman of color, an immigration lawyer for 10 years, and a clinical law professor, I thought I understood pain and despair. However, nothing in my personal or professional experience prepared me for the reckoning that this administration is inflicting on my community.

Take, for example, the case of a client of mine, a 31-year-old man who died in 2025. My law students and I fought relentlessly for his opportunity to secure asylum in the United States. Having survived years of persecution and torture by his home government and months of detention by the U.S. government at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, he fought as hard as he could. Despite having a legally sound and compelling case, it was summarily denied. His fight was lost before it even started. The immigration judge, a former ICE attorney, prioritized legitimizing a violent and punitive legal system, rather than existing legal precedent. The judge did exactly what the Trump administration has demanded of the immigration system: detain for profit, deny meritorious claims, and deport mercilessly.

After being deported to his home country, he went into hiding from his persecutors, embraced his children, and kissed his wife one last time. The following day, he committed suicide, unable to withstand what the U.S. government had done to him. His young family will live forever with the consequences of a death caused by the Trump administration's policies and the immigration laws currently in effect.

Make no mistake: The Trump administration is responsible for my client's suicide. Kristi Noem is responsible for his death and for the deaths of many others persecuted and detained by the various agencies under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. My client's case is not unique. It is not an anomaly; it has become increasingly common under the most racist and violent legal system in the United States.

Trump's ""mass deportation"" agenda has drawn significant media attention. Actions in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and now Minnesota have exposed the war-like tactics Noem and Gregory Bovino have unleashed against communities of color. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the humanity and suffering of those who have been on the receiving end of Trump's militarized harm and cruelty long before January 2026.

It has been barely a year since this administration took office — and the deadliest for immigrants. Human rights organizations have documented the abuse and violence that result from the U.S. immigration system. Although ICE underreports the deaths of immigrants under its custody, independent nonprofit organizations report that 32 people died in ICE custody in 2025. This is the highest number of deaths reported by ICE since 2004. And while 32 deaths are too many, the loss for families and loved ones is simply immeasurable. These families will never be made whole again.

Not enough attention is brought to the government-sanctioned disappearances happening every day throughout the entire nation — a particularly egregious trend utilized by Trump's immigration law enforcement agencies. Take the example of Vicente Ventura Aguilar, who is yet to be found after being arrested by masked ICE agents in Los Angeles on Oct. 7–8, 2025. Based on witness accounts and available information, Ventura's lawyer and family fear he died in government custody, while DHS denies their allegations.

Those who support the Trump administration's extermination of immigrants of color, or who haven't witnessed what I have, will claim that this administration is only ""targeting the worst and most dangerous criminals."" That is simply not true. DHS's own data reports almost 97% of people detained for an immigration violation have never been convicted of a criminal offense, yet they are deported in violation of due process. Even if the administration's claim was true, the immigration system is a civil — not criminal — legal system, yet people are routinely punished, dehumanized, and tortured by the immigration system with impunity.

Why was the violence and tyranny of Trump's America not exposed sooner? And what is our moral duty during these dark times? This administration is succeeding in the systematic erasure of people of color. These atrocities must be named and shouted from every rooftop, because what we do not name does not exist, and silence creates complicity. Now that you know, what will you do to fight these injustices?

One case accused Trump of conspiring to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election, while the other accused him of unlawfully holding onto classified documents.
“President Trump was charged because the evidence established that he willfully broke the very laws that he took an oath to uphold,” Smith told the House panel.
Neither case reached trial and Smith dropped them after Trump won re-election, citing a Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.
The Trump administration has fired dozens of Justice Department lawyers, FBI agents and staffers who worked on the investigations.","Former U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who unsuccessfully prosecuted President Donald Trump, appeared before a House of Representatives panel for his public testimony on Thursday, where he condemned “false and misleading narratives” about his investigation.

Smith was fielding questions before the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee about his two criminal cases, which he dropped after Trump won the 2024 presidential election. One case accused Trump of conspiring to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election, while the other accused him of unlawfully holding onto classified documents.

The hearing marks the first time the American public will hear at length from Smith, whose historic prosecutions dominated Trump’s years out of power and helped fuel the Republican president’s quest for retribution since returning to office.

“President Trump was charged because the evidence established that he willfully broke the very laws that he took an oath to uphold,” Smith told the House panel. “If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so, regardless of whether that president was a Democrat or a Republican.”

Republican lawmakers are seeking to discredit Smith’s investigation and buttress Trump’s claims that the probes were an abuse of the legal system.

“It was always about politics,” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the Republican chair of the Judiciary Committee, said at the start of the hearing. “To get Donald Trump, they were willing to do just about anything.”

Democrats Defend Smith

Democrats defended Smith as an apolitical career prosecutor who was guided by the evidence in building his cases against Trump.

Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the panel, said Trump has assailed Smith “not because you did anything wrong, but because you did everything right.”

“You had the audacity to do your job,” Raskin added.

Smith’s testimony is expected to focus primarily on the case that accused Trump of using false voter fraud claims to obstruct the certification of election results following his 2020 defeat to Democrat Joe Biden.

A federal judge has barred the Justice Department from disclosing many of the details surrounding Smith’s second case, which accused Trump of stashing highly sensitive government documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence following the end of his first term in 2021.

Trump Pleaded Not Guilty

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and has repeatedly argued the charges were improperly aimed at damaging his 2024 campaign.

Neither case reached trial and Smith dropped them after Trump won re-election, citing a Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.

Trump, who called Smith a “sick guy” earlier this week, has called for his prosecution. The Trump administration has fired dozens of Justice Department lawyers, FBI agents and staffers who worked on the investigations.

Republican lawmakers are expected to press Smith on disclosures from the Justice Department showing that his investigators examined limited phone records from several Republican senators in the days surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.

Trump allies have argued that the records show Smith’s investigation was overzealous and aimed at the political opposition.

Smith has said the records were necessary to examine Trump’s efforts to pressure Republican lawmakers to block certification of the election.

Congress created federal question jurisdiction to empower federal courts to secure federal rights, like the constitutional rights T.M.
During Reconstruction, Congress passed a series of laws meant to protect and secure federal rights, in part through access to the federal courts.
Ever since, litigants who want to vindicate their federal rights have often sought to do so in federal court.
Because there was no final judgment of a state court of last resort in T.M.’s case, Rooker-Feldman does not apply.","T.M., the petitioner in this case, has a rare condition that can cause temporary psychosis. After one such episode, she was involuntarily committed to a state hospital, which took steps to medicate her against her will. In a lawsuit to vindicate her rights in federal district court, T.M. alleged that she agreed to a consent decree in state court under duress to secure her release. She alleged that the state court consent order, which indefinitely dictated her treatment plan going forward, violated her constitutional rights. She argued that her lawsuit belonged in federal court because federal courts have jurisdiction in cases arising under federal law and, specifically, in lawsuits against state officials for civil rights violations.

The federal district court dismissed T.M.’s case, applying the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which prohibits federal courts from adjudicating cases attempting to appeal a judgment of a state’s highest court. But T.M. was not seeking review of a judgment of a state’s highest court—at the time T.M. filed her lawsuit in federal court, she had also appealed the consent decree to a state appellate court, and that appeal remained pending.

The Fourth Circuit affirmed, and T.M. asked the Supreme Court to hear her case. In January 2026, CAC filed an amicus brief explaining why Rooker-Feldman does not bar T.M.’s search for justice in federal court.

Congress created federal question jurisdiction to empower federal courts to secure federal rights, like the constitutional rights T.M. is trying to vindicate. At the Founding, the Framers recognized that existing state court systems would not always be sufficient to protect federal interests. In subsequent decades, Congress expanded federal question jurisdiction, often reflecting Congress’s increasing frustration with brazen and unlawful conduct in the state courts. During Reconstruction, Congress passed a series of laws meant to protect and secure federal rights, in part through access to the federal courts. While opponents protested that these laws would let federal courts interfere with state judicial systems, supporters countered that this was precisely the point, due to widespread abuses by the state courts. By granting the federal courts civil rights jurisdiction in 1871 (in the same statute that created the cause of action for civil rights cases now known as § 1983) and federal question jurisdiction in 1875, Congress empowered lower federal courts to protect federal rights at a time when state courts could not be trusted to do so.

Ever since, litigants who want to vindicate their federal rights have often sought to do so in federal court. But in the twentieth century, in decisions separated by nearly sixty years, the Supreme Court dismissed two cases for lack of jurisdiction when state-court litigants, complaining of constitutional violations, sought review in federal district court of judgments of state courts of last resort. These cases created the “Rooker-Feldman doctrine.” Now, despite the Supreme Court’s subsequent admonishments that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine should be exceptionally narrow in scope, the lower federal courts sometimes apply it capaciously to dismiss cases brought in federal court.

The Supreme Court has never applied the Rooker-Feldman doctrine in a case like this one, where the state-court judgment is still subject to further review in the state court system. Rather, the Supreme Court’s precedents establish that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine only applies to final decisions of state courts of last resort, for which the exclusive avenue for review is to seek a Supreme Court writ of certiorari. Any expansion of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine beyond this narrow scope would be completely at odds with the history of Congress’s effort to throw open the doors of the lower federal courts for the vindication of federal rights.

Because there was no final judgment of a state court of last resort in T.M.’s case, Rooker-Feldman does not apply. The lower federal courts have jurisdiction to hear her case, just as the Reconstruction Congress that conferred that jurisdiction intended.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-22 12:38:17.413868

Federal prosecutors say they were unaware Flores had an immigration detainer.

Ordinarily, if a criminal defendant had immigration proceedings against them – which is common – immigration officials would inform prosecutors what was happening.
While the victims reported more than $100m in losses, Brink’s said the stolen items were worth less than $10m.","Federal immigration authorities allowed a suspect in a $100m jewelry heist believed to be the largest in US history to deport himself to South America in December, a move that stunned and upset prosecutors who were planning to try the case and send him to prison.

Jeson Nelon Presilla Flores was one of seven people charged last year with stalking an armored truck to a rural freeway rest stop north of Los Angeles and stealing millions worth of diamonds, emeralds, gold, rubies and designer watches in 2022.

Flores faced up to 15 years in federal prison if convicted on charges of conspiracy to commit theft from interstate and foreign shipment and theft from interstate and foreign shipment. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported Flores in late December after he requested voluntary departure, prosecutors said in court filings.

ICE did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Flores’s attorney, John D Robertson, motioned to dismiss the indictment against his client, asking for the charges to be permanently dropped and the case closed.

Federal prosecutors oppose the motion and say they still hope to bring Flores to trial, asking for charges to be dropped “without prejudice” to keep the door open for criminal prosecution in the future.

Despite Flores being a lawful permanent resident and released on bail, he was taken into ICE custody in September, according to court filings from his defense attorneys. Federal prosecutors say they were unaware Flores had an immigration detainer.

This was a violation of his criminal prosecution rights and warrants his case getting dismissed, Robertson said in his motion.

Flores opted for deportation to Chile during a 16 December immigration hearing, according to court documents. The judge denied his voluntary departure application but issued a final order of removal, and he was sent to Ecuador.

“Prosecutors are supposed to allow the civil immigration process to play out independently while criminal charges are pending,” federal prosecutors wrote in their motion opposing the case dismissal. “That is exactly what they did in this case – unwittingly to defendant’s benefit in that he will now avoid trial, and any potential conviction and sentence, unless and until he returns to the United States.”

What happened to Flores is extremely unusual, especially in a case of this significance, former federal prosecutor Laurie Levenson said.

Ordinarily, if a criminal defendant had immigration proceedings against them – which is common – immigration officials would inform prosecutors what was happening. In minor cases, a defendant can sometimes choose to self-deport in lieu of prosecution.

“It’s just beyond me how they would deport him without the prosecutors … being in on the conversation,” Levenson said. “This really was the left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing.”

The jewelers who were stolen from are also demanding answers.

“When a defendant in a major federal theft case leaves the country before trial, victims are left without answers, without a verdict, and without closure,” Jerry Kroll, an attorney for some of the jewelry companies, told the Los Angeles Times.

The infamous jewelry heist unfolded in July 2022 after the suspects scouted the Brink’s tractor-trailer leaving an international jewelry show near San Francisco with dozens of bags of jewels, according to the indictment. While the victims reported more than $100m in losses, Brink’s said the stolen items were worth less than $10m.

A series of high-profile arrests and rumors of a potential detention facility have thrust Kansas City into a national fight over the Trump administration’s sweeping crackdown on American cities.
However, there is no evidence that the city’s little-known agreement is connected to reports of a planned immigration detention facility in south Kansas City.
Those members, which include Kansas City, determine what other agencies are allowed on the system.","Over the past two years, Kansas City has received $42,000 from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of a little-noticed agreement between the city and the federal immigration agency.

The agreement, revealed in federal government spending records reviewed by The Star, runs from September 2024 to May 2026. The payments, which have been obligated, allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE access to a multi-agency law enforcement radio network known as the Metropolitan Area Regional Radio System (MARRS), according to a city spokesperson.

Multiple city officials, including Mayor Quinton Lucas, said they were unaware of the payments until contacted by The Star this week. The full scope of the city’s financial relationship with ICE remains unclear and The Star has requested a copy of any formal agreements.

Centralized communications systems are common among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies and Lucas downplayed the agreement when informed about it. The mayor pointed to its low dollar amount, the fact that it began under the Biden administration and that it appeared to solely deal with radio communications.

“(The) agreement appears not to be born out of recent efforts toward mass warehousing of persons or recent efforts challenged in federal courts to apprehend persons without due process,” Lucas said in an email to The Star.

Revelations about the agreement have sparked concern from at least one law enforcement accountability advocate. A series of high-profile arrests and rumors of a potential detention facility have thrust Kansas City into a national fight over the Trump administration’s sweeping crackdown on American cities.

However, there is no evidence that the city’s little-known agreement is connected to reports of a planned immigration detention facility in south Kansas City.

Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, said Kansas City and other cities should review all potential agreements with ICE and consider canceling those contracts if city leaders are opposed to the Trump administration’s immigration efforts.

“To the extent they want to, you know, publicly say that they’re opposed to the brutality that we’re seeing with ICE and potentially allowing members of their community to be targeted by ICE,” Bonds said, “There shouldn’t be a contract in place like this.”

Two Kansas City Councilmembers, Johnathan Duncan and Wes Rogers, said they were also unaware of the agreement until contacted by The Star. Duncan said he would look into it. Rogers said the agreement was concerning, but that he needed to know more about it.

“It’s OK to have secure borders and have homeland security agents here,” Rogers said. “It’s not de facto bad. I just want to know more about it.”

City spokesperson Sherae Honeycutt, in a series of emails to The Star, said the payments allow ICE and DHS to use 111 active radios on the MARRS system. DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection use the system, but DHS is the only federal agency billed directly by the city.

Both federal agencies have “dedicated talk groups” on the radio system, allowing them to communicate with regional partners, Honeycutt said.

“DHS coordinates with local law enforcement as needed; the system enables communication during joint operations or incidents, but it is not a surveillance or data-sharing platform,” Honeycutt said.

The joint radio system is facilitated by Mid-America Regional Council (MARC), but governed by the MARRS Management Council, Honeycutt said.

Eric Winebrenner, MARC’s public safety communications program director, in a statement to The Star, listed nine cities and counties that are part of the MARRS system.

Those members, which include Kansas City, determine what other agencies are allowed on the system. Agreements are then brought to the MARRS Management Council for approval. Winebrenner did not immediately have information detailing how long DHS and ICE have been part of the system.

When asked what ICE and DHS would use the system for, Winebrenner said public safety agencies use it for dispatch and communications between first responders.

While centralized law enforcement communications are common and Lucas and city officials have downplayed the payment, Kansas City’s agreement was also the focus of a recent report that highlighted the immigration agency’s sprawling network of partners.

Sludge, a news outlet that focuses on money in politics, included a portion of Kansas City’s agreement with ICE in an interactive map that showed every company or agency that either entered into a new contract with ICE or was awarded new obligations under the Trump administration.

The news outlet’s report focused on $25,601 that was obligated as part of the agreement on Sept. 29. That portion, which is mentioned in federal records available online, states that the payment was for access to a communication system for law enforcement personnel.

For Bonds, the law enforcement accountability advocate, one of the major concerns about the agreement is a lack of control over how much information is shared between agencies.

“Even if you aren’t intentionally trying to share information with ICE, with DHS, you don’t really have a lot of control over who sees it and who uses it if you decide to participate in something like this,” Bonds said.",https://www.kansascity.com/public/latest-news/qqzb1b/picture275902766/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/KCM_KCSkylineBuildings_0331%20(3),N,,2026-01-22 11:38:53.162725

The president had gone to Davos seeking a deal that would hand the U.S. more control over the semi-autonomous Danish territory's security, but talks are preliminary.

Jordan berates Smith over Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony about Trump's Jan. 6 actions

Jordan berated Smith in his line of questioning over the testimony that Cassidy Hutchinson provided to the former House select committee that investigated Jan. 6 about Trump's actions in the motorcade that day.

""Everybody knows she wasn't telling the truth,"" Jordan said.

Asked if federal prosecutors were planning to call Hutchinson to the stand if their case against Trump had made it to trial, Smith said they had not finalized their witness list before the case was dismissed.

Jordan said ""the left and Democrats"" were willing to put her on the stand despite her story being told second hand or not confirmed by other witnesses. Jordan claimed everyone knew that Hutchinson was ""making it up.""

Hutchinson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Republican chairman was referring to Hutchinson's 2022 bombshell public testimony to Congress in which she shared what she said she was told by the White House deputy chief of staff for operations, Tony Ornato, and Secret Service agent Bobby Engel on Jan. 6.

After Trump's speech at the Ellipse that morning, Hutchinson said that she was told by Ornato that Trump grew livid when his security told him his motorcade was heading to the White House rather than the Capitol after the rally. Engel was inside Trump's vehicle with him when this happened.

“I am the f---ing president. Take me up to the Capitol now,” Hutchinson recounted to lawmakers, relaying what she was told.

Trump made a grab for the steering wheel from the back seat, wrestled with one of the bodyguards for control of the car and ultimately grabbed the bodyguard’s throat, Hutchinson said.

After her testimony, a source close to Ornato told NBC News that he was willing to testify under oath disputing that account, while a source close to the Secret Service separately told NBC News that Engel was also willing to do the same.

Vance says he’ll try to calm tensions in Minneapolis — while still criticizing officials and protesters there

Vice President JD Vance, previewing a trip to Minneapolis later today to meet with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and members of a community awash in tension, said he will aim to “turn down the chaos” and project calm.

He also used coarse language to reinforce Trump’s position that Democrats there are impeding ICE operations and have created an environment that breeds unruly protests.

“If you disagree … fine, make that argument,” Vance said in response to a question from a reporter during an event here to promote the White House’s economic policies. “But make that argument at the ballot box. Write an op-ed in the newspaper, argue about it on social media. Don’t go to the streets and start assaulting federal law enforcement officers because you disagree with the policies of our administration. It’s cowardly bulls---, and it’s got to stop.”

The remarks came hours before Vance was expected to hold a roundtable discussion and deliver a speech in Minneapolis, where a federal officer this month fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, 37, during a confrontation. Trump, Vance and other administration officials have, without offering conclusive evidence, said that Good was connected to left-wing protesters and that she was a threat to officers as they approached her car and she began to drive.

Smith says attacks on DOJ were 'unjustified'

Asked by Raskin for his response to the ""attack"" on the Justice Department and Smith's team for ""doing your jobs,"" the former special counsel answered that it was ""unjustified.""

Raskin had referred to how Republicans are responding to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Many Republicans have sought to cast rioters as peaceful protesters, and Trump pardoned people convicted of crimes related to the attack. Since then, many Republicans have criticized the Justice Department's handling of Jan. 6-related cases, in addition to Smith's investigations into Trump.

""I think the attack is unjustified,"" Smith said. ""I think the people who worked with me as career public servants are people — they're part of the reason I've been a prosecutor for so long, is to work with people like that.""

Smith added that the ""attacks are unwarranted based on the facts and I think that they have no basis in who we are as Americans."" He added that he did not believe the attacks were ""appropriate.""

Smith says he stands by his decisions to bring criminal charges against Trump

In his opening statement, Smith defended his decision as special counsel to indict Trump in two separate federal criminal cases.

“As I testify before the committee today, I want to be clear I stand by my decisions as special counsel, including the decision to bring charges against President Trump. Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in criminal activity,"" Smith said.

He said if he were asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, he would do so regardless of whether the president was a Democrat or a Republican.

""No one should be above the law in this country, and the law required that he be held to account. So that is what I did,"" Smith said.

Raskin defends Smith and the 'four American heroes' who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6

Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, began his opening statement by recognizing ""four American heroes"" who defended the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.

The four officers were in the hearing room: Michael Fanone, Aquilino Gonell, Daniel Hodges and Harry Dunn.

Raskin also defended Smith and his investigations in light of Trump saying Smith belongs in prison.

""He says you belong in prison not because you did anything wrong, mind you, but because you did everything right,"" Raskin said. ""You pursued the facts, you followed the law, you stuck with extreme caution, to every rule of professional responsibility. You had the audacity to do your job.""

He continued, ""Everybody here knows what you did wrong in Donald Trump’s eyes,"" saying that Smith ""found proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.""

Raskin said he knows there's still a lot of information Smith can't talk about because of a gag order. He said that Smith ""developed what he calls powerful evidence that Trump stole documents containing our country's most sensitive secrets, hoarded them in the ballrooms and the bathrooms of his well-trafficked Mar-a-Lago social club.""

House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan argues Smith's actions were motivated by politics

House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, predicted there would be “yelling and screaming” from Democrats, and said people should “never forget” what Democrats did to Trump, referring to investigations into the president.

During his opening remarks, Jordan criticized the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which was related to an investigation into alleged mishandling of classified documents.

Jordan also referenced Judge Aileen Cannon’s decision to dismiss the classified documents case after deciding that Smith’s appointment was unlawful. He went on to accuse Smith of abandoning proper procedure and being motivated by wanting to stop Trump.

“It was always about politics. The good news is, the American people saw through it,” Jordan argued.

Ranking member Jamie Raskin, D-Md., will deliver opening remarks next.

Jack Smith testimony will warn Americans not to take the rule of law ‘for granted’

Former special counsel Jack Smith is set to testify shortly in front of the House Judiciary Committee. He will warn Americans not to take the rule of law for granted in his first public testimony before Congress about the investigations into Trump, according to his prepared statement obtained by NBC News.

“I have seen how the rule of law can erode. My fear is that we have seen the rule of law function in this country for so long that many of us have come to take it for granted,” Smith plans to tell members of the committee.

“But, the rule of law is not self-executing — it depends on our collective commitment to apply it. It requires dedicated service on behalf of others, especially when that service is difficult and comes with costs,” he plans to say. “Our willingness to pay those costs is what tests and defines our commitment to the rule of law and to this wonderful country.”

Zelenskyy: Ukrainian, U.S., Russian officials to meet together for the first time in UAE

Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos today, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian and Russian teams will hold their first trilateral meeting with the U.S. officials in the United Arab Emirates in the coming days.

Zelenskyy said the meetings would take place on Friday and Saturday, adding that Russians need to be ""prepared for compromises.""

The Ukrainian leader met with Trump earlier today, with both acknowledging it was a productive exchange.

Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff is meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today.

France says won’t join Peace Board for now, partly contrary to U.N. charter

France will not join Trump’s Board of Peace for now because its charter does not correspond with a United Nations resolution to resolve the war in Gaza, and some of the charter’s elements were contrary to the U.N. charter, its foreign ministry spokesman said Thursday.

“It was not corresponding on the one hand with the pure Gaza mandate, which is not even mentioned, and on the other hand, there are elements of this charter which are contrary to the United Nations charter,” Pascal Confavreux told reporters.

Could Trump's tariffs reversal be a turning point for Europe's dealings with the president?

Trump’s U-turn on hitting eight European countries with tariffs over Greenland could mark a turning point in how the continent deals with the president, a former Obama White House staffer said.

“It was an illustration that when our allies are firm and not accommodating on some of these outrageous demands, that they can actually push him back,” said Brett Bruen, director of global engagement for President Barack Obama.

“I hope that we’re going to see a turning point where Europe and others are finally going to say to Trump, ‘We accommodated you for a year, and we accepted even imbalanced trade agreements so that you could claim a win and a prize, but now you’ve gone too far,’” he said.

Having ramped up his threats to his own allies, Trump said yesterday he would not use force to seize Greenland and dropped tariffs set to hit eight NATO members.

“In the history of diplomacy, we have not seen such a rapid about-face, which just speaks to how strategically stupid this move was,” Bruen added. He said the response to Trump’s hostility, not just from world leaders but CEOs and the bond market, was like “a bucket of cold water that got dumped on him from the Swiss Alps.”

Jamie Dimon on Trump's immigration policies: 'I don't like what I'm seeing'

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been a strong supporter of Trump’s border policies, criticized his immigration crackdown in a rare public rebuke by a U.S. corporate leader.

“I’m still angry at the Biden administration for what they allowed to happen, OK? And I think it severely damaged our country,” Dimon said yesterday at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “And then they say, ‘Oh, there’s nothing you can do about it.’ No, because Trump comes in — boom, it’s closed. God bless them.”

Dimon said that when Trump was elected president, he told him, “When you get the borders controlled, fix the rest of it,” including protecting recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and other “merit-based” cases, and that Trump said, “Absolutely.”

Dimon said he had yet to see much evidence of that, aside from “a little bit in the merit side.”

“Of course, I don’t like what I’m seeing, you know, with five grown men beating up little women,” he said, referring to ICE operations. “So I think, we should calm down a little bit on the internal anger about immigration.”

Japanese exports to the U.S. fall for the first time in 5 years under Trump's tariffs

Japanese exports to the U.S. fell last year for the first time in five years, government figures showed, largely because of Trump’s tariffs on the U.S. ally’s automobiles.

Exports to the U.S. dropped 4.1% by value to 20.4 trillion yen ($129 billion), according to preliminary results from the Japanese Finance Ministry, the first decrease since the Covid pandemic in 2020. Shipments of vehicles, Japan’s biggest export, were down 11.4%, while auto parts were down 10.7%.

The Trump administration has imposed a 15% tariff on Japanese auto imports, down from 25% earlier last year.

Japanese imports from the U.S. increased for the second consecutive year, up 1.6% to 12.9 trillion yen ($81.3 billion). Japan’s trade surplus with the U.S. fell for the second year in a row to 7.5 trillion yen ($47.3 billion), down 12.6%.

British PM skips Davos to host Danish counterpart

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomes Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to Chequers, the official countryside residence outside London today. The Danish leader is in the United Kingdom to discuss Trump's demand to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of the kingdom of Denmark.

Trump says meeting with Zelenskyy was 'very good'

Following his one-on-one with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines in Davos, Trump told reporters the meeting was ""very good.""

""Everybody wants to have the war ended,"" Trump added. He said earlier today that a deal on ending the war in Ukraine is ""getting close.""

His envoy Steve Wiktoff will be heading to Moscow later today for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Zelenskyy also called the meeting ""productive and substantive"" in a post on X, signaling that peace deal documents were now ""even better prepared.""

E.U. lawmakers to revisit U.S. trade deal Monday after Trump backs off tariff threat

A top European Union lawmaker says parliamentarians will revisit the E.U.'s trade deal with the U.S. on Monday after Trump backed off his threat to impose new tariffs on European nations.

Yesterday, the European Parliament's trade committee halted the implementation and approval of the trade deal amid rising rhetoric from the Trump administration on Greenland. The deal would reduce tariffs for importers and consumers in both regions.

""Hardly any details are known yet about the proposed Greenland deal,"" European Parliament member Bernd Lange said on X. ""But we need them in order to decide how to proceed with the implementation of the EU-US trade deal.""

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick commented shortly after Lange's post, writing that ""we remain committed to implementing the U.S.-EU trade agreement and will always value our deep ties with our friends in Europe.""

Leaders of the 27 E.U. countries will meet today in Brussels for an emergency summit to discuss the latest developments related to Trump's efforts to exert control over Greenland.

Belgium says it did not join Board of Peace after being included by the White House

The deputy prime minister of Belgium has corrected the list released by the White House to the media of the more than 20 nations that it said signed the charter of the newly inaugurated Board of Peace this morning in Davos.

“Belgium has NOT signed the Charter of the Board of Peace. This announcement is incorrect,” Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Maxime Prévot said on X. “We wish for a common and coordinated European response. As many European countries, we have reservations to the proposal.”

The original list circulated by the White House included Belgium, alongside Bahrain, Morocco, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan.

A source familiar with the matter told NBC News that Belgium originally signed on to joining the Board, but backed out at the last minute. NBC News has not confirmed this with Belgian officials.

Many Western European nations allied with Washington have voiced their reservations about joining the Board out of concerns that it could replace the United Nations and over the invitations being extended to regimes such as Russia and Belarus.

Trump claims the U.S. will have 'total access' to Greenland in new deal

Trump said in an interview on Fox Business this morning that the U.S. will have ""total access"" to Greenland under a framework of an agreement he announced after a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

“Essentially, it’s total access,"" Trump told anchor Maria Bartiromo on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""There’s no end, there’s no time limit.”

“I’m not gonna have to pay anything,"" Trump added. ""We’re gonna have total access to Greenland. We’re gonna have all military access that we want. We’re going to be able to put what we need on Greenland because we want it. We’re talking about national security and international security.”

Negotiations on a deal are preliminary and it's unclear what a final agreement will entail. The U.S. already has a military base in Greenland and has wide leeway to establish more military installations on the semi-autonomous Danish territory.

Trump also noted in the interview that ""a piece"" of the Golden Dome missile defense system will be located on Greenland.

""If the bad guys start shooting, it comes over Greenland,"" he said. ""So we knock it down.""

Zelenskyy meeting with Trump now

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with Trump in Davos, his office has confirmed, after the U.S. president said an end to the war with Russia was ""getting close.""

Zelenskyy arrived in Davos this morning. He had said he would not attend unless agreements on security guarantees and post-war reconstruction funding could be signed with the U.S. He also said he had wanted to remain in Kyiv to focus on the energy crisis in Ukraine.

Zelenskyy lamented earlier this week that the world's attention had switched away from Ukraine to Trump's threats over Greenland and the future of NATO, but the U.S. is signaling it wants to push forward with talks again.

Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff will be going to Moscow later today to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

U.S. outlines plan for Gaza with slides and maps, tells critics to 'calm down'

After the signing ceremony earlier, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner presented the U.S. vision for Gaza's future, complete with a slide presentation and maps that resembled a real estate plan.

It features a timeline for the redevelopment of Gaza, which Trump said was a ""great location,"" citing his real estate experience. The Palestinian enclave was largely reduced to rubble by Israel's military campaign.

Kushner said the focus has to be on security plans to encourage investment in the Palestinian enclave, which has to start with Hamas' demilitarization, as well as plans for transitional governance and redevelopment of Gaza, which he said had ""amazing potential.""

But he also urged critics to ""calm down"" and ""turn a new chapter.""

""If we believe that peace is possible, then peace really can be possible,"" he added.

Musk to speak at Davos in newly scheduled session

Tech billionaire Elon Musk is set to speak at Davos on Thursday in a newly scheduled session.

The World Economic Forum, which Musk previously criticized, confirmed it will be the Tesla owner’s first time attending the elite event in the Swiss Alps.

His address is billed as a conversation with Laurence Fink, BlackRock’s CEO and interim co-chair of the forum.

Musk is embroiled in a war of words with Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary that began with a dispute over installing Starlink systems on Ryanair planes. Yesterday, O’Leary dismissed the tech titan’s suggestion he would buy the budget airline.

Trump sought Greenland deal that would hand U.S. more control over security

Despite his escalated rhetoric about acquiring Greenland, including potentially by military force, Trump arrived in Davos looking to negotiate a deal that would give the U.S. more control over security there and in the broader Arctic region, a congressional official and two former U.S. officials told NBC News.

Trump has mentioned possibly adding U.S. troops and more military bases in Greenland, particularly with respect to supporting the Golden Dome missile defense system, the two former U.S. officials said.

Trump went into his meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte with the expectation that he would announce a broad framework of a deal on Greenland, the congressional official and one of the former U.S. officials said. Negotiations on a deal are preliminary, with Trump describing it as a “framework,” and it’s not clear the president will secure a final agreement or what that would entail.

Witkoff and Kushner appear ahead of Russia-Ukraine talks

Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner took to the stage after the signing ceremony to talk to about progress in implementing Trump's peace plan in Gaza.

It will be a long day for Witkoff, who will head to Moscow later today to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin about a deal to end the war in Ukraine.

Witkoff said earlier today that ""a lot of progress"" had been made and the negotiations were ""down to one issue.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Davos this morning for talks with Trump. Zelenskyy earlier said he would not be attending unless he could sign agreements with Trump on security guarantees and post-war reconstruction funding.

Trump thanks attendees in concluding remarks

Trump is called to the podium for closing remarks.

""I just wanted to tell you, it's all happening,"" he said, as he thanked those who made the Board of Peace happen. ""It's a big one, but it's very doable,"" he added.

Rubio vows other countries will join despite allies’ reservations

Rubio thanked the world leaders on the stage who just signed the charter of the Board of Peace, but vowed that those who might have reservations will ultimately join in.

""Others will join,"" Rubio said. ""Many want to be a part of this effort, because it is going to be a successful effort,"" he added. He downplayed some countries' reservations, saying that many just needed to get domestic approval before joining.

No major Western allies were among the signatories today, with some voicing concerns about the possibility of the board replacing the United Nations, and invites for countries such as Russia and Belarus.

Rubio says Board of Peace ushers in new era of 'action'

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking after the signing ceremony, said the newly inaugurated Board of Peace is about ""action"" and not just ""strongly-worded statements"" the world is used to from global leaders.

""We often find ourselves at events where people are reading these scripted statements, these strongly worded letters that they put out, but no action. Nothing happens,"" Rubio said.

He added: ""This is a group of leaders that are about action, and the president of the United States is a president of action, of getting things done. And today is the beginning of that, of a new era and a new stage that we think is so important as a model to the rest of the world of what is possible.""

Trump finishes speaking, signs Board of Peace charter

Trump has finished speaking and is leading a signing ceremony for the Board of Peace charter.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt proclaimed: ""The charter is now in full force, and the board of peace is now an official international organization.""

She is now calling the world leaders on the stage to come up in pairs to sign the charter.

Trump vows to work with U.N., says Board of Peace could be 'one of the most consequential bodies ever'

Signaling broad ambitions, Trump says his Board of Peace ""has the chance to be one of the most consequential bodies ever created,"" adding that it was an ""enormous honor"" to serve as its chairman.

Initially envisioned as part of his plan for peace in Gaza, the body's charter views it as a way to resolve global conflicts. That has raised fears among allies that Trump intends to replace the United Nations with a body chaired by him.

But Trump said his board would work alongside the U.N., which he said has ""got tremendous potential."" The two bodies together ""can be something very, very unique for the world,” he said.

Trump: Iran wants to talk and we'll talk

In his opening speech, Trump says Iran was ""two months away from having a nuclear weapon"" before a U.S. bombing campaign last June.

""Can’t let that happen, and Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk,"" he added.

It comes after Trump's threats to retaliate against Tehran over its crackdown on mass protests earlier this month.

Trump runs through conflicts he says he settled

In his opening speech, Trump is touting his peacemaking credentials.

The president is going over a number of global conflicts he claims to have settled, including the war in Gaza, the conflict between Cambodia and Thailand, Pakistan-India and Armenia-Azerbaijan. He also mentioned tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia among others.

Some surprise world leaders join Trump on stage, but no major Western allies

Trump is joined on stage by a number of world leaders who have agreed to join the Board of Peace.

They feature a few surprises, including the leaders of Bulgaria and Mongolia, who had not publicly accepted an invite. But no major Western allies are there, and the number of attendees is lower than the U.S. had suggested.

Those present, according to the White House, are: Bahrain, Morocco, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UAE, Uzbekistan

Signing ceremony for Trump's Board of Peace begins

Trump is appearing now at a ceremony launching his Board of Peace in Davos.

Trump is joined on stage by a hostof world leaders for the signing of the board's charter.

Some 35 countries have agreed to sign on to the project, a senior State Department official told reporters, with more than 50 nations invited to join.

What we know about Trump's Board of Peace

The Board of Peace was first proposed by Trump as an entity that would oversee the next phase of his peace plan for the Gaza Strip, but has since morphed into something with a much broader remit.

The proposed charter for the board, as confirmed by NBC News, makes no direct mention of Gaza and proposes a broad mandate for a new international organization that “seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”

Trump has suggested his Board of Peace ""might"" replace the United Nations, but that has raised concerns among some key allies.

The charter states that Trump will chair the board and can only be replaced as chairman through “voluntary resignation or as a result of incapacity, as determined by a unanimous vote of the Executive Board.”

It also states that each member state “shall serve a term of no more than three years,” with an exception for those “that contribute more than"" $1 billion.

Among the founding executive board members are Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and World Bank President Ajay Banga.

NATO’s Rutte says he had ‘very good discussion’ with Trump on how to keep Arctic safe

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in Davos this morning he had a ""very good discussion"" with Trump after the U.S. president announced they had agreed to a ""framework of a future deal"" on Greenland yesterday.

Rutte said the discussion involved talking about how all the Arctic nations, including the U.S., can ""collectively make sure that the Arctic stays safe, that the Russians and the Chinese stay out.""

Echoing Trump's consistent argument about the alleged danger to Greenland coming from Beijing and Moscow, Rutte said it was important that ""the Chinese and the Russians will not gain access to the Greenland economy, militarily to Greenland, and that will be a discussion taken forward.""

U.K. says it will not join Trump's Board of Peace today

Britain will not be signing Trump's Board of Peace charter in Davos today despite being invited, foreign minister Yvette Cooper said, citing concerns about Russia's involvement.

“We won’t be one of the signatories today, because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace when we still haven’t seen any signs from Putin there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine,” Cooper told BBC News.

Another key U.S. ally, France, has indicated it will not join as have Sweden, Norway, and Slovenia. Italy said it needed more time.

In another interview with the BBC, Cooper shared further details on the ""Arctic sentry"" discussed as part of the deal framework that Trump announced yesterday on Greenland, saying it would be a combined operation program that draws NATO countries together to work on a ""shared threat.""

NATO says it did not promise any compromise to sovereignty in Trump meeting

NATO has said this morning that Secretary General Mark Rutte did not propose any compromise on Greenland's sovereignty in his meeting with Trump.

Trump’s announcement of a ""framework"" for a future deal came hours after the possibility of the United States obtaining sovereignty over land for military bases was discussed during separate meetings in Brussels among top military officers from NATO member states, the New York Times reported, citing three senior Western officials familiar with the talks.

Asked about the reporting by NBC News, NATO Spokesperson Allison Hart stressed that Rutte did not propose any compromise to sovereignty during his meeting with Trump in Davos on Wednesday.

Danish PM says she won’t negotiate on nation's sovereignty

Denmark's leader warned this morning that she will not negotiate on her country's sovereignty, after Trump announced yesterday that he had agreed to the “framework of a future deal"" on Greenland.

Trump said it came after a very productive meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte. There were no details provided on what the deal would actually entail.

""Security in the Arctic is a matter for the entire NATO alliance,"" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement. ""Therefore, it is good and natural that it is also discussed between the NATO Secretary General and the President of the United States. The Kingdom of Denmark has long worked for NATO to increase its engagement in the Arctic.""

But she said NATO was fully aware of her position. ""We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy,"" Frederiksen said. ""But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty. I have been informed that this has not been the case either. And of course only Denmark and Greenland themselves can make decisions on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.""

Doubting U.S. resolve, Europe looks to bolster its own nuclear arsenal

Questioning America’s decades-long commitment to guard them against a nuclear-armed Russia, European nations are looking at ways to bolster their own arsenals rather than continue to rely on the U.S., according to six senior European officials.

European leaders are discussing whether to rely more on nuclear-armed France and Britain instead of the U.S. or even develop their own atomic weapons, three of the senior European officials said. The discussions have taken on a new urgency in recent weeks as Trump demands the U.S. acquire Greenland, these officials said.

Greenland is ‘not just a block of ice,’ residents say

Trump’s renewed demands for Denmark to hand over Greenland have received an icy response from locals on the remote Arctic island, usually far removed from world affairs.

There was a chill in the air in Greenland‘s capital, Nuuk, thousands of miles away from Trump's speech and meeting with world leaders.

“It’s crazy. Totally crazy,” Peter Jensen, an office supply store’s owner in Nuuk, said before Trump’s speech. “But many are scared.”

Tillie Martinussen, a former member of Greenland’s parliament, was incensed by Trump’s remarks. “We’re not just a block of ice,” she said in an interview on Wednesday. “We are human beings. We have elderly people here who are so afraid right now. We have children that are afraid of the United States.”

Trump pauses tariffs on European powers, saying ‘framework’ of Greenland deal agreed

Trump said he is dropping his threat to slap new tariffs on European nations in a fresh sign that he is prepared to reach a peaceful settlement to a tense standoff over the future of Greenland.

Trump announced on social media that after a private meeting with NATO’s secretary general in Davos, Switzerland, he agreed to the “framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region.”

Trump gave no details, nor did he say he was abandoning his effort to wrest control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. Earlier, Trump gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in which he said that the U.S. needs to absorb Greenland for global security reasons and that European countries need to meet the demand.

Equipped with military grade weapons and body armor, members of this paramilitary force often behave like soldiers, even though they are technically police.
Before Trump took office last January, the Border Patrol confined its operations primarily to the southern border.
Deploying paramilitary forces with police powers, a military mentality and an aggressive mindset without proper training and oversight leads to the abuses of power witnessed in Minneapolis.
Dictatorships, on the other hand, rely heavily on paramilitary forces that are answerable only to the regime.","Democratic societies need soldiers and police. When they combine the two into a single body, tragedies like the Minnesota shooting are inevitable.

Forty years of studying internal security operations around the world have taught me that units empowered as police but armed like soldiers will lack the discipline of either. The behavior of federal agents conducting the administration’s immigration crackdown clearly demonstrates the danger they pose.

Soldiers operate under “rules of engagement,” guidelines defining the circumstances in which they can use lethal force. In wartime, those guidelines are quite permissive, but even then there are still restrictions. The “Law of War,” a set of agreed upon international principles accepted by most militaries, forbids (for example) the intentional killing of non-combatants and the abuse of prisoners.

Armed forces around the world abide by these laws — not merely on moral grounds, but to make sure their own troops and civilians receive fair treatment. The outrage over the killing of two men clinging to a burning boat by U.S. forces in September illustrates the wide regard in which these principles are held.

Because of their professional ethos, soldiers in democratic societies assiduously avoid internal security operations. When troops have been deployed in that role — which occurred in Northern Ireland during the Troubles (1969 to 1998) — problems invariably arise. The Jan. 30, 1972 “Bloody Sunday” massacre of demonstrators in Londonderry by members of the Parachute Regiment still haunts the British Army.

Police operate under far more restrictive rules of engagement than soldiers. According to Department of Justice guidelines, officers may only use deadly force when “the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.” The rules explicitly forbid use of lethal force “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.”

Whereas soldiers and police have a clear understanding of their rules of engagement, the same cannot be said of hybrid paramilitary forces. The behavior of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement illustrates the problem.

Even before the Trump administration’s massive roundup of illegal immigrants, the Border Patrol had been accused of using excessive force. Since 2010, the force has killed 362 people. Equipped with military grade weapons and body armor, members of this paramilitary force often behave like soldiers, even though they are technically police.

Before Trump took office last January, the Border Patrol confined its operations primarily to the southern border. Now it operates in U.S. cities alongside ICE agents, who are also heavily armed.

In addition to deploying Customs and Border Protection agents more extensively, Trump has given them freer rein. He has lifted restrictions on immigration raids in “sensitive” areas such as schools, churches and hospitals. In September, the Supreme Court upheld the power of Customs and Border Patrol and ICE to apprehend people based on their language, location and appearance — what many experts call “racial profiling.”

Although operating under law enforcement rules of engagement, agents show up in body armor and carrying assault weapons and behave more like soldiers than police.

The rapid expansion of ICE and its recruitment methods have led to concerns over vetting and training. Cash incentives and an appeal to rid the country of undocumented immigrants, described in dehumanizing terms, may be drawing recruits with a vigilante mentality. Pressure to deploy more agents as fast as possible makes it difficult to train them properly.

To make matters worse, under Secretary Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security has created a permissive institutional culture in which its agencies feel empowered to use violence with little fear of accountability. Their officers and agents wear masks and do not show identification or warrants.

Noem’s response to the Minneapolis shooting illustrates her permissive attitude. Before an investigation had even occurred, she defended the shooting of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, portraying Good as a “domestic terrorist.” The FBI has taken over the investigation and is excluding Minnesota officials, even though murder is a state crime over which local authorities have jurisdiction.

Deploying paramilitary forces with police powers, a military mentality and an aggressive mindset without proper training and oversight leads to the abuses of power witnessed in Minneapolis. Since the death of Good, two more people have been shot (not fatally) by a federal agent in Portland, Oregon. More tragedies are bound to occur.

As a military historian who focuses on violent extremism, I have examined internal conflicts throughout history and across the world to learn how distinct types of government respond to threats. Democracies rely on disciplined police. They rarely deploy troops inside their countries but, when they do, employ them in an extremely limited role, such as riot-control.

Dictatorships, on the other hand, rely heavily on paramilitary forces that are answerable only to the regime.

The memo signed by the acting ICE director Todd Lyons, and obtained by The Associated Press, authorizes immigration officers to forcibly enter someone’s home and arrest immigrants using just a signed administrative warrant, known as an I-205, if they have a final order of removal issued by a judge.

Typically, administrative warrants authorize immigration arrests but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes without consent. Traditionally, only warrants signed by judges carry that authority. But the memo says the department has come to a different conclusion, the AP reported.

“Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose,” the memo reads.

It also instructs officers first to knock on the door and identify themselves and the reason for their visit. If people inside are then given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully,” but do not open the door, the memo says the officers can enter with force.

“Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien’s residence, following proper notification of the officer or agent’s authority and intent to enter,” the document reads.

The memo was issued last May and has only been shared with “select DHS officials,” according to a whistleblower disclosure obtained by the AP.

But the contents of the directive have been used to train ICE officers who have been deployed to cities during the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, according to the document, which claims immigration enforcement officers undergoing training are instructed to follow the memo, even though it contradicts the agency’s written training materials.

The news wire obtained the whistleblower disclosure from an unnamed member of Congress and said it verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.

The nonprofit legal organization, Whistleblower Aid, filed a complaint, saying it represents two government officials “disclosing a secretive — and seemingly unconstitutional — policy directive.”

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stood by the reasoning provided in the internal memo, saying in a statement to The Hill, “Every illegal alien who DHS serves administrative warrants/I-205s have had full due process and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.”

“The officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause. For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,” she added.

The whistleblower disclosure, dated earlier this month, comes amid escalating tensions in cities across the country over the Trump administration’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement.

In Minnesota, protests have at times turned violent, as demonstrators have chucked rocks and fireworks at law enforcement, who have responded with tear gas and force. Two officer-involved shootings, including one that was fatal, have also further inflamed tensions.

The decision to put the spotlight on the US for Thursday’s “International Day of the Endangered Lawyer” underlines how rapidly America has plummeted in global esteem. For decades the US has been held up as a role model of a democratic judicial system.

Now, just a year into Donald Trump’s renewed presidency, it is widely seen around the world as a state in which lawyers and judges are attacked just for doing their jobs.

The “endangered lawyer” epithet brings the US into the company of dictatorships and autocracies that have been previous holders of the title. Last year’s focus was Belarus, while other highlighted states since 2010 when the annual event was created include Afghanistan, Iran and China.

The US was selected through a vote of more than 40 bar associations and lawyer organisations globally. A report released by the coalition on Thursday explained the decision by saying that members were alarmed by the Trump administration’s “sustained and co-ordinated campaign aimed at undermining the independence of the legal profession and the judiciary”.

It added that the past 12 months displayed a “troubling pattern of political intimidation and institutional destabilization unprecedented in the modern history of the US”.

Symone Gaasbeek, a co-founder of the coalition, said that it was surprising to find a country normally lauded for its commitment to democracy and justice added to the list of largely authoritarian countries. Speaking to the Guardian from the Netherlands, she said that “we look at the facts, we don’t deal in labels”.

Led by the facts, she said, “you see a systematic attack on the legal profession in the US. As the past year has progressed, those attacks have intensified – it has become more and more clear that the government is trying to control the legal profession and that the rule of law is threatened.”

One of the influences behind the coalition’s decision was the work of the UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Margaret Satterthwaite. She acts as an independent monitor of the treatment of legal professionals around the world.

Over the past year Satterthwaite has raised mounting concerns about the actions of the Trump administration. She has sent two official letters to top US diplomats and the US state department objecting to the abusive treatment of American lawyers.

The first letter, sent a month after Trump’s inauguration, objected to the dismissal of scores of career lawyers from the Department of Justice. The firings were in apparent retaliation for their participation in earlier prosecutions against Trump over the January 6 insurrection and other alleged crimes.

The second letter, dated 6 May 2025, addressed the attacks emanating from Trump and his inner circle against judges who had ruled against the administration. Those assaults included Trump’s call for the impeachment of James Boasberg, chief judge of the US district court in Washington DC, after Boasberg blocked the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

The president called the judge a “radical left lunatic” and a “troublemaker”.

Satterthwaite told the Guardian that presidents were entitled to publicly disagree with court rulings. But, she said, “this kind of smearing is completely inappropriate”.

The UN rapporteur said that in other countries such verbal assaults had incited violence against judges. She pointed to the Philippines under the former strongman president Rodrigo Duterte.

In the US, scores of federal judges have endured a wave of violent threats in the wake of Trump’s rhetorical attacks. Several have been intimidated by anonymous pizza deliveries to their homes.

Satterthwaite said the ominous pizza deliveries were a “horribly good example” of the dangers of vilifying judges. “Attacking lawyers and judges for their work is a hallmark authoritarian move,” the UN monitor said.

She added that the administration had so far failed to reply to either of her official letters.

Tension between the executive branch and the judiciary has been a feature of both Trump’s presidencies. In his first term, the administration was partly frustrated in its policy ambitions in areas such as immigration and law enforcement by hundreds of lawsuits pursued in federal courts.

That confrontation has only intensified in the second term. A litigation tracker curated by the Just Security website is currently following 585 legal cases involving the administration.

As the clash continues, some of the territory has shifted to Trump’s advantage. He has benefited from largely favorable temporary rulings from the US supreme court, facilitated by Trump’s own three appointments to the top bench which sealed its hard-right majority.

Trump’s aggressive approach to filling seats on federal courts during his first term is also paying dividends in the appeals courts. A recent New York Times analysis found that the 54 appellate judges picked by Trump during his first four years in the White House have sided with the administration in an overwhelming 92% of recent cases.

Federal courts continue, though, to act as a last bastion against Trump’s anti-democratic onslaught. The newly released Endangered Lawyers report chronicles the many different ways that the president has stepped up his attack on lawyers and judges.

He has unleashed a raft of executive orders targeting specific law firms considered to be acting on behalf of Trump’s enemies or opponents. Firms such as Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block were threatened with the removal of all federal contracts, scrapping security clearances for their lawyers and barring them from entering federal facilities.

The UN rapporteur said that such an attack on private law firms was unprecedented and dangerous. “Lawyers are meant to represent their clients without them being seen as aligned with those clients. There’s a reason for that: so that everyone has access to a lawyer.”

The endangered lawyer coalition warns that there is a “chilling effect” on legal advocacy. Law firms and individual lawyers who represent marginalised clients in cases involving immigration, LGBTQ rights or Palestinian activism are finding themselves under intensified scrutiny.

At the same time, prosecutors are under growing pressure to conform to the political agenda of the White House. The 50-year norm that has shielded the justice department from presidential interference, dating back to Watergate days, has been shattered by Trump.

As an example of the weaponisation of the justice department, federal prosecutors stepped up their investigation of leading Democratic officials in Minnesota on Tuesday amid the ongoing immigration tussle with ICE. The governor, Tim Walz, Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, and several other top state Democrats were served subpoenas in what Frey said was a “crackdown on local voices” of opposition.

Trump has also expanded his war against lawyers beyond US borders. He has used executive orders to impose sanctions on 11 judges on the international criminal court at The Hague.

The president said the moves were in response to the court’s investigations into US military conduct in Afghanistan and the Israeli war in Gaza.

Vânia Costa Ramos, president of the European Criminal Bar Association that is a member of the coalition, said she feared the sanctions would put a chill on lawyers working with the ICC. She said that it was critical for people in the US and around the world to resist the intimidation.

“If lawyers and all citizens don’t stand up and denounce abuses and bring them to daylight, then in a few years we could see the entire US justice system impacted in ways that would be very difficult to reverse.”

Costa Ramos said that a fundamental principle of any democracy was that lawyers should be free to carry out their work. “Whenever there is a climate of threats, sanctions, or bankruptcy it makes lawyers think twice before they even take a case, and that would mark the end of a free legal profession.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1d0dda46f140e18623ffe4de78bbea4da6274d/513_0_5133_4107/master/5133.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a93dc0eda978f18bee2a7b7d2958fb90",N,,2026-01-22 11:39:04.892230

6 (acknowledging that because “other lines of business are not included in the health center’s total budget” they are “not subject to Health Center Program requirements and not eligible for related Health Center Program benefits”).","This article was originally published in the ABA’s Health Law Section, December 2025, and is reposted here with permission.

In July 2025, multiple federal agencies announced a reinterpretation of provisions of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), which prohibits “an alien who is not a qualified alien” from accessing “Federal public benefits,” unless an exception applies. The notice issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (the HHS Notice) declares the Health Center Program—which qualifies certain community clinics for federally qualified health center (FQHC) reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare and 340B drug pricing, among other benefits—to be one of thirteen newly identified Federal public benefit programs for which such “not qualified aliens” are not eligible under PRWORA.1

The HHS Notice is not law or regulation, and it has been preliminarily enjoined in some states by a federal district court.2 It may eventually be permanently blocked or narrowed by courts. In the meantime, the HHS Notice raises thorny practical issues for community clinics operating within the Health Center Program (Health Centers). As they evaluate their evolving compliance obligations, Health Centers should consider at least the following unanswered questions:

How does the HHS Notice apply to Health Centers? What in the Health Center Program does HHS now view as a “Federal public benefit”—is it the federal grants awarded to some qualifying community clinics, or does HHS also view ancillary features of Health Center status, such as FQHC reimbursement, to be “Federal public benefits”?

Could Health Centers be required to verify patient eligibility? Does the HHS Notice imply that individual Health Centers need to implement eligibility verification procedures for patients seeking services? Does it matter whether the Health Center is a nonprofit or public entity?

How will HHS enforce eligibility restrictions for the Health Center Program? What are the consequences if a Health Center inappropriately provides a “Federal public benefit” to an alien who is not a “qualified alien”? Can a Health Center provide services for ineligible individuals outside of its federal scope of project?

Following a brief discussion of the HHS Notice and current litigation, this article unpacks each of these critical questions.

How Did HHS Reinterpret “Federal Public Benefit” in its July 14 Notice?

The HHS Notice aims to broaden the prohibition in PRWORA on a non-citizen who is not a “qualified alien” from accessing “any Federal public benefit.”3 Similar notices were released by the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Justice (referred to collectively as the “PRWORA Notices”).4

The PRWORA Notices do not interpret what it means to be an alien who is “not a qualified alien.” Under PRWORA, all non-citizens are subject to the prohibition unless they fall within enumerated categories of “qualified aliens,” including non-citizens who have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States, have certain asylum or refugee status, or are lawfully resident in certain U.S. territories.5 Most individuals lawfully present on a temporary basis—such as individuals with a student visa or H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B work visas—are not qualified aliens. Individuals who do not have documentation of their immigration status are also not qualified aliens.

The statutory definition of “Federal public benefit” includes two prongs. Under the grant prong, a Federal public benefit is “any grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”6 Under the benefits prong, a Federal public benefit may also be “any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”7

The HHS Notice broadened the interpretation of “Federal public benefit” under both prongs to include an expanded set of federally funded social, educational, workforce, and emergency services. For example, the HHS Notice concludes that the Health Center Program, as well as federal block grants to states and localities, are Federal public benefits.

What is the Status of the Multi-State Litigation Challenging the PRWORA Notices?

The PRWORA Notices have been challenged in court by a group of 21 states and the District of Columbia.8 Specifically, in State of New York, et al v. U.S. Department of Justice, et al., the plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that the PRWORA Notices violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution and request the court enjoin defendants from implementing them in the plaintiff states.9 On September 10, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from enforcing or implementing the PRWORA Notices in the plaintiff states during the pendency of the lawsuit. With respect to Health Centers, the court concluded that the Health Center Program statute—which was enacted subsequent to PRWORA and requires Health Centers to provide services for all residents within its catchment area—exempts Health Centers from PRWORA limitations.10 On November 7, 2025, the defendant agencies appealed the court’s September 10 order to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.11 The appellant’s brief is due January 5, 2026.12

While litigation is likely to continue, it is important to note that following the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, courts are not required to afford the same level of deference to agencies such as HHS.13 While the federal administration has tried to argue that Loper Bright supports its reinterpretation, the first court to consider the issue did not share that view.14

How Does the HHS Notice Apply to Health Centers?

While the HHS Notice offers general reasoning for why HHS believes more of its programs are Federal public benefits, it does not address how this conclusion applies to particular programs. HHS has argued in ongoing litigation that it is not obligated to “minutely explain why every individual program listed in the HHS Notice provides Federal public benefits.”15 This reasoning gap is particularly important for the Health Center Program, which includes community clinics that receive federal grants as well as community clinics that meet similar qualifying criteria but do not receive any grant funds (i.e., lookalikes). The details of why HHS believes the Health Center Program is a Federal public benefit impacts which entities are subject to the HHS Notice and how it might be enforced against them.

For example, one straightforward position would be for HHS to view the Health Center Program as a Federal public benefit under the “grants” prong of the definition rather than the “benefits” prong. While it is indisputable that some Health Centers receive federal grants, it is much less clear that they constitute or administer a “health benefit.” The mere fact that Health Centers have a federal status qualifying them at times for favorable treatment (e.g., FQHC reimbursement, Federal Tort Claims Act protections, 340B drug pricing) does not obviously transform them from a provider of services into a Federal benefit “provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit.”

If the Health Center Program qualifies as a Federal public benefit solely under the “grants” prong of the definition, then Health Center lookalikes should not be subject to the PRWORA exclusion because they do not receive federal grants. In other words, there is a simple textual argument—not addressed by HHS in the Notice—that only certain clinics regulated under the Health Center Program should be subject to PRWORA even under HHS’s broader interpretations.

The application of PRWORA to Health Centers through the “grants” prong of the definition is also not straightforward. Health Center grants are available only to designated public and nonprofit private entities, not to individual persons.16 This raises a natural question: Does a Health Center comply with PRWORA merely by ensuring it does not distribute federal grant funds it receives directly to any alien who is not a “qualified alien”? The HHS Notice, focusing on narrow issues of statutory interpretation, does not defend—or even articulate—the more expansive alternative that PRWORA prohibits federal grantees from expending grant funds on activities that benefit aliens who are not qualified aliens.17 Yet certain HHS rhetoric in the Notice at least implies that HHS might believe its action to have a broader impact.18

Could Health Centers be Required to Verify Patient Eligibility?

Under PRWORA, non-citizens who are not qualified aliens are not “eligible” for any Federal public benefit, unless an exception applies.19 In addition, the law directs the U.S. Attorney General, after consultation with HHS, to promulgate regulations requiring verification that persons “applying for” a non-excepted Federal public benefit are qualified aliens and are eligible to receive such benefit.20 The Attorney General issued interim verification guidance in 1997, but has not issued regulations imposing affirmative verification obligations.21

Verification requirements are not substantively addressed in the HHS Notice.22 As a result, there is no new information about whether or how HHS expects Health Centers to conduct eligibility verification activities. The plain text of PRWORA provides, subject to a requirement for the Attorney General to promulgate regulations, that a “nonprofit charitable organization” is “not required under this chapter to determine, verify, or otherwise require proof of eligibility of any applicant for such benefits.”23 Because the Attorney General has not yet promulgated regulations, there is therefore a straightforward textualist argument that this statutory provision exempts the more than 16,000 nonprofit Health Center sites from conducting eligibility verification.24

While there is not a comparable statutory exemption directly applicable to the minority of public Health Centers, local government entities are not expressly required by PRWORA to verify eligibility. Instead, PRWORA most directly gives the states responsibility for verification by directing “a State that administers a program that provides a Federal public benefit” to “have in effect a verification system that complies with the regulations” issued by the Attorney General within 24 months of the date such regulations are adopted.25

In short, there is no clear requirement at this time for Health Centers to modify their eligibility verification processes—or direction about how to do so. While Health Centers may choose to make changes, they should take care to balance risks and benefits if they do so. For example, the potential benefits of reducing the likelihood of future PRWORA enforcement should be weighed against potential risks involving noncompliance with federal Health Center Program requirements to serve all residents of the catchment area and state discrimination claims grounded in disparate treatment of protected classes. Federal agencies may address the subject of eligibility verification in the future, such as through the Attorney General promulgating the verification regulations required by PRWORA.

How Will HHS Enforce Eligibility Restrictions for the Health Center Program?

Finally, the HHS Notice does not address enforcement. During the multi-state litigation discussed above, HHS agreed to stay enforcement and application of the Notice through September 10, 2025.26 And the court’s September 11 order temporarily enjoins HHS from enforcing or implementing the revised interpretation in the plaintiff states. As noted above, the preliminary injunction is currently on appeal before the First Circuit. At the time this article was drafted, appellate briefs had not yet been filed. In part for these reasons, there is limited information available about what enforcement would look like for Health Centers.

While the prior sections of this article underscore the uncertainty of whether and how PRWORA applies to Health Centers under the new HHS interpretation—and point to several defenses Health Centers could raise if faced with enforcement—there is nonetheless a risk that HHS may pursue termination of the Health Center status (and any accompanying federal grant) for a Health Center that knowingly provides services to aliens who are not “qualified aliens.”

One significant unanswered question is whether Health Centers that knowingly serve aliens who are not “qualified aliens” could insulate themselves from potential enforcement actions by carving those activities into a separate line of business outside their federal scope of project. Under this approach, the line of business would be separately accounted for so that no federal grant money would be used to pay for the services. There is a reasonable position that carved-out services would not constitute a Federal public benefit; for example, HHS guidance has long acknowledged that Health Centers need not comply with HHS requirements for separate lines of business.27

Conclusion

The HHS Notice demonstrates executive intent to exclude certain non-citizens from the Health Center Program. Courts have already begun to address the expanded interpretation and the government’s authority to issue the notices. For now, the interpretation of PRWORA—and its application to Health Centers—is deeply unsettled. Even apart from the overarching question of whether the notice is lawful and the new interpretation will be upheld, there are a number of critical follow-up questions about how it would be applied to the Health Center Program. Health Centers should ensure they have a thoughtful and defensible position on each of these questions as they consider potential changes to their operations.

State officials will probe whether the owner of a South Shore apartment building raided by federal agents in September in an extravaganza designed to go viral on social media tipped off immigration agents in an effort to force out Black and Latino residents, officials said.

The Illinois Department of Human Rights will investigate whether the three firms that own and manage the building at 7500 S. South Shore Drive committed housing discrimination, officials said.

The investigation will focus on “allegations that the building owner and management tipped federal officials about the presence of Venezuelan immigrants in the building in order to intimidate and coerce the building’s Black and Hispanic tenants into leaving the building, based on stereotypes or hostility toward Venezuelan immigrants,” according to a statement from state officials.

“These allegations of housing discrimination raise serious concerns for people struggling to maintain housing — and the communities that have been profiled and relentlessly targeted by the federal government during its violent immigration enforcement operations,” Governor JB Pritzker said in a statement. “State law prohibits discrimination, and that includes aiding or abetting conduct intended to interfere with housing and civil rights. Illinois will not tolerate conduct that puts anyone in Illinois at risk of discrimination or harm.“

Representatives of 7500 Shore A LLC, Trinity Flood, and Strength in Management LLC could not be reached for comment.

Pritzker, who is running for a third term as governor and considering a run for president in 2028, ordered state agencies on Oct. 3 to evaluate the treatment of four children detained during the Sept. 30 raid, which touched off an international furor.

No results from that probe have been announced.

Without providing evidence, federal officials said 300 agents raided the South Shore apartment building to arrest members of the Tren de Aragua criminal organization, which originated in Venezuela. Federal officials said 37 people were arrested, but no one was ever charged with a crime, ProPublica reported.

Federal officials have never disclosed why agents chose to raid a nondescript apartment building in the heart of South Shore. Some residents told reporters they saw people they believe to be federal agents in the building before the high-profile raid.

WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times found a map of the building after the raid that labeled each unit inside the five-floor building as “vacant,” “tenant” or as “firearms.”

White stickers, made out of duct tape and a marker, remained on the doors of units that had been broken down after the raid, according to WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times.

The apartment building became a home for dozens of migrants who made their way to Chicago from the southern border on buses paid for by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in an attempt to bolster President Donald Trump’s bid for reelection.

Approximately 300 federal agents conducted the late-night raid, with some landing on the building from Blackhawk helicopters, according to a video produced by federal officials and posted on social media.

Other agents arrived in moving vans and large trucks, according to the video.

The charge allows state officials to begin probing whether “armed federal agents in military uniforms forcibly entered nearly all the 130 units in the 5-story building,” according to a statement. “Agents dragged tenants and their children outside, separated them based on their race, ancestry, and national origin, and left them zip-tied for hours outside the building.”

State officials will also probe reports that when “tenants were permitted to return to the building, they found their doors kicked down or ripped from the hinges and their furniture and belongings removed, tossed, or damaged,” according to the statement. “The raid left their residences uninhabitable. The charge also alleges that within hours after the raid, workers employed or contracted by 7500 S Shore building management began putting tenants’ belongings in the trash and clearing out units vacated by the raid.”

“The conduct alleged in this matter reflects more than isolated harm,” Illinois Department of Human Rights Director Jim Bennett said in a statement. “It describes a pattern of intimidation that reverberates through our communities.”

A Cook County judge ordered all remaining residents of the building to move out no later than Dec. 10.

In another case on 14 January, ICE agents “pushed their way into an apartment” and detained a 17-year-old high school girl and her mother, Stenvik said.
“ICE agents have been roaming our neighborhoods, circling our schools, following our buses, coming into our parking lots and taking our kids,” Stenvik said.
They’re taking children.” School officials said some families were choosing to stay home out of fear of ICE.","US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained a five-year-old Minnesota boy on Tuesday as he returned home from school and transported him and his father to a Texas detention center, according to school officials.

Liam Ramos, a preschooler, and his father were taken into custody while in their driveway, the superintendent of the school district in Columbia Heights, a Minneapolis suburb, said at a press conference on Wednesday. Liam, who had recently turned five, is one of four children in the school district who have been detained by federal immigration agents during the Trump administration’s enforcement surge in the region over the last two weeks, the district said.

Liam and his father had just arrived home when they were detained, according to Zena Stenvik, the superintendent, who said she drove to the home when she learned of the detentions.

When she arrived, Stenvik said the father’s car was still running and the father and son had already been apprehended. An agent had taken Liam out of the car, led the boy to his front door and directed him to knock on the door asking to be let in, “in order to see if anyone else was home – essentially using a five-year-old as bait”, the superintendent said in a statement.

Stenvik said another adult living in the home was outside during the encounter and had pleaded to take care of Liam so the boy could avoid detention, but was denied. Liam’s older brother, a middle schooler, came home 20 minutes later to find his father and brother missing, Stenvik said. Two school principals from the district also arrived at the home to offer support.

Marc Prokosch, an attorney representing the family, said the family had an active asylum case and shared paperwork showing the father and son had arrived to the US at a port of entry, meaning an official crossing point.

“The family did everything they were supposed to in accordance with how the rules have been set out,” he said. “They did not come here illegally. They are not criminals.” He said there was no order of deportation against them and he believes the father and son have remained together in detention.

School officials released two photos of the encounter, one showing Liam, in a blue knit hat, outside his front door with a masked agent by his side, and another showing Liam standing by a car with a man holding on to his backpack.

“Why detain a five-year-old? You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal,” Stenvik said.

Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in a statement on Wednesday night that ICE was conducting a “targeted operation” to arrest Liam’s father, who she called an “illegal alien”. “ICE did NOT target a child,” she said. McLaughlin also alleged the father “fled on foot – abandoning his child”, saying, “For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended [his father].

“Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates,” she added.

The school district provided a statement from Liam’s teacher, who expressed shock over the boy’s detention: “Liam is a bright young student. He is so kind and loving, and his classmates miss him. He comes into class every day and just brightens the room. All I want is for him to be back here and safe.”

The detention of a young child will have ripple effects, said Prokosch. “Once his classmates learn the government took him away … I’m not qualified to talk about how much damage that is going to cause. It’s not just the family, it’s the entire community and all of those kids who are now going to be facing secondary trauma.”

Also on Tuesday, a 17-year-old Columbia Heights student was taken by “armed and masked agents” without parents present, Stenvik said. That student was removed from their car, she said.

In another case on 14 January, ICE agents “pushed their way into an apartment” and detained a 17-year-old high school girl and her mother, Stenvik said.

And in a fourth case, on 6 January, a 10-year-old fourth-grade student was allegedly taken by ICE on her way to elementary school with her mother. The superintendent said the 10-year-old called her father during the arrests and said that ICE agents would bring her to school, but when the father arrived at the school, he discovered both his daughter and wife had been taken. By the end of that school day, the mother and daughter were in a detention center in Texas.

Stenvik reported that as school officials were preparing for the press conference on Wednesday afternoon, an ICE vehicle drove on to the property of the district’s high school and were told by administrators to leave.

“ICE agents have been roaming our neighborhoods, circling our schools, following our buses, coming into our parking lots and taking our kids,” Stenvik said.

The DHS did not respond to inquiries about the other arrests and the report of ICE’s arrival on campus.

In an interview after the press conference, the superintendent said the arrests and looming presence of ICE had taken an enormous toll on students, parents and school staff.

“Our children are traumatized. The sense of safety in our community and around our schools is shaken,” Stenvik said. “I can speak on behalf of all school staff when I say our hearts are shattered. After our fourth student was taken yesterday, I just thought someone has to hear the story. They’re taking children.”

School officials said some families were choosing to stay home out of fear of ICE.

Stenvik said school leaders were working to aid families affected by ICE. “Our role is to educate children during the school day. But now we’re trying to help people navigate this legal system.” She added: “Our main priority is to keep children safe. They’re children. They are not violent criminals. They are little kids.”

One year after Donald Trump’s second inauguration, a pattern emerges. Across dozens of executive orders, agency memos, funding decisions and enforcement changes, the administration has weakened federal civil rights law and the foundations of the country’s racially inclusive democracy.

From the start, the U.S. was not built to include everyone equally. The Constitution protected and promoted slavery. Most states limited voting to white men. Congress restricted naturalized citizenship to “free white persons.” These choices were not accidents. They shaped who could belong and who could exercise political power, and they entrenched a racial political majority that lasted for generations.

That began to change in the 1960s. After decades of protest and pressure, Congress enacted laws that prohibited discrimination in employment, education, voting, immigration and housing.

Federal agencies were charged with enforcing those laws, collecting data to identify discrimination and conditioning public funds on compliance. These choices reshaped U.S. demographics and institutions, with the current Congress “the most racially and ethnically diverse in history,” according to the Pew Research Center. The laws did not eliminate racial inequality, but they made exclusion easier to see and harder to defend.

The first year of the second Trump administration marks a sharp reversal.

Cumulative retreat

Rather than repealing civil rights statutes outright, the administration has focused on disabling the mechanisms that make those laws work.

Drawing on over two decades of teaching and writing about civil rights and my experience directing a GW Law project on inclusive democracy, I believe this pattern reflects not isolated administrative actions but a cumulative retreat from the federal government’s role as an enforcer of civil rights law.

Over the past year, the president and his administration have taken a series of connected actions:

• On its first day in office, announced the end of all federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, including diversity officers, equity plans and related grants and contracts.

• Shut down or sharply cut funding for federal programs aimed at reducing inequality, including offices focused on minority health, minority-owned businesses, fair federal contracting, environmental justice and closing the digital divide in broadband.

• Warned schools that diversity programs could jeopardize their federal funding, opened investigations into colleges offering scholarships to students protected under DACA – the Obama-era policy providing deportation protection for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children – and signaled that colleges risk losing federal student aid if their accrediting agencies consider diversity.

• Revoked security clearances and access to federal buildings for employees at law firms with diversity policies. The FCC investigated media companies for promoting diversity and threatened to block mergers by companies with similar programs, leading several companies to drop their initiatives.

• Issued a government-wide memo labeling common best practices in hiring, admissions and other selection and evaluation processes – such as compiling diverse applicant pools, valuing cultural competence, considering first-generation or low-income status and seeking geographic and demographic representation – as potentially legally suspect. The memo warned that federal funding could be cut to schools, employers and state and local governments using such practices. Federal prosecutors reportedly investigated federal contractors that consider diversity, characterizing such initiatives as fraud.

• Weakened enforcement against discrimination by ordering agencies to stop using disparate impact analysis. That kind of analysis identifies disparities in outcomes, assesses whether they are justified by legitimate objectives, and intervenes when they are not. The Department of Justice, the EEOC, the National Credit Union Administration and other agencies complied and dropped disparate impact analysis. Because algorithmic systems typically operate without explicit intent, eliminating disparate impact analysis reduces federal agencies’ ability to detect and address discriminatory outcomes produced by increasingly automated government and private-sector decision-making.

• Rescinded an executive order that barred discrimination by federal contractors, required steps to ensure nondiscriminatory hiring and employment, and subjected contractors to federal compliance reviews and record-keeping. This weakened a key mechanism used since 1965 to detect and remedy workplace discrimination.

• Eliminated data used to track inequality, including rolling back guidance encouraging schools to collect data on racial disparities in discipline and special education. The administration also removed data used to identify racial disparities in environmental harms.

• Dismantled or sharply reduced civil rights offices across federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Education. About three-quarters of lawyers in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division left.

• Pressured the Smithsonian to remove exhibits about racial injustice, restored Confederate monuments and military base names, and barred schools and teacher training programs from including material the administration labeled divisive, such as unconscious bias.

• Declared English the nation’s only official language, repealed a requirement that federal agencies provide meaningful access to government programs and services for people with limited English proficiency, and prompted the General Services Admininistration and the departments of Justice, Education and other agencies to scale back language-assistance requirements and services.

• Attempted to limit birthright citizenship guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and adopted practices that treat ethnicity and non-English accents as legitimate reasons for immigration stops.

The pattern is hard to miss

Taken together, these shifts have practical consequences.

When agencies stop collecting data on racial disparities, discrimination becomes harder to detect. When disparate impact analysis is abandoned, unfair practices with no legitimate purpose go unchallenged. When diversity programs are chilled through investigations and funding threats, institutions respond by narrowing opportunity. When history and language are recast as threats to unity, truth and freedom of speech and thought are suppressed and undermined.

Administration officials argue that these steps are needed to prevent discrimination against white people, promote unity, ensure “colorblind equality” and comply with a Supreme Court decision that struck down affirmative action in college admissions. But that ruling did not ban awareness of racial inequality, or neutral policies aimed at reducing it. Many of the administration’s actions rely on broad claims of illegality without providing specific violations.

The selective nature of enforcement is also telling.

Books about racism and civil rights were removed from military libraries, while books praising Nazi ideas or claiming racial intelligence differences were left untouched. The administration suspended admissions of refugees – over 90% of whom have been from Africa, Asia and Latin America in recent years – but then reopened the refugee program for white South Africans.

One year in, the pattern is hard to miss.

The administration is not simply applying neutral rules. It is dismantling the systems that once helped the U.S. move toward a more open and equal democracy. It is replacing them with policies that selectively narrow access to economic, cultural and educational participation.

The result is not simply a change in policy, but a fundamental shift in the trajectory of American democracy.

Trump faces his own public opinion challenges The president’s approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.","WASHINGTON — Democrats had planned to campaign in the midterm elections on affordability and health care, two issues where Americans are particularly unhappy with President Donald Trump.

But the aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good during a confrontation with federal agents, has scrambled the party’s playbook.

Now Democrats are trying to translate visceral outrage into political strategy, even though there’s little consensus on how to press forward on issues where the party has recently struggled to earn voters’ trust.

Some Democrats want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a proposal that echoes “defund the police” rhetoric from Trump’s first term, and impeach administration officials such as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Others have taken a different approach, introducing legislation intended to curb alleged abuses by federal agents. But those ideas have been criticized by activists as insufficient, and there is mounting pressure to obstruct funding for deportations.

“We’re Democrats. I’m sure we’re going to have 50 different ideas and 50 different ways to say it,” said Chuck Rocha, a party strategist who is advising several House and Senate candidates on immigration this year.

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under Democratic President Joe Biden helped return Trump, a Republican, to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden’s former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

“It’s not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people’s civil and human rights,” she told The Associated Press. “This country has done that before, and it can do it again.”

Violent scenes force a strong Democratic response

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

“I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,” said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. “We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,” Garcia added, “which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.”

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats.

On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared with 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

“If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

“I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for ICE to be doing this,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last week. “The cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this.”

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

Trump faces his own public opinion challenges

The president’s approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling, from 49% in March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

“Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it’s going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,” he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party’s strategy since Good’s death was captured on video.

“I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,” he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

“Are we really going to be the Gestapo?” he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state’s Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said “there’s a lot of pain and anguish.”

“It’s heartbreaking,” he said in a recent interview. “It’s chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.”

Indeed, this was the basis for declaring similar efforts in Trump’s first term unconstitutional.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that this was unconstitutional.
These cases reflect the Supreme Court’s upholding of the basic principles of federalism, which safeguard the autonomy of state and local governments.
Federal authorities — such as ICE and border patrol agents — can enforce federal law so long as they do so in a manner consistent with the Constitution.","The president cannot constitutionally threaten to withhold funds from so-called sanctuary cities.

If he carries out his threat to cut off funds to jurisdictions that resist his immigration policies, President Donald Trump will violate the Constitution. In a speech on Tuesday, January 13, Trump announced that starting February 1, he will deny federal funding to any states that are home to local governments resisting his administration’s immigration policies.

This, of course, is not the first time Trump has made threats to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with deportation efforts led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He tried to do exactly this in his first term, only for the federal courts to declare his actions unconstitutional. Last year, just a day after the inauguration, Acting Deputy Attorney General (and now federal court of appeals judge) Emil Bove wrote a memo to the Justice Department calling on United States Attorneys to prosecute state and local officials who do not cooperate with the deportation efforts of the Trump administration.

President Trump also has expressed this, saying that state and local officials face prosecution for failing to assist his immigration policies.

These pronouncements, which obviously are meant to intimidate state and local governments, ignore the constitutional limits on the ability of the federal government to coerce state and local governments to carry out federal mandates. The Supreme Court has long held that the federal government may not commandeer state and local governments and force them to administer federal mandates.

In 1992, in New York v. United States, the Court declared unconstitutional a federal law that required that every state clean up its nuclear waste by 1996 or face significant legal consequences. The Court held that this violates state sovereignty and the Tenth Amendment. In an opinion by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the Court explained that Congress can try to induce state and local governments to act, but forcing them to adopt laws or enact regulations is unconstitutional. For example, when Congress wanted there to be a 21 year old drinking age it said that every state receiving federal highway money had to adopt this or it would lose five percent of those funds. This was deemed to induce, but not coerce state and local governments to act.

Under the Constitution, state and local governments are not enforcement arms of the federal government and cannot be treated as such.

The Court extended this in 1997, in Printz v. United States, declaring unconstitutional a provision of the Brady Handgun Control Act that required state and local law enforcement departments to conduct background checks before issuing permits for firearms. Once more, the Court said that the federal government could do its own background checks, but it could not conscript state and local governments and compel them to administer a federal law. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, stressed that the federal government cannot require state and local governments to serve as its enforcement arm — and concluded that it violates the Tenth Amendment for Congress to commandeer the states and force them to administer a federal mandate.

More recently, in 2018, in Murphy v. NCAA, the Court unanimously concluded that the federal government could not force New Jersey to have a law banning betting on college sports. Congress certainly could use its power to regulate commerce among the states to prohibit such gambling everywhere in the country. But the Court, in an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, ruled that it violates the Tenth Amendment for Congress to compel that state legislatures adopt laws.

Thus, the law is clear that Trump cannot force state and local governments to assist federal immigration officials. This would be impermissible commandeering.

Indeed, this was the basis for declaring similar efforts in Trump’s first term unconstitutional. Then, too, Trump adopted a policy to cut off federal law enforcement money to local governments that did not cooperate with ICE. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that this was unconstitutional. Also, California, during the first Trump term, adopted a law limiting state and local cooperation with federal immigration officials. A federal district court upheld this law as constitutional.

There is a separate, important constitutional reason why Trump cannot unilaterally cut off funds: Only Congress, not the president, has the spending power and can set conditions on the receipt of federal money. The Supreme Court has held that the legislature can put strings on federal grants, but only if the conditions are clearly stated, they relate to the purpose of the program and they are not unduly coercive. Congress has not conditioned federal law enforcement money on state and local governments cooperating with ICE. As mentioned above, this is why Congress could say that state governments would lose five percent of their federal highway money if they did not set a 21-year-old drinking age: the condition was clearly stated, it related to the purpose of the highway funds and five percent was not unduly coercive. The Trump administration cannot add requirements that are not found in the federal spending law.

Throughout American history, it has been conservatives, and conservative justices, who have championed states’ rights and federalism.

Additionally, the Supreme Court has been clear that the federal government cannot coerce state and local action by withholding federal funds. In 2012, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the Court declared unconstitutional a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required state governments receiving Medicaid funds to provide coverage to those within 133% of the federal poverty level. Those not complying would lose all federal Medicaid funds. The Court said that this was “dragooning” the states, impermissibly commandeering them to comply with a federal mandate. Such coercion, it ruled, violated the Tenth Amendment.

But that is exactly what Trump is trying to do if he cuts off money to state and local governments for not adequately cooperating with federal immigration officials. He is using federal money to coerce state and local governments that disagree with his immigration policies.

These cases reflect the Supreme Court’s upholding of the basic principles of federalism, which safeguard the autonomy of state and local governments. These are not new, and they are not historically liberal. Quite the contrary: Throughout American history, it has been conservatives, and conservative justices, who have championed states' rights and federalism. That is why it is realistic to imagine that the Roberts Court, which so far has generally been supportive of President Trump, would be likely to rule against his administration if he carries through his threats to cut off federal funds to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities to his satisfaction.

To be clear, despite the use of the phrase “sanctuary cities,” that is a misnomer. No state or city can or does protect undocumented individuals from ICE enforcement or deportation. Rather, “sanctuary cities” are jurisdictions that say that they will not explicitly assist the federal government in its immigration efforts. In other words, the state or local government cannot literally provide sanctuary to anyone, but they also don’t have to assist the federal government’s immigration enforcement efforts.

There are compelling reasons for cities to adopt such policies. Law enforcement agencies are understandably concerned that victims of crime and witnesses to crime will not come forward to the police if they fear deportation. This is not a new concern. In 1979, the Los Angeles Police Department adopted Special Order 40, which provides that “Officers shall not initiate police action with the objective of discovering the alien status of a person. Officers shall not arrest nor book persons for [violating] the United States Immigration code.”

Public health officials worry that sick people, including those with communicable diseases, will not go for treatment if they fear that it could lead to their deportation. Education officials fear that parents will not send their children to school if they think it might lead to deportation. This is not hypothetical. Cities are reporting significant absenteeism in schools as parents fear ICE actions there.

Under the Constitution, state and local governments are not enforcement arms of the federal government and cannot be treated as such. Federal authorities — such as ICE and border patrol agents — can enforce federal law so long as they do so in a manner consistent with the Constitution. But whether state and local governments wish to cooperate is entirely up to them. Cutting off funds from jurisdictions that don’t assist ICE would be unconstitutional.","https://images.prismic.io/vitalcity/aXIxEAIvOtkhB0eb_25295032366785.jpg?auto=format,compress",N,,2026-01-22 09:57:45.508804

Democrats oppose DHS funding bill over immigration crackdown

House Democrats protest ICE actions, citing lack of guardrails

Spending bills show Congress reasserting control over federal spending

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday were girding to oppose a Department of Homeland Security funding bill, in protest of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, which could risk a partial government shutdown at the end of the month.

This comes as Congress stares down a January 31 deadline to pass spending bills to keep federal agencies across the Trump administration operating, or risk the second government shutdown in four months.

Lawmakers have made progress on that front so far, as several of those bills have won the support of Republican and Democratic negotiators.

But leading Democrats in the House are planning to oppose the Homeland Security spending bill as the nation is reeling over the January 7 killing of a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.

Democratic leaders say the bill lacks sufficient guardrails against ICE excesses and their opposition could prompt many rank-and-file Democrats to follow suit.

""They should not be able to fire at moving vehicles unless their life is in danger and they are and that's wrong,"" No. 2 House Democrat Pete Aguilar of California told reporters on Wednesday.

Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said the bill empowers frontline agents to uphold immigration laws.

With Republicans' razor-thin 218-213 House majority, it was unclear whether Speaker Mike Johnson could win passage of the $64.4 billion bill. Prospects are also unclear in the Senate.

Defeat could trigger furloughs of DHS workers deemed ""unessential,"" which likely would not have an impact on ICE operations. Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" enacted last year, lavished ICE with an additional $75 billion whether or not the House passed the DHS spending bill.

Some Democrats are calling on colleagues to recognize their limits and support the package.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of (ICE) accountability we need,"" said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, referring to November's congressional elections.

Aside from the immigration dispute, experts say the spending bills show some evidence that Congress is moving to reassert its control over federal spending, after Trump refused to spend billions of dollars that had already been signed into law last year.

Brendan Duke of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the spending bills protect many programs targeted by Trump, such as medical research, housing and education.

""We will see if President Trump respects this agreement,"" he said.

Party leaders told a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that they would vote against the homeland security funding bill, citing insufficient provisions to rein in Immigration Customs and Enforcement, more widely known by its acronym.
“I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,” she said.
I encourage my colleagues to review the bill and determine what is best for their constituents and communities.” But she added: “The Homeland Security funding bill is more than just ICE.

Party leaders told a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that they would vote against the homeland security funding bill, citing insufficient provisions to rein in Immigration Customs and Enforcement, more widely known by its acronym.

Signals for a no vote came from Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader in the House of Representatives, along with Pete Aguilar, the chairman of the party’s caucus, and Katherine Clark, the chief whip.

Their sentiments are expected to influence the vast majority of the Democrats’ 213-strong House caucus to vote no – although sufficient Democrats are believed to be ready to vote in favor to enable the legislation to pass. The party has no plans to whip its members into line to enforce the leadership view.

The anticipated Democratic thumbs-down comes despite provisions in the bill that keeps the agency’s $10bn annual budget flat, reduces ICE enforcement and removal operations, and imposes a 5,500 reduction to its number of detention beds. The legislation also secured $20m for the “procurement, deployment, and operations of body worn cameras” to be worn by ICE agents, thanks to Democrats’ efforts.

Such palliatives are unlikely to placate anger in the party over the agency’s operations in Minnesota, including the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a mother of three, in Minneapolis, this month.

“In the last 24 hours, we’ve heard our members speak loudly that ICE isn’t doing enough, these reforms aren’t doing enough. This lawlessness has to stop,” Aguilar told reporters after the meeting. “They are only doing this because the president of the United States wants to use them to terrorize communities, to terrorize US citizens.”

Rosa DeLauro, a representative from Connecticut and the ranking Democrat on the appropriations committee, said it was still better for the bill to pass rather than run the risk of a renewed government shutdown that could affect other agencies. “I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,” she said.

“I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency. I encourage my colleagues to review the bill and determine what is best for their constituents and communities.”

But she added: “The Homeland Security funding bill is more than just ICE. If we allow a lapse in funding, TSA [transportation security administration] agents will be forced to work without pay, Fema [federal emergency management agency] assistance could be delayed, and the US Coast Guard will be adversely affected. All while ICE continues functioning without any change in their operations due to $75 billion it received in the One Big Beautiful Bill.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/065fc575db672d238064bb2766da740ede256289/577_0_5419_4335/master/5419.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4fcdf26e11fa76626b29b2fc8ca94ae",N,,2026-01-22 11:38:57.154660

These lawmakers are on the right track, but they need not have waited so long. Throughout her year at the Department of Homeland Security, Noem has shown disregard for judicial and congressional authority, and she has misled the American people. Her leadership is endangering the country. She should be removed from office before she can do more of the same and worse.

As secretary, Noem has displayed a troubling pattern of unethical behavior. Her infamous photo op last March, posing in front of detainees in El Salvador’s CECOT prison, was not just grotesque; it may have violated Geneva Convention provisions against the public exploitation of prisoners.

In October, Noem ordered a video blaming Democrats for the government shutdown to be played at airports nationwide. This was in direct conflict with the Hatch Act, which restricts federal employees from engaging in partisan political activity.

In November, the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica reported that a company tied to Noem got money from $220-million Homeland Security ad contracts in a secret, no-bid process.

None of these instances reflect sound judgment by the person charged with keeping our country safe.

Noem does not seem to respect the judicial branch. She defied a federal judge by not turning around deportation flights to El Salvador last March. Her agents in Chicago have used chemical sprays on protesters multiple times despite a court order forbidding them from doing so. Speaking on “Meet the Press” in November, Noem said, “We’ll continue to do the right thing, continue to work and protect Americans, no matter what radical judge comes out and tries to stop us.” These actions, coupled with her own words, reveal an unacceptable disdain for our constitutional system of checks and balances.

Under Noem, officials from the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have flouted congressional authority. Members of Congress have for months been denied their lawful right to inspect detention facilities in Minnesota, New Jersey, Florida and California. Such oversight is critical to protecting the well-being of detainees, especially because the department gutted its own watchdog agencies.

Noem has also made false or misleading statements to Congress, the press and the public. She made so many derogatory remarks about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man deported by mistake to El Salvador, that a federal judge rebuked her for inflammatory comments. Noem has often declared that ICE does not detain or deport U.S. citizens, even though it does. ProPublica has, in fact, documented more than 170 cases of Americans detained by immigration agents. And although Noem likes to repeat that ICE agents are going after “the worst of the worst,” internal agency data show that they have arrested nearly 75,000 people with no criminal records.

When summoned before a congressional committee in December, Noem struck a defiant tone. “I will consider your asking me to resign as an endorsement of my work,” she told one lawmaker. However, this was before the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis. Now the public appears to have lost confidence in Noem, whose job approval recently slipped to 36%.

True, Noem was appointed by President Trump to execute his aggressive immigration enforcement agenda. Anyone else put in the role would probably also have carried out these policies.

It is how Noem has carried out her responsibilities that demonstrates unfitness for her job — not only pursuing the president’s agenda but also racking up a body count, defying the law and lying.

She is also failing at the most basic functions of her role. Consider that, under her leadership, FEMA has been widely faulted for responding too slowly to natural disasters in Texas and North Carolina. Or that Noem has allowed department social media accounts to feature white nationalist memes and questionable messaging, including recruitment posts saying, “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?”

Noem’s tenure has already had grave consequences. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the agency’s deadliest year in more than two decades. During Trump’s second term, immigration agents have shot at people at least 16 times.

Americans need a Homeland Security secretary who will follow the law, respect Congress and tell the truth to the public. Kristi Noem is not that person. Under her, the department is harming citizens, not protecting them. Lawmakers should press her impeachment forward and remove her from office — unless she has the decency to resign first.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b5aea9a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5141x2699+0+364/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffe%2Fcd%2F5ace0e3b4dd3be72939a0be442f1%2F2256461977.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 09:37:36.645055

The Justice Department has refused to open a criminal investigation into the shooting, hastily declaring it an act of self-defense that does not warrant a criminal inquiry. But despite statements by administration officials to the contrary, there is more than enough for DOJ to investigate here. I know from experience.

For over a decade, I was a prosecutor in the Criminal Section of DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, the office dedicated to—and staffed with experts on—investigating and prosecuting officer-involved shootings and other uses of excessive force. From reviewing, investigating, and prosecuting law-enforcement misconduct cases, I know both whether and how DOJ, across administrations, would look into something like the Jan. 7 shooting.

I also know just how challenging such investigations can be and how difficult these cases are to prove. Prosecutors must first find that the force used was excessive as a matter of constitutional law. That means, in Fourth Amendment parlance, the force was an objectively unreasonable seizure. Prosecutors must prove this under a legal standard that explicitly allows “for the fact that [] officers are often forced to make split-second judgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396-97 (1989).

And even if the force is excessive, prosecutors must also prove the agent’s intent. The law sets an exceptionally high bar here. Prosecutors must prove that the agent acted “willfully,” meaning that he must have had the specific intent to deprive someone of a constitutional right. As I and many other civil rights prosecutors have explained to juries in these cases, willfulness requires the agent to know what he is doing is wrong and decide to do it anyway, one of the most stringent mens rea requirements in criminal law. That standard permits prosecution of agents who purposefully or consciously choose to act in violation of the Constitution (not to mention in violation of their training and experience). But it precludes prosecution of agents who, no matter how unreasonable their use of force, nonetheless acted unknowingly, negligently, or in the good faith (but incorrect) belief that the force was necessary. One result of these requirements is that federal prosecutions for excessive force are typically brought only on the most unassailable evidence and are, in the grand scheme of things, relatively rare.

This legal framework is governed by 18 U.S.C. § 242, the statute DOJ uses to prosecute excessive force cases at the federal level. That provision makes it a crime when “[w]hoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.” The statute, which dates to the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era, applies when any government official, including an immigration agent, willfully violates a person’s constitutional rights. The Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, often in partnership with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices across the country, has used that statute to successfully prosecute cases like the Rodney King beating, the fatal shooting of Walter Scott, and the murder of George Floyd, among others.

Since Good’s shooting, facts have incrementally emerged that point to both the excessiveness of Agent Ross’s use of force and to his intent. Exhaustive reporting has helped establish many of the circumstances surrounding the Jan. 7 shooting, including through a multi-angle, step-by-step analysis of the incident. It’s a good start in determining whether the force was unreasonable. The fact that agents had been able to pass by Good’s vehicle; that Good was clearly turning her steering wheel and vehicle away from the agents at the time shots were fired; that there was a notable gap between Agent’s Ross’s body and the vehicle, at least at the time of the second and third shots; that he was the only agent on the scene to even attempt to use any kind of force—all indicate that resorting to deadly force was not reasonable under the circumstances. Prosecutors would, of course, want to test, corroborate, and build on that evidence through, among other things, ballistics analysis, complete autopsy and medical reports, and witnesses accounts. Definitively establishing where the agent was positioned when he fired the shot that, according to an independent medical pathologist’s report, struck the left side of Good’s head and likely killed her, will be critical.

The more difficult question, as in so many of these cases, is one of intent. Prosecutors must prove the agent’s thinking and motivation. To this end, there is evidence that Agent Ross did not view Ms. Good as an imminent physical threat. Multiple videos show, for instance, that Agent Ross’s own vehicle was able to get around Ms. Good’s SUV, that he chose to walk around the front of Ms. Good’s vehicle (thereby exposing himself to possible harm, and against DHS policy) with one hand occupied by a cell phone, and that, just prior to the shooting, Ms. Good told the agents, “I’m pulling out.” Other evidence suggests that Agent Ross may have shot because he felt annoyed or disrespected by Ms. Good and her partner, rather than out of fear for his safety. The former are improper motivations that would support § 242’s willfulness prong. From the outset, for example, videos show that Ms. Good and her partner stopped their SUV in the street and honked the horn repeatedly in apparent protest of the ICE agents. Additionally—and courtesy of the agent’s own cellphone video, which importantly provides a view of the incident from his perspective—we can hear Ms. Good say, “That’s fine dude, I’m not mad at you,” and her partner sarcastically tell Agent Ross to “go get yourself some lunch, big boy.” Perhaps giving a window into his irritation at these remarks or Ms. Good’s attempt to drive away, Agent Ross muttered after firing his weapon at her, “f*cking b*tch.” He walked away from Ms. Good’s SUV, which had by that point crashed into a parked vehicle (a clear sign that Ms. Good was injured or dead), and gestured to someone else to “call 911.”

Together, these facts are more than enough to show the allegation that Agent Ross willfully used excessive force when he shot Ms. Good is a serious one. And because that allegation, if proven, would constitute a violation of federal law, it is wholly appropriate to open a formal investigation into the shooting. (Indeed, it is no wonder that an initial FBI review reportedly concluded that opening an investigation was justified.)

Based on my experience, further investigation should build on the early indications of Agent Ross’s intent. That issue will almost certainly boil down to whether evidence shows the agent actually did fear for his (or others’) safety, or whether he unlawfully acted out of anger, in retaliation, or to stop Ms. Good as she drove away. On the last point: to the extent Agent Ross was taught even the most basic law governing uses of force, he was likely told that the use of deadly force to prevent someone who poses no immediate threat from escaping is constitutionally unreasonable. Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 11 (1985).

What specifically would investigators look for? Several categories of evidence are relevant here, and the list below is far from exhaustive:

Radio traffic and witness accounts that might capture, in real time, how Agent Ross experienced the incident and in particular any comments he made before, during, and after the shooting that could provide a window into his mindset;

Medical records for Agent Ross, which, in addition to bearing on allegations that Ross was hit by Ms. Good’s vehicle and suffered internal bleeding, may contain the agent’s account of whether and how he received any injuries;

Witness accounts, particularly from other agents on the scene who experienced the incident from a similar vantage point and who could speak to whether they viewed Ms. Good as a physical threat;

Routine incident and use-of-force reports from Agent Ross and others containing their accounts of the shooting, which could reveal inconsistencies between early and later accounts;

Training records, to determine whether Agent Ross’s actions were consistent with or in contravention of how he was taught and trained; and

Other personnel records to identify prior uses of force or displays of his firearm and any resulting remediation or discipline that might have put Agent Ross on notice about unlawful force.

None of these investigative steps remotely resembles how this administration has approached the shooting. In the wake of Ms. Good’s death, administration officials rushed to judgment, suggesting that the agent shot Ms. Good in self defense and condemning Ms. Good’s actions as “domestic terrorism.” Less than three hours after the incident, DHS tweeted that Ms. Good had “weaponized her vehicle” and “attempt[ed] to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.” With no investigation whatsoever, DHS apparently concluded that the agent had “fired defensive shots” out of fear for his and others’ lives. In line with these premature conclusions, the administration has refused to seriously examine what happened. On Jan. 13, DOJ Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche declared that there was “no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” Blanche has since reiterated his belief that it is not “appropriate to investigate” the shooting and has definitively stated that DOJ is “not investigating.”

But only after completing a fair and thorough investigation involving the steps described above (and likely many others) would prosecutors be able to decide whether to pursue criminal charges—which requires that they believe the “conduct constitutes a federal offense, and that the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction” by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This process—from initial allegation through investigation to charging decision—is highly important. It supports the legitimacy of our criminal justice system by allowing charges to be brought only when supported by evidence obtained through an unbiased investigation. It seeks to spare crime victims the heartache of acquittals or dismissals for insufficient evidence. It benefits officers, too. The process ensures that any decision to decline charges is credibly based on a thorough review, rather than a political whim. And finally, a careful investigation serves an important social good by helping ensure that the rules around the use of force are carefully followed and signaling to officers that, this administration’s false assurances aside, they do not have absolute immunity for criminal conduct.

Perhaps an investigation would ultimately support the administration’s predetermination that the Jan. 7 shooting does not merit prosecution. Perhaps not. Additional evidence is sure to emerge that could cut either for or against seeking charges. But it is absolutely clear that the evidence at this point is more than sufficient to justify opening a criminal investigation into the agent’s conduct—a step that would be consistent with decades of DOJ practice and, until recently, would have been considered largely unremarkable.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255170397.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 12:38:09.180564

""The Maine Law Enforcement Coalition calls on elected officials, advocacy groups, and media outlets to act responsibly,"" said the coalition, whose members include the Maine Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, the Maine State Law Enforcement Association, the Maine Association of Police and the Maine State Troopers Association.
""We can't rise to take the bait,"" said Bennett, a former chairman of the Maine Republican Party.","The increased presence of federal law enforcement in Maine is raising tensions in some communities — and among state political leaders.

Republicans are welcoming federal immigration agents and accusing Democrats, including Gov. Janet Mills, of inflammatory rhetoric that could endanger federal agents and the public. Democrats, meanwhile, respond that they are looking out for the civil rights of Maine residents in the wake of the heavy-handed tactics seen in Minneapolis and other cities.

The full extent of the federal operation in Maine remains unclear even as reports begin emerging about detentions and communities targeted by immigration agents. Mills said Wednesday that her administration is maintaining close contact with officials in Portland and Lewiston — two cities frequently mentioned as likely targets of immigration enforcement — and with organizations across the state.

""If the Federal government has warrants, then it should show them,"" Mills said in a statement on Wednesday. ""But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the Federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors — none of which is welcome.”

In a press conference on Tuesday, Republican lawmakers accused Democrats — including Mills — of fanning the flames of fear.

""The governor's remarks last week have really served to only escalate tensions and concerns, particularly around public safety, both for law enforcement and the general public here in the state of Maine,"" said Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart of Presque Isle.

Stewart was referring to a 3-minute video released by Mills on Jan. 14 as state and municipal officials began hearing about a surge in federal law enforcement coming to Maine. In that video, Mills pledged to protect the safety and the rights of Maine residents and urged anyone protesting to so peacefully and to ""meet any hostility with reserve and resolve.""

But Mills added: ""To the Federal government I say this: if your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused – those tactics are not welcome here.""

Stewart described the situation since last week as a feeding frenzy on the political left. And Stewart said that frenzy is being led or inspired by Democratic leaders like Mills and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows as they run for higher office. Mills is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican Sen. Susan Collins while Bellows hopes to win the Democratic ticket to succeed Mills.

""And unfortunately what our concern is with that, as things continue to escalate in that regard, you are going to see people take what she says to heart, take what other Democratic leaders say and take it seriously,"" Stewart said. ""And when that happens, the end result is going to be that people get hurt.""

That's a concern echoed by police officials.

In a rare statement issued last weekend, the Maine Law Enforcement Coalition raised concerns about ""inflammatory political rhetoric and misleading public narratives"" without naming names.

""The Maine Law Enforcement Coalition calls on elected officials, advocacy groups, and media outlets to act responsibly,"" said the coalition, whose members include the Maine Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, the Maine State Law Enforcement Association, the Maine Association of Police and the Maine State Troopers Association. ""De-escalation, accuracy, and accountability must take precedence over political gain. Public safety depends on it.""

Not all Democrats are unified in their messaging.

On Wednesday, Democratic Congressman Jared Golden, who lives in Lewiston, released a statement saying that as long as the federal law enforcement operations are targeting individuals who have engaged in criminal activities then ""I believe it legitimately serves the public interest.""

In an interview with Fox News earlier this week, a deputy assistant director at ICE said the surge in Maine that they've dubbed operation ""Catch of the day"" is targeting approximately 1,400 people with such offenses as drug trafficking, assault, sexual assault of children and driving under the influence. The Fox News report said that 50 people had been detained on Tuesday.

But Senate President Mattie Daughtry, a Democrat from Brunswick, said federal officials have not been responsive to the state.

""We're getting more information from watching Fox News than from official communications,"" Daughtry said.

Daughtry flatly rejected Republican suggestions that Mills and other Democratic leaders have been using inflammatory rhetoric that could incite violence against federal agents or others. She said Democrats are urging people to behave peacefully — but also to know their rights.

""When we are seeing families separated, people scared, people not leaving their homes and the fact that people are concerned that they could be pulled over just for being black or brown — that is something that I will continue to say is wrong,"" Daughtry said. ""And I can say that civilly and continue to have that conversation. And if folks think that me speaking out against that is violent rhetoric then I really urge them to . . . check themselves and make sure that they are willing to have a dialogue. Because it takes both voices.""

State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who recently withdrew from the Republican Party and is running for governor as an independent, said he is also hearing that people are afraid. And Bennett believes that's the intention of the Trump administration.

""We can't rise to take the bait,"" said Bennett, a former chairman of the Maine Republican Party. ""I think there is an effort by the White House and the administration in Washington to, as I said, scare people and to provoke. So I think we have to be measured. I think we have to take each step at a time and see what actually happens.""

Bennett also blames the Trump administration for increasing the temperature around immigration.

""It's one thing for Republicans to say let's lower the temperature,"" Bennett said. ""And I agree. But maybe they should be telling that to the people they support in Washington.""

Back at Tuesday's Republican press conference at the State House, Stewart and his House counterpart, Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor, said they are asking for a sit-down meeting with Mills to discuss the issue.

In the meantime, they called on the governor and other Democrats to drop what Faulkingham described as the state's antagonistic and ""almost insurrectionist approach towards the federal government."" Faulkingham criticized some Democratic talk of ""lawless"" federal agents who he said are being sent to Maine to enforce the law and root out fraud.

""The talk that I would like to see is that we are going to cooperate with federal law enforcement — that these are the same FBI, border patrol and ICE agents that have faithfully served the U.S. government for many years and that we are going to cooperate with them to get to the bottom of this,"" Faulkingham said.

Neither the Mills administration nor spokesmen for the Republican leaders responded to follow-up requests about whether that meeting has been scheduled.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac45583/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F24%2Fb6608a8145829437d77a928e3855%2Fportlandice3-0118.jpeg,N,,2026-01-22 09:37:41.339800

She said she was alarmed by the number of federal agents flooding her hometown and the violent scenes that have accompanied their presence.
“In some communities, activists have posted fliers with information about the ICE agents involved in arrests and other actions in the community,” he said.
However, it appears the administration has adopted the view that any posting of personal information regarding ICE agents is unlawful.
Zick said posting threats to federal agents is unlawful and not protected speech.","One day after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis earlier this month, a Minnesota immigrant advocacy group reported a threefold increase in the number of people signing up to become legal observers.

“To say this: The killing of Renee Good lit a fire under the community, would be an understatement,” said Ryan Perez, a leadership and organizing director with the advocacy group COPAL, part of a network of 5,000 trained civilians who monitor immigration enforcement. “It really is a remarkable moment.”

As the Trump administration deploys thousands of federal officers to carry out turbocharged immigration operations across the country – with the Minneapolis area now the epicenter – growing networks of volunteers who call themselves ICE observers appear to be intensifying their efforts.

Volunteers document arrests, some tail ICE agents in vehicles, while others blow whistles warning community members of ICE enforcement –– tactics under increased scrutiny since the fatal shooting, which has led to more aggressive enforcement operations and sparked protests across the US.

Good, who served on the board of her son’s school, was linked, in school documents, to similar activities encouraging parents to monitor and possibly disrupt ICE operations –– an association Trump officials are placing at the center of their review into the incident as the activist and mother of three partially blocked ICE agents with her car.

An ICE officer who was filming Good shot her after she started to accelerate her SUV on January 7. Videos of the encounter show Good was turning her vehicle away from the agent as she pulled forward, but it is unclear whether she made contact with him before he fired.

Experts say while some practices by volunteers are acts of nonviolent civil disobedience, others may fall into murkier legal territory. Here’s what we know.

Who is involved in the ICE observer groups?

Across the country, thousands of parents, teachers, clergy members and community organizers have sought training on what they can legally do when they see an immigration arrest. They have been trained on documenting federal immigration agents’ actions with cell phone video and quickly warning migrant neighbors with whistles and car horns.

“People that look a lot like Renee Good, we have a lot of moms. We have a lot of retirees, people that would be volunteering at the ballot box,” Perez said of the volunteers.

Kateri Heymans, a 29-year-old Spanish teacher in Minneapolis, registered as an observer the day after Good was fatally shot. She said she was alarmed by the number of federal agents flooding her hometown and the violent scenes that have accompanied their presence.

In North Carolina, the immigrant worker group Siembra NC operates an ICE watch hotline and a verification system tracking the operations of federal agents in the community.

“Safety concerns are a daily reality,” said Andrew Wills Garces, a senior strategist with Siembra NC. “After the killing of Renee Nicole Good, our volunteers are asking, ‘Can they get away with this?’ They see an administration labeling legal observers as ‘domestic terrorists’ and feel a target on their backs.”

How are ICE observers trained?

Nationwide, volunteers are being trained not only to honk horns and blow whistles to warn anyone in earshot immigration agents are present but also to document the actions of federal officers.

Critics of the immigration crackdown say observers are necessary given what they describe as dangerous tactics by federal agents which put people at risk. Trump administration officials counter they are taking necessary steps to keep Americans safe, and ICE officers are facing a significant increase in assaults. Officers exercise restraint despite facing threats and attacks, according to federal officials.

“Our observers are trained to walk in and say, ‘I demand to see a warrant. Show me a warrant. I need to see a signed judicial warrant. Why are you here? What are you doing here?’ And all of that creates a legal record as well,” Perez said.

Their notes and videos are shared with attorneys and advocacy groups to be used in possible court cases, he said. Volunteers also watch video of enforcement actions and participate in simulations as part of their training.

What actions are legal?

“If you’re in a public space, using whistles to signal that law enforcement officers are present and recording law enforcement activities are expressive activities protected by the First Amendment,” said Gregory Magarian, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.

“If we take the First Amendment seriously, and if we look at our nation’s history, we see that a wide range of protest and pushback activities are protected by the First Amendment … and have been essential to social movements – the Civil Rights Movement, women’s suffrage, the run-up to the American Revolution itself – that almost everyone views positively.”

Tim Zick, a professor at William and Mary Law School in Virginia, said some volunteers have sought to identify mostly masked ICE officers by badge numbers or other accessible information, occasionally posting information about their identities online.

“In some communities, activists have posted fliers with information about the ICE agents involved in arrests and other actions in the community,” he said.

Distribution of factual and lawfully obtained public information is generally protected by the First Amendment, according to Zick.

“The Trump administration has initiated investigations and prosecutions of some activists who have posted information about agents online or distributed it,” Zick said.

But context matters.

“If the information is posted with the intent or purpose of inciting violence against agents or threatening them, it may not be protected. However, it appears the administration has adopted the view that any posting of personal information regarding ICE agents is unlawful. That position is contrary to First Amendment case law.”

What is illegal?

President Donald Trump has warned leaders in Minnesota he may be forced to intervene further if widespread protests continue during his administration’s surge in immigration enforcement operations.

“In Minnesota, the Troublemakers, Agitators, and Insurrectionists are, in many cases, highly paid professionals,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.

ICE watch activities and protests appear to be escalating as aggressive arrests become more common in public, with some federal officers using tactics such as shattering car windows and tackling their targets.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has said agents who “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law” are facing “smearing” by claims they’re employing “harsher approaches.”

“ICE and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” McLaughlin told CNN. “Our officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training.”

Physically interfering with the actions of agents is illegal.

“If a person directly interferes with a law enforcement officer, for example by deliberately blocking the officer’s path, that is not protected by the First Amendment and is generally unlawful,” Magarian said.

It is also unlawful to disobey an order from law enforcement to disperse, he said.

Zick said posting threats to federal agents is unlawful and not protected speech.

“So is inciting others to engage in unlawful actions against the agents, if the incitement is likely to produce an imminent attack,” he added.

Perez, the Minneapolis activist who trains ICE watchers, said his group instructs volunteers to stay eight feet away from agents and to avoid touching or blocking them.

“We have a 100% no obstruction protocol as observers,” he insisted.

Perez added, “We have people that were so afraid before and I think the fear is still there. There’s so much violence from law enforcement against community members and yet there’s also more bravery than ever … because people are feeling like, ‘Now’s my time to act.’”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-11-08t022404z-1512418995-rc2xrhaz3fwf-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-chicago-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-22 10:39:31.949027

They’ve promised civil rights legislation that could offer alleged victims another route to courts, ordered up official tribunals to gather video and other records, or asked cities to refuse requests to cooperate with raids. But for the most part, states looking for concrete ways to push back find themselves largely hamstrung.

Violence in immigration enforcement is on the rise. A federal immigration agent’s killing of Renee Good in Minnesota on Jan. 7 was one of half a dozen shootings since December. An immigrant’s death in a Texas detention facility this month was ruled a homicide. And detention deaths last year totaled at least 31, a two-decade peak and more than the previous four years combined.

There also have been dozens of cases in the past year of agents using dangerous and federally banned arrest maneuvers, such as chokeholds, that can stop breathing.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in masks and tactical vests have been recorded firing pepper spray into the faces of protesters, shattering car windows with little warning, punching and kneeing people pinned face down on the ground, using battering rams on front doors, and questioning people of color about their identities.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended many recorded incidents as legitimate uses of force against dangerous people. And some Republican state lawmakers have said they’ll work to bolster ICE’s work within their borders.

Some lawmakers, legal experts and immigrant advocates worry about whether a lack of oversight from the federal government and the weak positions of state governments could give rise to even more violence as President Donald Trump continues his push to arrest immigrants who are living illegally in the United States.

Previous administrations have prioritized arresting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also have criminal records, but that isn’t the case in Trump’s second term.

“You can’t go after a murderer and a garden-variety immigration violator like a poor nanny or a poor landscaper with equal emphasis. This administration has abandoned all discretion and all priorities, and you create this narrative that you’re doing this patriotic, godly thing,” said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank.

Chishti said there has been a surge in abusive tactics that comes from a series of federal policies. He cited the massive infusion of inexperienced officers under heavy pressure to make arrests, the military-style tactics meant to create spectacle and fear, and the harsh rhetoric aimed, he said, at instilling warlike hostility toward immigrants and protesters.

More agents, more incidents

The number of ICE law enforcement agents doubled in less than a year, with Homeland Security announcing this month it has hired 12,000 new agents out of some 220,000 applicants. More agents have surged into cities such as Chicago and Minneapolis, their semiautomatic weapons, bulky vests and balaclavas often contrasting with local police officers wearing name badges and carrying sidearms.

Noem has insisted that ICE and other officers are the real victims of increased violence, citing instances like one on Jan. 14, when a man was shot in the leg by an ICE agent. She said in a news release that bystanders struck an officer with a snow shovel and broom handle in Minneapolis as the officer tried to catch a fleeing suspect. Noem called it “an attempted murder of federal law enforcement” in which, “ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life.”

ICE is using Medicaid data to find out where immigrants live

Court papers released Jan. 20 included an officer’s account of only two assailants, the suspect and a friend who owned the car he had been driving, and said the injured suspect was trying to escape into the apartment building and that tear gas had been used to force the men to surrender.

Noem, who claimed Monday that more than 10,000 immigrants have been arrested in Minnesota, has described some people living in the U.S. illegally as “foreign invaders.” She characterized Good’s shooting as self-defense against “an act of domestic terrorism.”

And in a press briefing Tuesday, Trump told reporters that the people being deported “make our criminals look like babies. They make our Hells Angels look like the sweetest people on Earth.”

Such descriptions have become a tool that incites violence, Chishti said.

“When they say that they were doing God’s work with Renee Good, that she was a domestic terrorist, when you frame it that way from the highest leadership of the agency, you’re basically sending a signal that there’s no accountability,” he said.

Democrats push back

State leaders who say they’re worried about violence are trying different approaches, though they can’t completely curb federal policies.

New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said state resources would not be used to assist in immigration raids, citing the shooting of Good. But local agencies in New York could still use other funds to help with raids.

New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham called for curbs on immigrant detention in the state, though two of three existing detention centers there could still continue to operate.

Colorado has launched a new system for claims of misconduct by federal agents, including ICE agents.

Democrats shrug as Trump threatens ‘sanctuary’ cities again with February funding cutoff

Some Republican-led states are taking the opposite tack, with Tennessee proposing legislation that would go beyond cooperation with federal immigration by setting up its own state immigration laws. If enacted, it would test the limits of a 2012 Supreme Court decision that struck down state-based immigration enforcement based on a similar Arizona law.

Tennessee is using White House guidance to draft the legislation, and other states are likely to follow. That would create new civil rights concerns if states pick up some of the same tactics as the federal government.

“That’s another way of unleashing the states, not only to work with the federal government, but also to acquiesce in the states’ enactment of their own immigration enforcement, detention, and removal regimes,” said Lucas Guttentag, a Stanford Law School professor who runs a project tracking federal immigration policy, speaking in a May interview published by Berkeley Journal of Criminal Law.

Combating the federal moves is already fraught, said Guttentag, who has served in immigration policy positions in the Obama and Biden administrations.

“No single political strategy can change it,” Guttentag told Stateline this week. “But litigation has proven both critical and effective in limiting some of the most egregious violations. The violence is a clear violation.”

It’s hard to police an administration that constantly pushes legal boundaries, Guttentag added.

“It’s like a ‘catch me if you can’ administration. They adopt tactics and basically challenge anyone to try to stop them.”

Two former federal prosecutors, Kristy Parker and Samantha Trepel, argued for state civil rights legislation and investigation in a Jan.14 op-ed published in The Guardian with the headline “Cities and states must hold ICE accountable for violence. The feds won’t.”

Accountability commissions — like one created by Illinois in October after ICE operations there — can help, they wrote, preserving evidence and gathering testimony in the face of federal obstruction, like the blocking of a state investigation into Good’s death in Minnesota.

Potential civil rights legislation

Another method mentioned by the former prosecutors: State civil rights legislation could theoretically give people harmed by federal agents a hearing in state court under a legal concept called “converse-1983.”

GOP redistricting could backfire as urban, immigrant areas turn back to Democrats

New York’s Gov. Hochul has proposed such legislation. A similar Wisconsin measure died in July when the Republican majority on the Assembly judiciary committee would not give it a hearing, said Democratic Rep. Andrew Hysell, the bill’s sponsor.

“It’s a positive approach to preserving our rights here in Wisconsin, our constitutional rights, because you can no longer count on the federal government to do that,” Hysell said. “In the situations we’ve seen in Minnesota, the federal government is crossing the line into what appears to be violations of constitutional rights.”

However, the idea of “converse-1983” has yet to be used successfully to sue a federal agent, and might never succeed, said John Preis, a law professor at the University of Richmond.

“I would be shocked if converse-1983 [lawsuits] went anywhere,” Preis said. “States may not enact laws that impede federal officers who were doing their jobs. A converse-1983 action would seem to do this.”

However, in some cases, such as the shooting death of Renee Good, victims may be able to successfully sue the federal government without such a state law, Preis said. The process is difficult but the lawsuit could succeed if a constitutional civil rights violation can be proven, he said.

Here are some takeaways from the arguments in the case, a crucial test for the central bank's independence.

A RULING AGAINST TRUMP SEEMS LIKELY

Comments by the justices during the two hours of ​arguments indicated that the court is not likely to grant the Trump administration's request to lift a judge's decision barring ​the Republican president ‌from immediately firing Cook while her legal challenge continues to play out. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.

A majority of the justices seemed focused on the manner in which they should rule in favor of Cook, rather than whether they should rule for her.

David Law, a constitutional law professor at the University of Virginia, said on X midway through the arguments that ""it's already clear that Lisa Cook will be keeping her job on the Fed.""

FOCUS ON DUE PROCESS

The president announced last August on his Truth ‌Social platform that he was ​firing Cook in light of unproven allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump ​appointee, that she committed mortgage fraud. Cook has publicly denied the allegations - calling them a pretext to remove her over monetary policy differences - and has not been charged with wrongdoing.

The judge who ruled against Trump in September found that his attempt to remove Cook without notice or a hearing likely violated her right to ‍due process under the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment. Some of the justices on Wednesday suggested Cook should have been provided by the administration with a formal opportunity to address the allegations.

Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett pressed Justice Department lawyer D. John Sauer on why the Trump administration was ""afraid"" of giving Cook such a hearing. Barrett said it ""would not have been that big ⁠of a deal"" for Trump to have sat down with Cook and presented the alleged evidence against her.

KAVANAUGH A LIKELY VOTE FOR COOK

Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, ‍who like Barrett was appointed by Trump to the Supreme Court, also signaled that he is likely to rule in favor of Cook. Kavanaugh said at one point that the ""simplest ‌way to ‌decide this case"" would be to declare that ""there was insufficient process"" provided to Cook. Kavanaugh told Sauer that his arguments in the case would lead to presidents ousting Fed governors over policy disagreements and ""would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve.""

QUESTIONS ABOUT AN 'INADVERTENT MISTAKE'

Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether the evidence against Cook is more consistent with an ""inadvertent mistake"" on her part rather than intentional wrongdoing. Sauer responded that, even if Cook made a mistake on mortgage ⁠paperwork, ""it is quite a big mistake.""

Roberts seemed ⁠skeptical of that argument, saying ""we can ​debate that, how significant it is in a stack of papers you have to fill out when you're buying real estate.""

'BIG PICTURE' THOUGHTS

It seemed clear that the justices understood that a ruling in favor of Trump could upend the U.S. economy by eroding the Fed's independence.

""If this were set as a precedent, it seems to me - just thinking big ‍picture - what goes around comes around, and all the current president's appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029, if there's a Democratic president, or January 20, 2033,"" Kavanaugh said, referring to the dates for presidential inaugurations following the next two U.S. elections.

Barrett asked Sauer about the practical implications of allowing Trump's unprecedented firing of a Fed governor, and noted ​that some economists had warned that Cook's firing would trigger a recession. Barrett asked that if ‍such a risk exists at this stage of the case ""doesn't that counsel caution on our part?""

A man with a reputation for lying about almost everything, President Trump has recreated his second administration in his own likeness.
MAGA’s Hack Propaganda Not surprisingly, President Trump and MAGA loyalists in the media and elsewhere quickly echoed Noem’s fantastical narrative.
Further, the ICE agent is plainly visible standing to the side of Good’s vehicle when he fired two more shots at her.
Vice President JD Vance has assured us the ICE agent who killed Good has “absolute immunity” from prosecution, a view many legal experts strongly refute.","If there is any hope for humanity’s future, it is in the vision of the day when war criminals, authoritarians, fascists, and other enemies of democracy can no longer threaten the world with impunity.

We are far from that reality at present. As we enter a new year, global power remains decidedly in the grip of a status quo dominated by corporate politicians, war criminals, and financial elites. Led by President Donald Trump, the worst of these political mobsters represent leadership on a moral caliber with history’s most malevolent barbarians.

In Minneapolis, the murder of Renée Good on January 8 by a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent has rightly provoked an outpouring of popular grief, anger, and resistance. In turn, the Trump administration’s response makes it clear that even the pretense of accountability or expectation of due process are nonexistent for this government. With even more federal agents flooded into Minneapolis in response, this lawless administration has made it clear it is at war with the American people.

A man with a reputation for lying about almost everything, President Trump has recreated his second administration in his own likeness. It took director of Homeland Security Kristi Noem only a couple hours after the shooting to brand Good a “domestic terrorist,” claiming the ICE agent acted in “self-defense” when she attempted to strike him with her vehicle. Noem also claimed Good had been stalking and impeding ICE’s activities “all day,” even though it was only just after 9:30 am when she was shot. She offered no evidence to support these charges.

The Trump presidency is an authoritarian cancer on what’s left of the body politic of democracy, led by the mendacious real estate blowhard turned politician and his hand-picked cabinet of sycophants, grifters, opportunists, and assorted incompetents.

In fact, ICE agents reportedly waited nearly three minutes before even calling 911 emergency services. Nor did they initiate CPR on Good or allow a doctor on the scene to assess her in the moments after the shooting. Instead, ICE agents briefly assessed Good and then left her bleeding and unattended until paramedics arrived several minutes later. It was more than 10 minutes before Good, who reportedly still had a pulse, received CPR from paramedics.

MAGA’s Hack Propaganda

Not surprisingly, President Trump and MAGA loyalists in the media and elsewhere quickly echoed Noem’s fantastical narrative. But anyone who watches video of the incident and thinks this victim blaming is a closed case requiring no further investigation is just serving the cause of hack propaganda.

Incredulously, it took Homeland Security more than a week to claim the agent who shot Good, Jonathan Ross, had received medical treatment for “internal bleeding” in the torso after being hit by Good’s car. No corroborating evidence was offered in support of this claim. But what does this claim even mean? That Ross was slightly bruised after being bumped by Good’s car as she attempted to drive away? In videos of the incident Good is clearly turning her vehicle to the right (not toward Ross) as she attempted to drive away. Further, the ICE agent is plainly visible standing to the side of Good’s vehicle when he fired two more shots at her. Did Good also deserve to be shot in the face because she didn’t immediately comply with one agent’s order to exit her vehicle? Actually, the MAGA hive mind has no shortage of reasons to justify her murder. She was a “lesbian agitator” with pronouns in her bio, after all.

But not to worry. Vice President JD Vance has assured us the ICE agent who killed Good has “absolute immunity” from prosecution, a view many legal experts strongly refute. The Trumpified FBI has also barred Minnesota state criminal investigators from access to materials in the case, exposing the Trump administration’s utter disregard for both the law and the truth. Tellingly, the US Department of Justice shows zero interest in even investigating the killing, a move that has prompted resignations of several federal prosecutors in Minnesota.

It’s a sign of the urgency of our times that scheduled antiwar rallies across the United States on January 10 to oppose the recent US military assault on Venezuela and kidnapping of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Celia Flores... had to be quickly amended to include a response to Good’s murder and the escalating threats from ICE.

The litany of ICE atrocities in the past year are many. For months, these thugs have terrorized American neighborhoods, pursuing a mass deportation policy that is inhumane and racist. In the first nine months of 2025 alone, approximately 220,000 people were arrested by ICE officers. Despite the president’s bogus claim that the immigration crackdown is necessary to target murderers, rapists, and gang members, more than 75,000 of those arrested last year had no criminal record. Can Trump make the same claim?

Actually, available data does not distinguish detainees with serious legal offenses from those with minor violations. In many instances, being in the United States illegally is a civil violation or misdemeanor offense, not a felony. As of early December, there were about 65,000 or more persons being held in ICE detention facilities.

The shooting of Good is also not an isolated incident of government violence. In fact, since September, ICE agents have been involved in 11 shooting incidents. In Santa Ana, California, federal officers shot two people in the face with “less lethal” projectiles, causing permanent eye damage. In Minneapolis, federal agents deployed flash-bang devices and tear gas on a family with six children in their car who were driving home from a sports practice.

The exploding lawlessness of the Trump administration now constitutes a blatant threat to democratic and human rights everywhere. Indeed, it’s a sign of the urgency of our times that scheduled antiwar rallies across the United States on January 10 to oppose the recent US military assault on Venezuela and kidnapping of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Celia Flores, initiated by the Democratic Socialists of America and the Party for Socialism and Liberation, had to be quickly amended to include a response to Good’s murder and the escalating threats from ICE.

Obviously, the military assault on Venezuela’s sovereignty was less about drugs and democracy than oil, power, and money. Maduro’s alleged complicity in narco-terrorism and weapons charges is only a specious pretext for an attack on a nation that just happens to have the world’s largest oil reserves. Venezuela’s real crime is that it operates independently of US foreign policy, which under Trump’s crudely resurrected version of the Monroe Doctrine now constitutes an unforgivable sin. Does anyone seriously believe Trump, who recently pardoned convicted former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez of drug trafficking and weapons charges, actually cares about narco-trafficking?

With escalating threats now against Columbia, Cuba, Mexico, Denmark, Greenland, and Iran, there is little coherent or reasoned policy in this intensifying US global aggression. But there is Trump’s need to distract the American people from his personal scandals and failures as a leader, and from the basic truth that he has absolutely nothing to offer to improve life for the majority of the people.

Gaza: Preface to a World Under Siege

Of course, we should not be surprised at what is happening now in the United States. Trump’s wild assault on democratic and human rights, his unhinged violent imperialism, are just the logical next expression of two years of genocidal destruction unleashed upon the people of Gaza by the Israeli state. This was a campaign of pure evil facilitated with decisive military support from both the Biden and Trump administrations.

Ironically, in 2025 the president who thought he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize conducted military attacks on seven countries, and launched air assaults on alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean. But don’t feel too sorry for Trump the Nobel loser. To thank him for bombing her country, Veneuelan right-wing coup plotter Maria Corina Machado has now given Trump her Nobel Prize. In his own name, Trump has also been awarded the Israel Prize by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a war criminal and fugitive from an international arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court.

Watching Trump and MAGA politics in action over the past year is like viewing a film documentary in reverse motion, as established rights are undone and the rule of a lunkhead mob of far-right extremists takes over.

These war criminals and obsequious grovelers before the American president can give each other all the awards they want, it won’t erase the moral censure they deserve. Whatever hope for this world exists belongs instead to the many millions of human beings who don’t support targeting Palestinian children for bullets to the head or chest, starving families, bombing hospitals and schools, the forced displacement of around 2 million people, and other crimes against humanity. They don’t believe 250,000 Palestinians deserved to die, to be maimed or left buried under rubble by a genocidal apartheid state. Nor do these many millions believe in kidnapping leaders of foreign states, bombing and threatening other nations with capricious indifference to their sovereignty, and ignoring international law.

The Trump presidency is an authoritarian cancer on what’s left of the body politic of democracy, led by the mendacious real estate blowhard turned politician and his hand-picked cabinet of sycophants, grifters, opportunists, and assorted incompetents. Watching Trump and MAGA politics in action over the past year is like viewing a film documentary in reverse motion, as established rights are undone and the rule of a lunkhead mob of far-right extremists takes over. For what it’s worth, Trump is already floating his interest in finding a way to subvert or even cancel this year’s midterm elections. That’s the direction his addled extremism is going.

Those who support the democratic and human rights of migrants and citizens, who oppose genocide and imperialist violence, are in a moment now that demands an escalation in mass action, solidarity, and resistance. Enough of the entrenched timidity of the Democratic leadership, many of whom remain hesitant even to curtail ICE funding. We need a mass united front built on grassroots organizing power, fueled by the activism, energy, and strength of unions, communities, students and everyone with a vested desire to stop ICE terror and the larger and growing authoritarian threat.

The call by labor and community leaders in Minneapolis for a general shutdown of the city on January 23—an “economic blackout”—to protest Good’s murder and the ongoing harassment, abductions, and violence by ICE is an important initiative. This means no school, no work, and no shopping. Significantly, the Minnesota Labor Regional Federation AFL-CIO has announced support for the Minneapolis Day of Truth and Freedom, demanding ICE leave Minnesota now and the agent who killed Renée Good be held legally accountable.

This call for justice represents a significant step toward building an ever more forceful campaign of popular mass resistance to the current threats to our democratic and human rights.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62701942&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417,N,,2026-01-22 08:38:06.079798

She said her agents were “absolutely” allowing ICE agents access to passenger data to help with their deportation efforts.
Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., pressed McNeill whether the TSA had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents.
“We are absolutely within our authorities to share information within the Department of Homeland Security to further the national security mission,” she said, before promising to get back to McIver.
Rep. Tim Kennedy, D-N.Y., asked how many TSA employees had been reassigned to immigration enforcement, but McNeill initially deflected the question.","WASHINGTON — The acting director of the Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday defended her agency’s practice of sharing information about travelers suspected of having deportation orders with agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a House oversight hearing.

“It is not new policy to share information between the agencies of the Department of Homeland Security,” the acting TSA director, Ha Nguyen McNeill, told lawmakers in a hearing before the Homeland Security Committee. She said her agents were “absolutely” allowing ICE agents access to passenger data to help with their deportation efforts.

The New York Times reported in December that the agency was collaborating with ICE to identify air travelers subject to deportation orders, allowing immigration agents to detain them at airports and quickly deport them.

The practice came under scrutiny after it led to the arrest of Any Lucía López Belloza, a college student detained by immigration authorities at Boston Logan International Airport on Nov. 20 as she prepared to fly home to Texas for Thanksgiving. She was deported to Honduras two days later, despite a court order preventing her removal. The Trump administration later acknowledged that it made a mistake by deporting her.

The Trump administration has deported hundreds of thousands of immigrants since President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago, and the harsh methods of ICE agents carrying out the crackdown has incited protests across the nation.

The complaints about ICE tactics have intensified, especially from Democrats, after an immigration agent shot and killed an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in Minneapolis this month. The Trump administration has defended the shooting, and conservatives, citing a video of the incident, have said the agent had reason to fear for his life. Democratic officials in Minnesota have used words like “propaganda” to describe the federal government’s account of the shooting.

During the hearing Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration that the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, declined a request to testify and so was not there to face questioning.

“The urgency in this country right now is what’s going on with ICE,” said Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y. “Why are we having a hearing with Department of Homeland Security officials who know nothing about ICE?”

With no ICE official to put on the stand, the Democrats peppered McNeill with questions about her agency’s involvement in immigration operations.

For their part, Republicans on the committee were mostly quiet when it came to the TSA’s collaboration with ICE. “There’s been a lot of talk about ICE, and, unfortunately, really outside the scope of this hearing,” said Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn. “And for that, to our witnesses, I apologize.”

Republican committee members praised TSA workers who worked without pay during last year’s government shutdown and challenged how airport security is funded in the United States.

They also asked McNeill about allegations that Somalis had smuggled cash through Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., pressed McNeill whether the TSA had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents. McNeill could not cite a specific statute or policy granting her the authority.

“We are absolutely within our authorities to share information within the Department of Homeland Security to further the national security mission,” she said, before promising to get back to McIver. “I can get you the exact policy,” she said.

Rep. Tim Kennedy, D-N.Y., asked how many TSA employees had been reassigned to immigration enforcement, but McNeill initially deflected the question.

When Kennedy pressed McNeill about news reports that air marshals from her agency were reassigned to deportation flights from commercial flights, McNeill said that providing flight security for deportation flights “was not a reassignment” and that it fell “within their mission.”

She rejected the notion that reassigning air marshals to deportation flights from commercial flights might mean a greater risk for ordinary passengers flying in the United States, saying that “providing in-flight security for deportation flights keeps our sky safe.”

The Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting immigrants lacking permanent legal status, undermining a wide range of law enforcement operations in response to mounting pressure from Trump.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01212026_tsa-tzr_tzr_183402.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-22 01:56:55.642077

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed in an email that it began on Tuesday what it’s calling “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine, after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier told Fox News that it had arrested nearly 50 people so far.

Those numbers have not been independently verified by Maine Morning Star nor community organizers because of Homeland Security’s otherwise silence on the matter and the inherent challenges with tracking people in the immigration system. Maine’s congressional delegation, the governor and local public officials have also not gotten responses from President Donald Trump’s administration about operations in Maine.

“We have no information,” said Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins Press Secretary Blake Kernen.

The community hotline tracking enforcement action in Maine began ringing continuously with reports of sightings on Tuesday, after the mayors of the state’s two largest cities announced last week that they were expecting a surge in ICE activity.

As organizers continue to crowdsource sightings and attempt to track down specifics, Project Relief Maine, Presente! Maine and No ICE for Maine are advising immigrants to shelter in place, especially in the Greater Portland area.

“Right now, it is unsafe to be outside, whether walking, driving, or waiting at bus stops,” the group posted on social media.

Sightings of federal agents in Maine were centered around Portland and Lewiston on Tuesday but on Wednesday expanded to Westbrook, South Portland, Biddeford, Scarborough, Waterville and Belfast, said Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, which runs the hotline.

By 12:30pm Wednesday, the hotline had received 522 calls, with the most being about federal agent sightings. At the end of the day yesterday, organizers had fielded 870 calls. For comparison, the hotline received 288 calls in the entire month of December, and 195 in November.

Gov. Janet Mills said she’s monitoring ICE activity, too. “If the Federal government has warrants, then it should show them,” she said in a statement Wednesday evening. “But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the Federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors — none of which is welcome.”

Maine’s members of Congress have responded to the ICE operations in their state with varying support. While Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree and independent U.S. Sen. Angus King offered clear condemnation, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden and Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said they’re supportive so long as it is a targeted operation focused on people who have engaged in criminal activity.

DHS Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde told Fox News that the agency has 1,400 targets in Maine. In an email, DHS said they are “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.” DHS only released information about four of the nearly 50 people reported to have been arrested Tuesday. Those the agency highlighted have convictions such as aggravated assault and operating under the influence of alcohol.

Maine organizers have long been preparing for ICE to arrive

Meanwhile, ICE detained an Angolan man at a routine check in on Tuesday at the Scarborough field office and his lawyer told the Bangor Daily News that he has no criminal record to justify his detention. A federal judge has ordered ICE to explain why the agency detained him.

As of the latest data from November, about 73% of people held nationwide in ICE detention have no criminal conviction. And, many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.

DHS has not responded to requests from Maine Morning Star to confirm overall arrest numbers or the reasons for those arrests.

Community impacts

Maine is not seeing a singular method for arrests. There’s been apprehensions in parking lots and of people walking in downtown areas or pulled over on the highway. “There’s a reason we call it a dragnet,” Ruben said.

As a result, he said, “Some folks have been avoiding work. Some folks have been avoiding sending their kids to school and going to appointments altogether. Some folks have been creative in working with community networks that have been established to be able to get rides to go to doctors appointments.”

It’s not only immigrants who are altering their daily lives out of fear. Ruben, who is a person of color, said he’s had people accompany him to places like the grocery store so that he is not the only one in the car.

These changes in behavior ripple out to the entire community, such as businesses that rely on foot traffic and employers who may face staffing shortages for an unknown amount of time.

MaineHealth has reported higher than usual call-outs in some segments of its workforce.

Portland Public Schools is reporting a drop in attendance. Though the specific reasons for absences don’t show up in the data, Superintendent Ryan Scallon said Wednesday during a press conference overall attendance is down more than 5%, with some schools down as much as 15-20%.

Project Relief Maine has called for the district to close for the remainder of the week, in light of a mother who was detained after dropping her child off at school.

Local police cooperation

Echoing Maine Republicans, Hyde and DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticized Maine for restricting local police cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” McLaughlin said in a statement.

Police are already not required to and generally do not have the authority to enforce immigration laws. A new state law, which won’t take effect until 90 days after the current legislative session adjourns, aims to prevent local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, while still permitting police to investigate crimes and execute judicial warrants.

The prison in the small Weld County town of Hudson, about 30 miles northeast of Denver, was identified by ICE last year as a likely site of a new federal immigration detention facility.

“These are our neighbors,” Sydney Engel, who lives in nearby Fort Lupton, told the Hudson Town Council of the immigrants being apprehended by ICE. “It’s hard, but I won’t stand here and let my voice not be heard, especially living so close to this community.”

After nearly three hours of public comment from Coloradans across the state opposing an ICE facility coming to Hudson, Mayor Joe Hammock said,”Public comment is closed. Let’s move on.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado has sued ICE multiple times, forcing the agency to turn over documents that revealed plans for additional detention centers in the state, including the use of the former Hudson Correctional Facility. The most recent document release, this month, confirms ICE is moving forward with plans to turn the former private prison into what the agency is calling the Big Horn Correctional Facility, said Tim Macdonald, the ACLU of Colorado’s legal director.

The documents show ICE inked a six-month deal last year worth nearly $40 milion with contractor GEO Group for services at the Hudson prison. They also reference the Huerfano County Correctional Facility, another former private prison — in Walsenburg — that has been eyed by ICE for expanded detention capacity in Colorado.

However, most details, including operational timelines and contracts, were redacted or withheld, Macdonald said.

“They’re trying to hide what they’re doing,” Macdonald said in an interview with The Denver Post. “We know that ICE is trying to do this in secret. We’re seeing ICE act in renegade ways across the country. Shooting people, killing Renée Good in Minneapolis, shooting people in Portland. ICE has gone rogue. … We don’t know exactly how they’re proceeding with the expanded detention here, but we know they’re trying to do it in the dark without transparency, even though they’re using our public taxpayer dollars to do this. They should be accountable to us, the people.”

Representatives of Highlands REIT, the Chicago-based real estate investment trust that owns the Hudson Correctional Facility, could not be reached for comment this week. A spokesperson for ICE did not respond to a request for comment from The Post.

Weld County resident Jenifer Montes helped organize Wednesday afternoon’s protest at the prison site, which drew more than 100 people. Many of those demonstrators then attended the Town Council meeting, where they addressed the elected leaders to voice their opposition to the detention center.

An October protest outside the facility drew about 70 people.

On Wednesday, Jody Whitmore, a 67-year-old Frederick resident, held a sign outside the closed prison that said “No to concentration camps in Hudson.”

Whitmore attended the Hudson protest in October and returned Wednesday even angrier than before, she said, after witnessing the recent ICE activity in Minneapolis.

“It is disgusting,” Whitmore said. “It’s out of control. The federal government is out of control, and they want to ramp it up even more.”

Whitmore said the inhumane treatment of detained immigrants was why she likened the facilities to concentration camps. “Plus they’re wasting our taxpayer dollars,” she said

Gina McAfee, 71, said there were so many misconceptions about immigrants. Growing up in Greeley, she knew many immigrants and has worked in the immigrant rights space for about 10 years.

When McAfee learned about the Hudson ICE facility, she said, she felt compelled to protest.

“I was appalled,” she said. “The inhumane treatment currently going on at the Aurora detention center is just shocking. The fact they want to add another facility is just appalling.”

State Sen. Julie Gonzales, a progressive who is challenging U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper in this summer’s Democratic primary, implored the crowd to keep speaking out.

“You all demonstrate the power of the Constitution of this country,” she said. “The Constitution protects us all. I don’t care what ICE has to say about it.”

‘The wishes of the people of Hudson’

Hudson Mayor Joe Hammock did not respond to a request for comment. Before Wednesday’s meeting, The Post also reached out to the members of the Hudson Town Council — Matt Cole, Candace Nolf, Lisa Marie Buesgens, Zachary Reyes, Don Post and Rachel E. Thwaites — asking what they knew about ICE taking over the former prison and their thoughts on the situation.

Only Reyes responded, saying in an email that as a nonpartisan elected official, his personal viewpoint was “irrelevant.” He said Hudson has not been approached by the federal government or the GEO Group — which also runs ICE’s current 1,530-capacity detention center in Aurora — regarding permits or use of the facility.

“I will always act with the wishes of the people of Hudson,” Reyes wrote.

“The town has minimal say in what the owner of the property chooses to do with their property. The town can only enforce code requirements set forth with current ordinances in effect both locally and with the state. … We as the council know just as much about the rumors as you, the public, knows.”

Macdonald said a review of the town documents suggests Hudson officials believe ICE is moving ahead with the detention center, which could open within a year. Hudson has about 1,600 residents, and the new ICE facility effectively would double the town’s population with an expected capacity of about 1,300 detainees.

“That doesn’t even include workers, so the demand for water will go through the roof, and we know from their planning documents they’re concerned about how they’re going to manage that and what that will mean for existing water uses in Hudson,” Macdonald said.

The documents turned over to the ACLU also revealed:

ICE last year issued a contract to the GEO Group for more than $39 million for six months of services, between April and October, at the Hudson facility.

ICE issued another contract for the GEO Group dated Dec. 1 for the Hudson facility but redacted the terms and pricing.

ICE redacted more than 100 pages of documents from late August that appeared to be in justification of why the agency should award a sole contract to the GEO Group for the Hudson facility without full and open competition.

A contract for the Southern Ute Indian Adult Detention Center, valued at less than $100,000, was submitted to the Department of Homeland Security for approval in August. No details about whether the proposal was approved could be located. Documents previously obtained by The Washington Post indicated ICE planned to add 28 beds to the existing Southern Ute detention center in Ignacio.

Another potential detention site, the former Huerfano County Correctional Facility in Walsenburg, was declared “funded,” but no additional details about the facility could be found in the documents.

Macdonald said the addition of any ICE detention centers in Colorado would be “a travesty.”

“They’re housing people who have in large measure never been accused or convicted of any crimes whatsoever,” Macdonald said. “They are people who have come to this country for a better life, and the way we treat them reflects on the values we have as a society. When we mistreat immigrants who are in civil detention, that’s a sign of how our government is treating all of us, so people should care when our government abuses the civil rights of anyone in our community.”

‘Nobody should have to live in fear’

Before this summer, Montes wasn’t an activist, but increasing ICE activity lit a fire beneath her. Now, the 34-year-old is organizing and leading protests against the proposed ICE facility that could open in her county.

“I don’t want to be on the wrong side of history,” Montes said. “I don’t want to look back and say all this happened before my eyes and I just stayed silent just because I was scared of some white guy.”

Montes’ parents came to the United States illegally from Mexico but now have legal status. Her family moved to Colorado in 2007, a year after one of the largest immigration raids in U.S. history played out at a Greeley meatpacking plant.

“We knew about it, and I have had family that worked there. And it’s something you always think about,” Montes said.

When ICE activity ramped up across the nation and in Colorado last year under the Trump administration’s push for mass deportations, Montes said she was too scared to speak up.

Then she heard rumors about the former private prison in Hudson being repurposed into a new ICE detention center.

“That’s way too close for comfort,” Montes said. “I wanted to be more involved and help the community also be prepared instead of just living in fear because nobody should have to live in fear.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GRE-L-HudsonICEProtest0121-0531x.jpg?w=1024&h=701,N,,2026-01-22 01:37:41.175303

WASHINGTON—Yesterday, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed its opposition to a renewed motion to dismiss made by the DC Board of Elections, which FAIR is suing over DC’s law letting aliens—including illegal aliens and diplomats—vote in DC local elections. In the suit, FAIR represents Ralph Chittams and five other registered U.S. citizen voters in DC. (DC politician Stacia Hall, formerly the lead plaintiff in the case, has moved away from DC and withdrawn from the case.)

In its motion to dismiss, the Board of Elections claims that DC has a rational basis for the alien voting law, since the law is meant to expand DC’s political community to include resident aliens who are affected by the outcome of local elections.

In its opposition, FAIR shows that DC’s law in fact has no rational basis. The Supreme Court has ruled that, under the Constitution, the political community of the United States—including localities such as DC—consists only of U.S. citizens. DC has no legitimate governmental interest in, and therefore no rational basis for, expanding its political community beyond the limits set by the Constitution.

The reason for these limits is obvious. Since 1776, the people of the United States—that is, American citizens—have always been regarded as the ultimate sovereign of this country. That is, citizens have a right to govern themselves through voting and holding office. This right is infringed if U.S. citizens are, in part, governed by the votes of citizens of foreign countries.

“‘We the People’ established the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land,” said Christopher J. Hajec, deputy general counsel of FAIR. “That means the people are sovereign, and laws like DC’s that diminish that sovereignty and deprive Americans of their right to govern themselves violate the Constitution. We hope the Court sees that, because DC’s law lets those who are not part of the American people govern in America, it is unconstitutional at the most basic level.”

I want to thank every Portlander for making their voice heard about ICE's presence in our city. I agree with those saying loud and clear that our public safety is undermined by the actions taken by federal agents. That is why I called on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed of the January 8 shooting by federal agents in the Hazelwood neighborhood.

Regarding the notice of violation issued to the ICE facility, we must follow the process. Any attempt to unilaterally revoke the conditional land use approval would surely be challenged. We cannot allow hasty action to prevent us from taking meaningful action.

The land use process is just one way the City is standing up to federal overreach. We are fighting back with legal action. We are fighting back as a Sanctuary City that does not assist federal immigration enforcement. We are fighting back with the Protect Portland Initiative, passed unanimously by the City Council. We are fighting back alongside you and will continue to do so with every legal and legislative tool we have available to protect our residents' civil and human rights.

The Trump administration is ramping up its aggressive approach to immigration as it begins its second year.

The Associated Press reported today that an internal memo shows some new federal immigration officers have been trained to forcibly enter homes without a judge's warrant, a sharp reversal of guidance that protected constitutional limits.

That comes amid news that ICE's latest surge has targeted the state of Maine. At least 50 people were arrested there earlier this week. Some top local officials have condemned ICE's aggressive approach, including Portland Mayor Mark Dion during a news conference today.

Mark Dion, Mayor of Portland, Maine: While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. What we have been concerned with as a council is the enforcement tactics that ICE has undertaken in other communities, which to our mind appear to threaten and intimidate populations.

Geoff Bennett:

In Minnesota, there's been no letup in ICE's surge there now in its third week. Today, a federal appeals court put a hold on a lower court's order that had restrained federal immigration agents' use of force against peaceful protesters.

State and local officials are continuing to push back against the federal presence in the Twin Cities. And more details are coming to light about a naturalized U.S. citizen with no criminal record, according to his family, who was arrested and detained by ICE in an incident that went viral.

Chongly Scott Thao, a resident of St. Paul, Minnesota, was later released and spoke recently about the ordeal after he was pulled from his home out through the snow.

Chongly Scott Thao, Detained By ICE:

So I just said, OK, let's open the door, see what they want. And then, suddenly, there's guns pointed at us. I was like, whoa. Then, suddenly, they just handcuffed me. They didn't ask for my I.D. or anything until after they handcuffed me.

Geoff Bennett:

And we are joined now by Kaohly Her, the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota.

Thank you for being with us.

Give us the latest picture of what's happening right now on the ground in your city with federal immigration enforcement. And is there any coordination between ICE and local law enforcement?

Kaohly Her, Mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota: So there is no coordination between ICE and local law enforcement. We are not informed when they go out on their assignments or who they're targeting. We do not get that kind of information.

And I think that that is what is causing the environment on the ground right now. People are afraid. They are frustrated. They are angry. But, I mean, there's also a lot of hope that we see on the ground as well with the love and the care and the kindness that people are showing each other. And so I feel hopeful about what can be the outcome, even if it feels like there's despair all around us right now.

Geoff Bennett:

The police chief of the Minneapolis suburb Brooklyn Park said that off-duty police officers of color had been targeted by ICE, at least on one occasion with guns drawn.

Are St. Paul officers seeing that kind of activity?

Kaohly Her:

We are seeing accounts of off-duty officers being stopped by ICE. This is not an isolated incident of in the Brooklyn Park area. We have heard accounts across the state of law enforcement being stopped by ICE.

Geoff Bennett:

I also want to ask you about this incident in St. Paul where protesters disrupted a church service where one of the pastors is an ICE official.

At this moment, when tensions are already high, do you believe entering a house of worship during a service is an acceptable form of protest or does that cross a line?

Kaohly Her:

You know, there is an active investigation into that situation. I wouldn't -- police did arrive on the scene, but by the time they got there, the individuals who disrupted the service were already gone.

So I can't expand too much on really that particular situation, but I will say that, for me personally, I am somebody who is a person of faith. I'm a Christian. I think that places of worship are sacred spaces. But I have said this before, is that, if our federal government and our friends from the other side of the aisle want us to respect sacred spaces, which I believe are churches, a place of worship is a sacred space, that means that we have to also respect other spaces, such as hospitals, places of which people are needed to get exams or needed to be treated because of the hands of ICE have been injured.

That means that schools, where children are present, should be off-limits. And so I think that it is really important that if there's going to be call for respecting sacred spaces, then our federal government and the agents of the federal government should be respecting those sacred spaces as well. That is the only way that we're going to bring calm and order back to our city is if everyone on both sides of the spectrum agree that they're going to respect sacred spaces.

Geoff Bennett:

You are among a number of Democratic state and local officials to receive a Justice Department subpoena tied to an investigation into alleged disruption of ICE operations.

What's your reaction to being subpoenaed and how will your office respond?

Kaohly Her:

Yes, I mean, I wasn't surprised by it.

Our president has stated very clearly that he -- that there's retribution to be paid by states and municipalities that do not agree with him. And so -- but we remain committed to protecting our residents, our neighbors and our communities. It doesn't change the process or our actions moving forward.

But, yes, I wasn't surprised by it.

Geoff Bennett:

How do you intend to respond?

Kaohly Her:

I mean, we are having our legal team look at it right now. I mean, we will -- we are law-abiding citizens. We will comply with this subpoena.

But it doesn't mean that it's lawful what has been done and what we have been served with. But we will comply and we will work with our legal team to figure out the best steps forward.

Geoff Bennett:

What do you want people to know about what's happening in your city right now and how the folks you represent are responding?

Kaohly Her:

I mean, I think it's important for people to remember that they should not just believe in the rhetoric from their sides of the party, that the -- what I'm hearing out there is, if people would just comply with the law, that if they would just not resist, that if they were here legally, that they have nothing to worry about, that they shouldn't be scared.

And that is just not true. I mean, ICE has made it very clear, the federal government, HSI, has made it really clear that anybody in the path of anything that they're -- any task that they're executing on or any mission that they're executing on in that, they are fair game. And so we're allowing people to target based on the way someone looks and the way that they sound.

And now we have incident after incident after incident of American citizens being detained and being injured at the hands of ICE, people with no criminal record at all. We are hearing more of those cases than actual situations where somebody had a criminal record or is a danger to our communities, that we are hearing less of those stories and more of just everyday Americans being targeted.

We should not listen to the rhetoric of just our own sides of the party and hear the real stories of individuals who have been impacted. And I want people to know that this administration can punish our city and can punish our state, but they will never break our spirit, and that we will show and continue to love each other and create networks to support each other and that we will continue to show kindness to those who are the most hurt by what this federal government is doing.

We will continue to be Minnesotans.

The group released a copy of a memo dated May 12, 2025, and apparently signed by Todd Lyons, the acting leader of ICE, that advises agents that they can enter homes on the basis of an administrative warrant.
An administrative warrant is different from a judicial arrest warrant.
A judicial arrest warrant is a court order based on probable cause that a crime was committed.
The May 12 memo acknowledged that relying on administrative warrants to enter homes would be a new practice.","A whistle-blower group on Wednesday said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials drafted guidance saying that deportation officers are allowed to enter homes to arrest people without a judicial warrant.

The claim was based on information provided by two government officials, said the group, called Whistleblower Aid. The group released a copy of a memo dated May 12, 2025, and apparently signed by Todd Lyons, the acting leader of ICE, that advises agents that they can enter homes on the basis of an administrative warrant.

An administrative warrant is different from a judicial arrest warrant. It is typically drawn up after an immigration judge has ordered someone deported, and serves as the basis to arrest them. A judicial arrest warrant is a court order based on probable cause that a crime was committed.

Whistleblower Aid said the guidance violates the constitutional protection from unreasonable search and seizure.

“D.H.S.’s new policy to permit arrests in an alien’s residence, without a judicial warrant or consent, is a complete break from the law and undercuts the Fourth Amendment and the rights it protects,” Whistleblower Aid said in a statement. “As far as our clients understand, D.H.S. has failed to articulate any change in the law to allow for a policy reversal of this magnitude.”

The Times has not independently verified the memo or spoken to the whistle-blowers involved, who are described as two U.S. government officials. The whistle-blowers’ claim was reported earlier by The Associated Press.

One Homeland Security Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, had not seen the memo but said their understanding was that the idea was piloted in one or two locations earlier this year.

The whistle-blower group said that the memo was not widely distributed within ICE. Rather, some ICE officials were provided an opportunity to read the memo in the presence of a supervisor and give it back. One of the whistle-blowers, according to the group, said that agents were entering homes without judicial warrants in Texas, and that the practice was carried out there because of the conservative judges in the area.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called for hearings and demanded an explanation from the Homeland Security Department’s leader, Kristi Noem.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Mr. Blumenthal said in a statement. “It is a legally and morally abhorrent policy that exemplifies the kinds of dangerous, disgraceful abuses America is seeing in real time.”

Department of Homeland Security officials did not contest the specific allegations made by the whistle-blower group.

“Every illegal alien who D.H.S. serves administrative warrants/I-205s,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman, has had “full due process” and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.

“The officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause,” she added. “For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement.”

ICE officers historically have relied on people voluntarily opening the doors of their homes to make arrests, or by tracking down targets in public spaces. The inability to enter homes has long stymied officers, in part because rights advocates advise immigrants not to open their doors when immigration officials arrive.

A 2025 Homeland Security training manual indicated that the agency itself agreed that entering homes without a judicial warrant was prohibited.

“Entering a home to arrest a person without a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement is typically a violation of the Fourth Amendment, regardless of whether the officer has probable cause to arrest the suspect,” the manual reads.

The May 12 memo acknowledged that relying on administrative warrants to enter homes would be a new practice.

“Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence,” the memo reads, “the D.H.S. Office of General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

The memo adds that officers and agents must knock and announce themselves first but says that if an immigrant does not respond, they can use a “reasonable amount” of force to enter the home.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/13/multimedia/21dc-ice-warrant/13nat-minneapolis-protests-01-jlqc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 01:37:45.580494

Ahmed said that she was in the area when she believes ICE were targeting two men she did not know, only for agents to shove her to the floor. She said that one of them called her a racial slur before putting her into a vehicle, where she said she met another woman who was detained.

""We were holding each other tight. I'll never forget the fear that we both felt in our hearts that day,"" Ahmed said, ""they pushed me hard, they used a lot of violence.""

Ahmed spent the next two days detained, only to be released without any charges. The 23-year-old was born in the United States and WCCO found no evidence of a criminal record.

Her story is one of many reported instances where ICE has detained an American citizen without charging them since Operation Metro Surge began in December. MN Ice Witness, a website driven by independent citizens, is recording media reports that detail these detainments. According to their efforts and WCCO's own review, ICE has detained at least 12 Americans, at times violently. DFL Representative Mohamud Noor shared video which he said shows ICE pulling an American man from his car in St. Cloud on Wednesday.

During a press conference on Tuesday, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino did not answer a question about the number of Americans ICE has detained. The agency provides no public data regarding these arrests, with many of those involved accusing the agency of profiling them. WCCO has asked multiple times for data related to American detainments, questions the agency is choosing to ignore.

On Jan. 18, ICE detained Chongly Scott Thao at gun point at his home in St. Paul, bringing him out into the frigid temperatures in little more than a blanket. The American was released without being charged.

On Jan. 11, ICE detained Rogelio Jimenez, dragging him out of his vehicle after he said that they mistook him for a different person. The American was released without being charged.

On Jan. 8, ICE agents held two Target employees in Richfield on the ground before forcing them into the back of an SUV. Minnesota Rep. Mike Howard, who represents Richfield, said he confirmed that both are Americans.

On Jan. 6, a naturalized citizen told WCCO that ICE left him hurt and hospitalized after they detained him. ICE then released him.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/22/c846812c-6024-4c9f-9ce4-77db1fd7b94c/thumbnail/1200x630/32f7859314322607ea2d5037a5cf994a/5p-pkg-woman-detained-2-days-wcco9n5z.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 01:37:50.565056

The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments today in a landmark legal battle centered on President Trump's efforts to shape the Federal Reserve in his image.

Our justice correspondent Ali Rogin has more on the case that could threaten the independence of the nation's Central Bank -- Ali.

Ali Rogin:

Geoff, you may recall it was a key moment in the president's standoff with the Federal Reserve. Back in August, President Trump posted on his social media platform that he was firing one of the Central Bank's governors, Lisa Cook, alleging she'd committed mortgage fraud.

But Cook, who was appointed by President Biden, sued Trump to block her removal, claiming her firing was illegal, and lower courts have blocked her dismissal. A majority of the justices had tough questions today for Solicitor General John Sauer, expressing skepticism about the rushed nature of the case and Cook's lack of recourse.

Samuel Alito, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice:

Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody, by the executive branch, by the district court, by the D.C. Circuit, in such a hurried manner?

Ketanji Brown Jackson, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice:

Was Ms. Cook given the opportunity in some sort of formal proceeding to contest that evidence or explain it?

D. John Sauer, U.S. Solicitor General:

Not a formal proceeding. She was given an opportunity in public because she was notified.

Ketanji Brown Jackson:

In the world?

D. John Sauer:

Yes.

Ketanji Brown Jackson:

Like, she was supposed to post about it, and that was the opportunity to be heard?

Ali Rogin:

The case comes as the Trump administration has moved to exert greater control over the Federal Reserve. This month, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell over comments he made to Congress about a building project.

For analysis on today's argument, we're joined now by ""News Hour"" Supreme Court analyst and SCOTUSblog co-founder Amy Howe and David Wessel, director at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings institute.

Thank you so much, both of you for being here.

Amy, this case has massive implications for the independence of the Federal Reserve. What were the key questions that were being looked at today and what are your major takeaways?

Amy Howe:

So the key questions -- I mean, as a really technical matter, the questions before the justices was simply whether to leave in place an order by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that leaves Lisa Cook in office.

This case came to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. The Trump administration was seeking permission to fire Cook and asking the justices to put this order by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb on hold. And after nearly two hours of oral arguments today, the justices seemed inclined to leave Cook in office, to turn down the Trump administration's request to pause Cobb's order.

The real question is how they are going to do it. Are they going to just send the case back to the lower courts and let the litigation play out there? Or are they going to try to resolve some of the thorny issues that are in play, things like what does it mean for the president to fire someone for cause? Can courts review a president's determination that he has fired a governor of the Federal Board -- Federal Reserve Board for cause?

What kind of process is someone entitled to before she can be fired? And the justices really sort of weren't sure. Several of them seemed inclined to send the case back to the lower courts. Chief Justice John Roberts, on the other hand, seemed to suggest that the court maybe should go ahead and decide the case right now.

Ali Rogin:

Yes, it was interesting, David. Some of the conservative justices seemed to engage in some of those thorny questions that Amy was talking about.

Justice Kavanaugh raised concerns about what this attempted dismissal code means for the Fed's independence. He said that, if the president alone can determine whether somebody can be removed for cause and what that cause is, that that could -- quote -- ""weaken, if not shatter the independence of the Fed.""

Why is the independence of this body so important?

David Wessel, Brookings Institution:

So the argument is that politicians, if they set interest rates, will tend to sit them too low in order to get more growth now and at the cost of more inflation later.

And so the U.S. and other major capitalist democracies have decided it would be better to have an independent Central Bank that is insulated from that political pressure. The Fed has a mandate set by Congress, maximum employment and price stability. And Congress has said, you guys decide what's the best interest rate to achieve that goal.

Ali Rogin:

And we have heard from a number of bankers, economists had written briefs in favor of Lisa Cook today, saying why this would be such a bad idea.

Why is there so much concern now over the firing for cause of just this one person on the Board of Governors?

David Wessel:

If President Trump gets his way, he will be able to fire any Fed governor for anything he deems is cause. The administration argues that the courts can't even review that.

So, for instance, his attacks on Jay Powell, the Fed chair, over the building, the Fed's handling of the building, not its finest hour, by the way, could become perhaps a reason to fire him for cause. And if the president can get rid of all seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, he would have control.

In fact, one of the questions that lawyers were asked today was, well, if we let Trump do this, will his successor just do the same and get rid of all the Trump appointees?

Ali Rogin:

The Supreme Court, Amy, has had to weigh in on a number of these sort of existential questions this term. They have looked at different ways the president has tried to exert control. They heard a case just this month, last month, about Rebecca Slaughter, a member of the Federal Trade Commission whom Trump had dismissed.

How is the court grappling with Trump's efforts to reshape the federal government in this major way?

Amy Howe:

So up until the case of Lisa Cook, the Supreme Court has green-lit Trump's efforts to remove the heads of independent multimember agencies. And so most of that has happened on the court's emergency docket.

The Supreme Court has given the OK to the Trump administration to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, even though there are similar statutes that only allow the president to remove officials at those agencies for cause.

And then the Supreme Court heard oral arguments, as you said, in December, in the case of Rebecca Slaughter, a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission whom Trump fired. And they seemed inclined to rule in favor of the Trump administration.

So in one of the orders on the emergency docket, the Supreme Court rejected an argument that members of the NLRB and the MSPB had made that said, if you are allowed to -- if Trump is allowed to fire us, what happens to the Fed? Because the statutes are similar.

And the Supreme Court in that case said, essentially, the Fed is special, and don't worry about the Fed. And so the case of Lisa Cook today suggests that the Supreme Court does regard the Fed as special.

Ali Rogin:

Yes, we are now worrying about the Fed.

David, last question to you.

Today's arguments, of course, were part of a longstanding -- just the latest in the longstanding effort by President Trump to take on the Fed. We mentioned the investigation into Jerome Powell. It's hard not to look at these things all in concert together. Are they all of a piece, or should we be looking at them discretely?

David Wessel:

They are definitely all of a piece.

I mean, as Amy pointed out, the court is a hard time here to explain why the Fed is special. I can argue why the Fed is special, but I don't have to make a legal argument. Jerome Powell was in the courtroom today, and I think that was a reminder to the justices that this is not about one Fed governor who may or may not have made a mistake or cheated on her mortgage application.

This is about the very concept that people are appointed to the Federal Reserve Board for terms of up to 14 years, and they can only be removed for cause, and most of the justices seem to think that whatever she did on her mortgages wouldn't qualify.

Ali Rogin:

Amy Howe with SCOTUSblog, David Wessel of the Brookings Institution, thank you both so much.

David Wessel:

You're welcome.

The shooting of Ms. Good, an unarmed mother of three, has led to sustained protests against federal agents in Minneapolis.

Ten federal prosecutors from Michigan have been assigned to work in Minnesota for the time being, according to people familiar with the matter.
But prosecutors have only filed a handful of criminal cases related to the protests since Ms. Good was killed.","Federal prosecutors issued subpoenas on Tuesday to at least five Democratic officials in Minnesota, ramping up the Justice Department’s investigation into their response to the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown in the state, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The subpoenas sought documents from Gov. Tim Walz, Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and Mayor Kaohly Her of St. Paul related to their policies on immigration enforcement efforts in the state. Similar subpoenas sought information from Keith Ellison, the state attorney general, and from Hennepin County, where Mary Moriarty, the county attorney, has said she has jurisdiction to investigate the fatal shooting this month of a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, by a federal immigration agent.

The subpoenas, all of which were formally served on the officials’ offices, represent a significant expansion of the inquiry into Minnesota leaders that was disclosed late Friday. The investigation was initially said to have focused on Mr. Frey and Mr. Walz, who have both criticized the crackdown. But it now appears that prosecutors will also scrutinize other public officials.

While the subpoenas did not cite a specific criminal statute, the inquiry as a whole was said to center on whether elected officials in Minnesota had conspired to impede the thousands of federal agents who have been in the state since last month looking for undocumented immigrants. But the investigation is likely to run up against stiff pushback for examining political speech and conduct that is traditionally protected by the First Amendment.

The shooting of Ms. Good, an unarmed mother of three, has led to sustained protests against federal agents in Minneapolis. In the immediate aftermath of Ms. Good’s death, Mr. Frey used an expletive to demand that agents leave the city. Mr. Walz has also sharply criticized the agents’ conduct, asking residents to monitor their efforts.

Justice Department leaders, in turn, have vowed to arrest anyone impeding the agents’ mission. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, recently accused Mr. Frey and Mr. Walz of “encouraging violence against law enforcement” and referred to their actions as “terrorism.” But there is no evidence that either man has incited violence — let alone engaged in acts of terrorism.

The investigation into the elected Democrats comes as the Justice Department has all but announced that it will not bring charges against Jonathan Ross, the agent who killed Ms. Good. Instead, the department has signaled that it intends to scrutinize possible connections between Ms. Good and her partner, Becca Good, and left-wing protesters in Minnesota.

That decision led to the resignation last week of six prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Minneapolis. Among those who quit was Joseph H. Thompson, the office’s second in command, who oversaw a sprawling fraud investigation that President Trump and his allies have repeatedly used to criticize Democratic leaders in the state.

Federal investigators have refused to cooperate with state and local officials like Mr. Ellison and Ms. Moriarty, who have the power to open their own inquiries into Ms. Good’s killing. But the additional subpoenas could further complicate those efforts.

In recent days, the Trump administration has started enlisting prosecutors and agents from other states to travel to Minnesota to assist in pursuing criminal cases against protesters they claim have impeded the activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Over the weekend, Attorney General Pam Bondi pressed U.S. attorneys in Midwestern states to provide personnel.

Ten federal prosecutors from Michigan have been assigned to work in Minnesota for the time being, according to people familiar with the matter. Additional prosecutors are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.

Administration officials have repeatedly said that ICE agents have been under sustained assault from protesters. But prosecutors have only filed a handful of criminal cases related to the protests since Ms. Good was killed.

The Justice Department needs additional personnel in part because so many senior prosecutors left the Minneapolis office rather than follow orders from the department’s leaders to conduct a criminal investigation into Ms. Good. The office already faced a significant staff shortage because many prosecutors had left last year as the Trump administration offered buyouts and encouraged prosecutors to quit.

To try to address the shortage, Justice Department leaders plan to draw staff from six states: Michigan, South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Wisconsin, according to people familiar with the matter and internal department communications.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/dc-minnesota-tzqh/dc-minnesota-tzqh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:56:54.564217

However, Norristown police chief Michael Trail acknowledged that officers do have contact with ICE agents.
According to Vincent, Montco Community Watch estimates ICE has detained at least 140 people in the county since the crackdown began.","A nationwide immigration crackdown has cast waves of fear, frustration and uncertainty throughout the Montgomery County seat.

More than 70 people gathered Tuesday evening for a vigil outside Norristown Municipal Hall to call attention to a surge in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the community.

“This community is under siege by ICE,” said Stephanie Vincent, a lead organizer with Montco Community Watch. “What people are seeing in Minnesota is not new — the violence, the kidnapping, the disrespect for due process is happening right here in our towns and in Norristown.”

The candlelight gathering coincided with a municipal council meeting. Organizers used the public comment section to demand transparency from the Norristown Police Department regarding its relationship with ICE.

“We see them all the time together,” said Denisse Agurto, executive director of Unides Para Servir Norristown.

Agurto began her public comment with a mask on — a mask she said ICE officers often wear when patrolling along Marshall Street.

Norristown does not honor ICE detainer requests unless accompanied by a “validly executed judicial warrant.” The municipality also discourages government departments, including the police, from sharing information with the federal agency.

However, Norristown police chief Michael Trail acknowledged that officers do have contact with ICE agents. Trail told WHYY News that his department is “trying to balance” its responsibilities, but he said his officers are not assisting ICE.

“When you’re seeing a Norristown police officer in the proximity of an ICE agent, it’s natural assume that we’re assisting, but lot of times we are called there for other ancillary reasons or quite frankly, I would like our officers there because I want our officers to know and I want federal law enforcement to know that we’re out here protecting our community,” Trail said.

Trail met with Agurto shortly after her public comment, and the two shared a dialogue outside of the council’s chambers.

Despite the blistering cold Tuesday night, the vigil drew members from various communities in and around Norristown.

“We are reminded that whereas it is not a sin or moral failing to not have worldly paperwork, it is a sin and moral failing to turn away our neighbor,” said Rev. Leslie Mamas, of Olivet-Schwenkfelder United Church of Christ in East Norriton.

According to Vincent, Montco Community Watch estimates ICE has detained at least 140 people in the county since the crackdown began.

“We’ve crossed into the territory where ICE has become the law enforcement arm of a fascist regime,” Vincent said. “And it’s time to start saying that out loud. It’s time to say that our public officials, our towns cannot work with this organization. It’s not acceptable, it’s not OK, and it’s about defending the Constitution.”

The Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good by ICE officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has only heightened tensions.

“We were always saying that something is going to happen — like somebody’s going to be killed,” Agurto said. “And now we are seeing this.”

The Department of Justice is not actively investigating the circumstances of Good’s death. Instead, the federal government has pushed prosecutors to look into Good’s widow, sparking resignations among some prosecutors. Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would open the door for the deployment of active-duty troops.

“I’ve been a registered Republican my whole adult life and what’s happening in this country is making me — I don’t even recognize it anymore,” said vigil attendee Fiona Palladino, of King of Prussia.

Palladino said she’s a nurse who works with a 911 agency. She reiterated testimony from some of the public speakers that people are reluctant to call 911 for medical attention.

“They’re afraid, and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to reassure people, ‘We’re not the cops. You’re safe with us. We’re not the cops,’” she said. “But that right there is going to discourage people from getting help, and there are going to be real injuries. There are going to be real deaths due to this kind of thing.”

Palladino called on people to “step up and be out here.” Lori Warren, of West Norriton, said she came out to support her fellow neighbors.

“I’m a white middle-aged woman, so I’m privileged, and I’m using my privilege to come out and to let our neighbors know that they’re not alone and that we want our police to protect them just like they would protect us,” Warren said.

Vincent said it’s a “pivotal moment” for police. She wondered aloud if ICE descends en masse on the Philadelphia area as it has in Minneapolis, how would local law enforcement respond?

“Are the police going to protect them?” she asked. “Are the police going to stop them?”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/norristown-ice-vigil-KC-012126-09.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 01:37:54.765203

Arthur,,,,,https://cis.org/Arthur/NYT-Tries-Measure-Trump-II-Deportations,"From FY 2014 until Trump II, however, most illegal entrants weren’t Mexican nationals, and importantly at certain times weren’t single adults (let alone males), either.
The good news for Trump II is that those pre-FY 2014 border demographics have returned, for now.
Under the George W. Bush and Obama administrations in FY 2009, ICE set its most recent record for interior removals, nearly 238,000 that fiscal year.
Interior removals tapered off thereafter, however, falling 72.6 percent from that record by FY 2016 (65,332).
230,000 Interior Removals With that background, the Times reports there have been 230,000 ICE interior removals since Trump returned, out of what it terms 540,000 “deportations”.","A recent article in the New York Times is headlined “How Many People Has Trump Deported So Far?” The stats offered by the “Gray Lady” look fairly accurate, but the story it’s attempting to tell — that Trump II is lagging prior administrations in “deporting” removable aliens from the United States — is suspect. That’s largely because of the facts the “newspaper of record” conveniently ignores — particularly about the correlation between “at large” arrests and “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

“What Is a Deportation?”

The Times asks the question “What is a deportation?”, which is fundamental to its analysis.

But then the article fails to answer that critical question, asserting: “Counting deportations is not as straightforward as it seems because there is not a specific legal definition.” Perhaps an outlet that holds itself in high esteem should check its own archives (colloquially the Times’ “morgue”).

The reason there’s no “specific legal definition” for “deportations” is because Congress formally retired it nearly 30 years ago (for legal reasons), swapping out both that term — which referred to the expatriation of aliens who had entered the United States — and “exclusions” (which referred to aliens stopped and turned around at the ports and borders) for “removals”.

“Removal” refers to the expulsion of aliens ordered removed by DHS under the “expedited removal” process in section 235(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as well as those ordered removed by immigration judges at the end of administrative “removal proceedings” process under section 240 of the INA.

To be fair, most — expert and casual observer alike — continue to use “deportations” to refer to removals, because it’s a term we all understand.

Vestiges of that retired term continue to haunt the INA, including when Congress delineated the grounds of removability for aliens who have been “admitted” to the United States (as defined in section 101(a)(13)(A) of the INA) in section 237 of the act, captioned “Deportable aliens”.

The real goal the Times is attempting to achieve is valid, which is measuring the number of removable aliens who have left the United States since Donald Trump returned, including: aliens removed under final removal orders, aliens turned around at the borders and the ports, crewmen with denied requests to land, and otherwise removable aliens who left on their own accord (so-called “self-deportations”).

The newspaper’s effort is complicated by the fact that various administrations have fudged their “deportation” totals for decades by lumping in “turn-arounds” at the borders and the ports (as well as crewmen) with more formal removals.

The Obama administration was likely the most egregious offender in that regard, which is why you should take characterizations of the 44th president as the “deporter in chief” with a grain of salt.

It was a title he gleefully accepted in a failed gambit to pass the amnesty he desperately desired, but at this point it’s so baked into the analysis it’s unfair to judge his successors by any other metric.

By the way, measured in this manner, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush would share the “deporter in chief” title for the 1.864 million removals and returns they oversaw in FY 2000, with Reagan a close finisher at 1.61 million in 1986. In contrast, Obama broke 850,000 just once, in FY 2010.

The Demographic Shift in Illegal Immigration

For most of his administration, Obama (and his predecessors) had a “deportation” advantage Biden and Trump didn’t: Prior to FY 2011, illegal migrants at the Southwest border were almost exclusively single adults — mostly male — from Mexico, and even up to FY 2014, the majority were.

When Border Patrol agents apprehend a single adult from Mexico at the Southwest border, they can generally process the alien and turn him back to Mexico in about eight hours. That’s a “deportation” under that continuing Obama-era calculus.

The problem is that about a quarter of those FY 2011 illegal migrants were “recidivists”, meaning they came back after they were turned around, and when they were apprehended again and returned once more, officially counted as a second deportation.

Given that the Southwest border recidivism rate was 30 percent or higher between FY 2005 (when DHS first attempted to capture that statistic) and FY 2009, you can understand how specious Obama’s record on “deportations” was.

From FY 2014 until Trump II, however, most illegal entrants weren’t Mexican nationals, and importantly at certain times weren’t single adults (let alone males), either.

In FY 2019, the high point for illegal immigration under Trump I, just 19.5 percent of the 851,500-plus Southwest border apprehensions involved Mexican nationals, and more than 64.5 percent involved either adult migrants entering illegally with children in “family units” (“FMUs”, 55.6 percent) or “unaccompanied alien children” (“UACs”, 8.9 percent) travelling alone.

Thanks to a combination of poorly reasoned court decisions and equally poorly considered laws, DHS had to release nearly all of those FMUs and UACs, and because most of the single adults were “other than Mexican” (OTMs), they couldn’t be quickly turned around, either.

Trump I responded to that OTM/FMU surge with the “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP), also known as “Remain in Mexico”, under which a small number of OTM FMUs and single adults were sent back across the border to await their asylum hearings, but that process didn’t produce “deportations” even under the lax Obama-era standards.

The good news for Trump II is that those pre-FY 2014 border demographics have returned, for now.

Of the 79,507 illegal migrants apprehended at the Southwest border between last February (the first full month of Trump II) and December, two-thirds (67 percent or 53,395) were Mexican nationals, 86 percent of whom were single adults.

Because, again, those Mexican nationals can be quickly returned, that flow boosts total “deportations” under the lax Obama-era “deportation” definition the Times prefers, but because Southwest border illegal entries have fallen by more than 90 percent under Trump II, it also detracts from the total.

The differences in border apprehension and return totals between the current administration and the last one are why the Times argues “the total number of deportations since Mr. Trump took office [is] 540,000 — fewer than in the last two years of the Biden administration, when border crossings were at record highs”, but the higher Biden numbers signal the weakness of his policies, not their strength.

More aliens attempted to enter illegally under Biden because they assumed (usually correctly) that they’d be able to remain. Fewer are coming now because they understand they likely won’t be allowed to stay, and lower attempted entries means more border security, or as Congress termed it, “operational control”.

“Interior Removals”

As I’ve explained in the past, the key metric for measuring the effectiveness of immigration enforcement efforts is ICE “deportations” of aliens within the United States (as opposed to at the border), formally known as “interior removals” (a term of art, even if it’s news to the Times). Here’s why that’s true.

Border enforcement is “reactive” because generally, DHS can’t control the number of migrants who come to the border illegally.

Biden was the exception to that rule, because by releasing nearly all (88.5 percent) of the illegal entrants who arrived at the borders and the ports, his administration spurred the largest illicit migrant surge in U.S. history, while (ironically) also boosting “deportations” of the rest under the Times’ flawed reasoning.

Interior enforcement, on the other hand, is proactive: DHS must identify, arrest, detain, and prosecute those aliens before it removes them.

Under the George W. Bush and Obama administrations in FY 2009, ICE set its most recent record for interior removals, nearly 238,000 that fiscal year. Interior removals tapered off thereafter, however, falling 72.6 percent from that record by FY 2016 (65,332).

That decline occurred when the Obama administration added a new wrinkle to interior removals, focusing its interior enforcement efforts at first (in March 2011) to a degree and then (in November 2014) almost exclusively on criminal aliens living in the United States.

That Obama “criminal alien” standard has come to define the purpose of “deportations” in the collective minds of many Americans and most in the media, which is why you see so many hit pieces now that deride ICE under Trump II for arresting “non-criminal” aliens in the interior.

“Deportation Is Crucial”

Trump supporters and many on the right usually respond to such attacks by noting most of those aliens are “criminals” because it’s a crime to enter the United States illegally (under section 275 of the INA) or highlighting the crimes “otherwise law-abiding aliens” must commit to remain here, like identity theft.

Those points are true and indisputable, but they miss three more important points.

First, it’s impossible to secure the border against a surge in illegal migrants, drugs, and other contraband if would-be migrants believe that if they can enter illegally and avoid the cops once they are here, they will be inoculated against “deportation”.

Second, the cognate to the (legitimate) focus on the due process rights of aliens in removal proceedings is the duty of the United States to remove aliens who have been accorded that due process and ordered removed.

Simply put, aliens have some level of protection under the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause, but so do Americans in the removal process, which is why ICE represents their interests in immigration courts.

Third, as Barbara Jordan explained:

Deportation is crucial. Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: Those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave. The top priorities for detention and removal, of course, are criminal aliens. But for the system to be credible, people actually have to be deported at the end of the process.

If the lead-up to the November 2024 elections demonstrated anything, it’s that Americans’ support for even legal immigration inevitably declines when they realize our immigration system lacks credibility and fails to serve our “national interest”.

Restoring credibility to our immigration system requires removals, regardless of whether those aliens are criminals or not. Obama may have minimized non-criminal removals, but there’s no reason ICE must continue to play that game.

230,000 Interior Removals

With that background, the Times reports there have been 230,000 ICE interior removals since Trump returned, out of what it terms 540,000 “deportations”.

Assuming that interior removal statistic is correct, the agency has fallen just slightly short of that (most recent) FY 2009 record of almost 238,000 interior removals, but then again: (1) ICE is far outperforming interior removals during the Biden years; and (2) is doing so in a much more challenging environment.

The Times concedes the first point but let me explain the second.

The Center defines “sanctuary jurisdictions” as:

cities, counties, and states [with] laws, ordinances, regulations, resolutions, policies, or other practices that obstruct immigration enforcement and shield criminals from ICE — either by refusing to or prohibiting agencies from complying with ICE detainers, imposing unreasonable conditions on detainer acceptance, denying ICE access to interview incarcerated aliens, or otherwise impeding communication or information exchanges between their personnel and federal immigration officers.

As I explained to Congress last May, while some jurisdictions implemented sanctuary policies decades ago, the movement really took off in response to DHS’s mid-2010s “Secure Communities” program. Basically, state and local support for ICE enforcement took a nosedive around 2014.

Which brings me to the following excerpt from the Times’ article:

In the past, ICE made most of its arrests in partnership with local jails and prisons, quietly taking into custody immigrants who had already been arrested by another law enforcement agency.

. . .

Arrests at jails and prisons went up over the past year, but the increase was far exceeded by the growth in what ICE calls “at-large” arrests, the apprehensions of immigrants on the streets, in courthouses, and at homes and businesses. These quadrupled to about 150,000 and made up a majority of immigration arrests in 32 states and Washington, D.C.

They were most common in states like California, Illinois and New York, where local governments have passed laws blocking local jails and prisons from transferring people to ICE custody.

The Times doesn’t use the word “sanctuary”, but “laws blocking local jails and prisons from transferring people to ICE custody” are the definition of such policies. Its omission of the term was deliberate.

In any event, that article includes a map of the states in which ICE has made “at-large” arrests under Trump II, concentrated almost exclusively in the Northeast (including New York and Massachusetts), the Northwest (Washington and Oregon), Illinois, and (curiously) Alaska.

Except for Georgia, at-large arrests are significantly lower south of Virginia and (aside from Oklahoma) in the Plains states and in the Southwest.

That at-large arrest map correlates with the Center’s sanctuary jurisdiction map, which explains why clashes between protestors and ICE officers are almost exclusively limited to a few areas.

As I recently explained, three states (Texas, Florida, and Tennessee) accounted for more than a third of all ICE arrests, because those states mandate cooperation by local officials with immigration authorities.

When ICE can simply pick up a criminal alien from a “secure location” like a jail or prison, officers don’t need to hit the streets looking for them.

When the agency is barred by sanctuary laws from arresting those aliens as soon as they are released from state and local custody, however, it must go into the community looking for them, and the pervasiveness of such laws explains a separate chart in the Times article showing a rise in “at-large” arrests under Trump II.

A Toxic Mix of Stupidity and Political Calculation

Two weeks after Trump returned, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued an opinion finding that counties in his state could not hold criminal aliens on ICE detainers.

That, of course, forced ICE officers into neighborhoods looking for those criminal aliens, and soon, officials in the Land of Ten Thousand Lakes began vilifying the agency’s enforcement efforts, with Gov. Tim Walz (D) referring to ICE as “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo” and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) claiming the agency’s “activities are largely built around terrorizing people”.

That was a month before Frey told ICE to “Get the f*** out of Minneapolis”, and the situation has since devolved into a toxic mix of stupidity and political calculation with Walz, Frey, and the rest egging on (likely) well-meaning but misinformed and occasionally violent protestors who attempt to interpose themselves between ICE officers and arrest targets.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/newyorktimes-social.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:52.795383

After rumors circulated social media over the weekend suggesting possible U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in and around Bellingham’s public schools, the district is confirming the posts were just that — rumors.

“There has been no ICE activity on Bellingham school properties,” Bellingham Public Schools spokesperson Dana Smith said in a statement to The Bellingham Herald.

Smith said two unrelated incidents — one involving police activity in the Columbia neighborhood on Friday and another involving a 10-minute “Hold” safety protocol at Shuksan Middle School to keep the halls clear to support students — may have created confusion.

“These two things seem to have combined into misinformation about ICE activity at or near our schools. The schools involved have been connecting directly with concerned families and answering their questions,” Smith told The Herald.

No ICE agents had visited Bellingham Public Schools as of Tuesday, Jan. 20, according to Smith. However, the district prepared and provided guidance last year for its school leadership and offices.

That guidance includes:

All visitors must abide by the district’s visitor policy and procedure 4200, which are designed to prevent disruption.

All visitors must report to a school’s main office or reception area.

No visitors may have access beyond a main office or reception area without permission of the school.

No visitors may disrupt educational proceedings of a school.

No visitor is entitled to information about or access to a student unless they have proper documentation showing that they are entitled to that information.

District office personnel will take the lead in all interactions with requests of immigration officers or other law enforcement.

Under a very limited set of circumstances, ICE agents may visit schools and request access to students. To enter a school past the main office or reception area, officials would need to present a judicial warrant, which is issued by a judge or court. It is unlikely that a judicial warrant would be issued for a child, according to the district.

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, good morning.
MIKE BARNICLE: Leader Jeffries, the Department of Justice is not the same Department of Justice that existed 12 or 14 months ago.
LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, that definitely is one of the projects that I think we’re going to need to work on.
House Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York, thank you very much for your time this morning, sir.","Today, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries appeared on MS NOW’s Morning Joe, where he made clear that, one year into Donald Trump’s term, House Democrats will continue to hold the Trump administration accountable for the corruption and extremism they are unleashing on American communities and their failure to fulfill the promise of lowering the high cost of living.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Let’s bring in right now, House Majority—Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York. I’m sorry there was a little time lapse to next year, still Minority Leader for now but before we go to that, I want to say, first of all, Independent voters, a plurality, close to a majority, are now calling for the elimination of ICE. I don’t think a lot of mainstream Democrats on the Hill want to do that, but the polls are breaking that way. So, Minority Leader Jeffries, before we get to funding for DHS and their brutal tactics which, by the way, it sounded even like Donald Trump was suggesting that they made a mistake in the killing of Renee Good. I’m curious about the Epstein Transparency Act that you passed well over a month ago. The Department of Justice was required by law, in an almost unanimous House vote and Senate vote, required to release all the files. They’ve only released about 1% of those files, most of those heavily redacted. What can you do, what can Democrats do, to answer the pleas of even MAGA Republicans—

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: When are they coming?—

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Who want these files released and want the White House to stop hiding them?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, good morning. The Department of Justice has completely and totally failed to comply with the law under that statute that was passed and of course signed by Donald Trump, almost unanimously enacted by both the House and the Senate. The DOJ was required to turn over the Epstein files by December 19th. A month has now passed, more than five million documents have failed to be released and the Department of Justice has not provided any reason that justifies their obstruction. The American people deserve the transparency and accountability connected to the release of the Epstein files. And, in my view, to the extent that Republicans are actually interested in making sure that that transparency occurs, then the Department of Justice needs to either come up to Capitol Hill and explain why they’ve failed to comply with the law or be held in contempt of Congress.

WILLIE GEIST: Leader Jeffries, as you know, Republicans, the Justice Department in particular, are saying there’s so many files, there’s millions of files, it’s going to take us a while. Are you buying that explanation and, if not, what do you suspect?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, from the very beginning of this whole sordid saga, Trump administration officials have claimed that they want to release these files, that they plan to release these files, they’re now compelled to release these files by a law that was passed in the Congress, and yet they continue to obstruct. And so, clearly, I think the American people can reasonably conclude they’re hiding something. Right? Who are they protecting is the question that we need to get a real answer to because the American people simply deserve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

JONATHAN LEMIRE: Leader Jeffries, let’s switch gears now and talk about the upcoming government funding bill, whether the government will perhaps even shut down as that deadline approaches. A thorny issue is funding for the Department of Homeland Security, and in particular ICE, in the wake of that fatal shooting in Minneapolis a couple of weeks ago. Talk to us about the divisions that you and your colleagues feel. What happens next?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, ICE is completely and totally out of control. Donald Trump promised with respect to immigration enforcement that the administration was going to target violent felons who are here in the country illegally. That’s something the American people support. The American people do not support the targeting, the arrest, the detention, the brutalization of American citizens, certainly do not find acceptable the killing of Renee Nicole Good and the targeting of law-abiding immigrant families and communities. And so, I think from our standpoint, and we’ll have a discussion in about an hour in our Caucus meeting about the path forward, but clearly there needs to be accountability mechanisms that is put into law so that ICE conducts itself like every other law enforcement agency in the United States of America. That’s not too much to ask. So some of the things that we believe are appropriate in this instance, are demanding be part of any final bill, are a warrant requirement. That’s common sense. ICE should not be able to storm houses of worship, hospitals and schools. That’s common sense. That relates to protocols that exist for every other law enforcement agency in the country. ICE should have a use-of-force standard. None currently exists. Of course, the notion that masked ICE agents are running around brutalizing American citizens, utilizing taxpayer dollars, completely and totally unacceptable. And so these are the types of things that we believe should be put into place to get ICE under control, consistent with the demands of the American people.

MIKE BARNICLE: Leader Jeffries, the Department of Justice is not the same Department of Justice that existed 12 or 14 months ago. Hundreds of prosecutors have left. The FBI has been stripped of a lot of skillful agents who left the Department of Justice. I realize you are in the minority, but what can be done to restore the integrity and the skill level of the Department of Justice?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, that definitely is one of the projects that I think we’re going to need to work on. From our standpoint, we’ve got two pillars that we need to proceed with as we move forward. One, of course, is affordability and making sure that we are driving down the high cost of living, fixing our broken healthcare system. Donald Trump promised that costs would go down on day one. Year one has passed. Costs haven’t gone down. They’ve gone up. But in addition to the affordability agenda that we’ll aggressively push, we need accountability. And Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice, they’ve weaponized this institution against political enemies. Highly qualified individuals have left, and they’re proceeding with impunity. And so from my standpoint, there have to be consequences for some of the outrageous things that have been done. Congress needs to function like a separate and co-equal branch of government as opposed to what my Republican colleagues have done, which is a reckless rubber stamp for Donald Trump’s extreme agenda. We’re going to continue to press the case, to elevate, to make the Department of Justice great again, but the reality is that work is not really going to happen in a meaningful fashion until Democrats take back control of the House of Representatives after the November midterm elections.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: All right. House Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York, thank you very much for your time this morning, sir. We appreciate it.

The effort was a threat by the administration to withhold billions of dollars in education funding from states and schools that refused to sign a document attesting that they did not have diversity and equity programs. Education groups sued in federal court and won a favorable ruling in August, which the government then appealed.

But on Wednesday, the administration withdrew its appeal. The federal judge in Maryland who heard the case, Stephanie Gallagher, ruled against the Trump administration on multiple grounds. She found that the administration had not followed proper procedure in attempting to withhold the funding, and that the underlying policy threatened educators’ free speech in the classroom.

The case was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, the American Sociological Association and a school district in Eugene, Oregon. Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT, said the case was the most important of the 22 lawsuits that her union had filed, along with partner groups, against President Donald Trump in his second term, because of the precedent it would establish for limiting executive power.

“You cannot, by executive fiat, rewrite 60 years of educational opportunity,” Weingarten said in an interview, referring to the civil rights laws that protect students from racial discrimination in schools.

Though the lawsuit succeeded in staving off one threat to withhold funding, Weingarten acknowledged that the administration has “other ways of getting to the same result” of rolling back diversity and equity programs in education.

The organization hosted a press conference Wednesday morning in Downtown Orlando asking residents to speak out against the current administration. Republicans, though, are encouraging ICE to continue doing its job.

“The happiest place in the world has turned in to show me your papers city,” said on of the Democratic Party leaders.

Within the last week, the Orange County Democratic Party said there have been confirmed reports of ICE seeking warehouse space in Orlando. Democratic leaders said there have also been confirmed reports of up to 200 hotel rooms booked by ICE in and around Orange County.

Leaders gathered on Wednesday to speak out against those moves and to say ICE is making residents live in fear.

“A person was taken, we don’t know where they are, is that the country we want to build?” another Democratic leader voiced.

Governor Ron DeSantis said ICE is simply doing the job it’s asked to do. He said its partnership in Florida is the largest joint immigration enforcement operation in ICE’s history.

In the wake of those operations, democratic speakers said they want Central Floridians to be informed, prepared, and knowledgeable about their rights, and that these implications will extend far beyond just immigrants.

“The price will be at the grocery store, when we need a roof fixed after a hurricane,” another Democratic leader said.

DeSantis said he is proud of ICE’s work and said the mission will continue in the state.

In addition to the Governor, Channel 9 has reached out to multiple Republican leaders and the Orange County GOP.

Republican Representative Byron Donalds responded, saying, “What Democrats are doing to obstruct, impede, and sabotage ICE is treasonous. The American people granted President Trump a mandate to deport illegal aliens and Make America Safe Again. As Governor, any Florida official who blocks these lawful actions will be removed from office.”

We also received a lengthy statement from the Orange County GOP:

It should be of serious concern to all residents of Orange County when any elected official or community leader takes actions or supports efforts that hinder law enforcement. Recent statements and actions by local Democratic leadership appear to align with advocating for individuals who break the law rather than supporting those who uphold it.

The Republican Party of Orange County stands firmly with our law enforcement professionals and with victims of crime. We support fair, respectful treatment of those who protect our communities and the vigorous prosecution of those who violate our laws.

Central Florida, including Orange County, experiences a disproportionately high volume of human trafficking activity. Far too often, victims — including women and children — are trafficked across state lines or international borders by heartless criminals, and it is law enforcement that leads the rescue and recovery efforts.

Federal, state, and local agencies — including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — play a critical role in identifying and dismantling trafficking networks. These operations also require the support of facilities, transportation, and safe housing to ensure that survivors receive the care and resources they need.

If local Democrat leaders were genuinely concerned about the well-being of our tourism and hospitality economy, they would stand with law enforcement and support efforts to protect vulnerable individuals and public safety.

Our Governor and President are charged with enforcing the law. Florida is a state where justice is not negotiable — Orange County should be committed to upholding the rule of law and delivering justice to those who deserve it.

Don’t Minneapolis our Orlando.

In a statement, a Trump administration spokesperson appeared to signal that targeting Maine was a political response to the ongoing feud between the president and the state’s governor, Democrat Janet Mills.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” said spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

But rumours have swirled that Maine was singled out for its significant Somali American population in the cities of Portland and Lewiston. Estimates put the total number of Somali Americans in the state at about 3,000.

Trump has repeatedly denounced the Somali community over the past several months, comparing its members to “garbage” at a December cabinet meeting. As recently as Tuesday, he used his White House podium to call Somalis and Somali Americans “ a lot of very low IQ people”.

Racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric has been a trademark of Trump’s campaigns for public office, and he has repeatedly singled out specific groups – including Haitians and Mexicans – to falsely tie their immigrant identity to pervasive criminal activity.

Parallels with Minnesota

Trump’s focus on the Somali community comes after a handful of members were implicated in a fraud scandal in Minnesota, a midwestern state where immigration enforcement operations were launched in December.

Those efforts have been marked by violent clashes between federal agents and protesters, and one woman, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was shot dead in her car after an interaction with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Fears that those tensions could spill into Maine dominated a Wednesday news conference with city officials in Portland.

Mayor Mark Dion told reporters that immigrant communities in the region felt “anxious and fearful” as ICE agents began their crackdown.

“They see this action as unpredictable and a threat to their families,” he explained.

He also questioned whether a heavy-handed operation was necessary to address immigration infractions in the area, and he called on ICE to adopt different tactics than it had in Minnesota.

“I want to underscore one important point: While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes,” Dion said.

“Federal immigration law is lawful. Its administration and enforcement is lawful,” he added. “What we’ve been concerned with, as a council, is the enforcement tactics that ICE has undertaken in other communities, which to our mind appear to threaten and intimidate populations.”

Nevertheless, Dion expressed optimism that ICE would adopt a more tailored approach to apprehending local suspects.

While the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, has seen nearly 2,000 immigration officers flood its streets, the mayor predicted that Maine would not see the same “massing of federal agents”.

“We’re seeing very individualised activity by ICE. A person here, a neighbourhood there,” he said. “Their conduct, at least as it is current in Maine, seems to be focused, which would indicate to me – and this is the speculation – that they’re functioning on the basis of an actual court warrant.”

That, he said, marked a departure from the “random, show-me-your-papers kind of experience” that residents had experienced in Minnesota.

Outrage at ICE operations

Still, while Dion advocated for a wait-and-see approach to the ICE operation, other city officials took a harder stance.

One Portland city councillor, Wesley Pelletier, described the unfolding raids as part of “an agenda of white nationalism and might makes right”.

“This is a war of terror that’s being waged on our city by the federal government,” Pelletier said. “We’ve seen people of all ages getting thrown on the ground and getting thrown into trucks.”

So far, Fox News quoted ICE Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde as saying the agency had made 50 arrests so far as part of operation “Catch of the Day”. Hyde added that ICE had identified nearly 1,400 individuals to detain in Maine.

Wednesday’s statement from the Department of Homeland Security highlighted four arrests as examples, showing people from Sudan, Guatemala, Ethiopia and Angola.

It described the four individuals as “the worst of the worst” and accused them of crimes ranging from aggravated assault to endangering the welfare of a child, though it was unclear in one case if the accusation had resulted in a conviction.

“We are no longer allowing criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,” McLaughlin said in the statement.

But Democratic officials in the state suggested that the Trump administration had refused to coordinate in the lead-up to “Catch of the Day”, heightening anxiety on the local level.

On January 14, nearly a week before the operation was launched, Governor Mills posted on social media that she had “attempted, unsuccessfully thus far, to confirm” the upcoming surge in federal immigration enforcement.

In a video statement, she said the state had reached out to local governments in Portland and Lewiston to prepare. She added that she too felt “angry” about the expected surge.

“Our goal, as always, will be to protect the safety and the rights of the people of Maine,” Mills said.

“To the federal government, I say this: If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused. Those tactics are not welcome here to the people of Maine.”

She also took a jab at the trend of federal agents using masks and other facial coverings to conceal their identities.

“Look, Maine knows what good law enforcement looks like because our law enforcement are held to high professional standards,” Mills said. “They are accountable to the law. And I’ll tell you this: They don’t wear a mask to shield their identities, and they don’t arrest people in order to fill a quota.”

A political rivalry

Mills and Trump have long been political adversaries, with their feud erupting in a public forum. In February last year, shortly after Trump returned to office for a second term, he hosted a White House gathering for governors, where he called out Mills personally.

“Is Maine here? The governor of Maine?” Trump said while outlining policies barring transgender athletes from sporting events. “Are you not going to comply with it?”

“I’m complying with state and federal law,” Mills responded. The tension escalated from there.

“You’d better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any, any federal funding,” Trump shot back.

“See you in court,” Mills replied.

“Good. I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a really easy one. And enjoy your life after, governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics,” he said.

The interaction made national news and cemented the frosty relationship between the two leaders, with Trump demanding an apology and slamming the Democratic governor for months afterwards.

His administration also took a series of escalating actions designed to target Mills, including launching an education probe in her state, suspending a marine research grant and freezing other federal funds to Maine.

In response to this week’s ICE deployment, Mills issued a short statement acknowledging the Trump administration’s latest efforts.

“Together, we will continue to place the safety and civil rights of Maine people above all else, and remain vigilant in our defense of due process and the rule of law,” she wrote.

Maine is set to hold its next gubernatorial race in 2026, as part of the year’s midterm election cycle.

Having served two terms as governor, Mills is not eligible for re-election and will instead be making a run for the US Senate, challenging Republican incumbent Susan Collins.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26021760239518-1769044359.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-22 00:36:52.131211

The Wednesday decision granted Homeland Security its request for an administrative stay of Friday’s preliminary injunction.

Homeland Security also argued that limiting federal officers’ ability to retaliate puts officers and the public in danger.","The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked an injunction Wednesday that prevented federal immigration officers from retaliating against demonstrators.

A Friday ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez had prevented the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from detaining or tear gassing people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest, including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of over 3,000 immigration officers and agents in the Twin Cities.

The Wednesday decision granted Homeland Security its request for an administrative stay of Friday’s preliminary injunction. Ten of the 11 judges in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted the stay, were appointed by Republican presidents, including four judges appointed by President Donald Trump.

The court decisions stem from a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU. The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year, either in cars or on foot, when they were threatened, pepper-sprayed or arrested by federal agents, according to the lawsuit.

The Trump administration argued in a motion filed on Tuesday that the lawsuit is based on five incidents in December that plaintiffs can “only speculate may recur,” and that plaintiffs can’t establish constitutional violations. Homeland Security said that the district court’s finding of a pattern of misconduct by ICE agents was “overblown.”

Federal immigration agents are facing backlash from local leaders, businesses and residents for their behavior as raids have ramped up in Minnesota.

The killing of 37-year-old Renee Good at the hands of federal agent Jonathan Ross has galvanized the opposition to the federal operation.

In the past few weeks, federal agents have shot a second person during an arrest; arrested U.S. citizens including a barely-clothed 56-year-old Hmong man who was misidentified by officers; and deployed tear gas and other chemical irritants against observers, protestors and bystanders, including at Roosevelt High School during dismissal hours after Good was killed.

Homeland Security also argued that limiting federal officers’ ability to retaliate puts officers and the public in danger. As an example, the government argued that tailing federal agents’ vehicles — an increasingly common tactic among community patrollers looking to disrupt ICE operations — is an “inherently dangerous activity.”

Menendez, in the preliminary injunction, had declared following ICE vehicles to be a legal and protected activity that does not justify a vehicle stop or arrest by agents.

The Reformer spoke to a protester, a U.S. citizen, who was detained for hours last week after following ICE vehicles and was never charged.

Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs of the December lawsuit, drove to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer.

The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_637-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:26.387556

For their part, Republicans on the committee were mostly quiet when it came to the T.S.A.’s collaboration with ICE.
They also asked Ms. McNeill about allegations that Somalis had smuggled cash through Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
Representative LaMonica McIver, Democrat of New Jersey, pressed Ms. McNeill whether the T.S.A.
had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents.","The acting director of the Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday defended her agency’s practice of sharing information about travelers suspected of having deportation orders with agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a House oversight hearing.

“It is not new policy to share information between the agencies of the Department of Homeland Security,” the acting T.S.A. director, Ha Nguyen McNeill, told lawmakers in a hearing before the Homeland Security Committee. She said her agents were “absolutely” allowing ICE agents access to passenger data to help with their deportation efforts.

The New York Times reported in December that the agency was collaborating with ICE to identify air travelers subject to deportation orders, allowing immigration agents to detain them at airports and quickly deport them.

The practice came under scrutiny after it led to the arrest of Any Lucía López Belloza, a college student detained by immigration authorities at Boston Logan International Airport on Nov. 20 as she prepared to fly home to Texas for Thanksgiving. She was deported to Honduras two days later, despite a court order preventing her removal. The Trump administration later acknowledged that it made a mistake by deporting her.

The Trump administration has deported hundreds of thousands of immigrants since President Trump returned to the White House a year ago, and the harsh methods of ICE agents carrying out the crackdown has incited protests across the nation.

The complaints about ICE tactics have intensified, especially from Democrats, after an immigration agent shot and killed an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in Minneapolis earlier this month. The Trump administration has defended the shooting, and conservatives, citing a video of the incident, have said the agent had reason to fear for his life. Democratic officials in Minnesota have used words like “propaganda” to describe the federal government’s account of the shooting.

During the hearing on Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration that the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, declined a request to testify and so was not there to face questioning.

“The urgency in this country right now is what’s going on with ICE,” said Representative Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York. “Why are we having a hearing with Department of Homeland Security officials who know nothing about ICE?”

With no ICE official to put on the stand, the Democrats peppered Ms. McNeill with questions about her agency’s involvement in immigration operations.

For their part, Republicans on the committee were mostly quiet when it came to the T.S.A.’s collaboration with ICE. “There’s been a lot of talk about ICE, and, unfortunately, really outside the scope of this hearing,” said Representative Andy Ogles, Republican of Tennessee. “And for that, to our witnesses, I apologize.”

Republican committee members praised T.S.A. workers who worked without pay during last year’s government shutdown and challenged how airport security is currently funded in the United States.

They also asked Ms. McNeill about allegations that Somalis had smuggled cash through Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

Representative LaMonica McIver, Democrat of New Jersey, pressed Ms. McNeill whether the T.S.A. had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents. Ms. McNeill could not cite a specific statute or policy granting her the authority.

“We are absolutely within our authorities to share information within the Department of Homeland Security to further the national security mission,” she said, before promising to get back to Ms. McIver. “I can get you the exact policy,” she said.

Representative Tim Kennedy, Democrat of New York, asked how many T.S.A. employees had been reassigned to immigration enforcement, but Ms. McNeill initially deflected the question.

When Mr. Kennedy pressed Ms. McNeill about news reports that air marshals from her agency were reassigned to deportation flights from commercial flights, Ms. McNeill said that providing flight security for deportation flights “was not a reassignment” and that it fell “within their mission.”

She rejected the notion that reassigning air marshals to deportation flights from commercial flights might mean a greater risk for ordinary passengers flying in the United States, saying that “providing in-flight security for deportation flights keeps our sky safe.”

The Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, undermining a wide range of law enforcement operations in response to mounting pressure from Mr. Trump.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21trump-news-tsa-ice-lbth/21trump-news-tsa-ice-lbth-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:36:40.934522

But without question, ICE abolition advocates have a lot of momentum among congressional Democrats and ICE resisters nationally (including, notably, Mayor Zohran Mamdani).

While “Abolish ICE” may be the only position emotionally consonant with justified outrage over its agents’ conduct, it’s not necessary at all if the goal is simply to radically change the immigration-enforcement status quo.
The national debate over lax immigration enforcement then played an unquestionably major role in Trump’s return to power in 2024.","For two overriding reasons, Democrats are intensively debating what to say and do about the future of ICE. First and most obviously, that agency is running wild in Minneapolis and other cities, pursuing a very deliberate policy of terrorizing immigrant communities and their allies in order to (a) encourage “self-deportation” and (b) titillate Donald Trump’s MAGA base. ICE has become the tip of a spear that seems aimed not only at mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, but at the military occupation of politically hostile territory by an increasingly authoritarian administration.

Second, an appropriations package that includes money for ICE (along with the rest of DHS, plus multiple other federal agencies) has become the flash point in another potential (if partial) government-shutdown cliff on January 30, which is when the stopgap-spending bill that ended last year’s total government shutdown expires. Many Democrats within and beyond Congress want to dramatize their opposition to what ICE is doing by voting against the new money, even though (as other Democrats argue) it won’t stop ICE for a moment thanks to the special slush fund for mass deportation created by last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

While nearly all Democrats oppose both current ICE tactics and Trump’s entire mass-deportation regime, the funding fight has exposed an increasingly large gulf between those who advocate abolishing ICE and those who seek to reform the agency. The latter camp isn’t necessarily a solid bloc; there’s language in the above-mentioned spending bill that authorizes body cameras and other measures for ICE accountability that some reformers consider inadequate. But without question, ICE abolition advocates have a lot of momentum among congressional Democrats and ICE resisters nationally (including, notably, Mayor Zohran Mamdani). One very recent poll from Economist-YouGov showed self-identified Democrats favoring the abolition of ICE by a margin of 77 percent to 19 percent (Americans generally were split right down the middle on the proposition). So is this the line in the sand the party generally should draw? Has Trump’s toxic immigration crackdown now made ICE abolition a mainstream position with little political downside?

While “Abolish ICE” may be the only position emotionally consonant with justified outrage over its agents’ conduct, it’s not necessary at all if the goal is simply to radically change the immigration-enforcement status quo. ICE has been around since 2003. Its agents weren’t masked until March 2025. ICE (along with the allied Border Patrol and Homeland Security Investigations agencies) wasn’t deployed to achieve mass deportation until a Trump executive order one year ago yesterday. The administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden didn’t publicly defend brutal tactics or accuse immigration-enforcement protesters of being “terrorists.” Columnist Will Bunch recently spoke out in opposition to Democratic efforts to reform ICE on grounds that “You can’t reform fascism.” Were the Obama and Biden administrations “fascist”?

More than a few progressives (and particularly advocates for undocumented immigrants) did indeed believe that enforcement of immigration laws generally, and deportation practices specifically, were too harsh during past Democratic administrations. In 2020, famously, most Democratic presidential candidates called for the decriminalization (or, in some cases, abolition of felony charges for immigration violations) of illegal border crossings. The national debate over lax immigration enforcement then played an unquestionably major role in Trump’s return to power in 2024. And as recently as September, a Washington Post–Ipsos survey showed only 29 percent of Americans trusted Democrats more than Republicans on immigration policy.

So despite widespread and steadily increasing public disapproval of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, Democrats aren’t on such solid ground that they can embrace some total abandonment of immigration enforcement without courting political peril. There’s no evidence that Americans actually want the “open borders” stance that Republicans have falsely accused Democrats of embracing in the past. Embracing it now makes little sense. The broadest and strongest position for Democrats right now is the abolition of both mass deportation and ICE terror tactics, alongside a new path to citizenship for noncriminal immigrants and fairer and more uniform enforcement of immigration laws without the sort of violence and cruelty perpetrated and celebrated by Trump, J.D. Vance, Kristi Noem, and Stephen Miller. Anyone who thinks such a position represents a surrender to MAGA needs to remember how and why these terrible people rose to power in the first place.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1fc/007/6707938cb73235ced6b571189472b9d18f-abolish-ice.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:31.449110

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is aiming the push at Somali immigrants living in the north-eastern state, according to reporting by the New York Times.

The initiative officially began on Tuesday. In comments provided to the Guardian, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent agency of ICE, said: “Some of the arrests of the worst of the worst from the first day of operations include criminal illegal aliens convicted of horrific crimes including aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child.” The government provided criminal histories related to four arrestees out of approximately 50 ICE said had been arrested so far, with no details on the backgrounds of the others.

The move follows similar efforts occurring in Minneapolis over recent weeks that have sparked demonstrations and prompted criticism of forceful methods used by ICE and border patrol officers, both on people pursued for deportation and on protesters and activists who warn communities when immigration enforcement activity is spotted nearby.

Thousands of enforcement officers have been mobilized to Minnesota. ICE has faced a storm of criticism, including from local officials, after the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month by an ICE officer, followed by the FBI excluding local prosecutors from the official investigation into the tragedy. The large Somali American community in Minnesota has been a particular and repeated target for Donald Trump.

Patricia Hyde, deputy assistant director of ICE, told Fox News on Tuesday that close to 50 people have been detained so far in Maine as part of what she described as an immigration enforcement surge.

Hyde also said ICE has compiled a list of 1,400 individuals in Maine it intends to target. ICE officers shown in TV footage on Fox News making arrests so far were masked and all had their faces blurred, while the faces of those being apprehended were not.

Many asylum seekers from a number of African nations who have entered the US have made Maine their home, adding to the Somali community that began forming there in the early 2000s when refugees settled in Lewiston. Maine is still largely white and has one of the oldest populations nationwide.

Meanwhile, many businesses have increasingly turned to immigrant workers to address labor shortages, as many native-born workers have retired or left the labor force.

The US attorney’s office in Maine had hinted at the coming operation in a statement issued Monday urging the public to demonstrate peacefully.

“In the coming days, if Maine citizens seek to exercise their rights to assemble and protest, it is vital that these protests remain peaceful,” said Andrew Benson, the US attorney in the state. “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

On Tuesday, the mayor of Lewiston, Carl Sheline, said in a statement that ICE agents had increased their presence in the state’s second-largest city. He urged calm and encouraged residents to “check in on one another”.

Last week, the Trump administration said it would end temporary protected status (TPS) for Somalis living in the US, giving hundreds of people two months to depart or face removal.

The administration had first signaled plans to revoke protections for Somali nationals in November, when Trump posted on his Truth Social account about Minnesota, which has a large Somali population, writing: “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing.

It dates back to 1970 and 1976 court orders that required the district to desegregate its schools.

The group said the policy amounts to racial discrimination and violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.

The lawsuit calls for a permanent injunction to prevent the school district from using race preferences in “operating, funding, advertising, or admitting students into school programs.”

A district spokesperson said they were unable to comment on the specifics of pending litigation.

“Los Angeles Unified remains firmly committed to ensuring all students have meaningful access to services and enriching educational opportunities,” the district said in a statement.

More than 600 schools in the district are classified as predominantly Hispanic, Black, Asian or other non-white, while less than 100 are not, the lawsuit said.

Students that attend a school under this designation receive extra points when applying to magnet schools, and they are required to have at least two parent-teacher conferences per year, according to the district's Student Integration Services website. These schools are also required to have student-teacher ratios of 25 to 1 or less, compared to other schools that are allowed to have classroom ratios of as high as 34 to 1, according to the lawsuit.

The 1776 Project Foundation's mission is to “create and disseminate policies that will promote academic achievement and revitalize our educational system for families and students across the nation,” according to its website. It does so primarily by putting money behind local school board candidates, pushing back against “progressive pedagogy” and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, its website said.

The group's members include a parent whose children are enrolled in a Los Angeles school that is not classified as predominantly Hispanic, Black, Asian or other non-white, according to the lawsuit. Because of the district's policy, those children were denied certain benefits such as admission to a magnet program, the lawsuit alleges.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement deputy assistant director Patricia Hyde told Fox News Tuesday that the agency has arrested nearly 50 people in Maine as part of an immigration enforcement surge.

Her remarks offered the first confirmation from the agency that it is intensifying operations in the state.

In a written statement Wednesday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed that an immigration enforcement effort dubbed ""Operation Catch of the Day"" was underway in Maine, but did not provide specific numbers on how many people had been arrested and how many agents are involved.

The numbers cited by Fox would represent a major escalation. For comparison, last year ICE arrested an average of 24 people per month, according to the Deportation Data Project.

Hyde told Fox News her agency has a target list of 1,400 people in Maine. That would represent about 10% of all immigrants without permanent legal status in the state, according to figures from the Migration Policy Institute.

A growing number of videos purporting to show arrests have cropped up in the last two days, mostly in Lewiston and Greater Portland.

Local officials in both cities say they are not receiving communication from ICE or other federal agencies.

At a press conference Wednesday, Portland officials pushed back ICE's tactics.

Mayor Mark Dion said ICE's use of force in other cities around the country has put Portland on edge.

""While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes,"" he said.

City councilor Wes Pelletier rejected the need for an operation at all.

""No one asked the federal government to come here. This is one of the safest cities in the country,"" he said.

Other councilors say residents are forming support networks to deliver food and other basic needs to immigrant families too afraid to leave home.

Amid widespread fear of immigration enforcement, Portland Public Schools superintendent Ryan Scallon says attendance is down 15-20% at certain schools.

""ICE's terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare,"" Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said in a statement. ""These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long term damage to our state and to our country. Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.""

On Wednesday afternoon, ICE issued a press release saying it was targeting ""the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.""

It identified four detainees:

Dominic Ali, a Sudanese man convicted of false imprisonment, aggravated assault, assault, obstructing justice, and violation of a protective order.

Ambessa Berhe, an Ethiopian woman convicted of aggravated assault and cocaine possession.

Elmara Correia, an Angolan woman who had previously been arrested for endangering the welfare of a child.

Dany Lopez-Cortez, a Guatemalan man convicted of operating under the influence of alcohol.

""Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the release. “We have launched Operation Catch of the Day to target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in the state. On the first day of operations, we arrested illegal aliens convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, we are no longer allowing criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens.”

“All this litigation that … we’re hearing about here before the federal courts in Minnesota is about the power of the immigration judge to set a bond.
He said it’s becoming a struggle to get a federal judge to agree on a bond hearing.
He said the immigration process can be hard for families to navigate.
“What people think they understand about bonds from watching TV or the criminal justice system is so different than immigration,” Wilson said.","Demonstrators outside the Whipple Building say they are seeing unpredictable releases of immigration detainees as an attorney warns that the federal bond system has not recovered from last summer’s policy changes and ongoing litigation.

Protests at the federal building have continued for two weeks following the death of Renee Good, who was shot by an ICE agent. People gathering outside said they have watched detainees walk out of the facility or get dropped off at random locations across the Twin Cities in below-zero temperatures and without basic necessities.

Legal observer Rachel Gerdes said she saw several young people released Tuesday evening.

“Yesterday, I was here around like 5 p.m., they were just dropping kids that had been detained out in front of the Whipple Building here and leaving them to fend for themselves,” said Gerdes. “They didn’t even have winter coats. Some of them I don’t even know if they had their phone.”

Gerdes said she helped a 19-year-old woman who had no way to get home. “She ended up saying she needed a ride, cause she had to get home. My friend and I drove her home.”

Gerdes said she later helped the woman’s 17-year-old brother, who was released sometime later.

Immigration attorney David Wilson said these kinds of releases have become more common.

“What used to be kind of an orderly process for letting someone out of custody has turned into a little bit of a chaos process, a chaotic process where we’re trying to find people way late into the night and they get released without much warning at this point,” he said.

He said the process is even more complicated if a detained immigrant is transferred to an out-of-state facility.

“When people are taken out of state for their custody or detention, it’s not just that they get separated from their families. It’s really a challenge to get people back to Minnesota, in a orderly fashion, and because when they’re picked up, they may not have been wearing a winter jacket and ready for that trip,” Wilson said.

In July 2025, a Trump administration policy sought to eliminate bond for most undocumented immigrants. Federal courts blocked the policy, but Wilson and other advocates believe the system has not returned to normal.

“All this litigation that … we’re hearing about here before the federal courts in Minnesota is about the power of the immigration judge to set a bond. We’re just fighting for the opportunity to be heard,” he said.

He said it’s becoming a struggle to get a federal judge to agree on a bond hearing.

“You know you go to criminal court; you’re expecting you’re going to be able to pay a bond and be heard, not in immigration, not today. You have people have to fight for that opportunity.”

He said the immigration enforcement surge is also making it harder for judges to respond to requests.

“Right now, it’s taking about seven to 10 days to get a bond hearing, and so a person sits in custody for that long,” Wilson said.

He said in 2024, a bond hearing could be set within two to three days of detainment.

Bond amounts vary widely, but Wilson said they typically range from $1,500 to $7,000 and must be paid in full.

He said the process determines whether someone goes home or remains in custody. Some families and organizations raise funds to help immigrants.

“Often, bond is everything. It is definitely like a coliseum-type argument where all the arguments come out on the table at once,” Wilson said

Wilson said bond is only one part of the deportation process and determines whether someone fights their case from home or from detention. He said frequent transfers between facilities are also causing delays, with some detainees missing scheduled bond hearings because they are moved before a judge can review their case. He said people who are detained a second time may be required to pay a new bond, and the amount does not carry over from a previous case.

He said the immigration process can be hard for families to navigate.

“What people think they understand about bonds from watching TV or the criminal justice system is so different than immigration,” Wilson said. “The rules keep changing and becoming more difficult to comply with,” Wilson said. “Families are waiting and hoping, but the process is moving slower than ever.”

Wilson said eligibility for bond depends on a judge’s assessment of flight risk and danger, and certain criminal offenses, including some minor ones, can make a person ineligible. If someone wins their deportation case, the bond is refunded.

Wilson said if a person did not comply with the requirements of their case or lost their proceedings, the bond could be kept by the government.

The memo authorizes ICE officers to use force to enter a residence based solely on a more narrow administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal, a move that advocates say collides with Fourth Amendment protections and upends years of advice given to immigrant communities.

The shift comes as the Trump administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide, deploying thousands of officers under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

For years, immigrant advocates, legal aid groups and local governments have urged people not to open their doors to immigration agents unless they are shown a warrant signed by a judge. That guidance is rooted in Supreme Court rulings that generally prohibit law enforcement from entering a home without judicial approval. The ICE directive directly undercuts that advice at a time when arrests are accelerating under the administration’s immigration crackdown.

The memo itself has not been widely shared within the agency, according to a whistleblower complaint, but its contents have been used to train new ICE officers who are being deployed into cities and towns to implement the president’s immigration crackdown. New ICE hires and those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo, according to the whistleblower disclosure.

It is unclear how broadly the directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. The Associated Press witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of the home of a Liberian man, Garrison Gibson, with a deportation order from 2023 in Minneapolis on Jan. 11, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Documents reviewed by The AP revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge who authorized the raid on private property.

The change is almost certain to meet legal challenges and stiff criticism from advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments that have spent years successfully urging people not to open their doors unless ICE shows them a warrant signed by a judge.

The Associated Press obtained the memo and whistleblower complaint from an official in Congress, who shared it on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive documents. The AP verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.

The memo, signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and dated May 12, 2025, says: “Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

The memo does not detail how that determination was made nor what its legal repercussions might be.

Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an e-mailed statement to the AP that everyone the department serves with an administrative warrant has already had “full due process and a final order of removal.”

She said the officers issuing those warrants have also found probable cause for the person’s arrest. She said the Supreme Court and Congress have “recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,” without elaborating. McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether ICE officers entered a person’s home since the memo was issued, relying solely on an administrative warrant and if so, how often.

Recent arrests shine a light on tactics

Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit legal organization that assists workers exposing wrongdoings, said in the whistleblower complaint obtained by The Associated Press that it represents two anonymous U.S. government officials “disclosing a secretive — and seemingly unconstitutional — policy directive.”

A wave of recent high-profile arrests, many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video, has placed a spotlight on immigration arrest tactics, including officers’ use of proper warrants.

Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by judges carry that authority.

All law enforcement operations — including those conducted by ICE and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures.

People can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant, with some limited exceptions.

Memo shown to ‘select’ officials

The memo says ICE officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using just a signed administrative warrant known as an I-205 if they have a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals or a district judge or magistrate judge.

The memo says officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they’re at the residence. They’re limited in the hours they can go into the home — after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn’t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

“Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien’s residence, following proper notification of the officer or agent’s authority and intent to enter,” the memo reads.

The memo is addressed to all ICE personnel. But it has been shown only to “select DHS officials” who then shared it with some employees who were told to read it and return it, Whistleblower Aid wrote in the disclosure.

One of the two whistleblowers was allowed to view the memo only in the presence of a supervisor and then had to give it back. That person was not allowed to take notes. A whistleblower was able to access the document and lawfully disclose it to Congress, Whistleblower Aid said.

Although the memo was issued in May, David Kligerman, senior vice president and special counsel at Whistleblower Aid, said it took time for its clients to find a “safe and legal path to disclose it to lawmakers and the American people.”

Memo says ICE officers are told to rely solely on administrative warrants

ICE has been rapidly hiring thousands of new deportation officers to carry out the president’s mass deportation agenda. They’re trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia.

During a visit there by The Associated Press in August, ICE officials said repeatedly that new officers were being trained to follow the Fourth Amendment.

But according to the whistleblowers’ account, newly hired ICE officers are being told they can rely solely on administrative warrants to enter homes to make arrests, even though that conflicts with written Homeland Security training materials.

Lindsay Nash, a law professor at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law in New York, said the memo “flies in the face” of what the Fourth Amendment protects against and what ICE itself has historically said are its authorities.

She said there’s an “enormous potential for overreach, for mistakes and we’ve seen that those can happen with very, very serious consequences.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/53e35be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+156/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F43%2Fe8%2Fbcd3b6f0df8b64cb7e8391258e4c%2Fecd7e2093e1048f484d277a5a60cf423,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:40.428165

Leaders in the state’s largest and most-diverse cities, Portland and Lewiston, continued to criticize the operation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as “terror and intimidation tactics” that threaten families. Many in those communities and elsewhere have documented with photos and videos the arrests and actions by ICE, often by masked agents.

Fox News reported that ICE had identified about 1,400 targets in Maine, and had made 50 arrests as of early Wednesday morning. The Department of Homeland Security later said in a statement the effort is targeting the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” citing people accused of committing crimes ranging from aggravated assault to operating under the influence of alcohol.

The department went on to criticize Gov. Janet Mills and “her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine” for standing in the way of their operations.

Mills, in a statement late Wednesday, didn’t back down.

“If the federal government has warrants, then it should show them,” she said. “But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors — none of which is welcome.”

Indeed, some residents have reported the detention of family members that have no criminal records.

A Westbrook mother said her 18-year-old son Jean-Pierre Obiang, an accounting student at the University of Southern Maine, was detained by ICE after a minor traffic incident outside the Westbrook Market Basket. Obiang and his mom, Sandrine Koumba, are asylum seekers from the central African county of Gabon, and have lived in Maine for three years. A background check of Obiang through the Maine State Bureau of Identification verified that he does not have a criminal record.

“You flee somewhere because you are being persecuted, and you arrive in a place where you say ‘Oh thank you God, I have arrived here; I am protected,'” Koumba said. “Then you realize that, actually, we are not safe.”

A Portland mom of four from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who also had no criminal record and a pending asylum application, was detained after agents followed her home from dropping one of her children off at Portland High School, the Maine Monitor reported.

A migrant worker in Lewiston who saw ICE agents approaching doors in their neighborhood said fears were high, with many neighbors staying home, locking their doors and ignoring knocks. In Portland’s Parkside neighborhood, residents blew whistles, honked car horns and called the statewide ICE activity hotline when six agents knocked on the door of a residential building, but did not detain anyone.

CITIES, SCHOOLS REACT

“They see this action as unpredictable and a threat to their families,” Dion said.

“Imagine you are a parent and you step out to put your kid on a school bus, and by the time you turn around you’re surrounded by ICE agents,” added Councilor Pious Ali. “Who is going to take care of that child?”

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said the agency’s presence in Maine amounted to “terror and intimidation tactics.”

“These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long-term damage to our state and to our country,” he said in a statement. “Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.”

Westbrook Mayor David Morse, whose city also has a large number of immigrants, denounced the agency for an incident where he said an agent targeted a U.S. citizen who was peacefully observing an enforcement action, describing it as “outrageous behavior.”

Portland’s school district also announced that it will temporarily suspend off-campus lunches for high schoolers to minimize, “the chance of students being potentially caught up in enforcement actions,” and reported a decrease in student attendance Tuesday, while South Portland’s school board canceled a public forum Thursday because too many families were scared to attend, the board chair said.

Maine’s federal delegation had mixed reactions to “Operation Catch of the Day.”

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, criticized federal agencies for not sharing any details with members of Congress, while Rep. Jared Golden, D-2nd District, said he supports ICE’s actions as long as the detention efforts focus on people “engaged in criminal activities.”

Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, said individuals in the country legally should not be detained, but also expressed support for some arrests.

“There are people in Maine and elsewhere who have entered this country illegally and who have engaged in criminal activity,” Collins said. “They could be subject to arrest and deportation pursuant to the laws of the United States, and people who are exercising the right to peacefully gather and protest their government should be careful not to interfere with law enforcement efforts while doing so.”

Federal officials have not said how long the operation in Maine will last.

Lawmakers at a legislative hearing sought more details from State Police about the cost of training officers to participate in the program, with one lawmaker saying she hoped there were no barriers preventing more departments from participating.

“We should be acting as aggressively as we possibly can to make sure everybody’s trained, everybody’s participating, everybody’s on the same page to execute the president’s agenda,” said Republican Sen. Missy Irvin, who co-chairs the legislative subcommittee overseeing State Police.

The program is a “force multiplier” that allows state and local agencies to enforce limited immigration authority during routine duties, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement site.

Through the agreement, state police can contact ICE if it believes a person it comes into contact with during traffic stops, pursuits, investigations or other routine enforcement activity may be in the country illegally. ICE can then put an immigration detainer on that person.

Arkansas State Police entered into the agreement after a state law passed during last year’s legislative session required state police, the Department of Corrections and county sheriffs to do so.

Arkansas National Guard requests immigration enforcement authority

President Donald Trump has made deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally one of the cornerstones of his second term. His administration has sent thousands of immigration enforcement agents into major Democrat-run cities with a stated goal of arresting and deporting immigrants with criminal convictions.

However, those without criminal histories and U.S. citizens have found themselves caught up in the crackdown as well. Most recently, the shooting death of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE agent sparked nationwide protests.

Neighboring Tennessee is moving to do more in the immigration crackdown as well. Republican lawmakers there recently unveiled plans for bills that would require public institutions such as public schools, vehicle registration offices and city governments to track and report immigration status.

Arkansas State Police Director Col. Mike Hagar told legislators that since the 287(g) agreement was signed, all but a handful of state police troopers have completed the required 60-hour training.

Sen. Joshua Bryant, a Republican from Rogers, said that with the fiscal session approaching, he wanted to know if expenses related to the programs were being tracked for state police and the county jails that hold immigrants for Immigration and Customs Enforcement .

Hagar said he believed county jails were being reimbursed, but was unaware of how much they were being reimbursed. Troopers did the 60-hour training in between regular calls for service during their shifts, he said. ASP spokesperson Cindy Murphy said in an email that the 287(g) training was added to troopers’ regular training requirements, so they were not seeking reimbursement from the federal government for those costs.

“It’s not had an impact on our agency as far as operations are concerned,” Hagar told lawmakers.

Hagar said federal immigration resources in Arkansas were “very minimal,” and that most of those resources were taken up by picking up immigrants in local jails to take them to federal immigration detention.

Sen. Terry Rice, a Republican from Waldron, said that while he supported efforts to deport immigrants who have committed crimes, he was also concerned about the potential for state police to assist federal immigration authorities in detaining immigrants without criminal histories.

“Is there anything outside of your daily work that y’all are doing currently in coordination with federal agencies, Homeland Security, ICE, as far as going out and just seeking anything more than people with criminal charges?” he asked.

The agency was not participating in any operations like the one Rice described, Hagar said.

He said troopers have been told there is a difference between an immigrant who was brought here as a child and who doesn’t have a criminal history, and an immigrant who is arrested for a crime.

6:20 p.m.: ICE agents detain 18-year-old USM student after minor car accident

ICE agents detained a 18-year-old student at the University of Southern Maine after a minor car crash Tuesday morning.

Jean-Pierre Obiang was on his way to USM, where he is studying accounting, when he called his mother, Sandrine Koumba, from the Westbrook Market Basket asking for proof of their car insurance, Koumba said in an interview Wednesday. The call was cut off after 36 seconds. Koumba was able to speak briefly with her son after multiple attempts to call him back, and he told her he was being detained by ICE agents.

Tiara Sandborn, the wife of the driver of the other car involved in the crash, said Obiang and her husband, Shawn Chastain, exchanged contact information and were about to drive away when three ICE officers showed up, saying they ran Obiang’s license plates and he was a person of interest, Sandborn said. Chastain tried to tell the agents that Obiang hadn’t done anything wrong, but they pushed him into his car.

Koumba said the car was registered in her name, not her son’s, and that he has no criminal history. A criminal background check on Obiang in Maine was not immediately returned Wednesday night.

“He had a license. He’s enrolled in school here. He was not engaged in any type of criminal behavior,” Sandborn said. “He had a minor accident that occurred that subjected him to be vulnerable and then basically kidnapped off the streets.”

Koumba and her family are asylum-seekers from Gabon, a nation on the West African coast that sits right on the equator. They have been living in Westbrook for three years.

Obiang was allowed one phone call and told his mother he had been moved to Burlington, Massachusetts. He was told he’d be moved to another facility the next day, but did not know where.

6 p.m. Gov. Janet Mills says state is monitoring ICE activity, committed to civil rights

Gov. Janet Mills responded to ICE operations in Maine Wednesday, saying her administration is committed to ensuring the safety and civil rights of Maine people are protected.

She said the state is working with municipal officials and organizations to monitor ICE activity.

“If the federal government has warrants, then it should show them,” Mills said in a written statement. “But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors – none of which is welcome.”

5:50 p.m.: Lewiston mayor says ICE tactics causing damage to the state

In a statement Wednesday, Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline decried ICE’s enforcement efforts in Maine, which began ramping up Tuesday.

“ICE’s terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare,” the statement said.

“These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long term damage to our state and to our country. Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.”

5:45 p.m.: Maine woman interfered with local law enforcement assuming they were ICE, police say

A Maine woman interfered with Brewer Police activity, thinking they were U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, police say.

Mary Conmee, 63, of Orrington, has been served a court summons for disorderly conduct and obstructing government administration, the Brewer Police Department said in a social media post on Wednesday.

Officers were investigating a threat against Brewer schools Wednesday morning and staged near a Brewer residence to attempt to contact a person of interest. During the operation, Conmee “deliberately drove to the scene and interfered with police activity by repeatedly sounding an air horn, refusing lawful orders to leave, and yelling at expletives at officers,” the post stated.

“The woman stated that she ‘didn’t want ICE’ in her neighborhood,” the department’s notice said. “Her actions interfered with legitimate law enforcement operations and created a real risk to the investigating officers.”

Police later determined the person of interest was not involved in the school threat, the department said. The threat stemmed from similar “swatting” incidents at other Maine schools on Wednesday, police say, and there was no credible threat to Brewer schools.

5:30 p.m.: Maine State Police won’t work with feds on immigration enforcement

Maine State Police are already following the policies outlined in a new law limiting the ability of local law enforcement to collaborate with federal immigration authorities — even though the law is not scheduled to take effect until this summer.

Gov. Janet Mills announced last month she would allow LD 1971, one of the most controversial bills of last year’s legislative session, to become law without her signature. The measure will prohibit state, county and local law enforcement officers from investigating, detaining, arresting or searching a person solely for immigration enforcement purposes.

LD 1971 is not scheduled to take effect until 90 days after the current legislative session ends, meaning its effective date is expected to come in mid-July. However, Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck has already issued a directive to his agency implementing the underlying policies of the law, a spokesperson for the department said Wednesday.

“Directives are a regular part of the first responder world, and this one was made internally by the Commissioner and was not prompted by any specific event or federal activity,” spokesperson Shannon Moss said in an email.

Officers will still be able to work with federal agents on criminal investigations and task forces, so long as the primary purpose is not immigration enforcement.

However, the law would not allow local officers to be placed under the supervision of federal authorities for the purpose of working on immigration enforcement, or allow police to use federal immigration officers as interpreters. Local police also won’t be allowed to transfer a person to immigration authorities without a court order or criminal warrant.

5:20 p.m.: Portland officials decry ICE tactics as enforcement effort enters second day

City officials in Maine’s largest city questioned the need for increased immigration enforcement during a Wednesday press conference as they attempted to reassure a fearful public.

Mayor Mark Dion and members of the City Council said they continue to hear from frightened and traumatized community members as reports of people being detained in public places mounted this week in Portland and neighboring cities.

“They see this action as unpredictable and a threat to their families,” Dion said about constituents and members of the immigrant community in Portland.

He said officials are doing everything they can to direct resources to the affected communities, along with reiterating their rights and responsibilities if approached by federal immigration officers.

Several officials urged residents to observe and record enforcement actions without interfering.

“The best thing you can do is be the best possible witness,” Dion said, reiterating his statement last week challenging “the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes.”

4:40 p.m.: Susan Collins issues statement on increased ICE arrests in Maine

U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the lone Republican in Maine’s delegation, issued a statement Wednesday afternoon on the initial set of ICE arrests in the state.

“Immigrants have long been an important part of our state and they continue to make valuable contributions to our communities. People who are in this country legally should not be targets of ICE investigations. They should be able to continue to go to work, school, and other public places and carry on with their normal lives. If for some reason an individual who is here legally is improperly detained, they should seek assistance through advocacy networks and the legal system,” she said in the statement.

“There are people in Maine and elsewhere who have entered this country illegally and who have engaged in criminal activity. They could be subject to arrest and deportation pursuant to the laws of the United States, and people who are exercising the right to peacefully gather and protest their government should be careful not to interfere with law enforcement efforts while doing so.

“I have advocated for providing body cameras and de-escalation training for ICE personnel. At this time of heightened tensions, these steps could help improve trust, accountability, and safety. Our proposed funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security includes $20 million for body cameras and $2 million for de-escalation training, which could help protect both ICE agents and the general public. I hope that Congress will adopt these measures quickly.”

Last week, Collins said she supported the deportation of criminals but did not “see the rationale for a large number of ICE agents to come” to Maine.

4:35 p.m.: Court orders ICE to give reason for detaining Portland asylum seeker

A Portland resident from Angola who has filed for asylum is asking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to explain why he was detained during a routine check-in Tuesday at the field office in Scarborough.

Advertisement

A federal judge on Wednesday ordered ICE to provide a cause for the detainment of Yanick Joao Carneiro by noon the following day, court records show.

The decision from U.S. District Judge Stacey Neumann came a day after Carneiro and his attorney filed a petition for a judge to consider whether he is being jailed unlawfully. Neumann also temporarily ordered that Carneiro not be transferred out of Maine “to provide the Court with a fair opportunity to review the merits of the petition and rule on any contested issues of jurisdiction.”

According to the petition, Carneiro entered the country from Angola in April 2023 and is not a U.S. citizen. The Department of Homeland Security then detained him according to the petition, but he was subsequently released. Carneiro applied for asylum, according to the order, and has a hearing on the matter scheduled for November 2027 in Massachusetts.

2:55 p.m.: Jared Golden says ICE enforcement is legitimate, as long as it targets criminal activity

U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, said Wednesday he supports Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that ramped up in his hometown of Lewiston and in the Portland area this week as long as the detention efforts focus on people “engaged in criminal activities.”

Golden issued a brief statement Wednesday afternoon after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed ICE agents are focusing on Maine under “Operation Catch of the Day,” which launched Tuesday.

“So long as this remains a targeted law enforcement operation focused on individuals who have engaged in criminal activities, then I believe it legitimately serves the public interest,” Golden said in a statement.

2:50 p.m.: Owner of East Ender restaurant says he’s trying to make staff feel safe

Karl Deuben, who owns East Ender on Middle Street in Portland, said he has sent a message to his staff about ICE’s presence in Maine, posted signs delineating the restaurant’s public and private spaces, reposted information from the ACLU, clarified the definition of a warrant, and reminded staff to call him immediately if ICE officers enter the building.

“The most important thing I mentioned to our staff is that interacting with ICE outside the business is different than inside the business,” he said. “They do have a legal right to be on premise and so we need to remember that.”

“The last thing I want is for there to be a specific type of adversarial energy that causes our staff or the public to be in any type of unforeseen danger,” Deuben said. “The goal is to de-escalate as opposed to escalate.”

Deuben compared the current situation to COVID, when he strove to give his staff accurate information.

Of a potential visit from ICE agents, he said, “my goal is if they come in, they’re in and they’re out. “

1:55 p.m.: Attendance down in Portland schools as ICE enforcement ramps up

Attendance was down in Portland Public Schools Tuesday as immigration enforcement activities increased in the city and across the state this week.

The district’s overall attendance rate was down to 84.4% on Jan. 20, compared to 89.4% last Friday, a district spokesperson said, although she noted that the reasons for absences are not always clear from the data.

Portland is home to the state’s largest and most diverse school district, where nearly 30% of students are English language learners. The district already saw impacts on attendance early last week, when rumors of ICE’s arrival in Maine began to circulate.

1:50 p.m.: Homeland Security says heightened enforcement targeting ‘criminal illegal aliens’

Officials from the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently enacted “Operation Catch of the Day,” a heightened immigration enforcement effort across Maine.

The federal agency said the operation is “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” according to an emailed statement from the Department of Homeland Security.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Federal officials would not immediately confirm how many people had been arrested by ICE agents so far, though they highlighted four people arrested in Maine Tuesday who are also accused of crimes such as aggravated assault and false imprisonment.

Fox News, during an interview with Department of Homeland Security Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde, said nearly 50 people had been arrested in Maine as part of ICE enforcement efforts.

1:35 p.m.: Portland schools pause off-campus lunches for students

Portland Public Schools is pausing its off-campus lunch option starting Wednesday to minimize “the chance of students being potentially caught up in enforcement actions as they move around the city on their own to buy lunch,” the superintendent said in a Tuesday letter.

All of the district’s high schools will switch from an “open campus” lunch, allowing students to buy lunch off-campus, to a “closed campus,” beginning Jan. 21 and continuing indefinitely, Superintendent Ryan Scallon announced. The schools will stock extra school lunches, but also encourage students to pack their own.

He said for the time being, off-site educational programming, field trips, recess and extracurricular activities will continue as usual.

“We continue to expect that our schools will not be the focus of immigration enforcement, but if there is action that impacts a school, we will communicate with families and staff as soon as possible,” Scallon wrote.

ICE arrests ramped up in Maine’s largest city Wednesday; a mother of four was detained Wednesday morning after dropping one of her children off at Portland High School, the Maine Monitor reported.

1:30 p.m.: Pingree says federal agencies directed not to speak to members of Congress

Gabrielle Mannino, spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, said federal agencies have been under a directive not to speak to congressional offices since President Trump took office.

“Since early December, the USCIS asylum office with jurisdiction over Maine has forwarded all of our constituent and policy inquiries to USCIS Headquarters for response, which we have yet to receive answers to,” Mannino said.

“It’s interesting that (ICE) let the Fox news crew ride along with them, but they won’t talk to us. It’s been like this for the past year, not just with (current activities in Maine) … So, we’re kind of in the dark just like everyone else.”

Mannino said the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum office has not provided substantive responses to inquiries from Pingree’s office since the Trump administration issued the January 2025 asylum pause and country-specific adjudication bans.

“ICE’s Office of Congressional Relations continues to provide empty responses and will not provide any information to our office about a constituent’s location, well-being, or reason for arrest without a specific privacy waiver signed by the detained individual,” Mannino said.

“When we pointed out that access to detainees is often challenging and people are advised not to sign anything in detention, our office was told that we should consider collecting these privacy waivers proactively.”

1:20 p.m.: Portland’s Parkside residents alert neighbors to ICE’s presence

When residents of Portland’s Parkside neighborhood saw six ICE agents knocking at the door of a multi-unit residential building on Grant Street, they made some noise.

Citizens threw on jackets and ran to the sidewalk to blow whistles, alerting others that ICE was in the area. Other residents began honking their car horns, drawing more people out of their homes.

The agents left the building at 134 Grant when they did not get a response at the door. They did not detain anyone, and left in a black sedan, followed by several cars honking at them.

After the agents left the scene, a dozen people congregated at the corner of Grant and Mellen Street to talk about the encounter and other ICE operations in the area.

Wylliam Wold, who lives in the neighborhood, called the ICE activity hotline, which is coordinated by the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition, to share the number of vehicles, the location and the uniforms the agents were wearing.

“I’ve been seeing flyers, talking with my community. I knew there was an ICE hotline and there’s an acronym, SALUTE, to remember what details to be giving when you do call it,” said Wold, 32.

“So that was just kind of my only thought: Here there’s nothing else I can do but call the hotline, share information.”

12:40 p.m.: Portland restaurant owner says her staff is anxious about ICE enforcement

Pastry Chef Ilma Lopez, who co-owns the Ugly Duckling and Chaval in Portland’s West End with her husband, said she has trained her staff how to handle any ICE presence at either restaurant.

“You can tell them, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m not allowed to talk to you. Let me just call our manager or let me just call our owner.’ You call me and I’ll take care of it.”

Lopez, who grew up in Venezuela, became an American citizen about a decade ago. “I’m 100% Latina and I’m proud of it,” she said. “I came to the States because in my country, it was really hard to make a living and we didn’t have freedom of speech. So 22 years ago, I came here and in a million years did it ever ever even cross my mind that we will be in this situation in America?”

Lopez said most of her restaurant staff come from North America, and all work in the U.S. legally. “We have done everything that the law asks us. I’ve been dealing with immigration lawyers for years. I follow every single step.”

She said the staff, nevertheless, is anxious. “Some people are anxious because they’re angry and upset. Some people are anxious because they don’t know what’s going to happen to them or to their friends. It’s a lot of question marks.”

11:25 a.m.: Gorham state representative says ICE officers are violating due process

Rep. Ellie Sato, D-Gorham, said the surge in immigration enforcement is harming Mainers who are skipping school, work and health appointments out of “fear of being disappeared.”

In a written statement, Sato, a member of the Legislature’s Judicial Committee, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are violating Mainers’ constitutional rights.

“What we are seeing on our newsfeeds everyday is a lack of due process,” Sato said. “It’s critical for everyone to know their rights, and how to respond when raids or arrests happen, both as bystanders, and as friends and family.”

Sato is sponsoring an emergency bill that would bar immigration enforcement officers from entering nonpublic areas within schools, public libraries, health care facilities and other locations without a judicial warrant signed by a judge.

11 a.m.: Lewiston resident reports ICE presence on Pierce Street

A migrant worker living on Pierce Street in Lewiston said ICE officers were present in their neighborhood Wednesday, with agents knocking on doors at nearby buildings Tuesday and again Wednesday morning.

The person, who asked not to be named because of safety concerns and declined to share their country of origin, said they saw a neighbor being questioned by agents.

“(Agents) were walking around here (Tuesday), and they caught him and interrogated him, but they didn’t take him away,” the resident said. “They didn’t take anyone.”

The resident said fears of ICE in their neighborhood and throughout the city are high, with many neighbors staying home, locking their doors and ignoring knocks.

“Even when they think you are here, you leave them alone,” they said. “Why are they here? We’re here to work, and we don’t hurt anyone.”

Portland city officials say they can’t restrict federal law enforcement from public spaces like city-operated parking garages, City Hall, Monument Square and Payson Park, according to an email from the parks department.

But when recreation programs are in session, officials say law enforcement officers cannot enter the space unless they’re invited or have a warrant.

“Many recreation programs, such as group swim lessons and Junior Celtics Basketball, take place in spaces that are reserved exclusively for pre-registered participants. During these programs, only enrolled participants and their caregivers are permitted in the program area,” according to an email sent by the parks department Tuesday morning.

City staff will inform anyone who tries to enter a recreation program area that space is limited to registered participants and caregivers, according to the email.

9:10 a.m.: South Portland school board cancels Thursday forum because of families’ fears

The South Portland board of education cancelled a public forum on Thursday to hear community members’ input about the upcoming budget because too many families with children in the schools were afraid to go out and attend, according to Board Chair Rosemarie De Angelis.

The school system has issued policies addressing what to do if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents show up on school grounds. The policy directs staff members to keep students away from immigration officers and direct agents towards the main office if they enter school property, according to a copy of the policy obtained by a public records request.

9 a.m.: DHS begins ‘Operation Catch of the Day’ in Maine, reports more than 1,000 targets

In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde said officers had identified more than 1,000 targets in Maine.

The network, which boasted “exclusive access,” reported nearly 50 arrests in Maine as enforcement picked up.

Officials have dubbed the surge “Operation Catch of the Day,” the network reported.

Hyde lamented a lack of cooperation by — and open criticism from — local leaders. City and state officials have warned of the impending surge for days.

“They ban their law enforcement from partnering or even communicating with ICE,” Hyde said on Fox. “And when law enforcement doesn’t communicate with law enforcement, that puts our communities in danger.”

Buitrago Ortiz is between 32 and 33 weeks pregnant and was deported from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
Buitrago Ortiz earlier had been detained in a center in Louisiana.
Ahmed said as recently as Jan. 18, there had been no indication that Buitrago Ortiz would be removed from the United States.
Ahmed said Buitrago Ortiz came to the U.S. with her family.","WASHINGTON — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials placed an asylum seeker who is eight months pregnant on a deportation flight Wednesday afternoon, even though she was in medical distress, her attorneys told States Newsroom.

ICE officials and the Department of Homeland Security responded to States Newsroom's requests for comment, but did not answer questions about the specific case.

Zharick Daniela Buitrago Ortiz, a 21-year-old national of Colombia, has a pending asylum case, said one of her attorneys, Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. Buitrago Ortiz was also represented by the Robert & Ethel Kennedy Human Rights Center.

As an asylum seeker, she was going through the credible fear process, a key step to establish an immigrant’s claim for asylum if they can show a fear of persecution or torture in their home country. Asylum seekers are typically allowed to live in the United States while their case proceeds.

Buitrago Ortiz is between 32 and 33 weeks pregnant and was deported from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Airport officials did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

Ahmed said flying late in pregnancy can have serious risks.

Buitrago Ortiz earlier had been detained in a center in Louisiana. She was placed by ICE on a flight from there to Atlanta prior to her removal to Colombia, her attorneys said.

As she waited for the flight to Colombia, Buitrago Ortiz experienced intense, shooting pain in her back and abdomen, according to her attorneys. They said they were also concerned about the risk to her health and that of her unborn child if she was placed on the flight, which is roughly five hours nonstop.

ICE generally has a policy to not detain immigrants who are pregnant unless there are exceptional circumstances. Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about reports of ICE detainment of pregnant immigrants, and urged ICE acting Director Todd Lyons to order the release of any immigrants who were pregnant from ICE detention facilities.

Travel during pregnancy can be risky past 28 weeks and can increase the chances of going into labor, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Ahmed said as recently as Jan. 18, there had been no indication that Buitrago Ortiz would be removed from the United States.

Ahmed said Buitrago Ortiz came to the U.S. with her family. Her mother received a favorable credible fear interview, meaning an immigration official believed there was a possibility of harm if she returned to her home country.

The family arrived in El Paso, Texas, in early November, according to Buitrago Ortiz’s mother, who asked not to be named for fear of harming her own asylum case.

Additionally, Ahmed said the father of Buitrago Ortiz’s child was murdered earlier this month in Colombia.

“It’s important that we understand that there is a woman in medical distress,” Ahmed said. “The clock is ticking.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2026-01/atlantaairport2026.jpg?h=81485932&itok=baPcqhht,N,,2026-01-21 18:58:50.607891

Department of Homeland Security officials announced the latest enforcement operation Wednesday. Officials say they will be targeting what the administration considers “the worst of the worst.”

The agency said that the operation launched officially Tuesday and that 50 migrants who are allegedly in the United States illegally have been arrested.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a released statement.

The surge of ICE officers comes two weeks after clashes between federal immigration agents and protesters began in Minneapolis in the wake of the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, issued a statement last week on social media, saying her administration had heard rumors of a looming immigration enforcement crackdown. Mills said her office had been unsuccessful in confirming whether an operation was pending.

Mills said she has directed the Maine State Police to work with local law enforcement as necessary as well as with city officials in Portland and Lewiston and the state attorney general.

“Our goal as always will be to protect the safety and the rights of the people of Maine,” Mills said in a video posted to her Facebook account.

“To the federal government, I say this: If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused — those tactics are not welcome here,” Mills said.

She added: “Maine will not be intimidated and we will not betray the values that make us who we are.”

ICE officers were dispatched to Minnesota in early December amid allegations of widespread fraud within the Somali population. DHS officials announced that 3,000 arrests of migrants in the country illegally have been made since that operation began.

DHS officials said Wednesday that among the 50 arrests made since Tuesday are migrants who have previously been convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a child.

Like in Minnesota, federal officials have alleged widespread fraud involving a Somali-led healthcare contractor that allegedly defrauded the state’s Medicaid system out of millions of dollars.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maine Andrew Benson warned residents against interfering with the work of federal agents and officers.

“In the coming days, if Maine citizens seek to exercise their rights to assemble and protest, it is vital that these protests remain peaceful,” Benson said. “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property, or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

He added, “Finally, it is incumbent upon anyone with a public voice—whether that be an elected official, commentator or engaged citizen—to similarly urge peaceful protest and engagement. Divisive, bombastic public statements only inflame the situation and make violence more likely.”

Maine is the latest Democratic-led area to be targeted by federal officials.

Deploying the military to conduct domestic policing outside of the Insurrection Act (or another authority) is a crime.
If President Trump does decide to invoke the Insurrection Act, he will be met with resistance in various forms, including litigation.","Since January 7, protests have broken out across Minnesota in response to the current administration’s abusive immigration policies and secret police tactics, which resulted in the murder of Renee Good, an American citizen and Minneapolis resident, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Instead of showing presidential empathy and leadership, President Trump has stoked the fire by threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act for the first time in more than three decades.

He’s made this threat before but seems more focused on it than ever. Here’s what you need to know.

The Insurrection Act — provisions of federal law that date back to 1792 — allows the president to use the military as a domestic police force in certain emergencies such as an “insurrection, “rebellion,” or “invasion.” Historically, the Insurrection Act is used rarely and in extreme emergencies when civilian police cannot or will not enforce the law. The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel has described invoking the Insurrection Act against the objection of the state’s governor as available only when “state and local law enforcement have completely broken down.” Most legal experts believe the Insurrection Act’s authorities are limited to these circumstances. The last time it was invoked was in 1992 when the governor of California and mayor of Los Angeles requested support from the National Guard to restore order after people rioted in response to police officers beating Rodney King. The riots caused over 60 deaths, 2,000 injuries, 4,000 fires, and $1 billion in property damage. And the last time the Insurrection Act was invoked over the objection of a state’s governor was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent the U.S. armed forces to Alabama to protect protestors marching in support of Black voting rights. In what is now known as Bloody Sunday, they had previously been attacked by Alabama state troopers at the Edmund Pettus Bridge during their pilgrimage from Selma to Montgomery.

It would be unlawful for the president to invoke the Insurrection Act to quash pro-immigrant protests. There is no insurrection, rebellion, invasion, or other emergency in Minneapolis that would justify invoking the Insurrection Act. Instead, protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful and state and local law enforcement in Minnesota have been capably handling the limited acts of violence among the protesters. The violence and disorder captured in social media posts have come almost entirely from federal agents, who currently outnumber the 10 largest regional police forces combined. Unlike in the case of the Rodney King riots, the governor of Minnesota and the mayor of Minneapolis have not sought outside support for the protests taking place today, which are mild in comparison.

Deploying the military to conduct domestic policing outside of the Insurrection Act (or another authority) is a crime. The military is trained for fighting wars against enemy combatants, not policing civilians. However, authoritarians throughout history have often used the military to dismantle democratic systems and seize power. That’s why Congress, under the Posse Comitatus Act, made it a crime to use the military for civilian law enforcement purposes without constitutional or congressional authorization. The ability to invoke the Insurrection Act is one of the exceptions. So, if the president were to intentionally try to invoke the Insurrection Act without justification so that he could use the military to control and police civilians, he would be committing a crime.

Invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy the military on U.S. soil is not the same as declaring “martial law.” Even if the president were to succeed in convincing courts of his flimsy argument that the Insurrection Act would apply to the situation in Minneapolis, he would not be declaring “martial law.” While “martial law” does not have a clear legal definition, it’s much closer to what you probably assume it is: the military entirely taking over the functions of local, civilian government. With martial law, we’re not just talking military police: we’re also talking military courts, military government administrators, and the military issuing orders to civilians rather than taking orders from civilian government officials under the law. Martial law also often comes with legally ambiguous civil rights violations, such as suspending habeas corpus, a constitutional right that guarantees any detained individual a hearing before a judge, and due process; censoring media, public figures, and individuals; and setting curfews. The Insurrection Act, by contrast, only allows the military to assist civilian law enforcement by enforcing existing law and engaging in traditional police activities like making lawful arrests, responding to acts of violence, or maintaining order during riots. The Insurrection Act cannot and does not override constitutional protections, such as your First Amendment right to freedom of speech and assembly, or your Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches or seizures.

President Trump has used other dubious authorities to deploy the military in American cities, but a more worrisome and potentially broader invocation of the Insurrection Act may be coming. The president has claimed inherent constitutional authority to use the military domestically to protect federal buildings and agents, which continues to be litigated. He also tried to unlawfully use state National Guard forces in California, Oregon, and Illinois for the federal government under a different federal law, which the Supreme Court rejected. Because courts have restricted the president’s attempts to deploy the military in American cities using other presidential loopholes, President Trump may decide to finally invoke the Insurrection Act to advance his personal goal of using the military for political ends.

If President Trump does decide to invoke the Insurrection Act, he will be met with resistance in various forms, including litigation.

Mills’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, although the Democrat said last week her administration was “taking proactive steps to prepare” for a possible surge in federal law enforcement agents.

Portland City Councilor Pious Ali said most of the people arrested by ICE on Tuesday were from Maine’s greater Portland area, including South Portland, Westbrook and Lewiston.

Local officials in the state have cautioned that the presence of federal officials in Maine could lead to heightened tensions, with Portland Mayor Mark Dion warning last week that “Our community is anxious and fearful regarding the understanding that ICE is planning to send agents to Portland and Lewiston next week.”

“There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents,” Dion said in a statement. “Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods. While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes.

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline also warned that the operation “may cause anxiety, fear or uncertainty for some in our community,” noting an increased presence of ICE agents in his city.

“ICE’s terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare,” he said in a Wednesday statement. “These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long term damage to our state and to our country.”

ICE Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde told Fox News in Scarborough, Maine, on Tuesday that the operation was targeting approximately 1,400 individuals— including immigrants from Senegal, Somalia, Honduras, Guatemala and the Congo — and that authorities arrested more than 50 people during its first day.

The operation comes as ICE has deployed several thousand agents to Minnesota as part of an ongoing crackdown also tied — but not limited — to Somali Americans.

Local and state officials have repeatedly clashed with the White House over ICE’s presence in that state, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announcing Tuesday that he had been served a subpoena as part of a federal investigation into the Democrat. Vice President JD Vance is also set to visit Minneapolis on Thursday as protests continue across the city against the administration’s immigration crackdown.

ICE’s nationwide crackdown has at times turned violent in other states, including Oregon, where Border Patrol agents shot two people that DHS alleged were suspected associates of the gang Tren de Aragua earlier this month. Last week, a federal agent shot and injured another man who DHS accused of attempting to “resist and violently assault the officer” during a “targeted traffic stop.”

And on Wednesday, DHS said an agent had fired “defensive shots” against the target of an operation in Compton, California, but that the person — who was ultimately apprehended — “was not hit and attempted to flee on foot.”

Ali, a Ghanaian American who has served on Portland, Maine’s, city council, since 2016, said he feared the crackdown could harm local businesses and schools.

The department said in a press release that it kicked off “Operation Catch of the Day” on Tuesday, targeting criminal offenders. More than 100 agents arrived in the frigid Northeast state this week, one current immigration official and one former official said on condition of anonymity. The former official said the operation would focus on refugees.

Maine’s political leadership and immigrant communities have been bracing for the arrival of more immigration agents. Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, said last week that the Trump administration’s aggressive enforcement tactics were “not welcome.”

Trump, a Republican, has surged immigration agents to Democratic-led cities and states since mid-2025, with some 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks. Trump has called the intense enforcement operations necessary to combat criminality, although many suspected immigration offenders arrested have no criminal charges or convictions.

Trump has been critical of Somali immigrants after some Somali Americans were implicated in a fraud scheme in Minnesota, calling them “garbage” and saying they should leave the U.S.

Trump takes election-year crackdown to Maine

Mills, in her second term as Maine’s governor, is running for a U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Susan Collins, a moderate trying to fend off Democratic challengers in November’s midterm elections that will decide control of Congress. Trump’s immigration policies are expected to be a prominent issue in Maine and other states.

Public support for Trump’s approach to immigration has dwindled in recent months as federal agents have swept through residential neighborhoods, tossing tear gas and clashing with protesters, Reuters/Ipsos polls show.

Tensions boiled over this month when a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis fatally shot Renee Good, U.S. citizen and mother of three.

Carl Sheline, mayor of Lewiston, Maine, said on Tuesday that the city had seen an increase in ICE agents in the 39,000-person city. Lewiston, the second-largest city in Maine, is home to Somali immigrants and other refugees, communities that have been there for decades.

Sheline said in an email that ICE’s “terror and intimidation tactics” showed “a complete lack of humanity.”

“Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home,” he said.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin criticized Maine’s governor, calling her one of the state’s “sanctuary politicians” trying to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the incident was reported around 7:25 a.m. on the 2400 block of 126th Street in the unincorporated community of Willowbrook, which is located just north of Compton. Deputies with the LASD were not involved, but were called to secure the perimeter of the scene.

Carballo was not hit by any fired rounds and attempted to flee the scene on foot, according to the DHS. He was later apprehended and taken into custody.

At least one CBP officer was injured during the incident, although the extent and circumstances of the injury were not immediately made clear.

DHS claimed that Carballo was previously involved in a ""human smuggling operation,"" with two prior arrests for allegedly ""inflicting corporal injury"" on a spouse or cohabitant. He was removed from the U.S. by an immigration judge in 2019, DHS says.

The memo authorizes ICE officers to use force to enter a residence based solely on a more narrow administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal, a move that advocates say collides with Fourth Amendment protections and upends years of advice given to immigrant communities.

The shift comes as the Trump administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide, deploying thousands of officers under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

For years, immigrant advocates, legal aid groups and local governments have urged people not to open their doors to immigration agents unless they are shown a warrant signed by a judge. That guidance is rooted in Supreme Court rulings that generally prohibit law enforcement from entering a home without judicial approval. The ICE directive directly undercuts that advice at a time when arrests are accelerating under the administration’s immigration crackdown.

The memo itself has not been widely shared within the agency, according to a whistleblower complaint, but its contents have been used to train new ICE officers who are being deployed into cities and towns to implement the president’s immigration crackdown. New ICE hires and those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo, according to the whistleblower disclosure.

It is unclear how broadly the directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. The Associated Press witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of the home of a Liberian man in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

The change is almost certain to meet legal challenges and stiff criticism from advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments that have spent years successfully urging people not to open their doors unless ICE shows them a warrant signed by a judge.

The Associated Press obtained the memo and whistleblower complaint from an official in Congress, who shared it on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive documents. The AP verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.

The memo, signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and dated May 12, 2025, says: “Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.""

The memo does not detail how that determination was made nor what its legal repercussions might be.

When asked about the memo, Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement to the AP that everyone the department serves with an administrative warrant has already had “full due process and a final order of removal.”

She said the officers issuing those warrants have also found probable cause for the person’s arrest. She said the Supreme Court and Congress have “recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,” without elaborating. McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether ICE officers entered a person’s home since the memo was issued relying solely on an administrative warrant and if so, how often.

Whistleblower Aid, a non-profit legal organization that assists workers exposing wrongdoings, said in the whistleblower complaint obtained by The Associated Press that it represents two anonymous U.S. government officials “disclosing a secretive - and seemingly unconstitutional - policy directive.”

A wave of recent high-profile arrests, many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video, has shined a spotlight on immigration arrest tactics, including officers’ use of proper warrants.

Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by judges carry that authority.

All law enforcement operations — including those conducted by ICE and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures.

People can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant, with some limited exceptions.

Federal agents this month rammed the door of the Minneapolis home of a Liberian man with a deportation order from 2023, who was then arrested. Documents reviewed by The AP revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge who authorized the raid on private property.

The memo says ICE officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using just a signed administrative warrant known as an I-205 if they have a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals or a district judge or magistrate judge.

The memo says officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they’re at the residence. They’re limited in the hours they can go into the home — after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn’t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

“Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien’s residence, following proper notification of the officer or agent’s authority and intent to enter,” the memo reads.

The memo is addressed to all ICE personnel. But it has been shown only to “select DHS officials” who then shared it with some employees who were told to read it and return it, Whistleblower Aid wrote in the disclosure.

One of the two whistleblowers was allowed to view the memo only in the presence of a supervisor and then had to give it back. That person was not allowed to take notes. A whistleblower was able to access the document and lawfully disclose to Congress, Whistleblower Aid said.

Although the memo was issued in May, David Kligerman, senior vice president and special counsel at Whistleblower Aid, said it took time for its clients to find a “safe and legal path to disclose it to lawmakers and the American people.”

ICE has been rapidly hiring thousands of new deportation officers to carry out the president’s mass deportation agenda. They’re trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia.

During a visit there by The Associated Press in August, ICE officials said repeatedly that new officers were being trained to follow the Fourth Amendment.

But according to the whistleblowers’ account, newly hired ICE officers are being told they can rely solely on administrative warrants to enter homes to make arrests even though that conflicts with written Homeland Security training materials.

ICE officers often wait for hours for the person they’re hoping to arrest to come outside so they can make the arrest on the sidewalk or at the person's work — public places where they are allowed to operate without the risk of infringing on the person’s Fourth Amendment rights.

Whistleblower Aid called the new policy a “complete break from the law” and said it undercuts the “Fourth Amendment and the rights it protects.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/7933ecac-3da1-4fa5-8c5b-ef6eddf9b82f/wirestory_00d0ab0338e82341fd91b160758aeb2d_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-21 18:58:34.986990

Janet Mills and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows for their response to reports of heightened ICE activity.","PORTLAND, Maine — U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials said they have launched “Operation Catch of the Day,” a targeted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) effort in Maine.

The effort is ""targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities,"" a press release from DHS shared Wednesday said.

""Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,"" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant DHS secretary, said in a statement.

McLaughlin claims ICE agents arrested people convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child. NEWS CENTER Maine has not yet been able to independently confirm this, or if the people convicted served time for their crimes.

Governor Janet Mills responded in a statement, saying, “I recognize that many people across Maine are fearful in the wake of ICE’s announcement that it has launched an operation in Maine, and my Administration remains in close contact with municipal officials, including in Lewiston and Portland, as well as with organizations across Maine, to monitor ICE activity and ensure the safety and civil rights of people across Maine are protected. If the Federal government has warrants, then it should show them. But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the Federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors – none of which is welcome.”

ICE Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde told Fox News the operation has resulted in about 50 arrests so far. Hyde said the agency is targeting about 1,400 individuals in Maine.

Hyde also criticized Maine’s law enforcement ban on collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying it has hindered operations.

She told Fox News “agitators” in the state impeded enforcement actions, but added that the agency will continue until it has arrested all its targets.

DHS did not immediately provide additional details on the specific locations of arrests or the identities of those targeted.

Westbrook Mayor David Morse said in a social media post that ICE has been actively conducting operations and detaining people in Westbrook on Tuesday and Wednesday.

""At least one peaceful US citizen observer from Westbrook was targeted for intimidation by a masked federal law enforcement officer this morning,"" Morse said. ""This is outrageous behavior from a federal authority, and I stand by our citizens’ rights to peacefully observe and/or protest.""

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline also released a statement Wednesday, saying Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home.

""ICE's terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare. These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long-term damage to our state and to our country,"" Sheline said. ""Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.""

Reports of increased ICE activity spread across southern Maine on Tuesday, prompting brief school lockouts and rising anxiety among immigrant communities.

Two Portland schools—Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School—briefly locked their doors around 9 a.m. after reports of ICE agents possibly on nearby Brighton Avenue. No threat was found, and the lockouts were quickly lifted, district officials said.

""This is an understandably tense time in our community, as reports and rumors of immigration enforcement actions grow,"" a statement from Portland Public Schools said. ""The Portland Public Schools will continue to follow our protocols for keeping students and staff safe, while also staying focused on our core work of teaching and learning. We will continue to provide updates directly to our PPS community as we have information to share.""

Staff at the Cumberland Farms on Woodford Street in Portland told NEWS CENTER Maine they had received several reports of ICE agents in the area on Tuesday morning.

Elsewhere, Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis urged tribal members to carry tribal identification amid reports of federal detentions of Native Americans in other states. He said no ICE activity had been reported on tribal lands in Maine but cautioned members to stay informed.

""We know that many of you have heard reports of ICE interactions involving individuals who are, by law and by birthright, citizens of Tribal Nations,"" Francis said in a statement. ""News and social media reports indicate that ICE has detained several Native Americans throughout the country and have conducted raids on facilities located on Tribal lands. The Tribal government has verified that some of these reports are true, and some are false.""

Maine Republicans have criticized Gov. Janet Mills and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows for their response to reports of heightened ICE activity.

After a request from Homeland Security, Bellows announced she would pause issuing new undercover Maine license plates to federal agencies, saying she wanted assurances the plates would not be used “for lawless purposes.”

On Wednesday, Bellows issued a statement in response to the ""Operation Catch of the Day"" launch.

“What ICE is doing right now in Maine is unconscionable. Maine is consistently ranked as one of the safest states in the country. It’s because Mainers are strong – we look out for our neighbors and we take care of one another. There can be no pretense that ICE is here to keep us safe; they are here to stoke fears, play political games, and try to destroy the Maine spirit. Our immigrant neighbors make our communities stronger, and they are a critical part of what makes Maine the best place to live.”

“When it comes to protecting new Mainers, I’ll do everything in my power to hold the Trump administration accountable and protect our state.”

What Employers Need to Know The Supreme Court’s refusal to hear argument in Richards leaves a variance in class certification standards across jurisdictions.
Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.","On January 12, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to address a deepening circuit split about the process for certifying collective class actions under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) and the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”). As a result, uncertainty persists for employers and employees alike, with federal courts adopting a range of standards.

Historical Class Certification Standard

Both Rule 23 class actions and FLSA section 216(b) collective actions allow employees to bring suit on behalf of others who are “similarly situated.” Section 216(b) mandates employee-plaintiffs opt-in to the lawsuit, which requires courts to approve and oversee the circulation of class notice to potential plaintiffs. The same process applies to ADEA class actions. In Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sperling (1989), the U.S. Supreme Court authorized the sending of notice of a FLSA collective action to potential opt-in plaintiffs so long as that notice is neutral, timely and accurate. Following the Supreme Court’s holding in Hoffman-La Roche, most federal courts adopted a plaintiff-friendly, two-step analysis articulated in Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. Under the Lusardi approach, plaintiffs who demonstrate that employees are “similarly situated” based on a “modest factual showing” achieve conditional certification.

Conditional certification permits district courts to oversee the circulation of notice to potential class action members. Courts then consider final certification or decertification at a later point in the case. Practically, this lenient standard has increased class sizes and created pressure for employers to settle early, before incurring the time and expense associated with the seemingly perfunctory “conditional” certification process and, thereafter, the final, evidence-based class certification decision.

Seventh Circuit’s Approach

In August, the Seventh Circuit, in Richards v. Eli Lilly & Company, departed from the two-step Lusardi analysis. There, the Seventh Circuit held that district courts must consider evidence from both sides concerning whether workers are similarly situated enough to proceed together. Under the Seventh Circuit’s approach in Richards, a plaintiff must first make a threshold showing that there is a material factual dispute as to whether the proposed collective is similarly situated. Thereafter, employer/defendants may submit rebuttal evidence. Once the court determines a material dispute exists, the decision to issue notice rests on its assessment of the factual dispute before it. Overall, this standard requires more evidence than Lusardi, which can reduce the pressure employers feel to settle that has traditionally accompanied conditional certification.

Fifth and Sixth Circuit Approach

Like the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have moved away from the traditional Lusardi standard.

In the Fifth Circuit (Swales v. KLLM Transport Services LLC), plaintiffs must meet a more demanding one-step test, showing it is “more likely than not” that employees are similarly situated. When crafting this standard in Swales, the Fifth Circuit noted the more lenient Lusardi approach resulted in broad circulation of conditional class notice to plaintiffs who were not truly similarly situated. This was frequently used as leverage against employers to compel them to settle. Similar to the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth Circuit now requires lower courts to vet plaintiffs at the outset of litigation and consider all available evidence before authorizing class notices. This standard is far more favorable to employer/defendants.

In the Sixth Circuit (Clark v. A&L Homecare and Training Center, LLC), plaintiffs must demonstrate a “strong likelihood” that the proposed group is similarly situated. The Sixth Circuit rejected the “more likely than not” standard as too high of a bar for plaintiffs, but found the Lusardi approach too lenient. Thus, in the Sixth Circuit, a plaintiff must make a showing that goes beyond creating a genuine issue of fact, but it need not rise to the level of “more likely than not” or a “preponderance”. Accordingly, the standard of proof in the Sixth Circuit falls between Lusardi and Swales.

The Supreme Court Denies Certiorari in Richards

In Richards, Eli Lilly submitted a petition for certiorari—which was joined by several amici—arguing that it was critical the Supreme Court resolve the growing circuit split in class certification standards. Last week, however, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Richards will now head back to the district court, which will likely apply the new Seventh Circuit standard to determine class certification.

What Employers Need to Know

The Supreme Court’s refusal to hear argument in Richards leaves a variance in class certification standards across jurisdictions. While most federal courts continue to apply the Lusardi approach—a relatively low bar for plaintiffs to obtain condition certification—recent decisions in the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits have created stricter, more employer-friendly standards. These varying criteria will almost certainly have the strategic effect of encouraging collective action plaintiffs to file suit—if jurisdictionally possible—in circuits other than the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh. Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.

Federal agents in tactical gear and carrying long rifles were at the scene, as were sheriff’s deputies.
Holly Mitchell, who represents the area on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said in an interview that she had been briefed on the episode by officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department on Wednesday.
She said she drove there to check on her parents, who live in the area, and to protest the federal agents.
She waved a large Mexican flag she said she had used at a previous “No Kings” protest in Los Angeles.","A federal agent fired his weapon during an immigration enforcement operation in the Los Angeles area on Wednesday morning, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

The agency said in an emailed statement that its agents were conducting an operation around 7 a.m. to arrest a man who they said had been “involved in a human smuggling operation.”

The department said that the man, Eduardo Moran Carballo, of El Salvador, had attempted “to evade arrest” and then “rammed law enforcement” with his vehicle. The agency said a federal agent had “fired defensive shots” and feared for his safety. It did not specify which Department of Homeland Security agency the officer worked for.

Mr. Carballo was not hit or injured in the shooting, the department said. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer was injured, according to the Homeland Security Department, which did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries or state his condition. Agents took Mr. Carballo into custody.

The department said the operation took place in Compton, Calif., south of Los Angeles, but a local official said it happened in Willowbrook, an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County.

“This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming,” the department said, adding that Mr. Carballo had two prior arrests on accusations of “inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.”

Hours after the incident, the wreckage of a gray BMW sports car that crashed was on the street near a curb, its airbags deployed and both doors open. Federal agents in tactical gear and carrying long rifles were at the scene, as were sheriff’s deputies. Helicopters hovered overhead as protesters, shouting obscenities at the masked federal agents, began to arrive.

The Trump administration’s national immigration crackdown first ramped up in Southern California — and particularly in many of the heavily Latino suburbs of Los Angeles County — last summer.

Holly Mitchell, who represents the area on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said in an interview that she had been briefed on the episode by officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department on Wednesday.

Ms. Mitchell said that a Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement task force action led to a “vehicle pursuit,” which ended at around 7:30 a.m. in Willowbrook. She said she was told that one round was fired, and that no one was hit. The Sheriff’s Department helped to secure the scene, she said, but emphasized that county law enforcement officers were not involved in the immigration enforcement action.

Ms. Mitchell, whose vast district includes many neighborhoods where working-class Latino families have lived for generations, said that the episode on Wednesday appeared to have been carried out with “the same kind of recklessness and lack of regard for basic human rights and true public safety” that she has seen from federal agents for months.

The car chase on Wednesday, she said, took place during the morning rush hour, just as families were taking children to school. She added that the use of lethal force by agents, both in Los Angeles and in other cities, is troubling.

“Fortunately no one was killed,” she said. “It was by sheer luck — I assume they didn’t intend to miss when they fired their firearm, so we were blessed today.”

Ms. Mitchell urged constituents to continue to document any activity they see, if they can do so safely. She echoed officials in Minnesota who have said that such documentation of interactions between federal agents and members of the public could be important evidence in future court cases over the federal government’s tactics.

Rosa Enriquez, 39, who lives in nearby South Gate, was among dozens of people who gathered at the scene. She said she drove there to check on her parents, who live in the area, and to protest the federal agents. She waved a large Mexican flag she said she had used at a previous “No Kings” protest in Los Angeles.

“We’re in Compton,” she said. “We’re so used to living life being cautious, being careful, and this is what we fear the most.”

Online fundraisers have identified two of the residents arrested that Sunday morning along Speedwell Avenue —including a Morristown High School senior. Donors have raised $120,000 for their legal defense as they face deportation.

Adonay Mancia Rodriguez went to pick up a takeout food delivery at the front door of his apartment building when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested him, leaving his 6-year-old daughter alone, a family friend said. The Honduran national came to the U.S. in 2013 and works in town as a chef, according to Cathleen Murphy, a Morristown teacher and neighbor of Mancia Rodriguez's family.

He remains in custody at the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility, ICE records show.

""He came here as a refugee when he was 17 years old,"" said Murphy, who said she was ""acting as [the family's] advocate during this time.""

""He never received a follow-up mailing for his immigration process,"" she said. ""He has a case to get his green card and everything. He just didn't receive the mailing to go to court. So he never followed up with the process and then that's what led to the deportation order, we guess.""

When he told the ICE officials his daughter was upstairs, ""They said, 'We're not here for your daughter. We're here for you,'"" Murphy added. ""They did not send anybody to check on her or coordinate with local police or anything. They just took him to the car.""

The girl was in the apartment upstairs for about an hour until she realized something was wrong, Murphy said.

6-year-old left alone

""So she gathered up her things, her coat, her shoes and her tablet, and she went out on the street,"" she said. ""She waited for a woman who came walking up the street and she said, 'I don't know where my dad is.' The woman was able to use the tablet to contact the family. Her mother was working at Walmart at the time.""

""The little girl is absolutely traumatized,"" Murphy said.

Mancia Rodriguez's family has been allowed to visit him in detention, and an attorney is working on the case.

""We're waiting to hear this week if the judge will accept the motion to reopen his case to become a citizen. or a resident,"" Murphy said.

In a Jan. 15 response to emailed questions, three days after the raid, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the arrests of 11 ""illegal aliens, several with felony offenses"" in the Morristown operation.

Others ""took advantage of the Biden administration’s open border crisis,"" Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS assistant secretary, said in the email.

The message did not identify the detainees nor provide details about the alleged offenses.

Online fundraisers

Murphy has cosponsored an online fundraiser for her neighbor's legal defense along with a family cousin of Mancia Rodriguez, Rosa Portillo. It had exceeded $26,000 as of late on Jan. 20.

""He first came to the country as a refugee and has been living and working in Morristown for over a decade,"" Portillo wrote.

""He is a hard worker with no criminal record whatsoever who is just trying to provide for his family. He has a huge family here that is devastated, but most of all is his daughter, who is inconsolable. They are very close and all she wants is to have him back.""

Another fundraiser has collected more than $94,000 for the legal defense of Juan David Mendoza, a Morristown High School senior who was among the detainees. Mendoza, 17, ""was taken by ICE without warning, leaving his family shocked and terrified,"" the organizers of the fundraiser wrote.

Organizers have yet to respond to messages from the Daily Record, but according to an update on the fundraising page, a district judge ordered the teen's release on Jan. 15 and he is currently represented by legal counsel. Efforts to reach the family were unsuccessful.

In a follow-up email from DHS on Jan. 20, McLaughlin said Mendoza was ""an illegal alien from Honduras"" who had entered the U.S. in 2024. ""He is an adult,"" McLaughlin added.

""All individuals are currently detained, and either in removal proceedings or in the process of being removed from the United States in accordance with U.S. immigration law,"" she said.

While New York City has robust legal aid networks, the BUILD Act would help develop rural and upstate regions where immigration services are scarcer.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Advocates and Democratic elected officials rallied at the Million Dollar Staircase on Wednesday, demanding Governor Kathy Hochul and the legislature pass bills that shield immigrant from federal enforcement. They want the state to refuse cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to offer legal aid to New Yorkers who are detained.

“We are here at a pivotal moment, a moment in time where our state and our country is at a crossroads,” said Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition. “Do we want to continue being a democracy, or do we want to allow a fascist, authoritarian dictator to take us in a different direction?”

The coalition wants the governor to include $175 million in her Fiscal Year 2027 executive budget to pay for the legal services of immigrants facing deportation. That’s because, unlike in criminal court, people in civil immigration court aren’t guaranteed a lawyer.

That’s why lawmakers at the rally pushed for the Access to Representation Act. That bill, S141/A270, would establish the right to legal counsel for those making less than 200% of the federal poverty line—about $31,000 for a single person, $42,000 for a couple, and $64,000 for a family of four—when they’re involved in removal proceedings.

Proponents cited a statistic that immigrants with lawyers are up to two-and-a-half times likelier to win their cases. “Immigration court has as much due process as traffic court, it has been said, but with outcomes as grave as the death penalty,” said Catharine Grainge from the Jericho Road Community Health Center in Buffalo.

Grainge, an attorney, recounted a frantic 72-hour window where she drafted a 300-page motion to save a client from immediate deportation, a technical feat that probably would be impossible for unrepresented immigrants.

Proponents cited a New York City Comptroller report estimating that universal legal representation would put $8.4 billion in savings and revenue in the government’s coffers.

The coalition also rallied for the Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense Act. The BUILD Act, S4538/A2689, would create a grant program to recruit and train lawyers, social workers, and community navigators to handle increasing immigration caseloads.

The BUILD Act would fund infrastructure in legal deserts, rural and remote regions where immigration services are historically scarce compared to the state average. While New York City has robust legal aid networks, the BUILD Act would help develop rural and upstate regions where immigration services are scarcer. The legislation is supposed to give attorneys more time to work on complex litigation.

Ralliers also promoted the New York for All Act, S2235A/A3506A, prohibiting state and local officers—including police and probation officers—from using tax dollars or resources to help immigration agents.

Supporters say ICE increasingly uses local police as deportation agents, eroding public trust by making New Yorkers afraid to report crimes, call for emergency services, or go to school. “We are not going to let you come into our communities to terrorize our neighborhoods, to divide our families, and to devastate our economies,” said State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, a Democrat from southern Brooklyn.

The coalition offered more statistics. Between January and July of 2025, they said, ICE detained almost 5,000 New Yorkers—more than in all of 2024 combined. As of August, almost 340,000 cases were pending in the state’s immigration courts. Assemblymember Catalina Cruz, a Democrat from Queens, described ICE detentions as kidnapping. She cited reports of 36 people dying in ICE custody in 2025.

They also highlighted the economic impacts of immigrants, who paid $31.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2023, while foreign-born residents account for more than a quarter of the workforce and include 190,800 entrepreneurs. “We’ve relied on that money that the immigrants bring every year to make our budget balanced,” Cruz said. “We need to make sure that we are not giving breadcrumbs to immigrants, because it’s frankly insulting.”

While anti-immigration voices maintain that cooperation with federal authorities is necessary to remove criminals and protect public safety, those at the rally disputed that connection between immigration and crime. Assemblymember Karines Reyes, a Democrat from the Bronx, said federal agents target law-abiding residents because they ran out of criminals on day one.

The governor and state legislature are supposed to finalize the state budget by the April 1 deadline, but the state has consistently missed that deadline in recent years.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2026/01/Immigration-rally-January-21-2026.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-21 17:00:07.440394

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has also repeatedly condemned ICE’s operation in the state, which the Department of Homeland Security has sought to tie to a widespread investigation into allegations of government program fraud involving some Somali Americans.

In the wake of the shooting, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem doubled down on the need for a heightened presence of federal law enforcement, vowing that “hundreds more” officials would be deployed to Minnesota in addition to the more than 2,000 agents already there.

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety announced Saturday that the state’s National Guard had been “mobilized and are staging to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies” at Walz’s direction.

Walz has repeatedly sparred with President Donald Trump, with federal prosecutors subpoenaing the 2024 Democratic nominee for vice president in the latest clash between the two leaders. In a Tuesday statement, Walz called the investigation into him “a partisan distraction,” accusing the Trump administration of pursuing “baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F20%2F0e%2F58685d13415e96ef1d56e4d5401d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2255448042,N,,2026-01-21 18:58:38.988932

Named for Democratic politician William S. Holman, the rule has been instated and rescinded over the decades.
That same year, some Republicans considered using the rule to derail a now-abandoned special counsel investigation into Donald Trump, though the maneuver was never deployed.
“The amendment before you is simple, and it’s narrow,” Veasey said at the hearing.
“It sends a clear message that we are not going to fund this man’s salary, and that Congress will not fund hate.","As a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill works its way through Congress, Congressman Marc Veasey, a Democrat who represents part of Dallas, introduced an amendment in committee Wednesday aimed to reduce the salary of James Rodden, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) assistant chief counsel who acts as a prosecutor for ICE in immigration court in Dallas, to $1.

In February of last year, the Texas Observer reported that Rodden operates a white supremacist X account named GlomarResponder, based on an overwhelming number of biographical details that the Observer matched through publicly available documents, other social media activity, and courtroom observation. Three members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including Veasey, wrote letters to ICE and DHS demanding information and investigation. In response, ICE sent a letter to Veasey stating it would address the matter and that such internal investigations can take up to 120 days, but it has otherwise not provided any information.

Veasey’s amendment came a week after the Observer reported that Rodden, who was apparently pulled from federal immigration court schedules following the Observer’s reporting last February, had returned to immigration court in Dallas.

“[Rodden’s] statements are disgusting, and they are dangerous, and regardless of if you are a Democrat or a Republican, they should be disqualifying for anyone entrusted with power in the United States government,” Veasey said during Wednesday’s House Rules Committee hearing. “If Congress does nothing, if the committee does nothing, then we’re sending the message that this type of behavior is tolerable, that accountability is optional, and that white supremacy can continue to be subsidized with taxpayer dollars.”

The GlomarResponder account has over 17,000 followers and has routinely posted hateful statements. In addition to posting that “America is a White nation,” that “‘Migrants’ are all criminals,” and that “All blacks are foreign to my people,” plus apparent praise of Adolf Hitler, the account has also made posts that evoke anti-immigrant violence: “Nobody is proposing feeding migrants into tree shredders,” the account posted in March 2024. “Yet. Give it a few more weeks at this level of invasion, and that will be the moderate position.”

Veasey’s amendment seeking to reduce Rodden’s salary relied upon the Holman Rule, which allows members of the U.S. House to amend appropriations legislation to cut specific programs or reduce the salary of specific federal employees. Named for Democratic politician William S. Holman, the rule has been instated and rescinded over the decades. It was most recently reinstated in 2023 when Republicans retook the majority. That same year, some Republicans considered using the rule to derail a now-abandoned special counsel investigation into Donald Trump, though the maneuver was never deployed.

“The amendment before you is simple, and it’s narrow,” Veasey said at the hearing. “It sends a clear message that we are not going to fund this man’s salary, and that Congress will not fund hate. We can stand by Nazi sympathizers and Hitler supporters, or we can do the right thing and honor the sacrifices of the men and women who died to stop the hateful spread of Nazism.”

The lawsuit was one of many in which MLFA helps to defend AMP and its leaders against baseless claims. Judge Mark Scarsi agreed with AMP that “there are no factual allegations raising an inference that AMP was involved” in any conspiracy to harm Plaintiffs. Despite inflammatory allegations unrelated to the claims, AMP and its leaders continue to see the truth prevail.

MLFA is grateful to Ms. Christina Jump, who began her work on this lawsuit as the Civil Litigation Department Head in MLFA’s Legal Division, and continues to serve as lead counsel for AMP after entering private practice with Jump Start Legal Justice Center. MLFA remains dedicated to helping to represent AMP, with Staff Attorneys Samira Elhosary and Ali Boyd supporting Ms. Jump for the duration of this case. Thanks also go to AMP’s local counsel, Max Schoening of Qureshi Law, for all his help.

“We’re so excited to see AMP vindicated, yet again, from these baseless attacks. Though the lawsuits continue to get creative, we continue to rise to the occasion to protect AMP and allow it to continue its important work educating the US public about the just cause of Palestine.”

– Samira Elhosary, Civil Litigation Staff Attorney:

“I remain honored to lead litigation for AMP, both during my time at MLFA and now as Jump Start Legal Justice Center. Each time we have the opportunity for facts to rise over fear, the federal courts recognize the failures of the lawsuits against AMP. AMP and its officials work hard, and work honestly, and even the plaintiffs couldn’t point to a single fact where AMP committed a violation — as the Judge rightly observed that “there are no allegations that anyone from AMP was anywhere near” the events the plaintiffs claim caused them harm. They were not, and now they need not be anywhere near these plaintiffs’ baseless claims.”

By the time, by the time you turn around, you are surrounded by uh uh uh ICE agents and they are ready to take you with them.
And uh uh I also wanna add this.
""Portland Mayor Mark Dion and members of the Portland City Council spoke Wednesday afternoon about the presence of ICE in Maine.
Portland Mayor Mark Dion and members of the Portland City Council spoke Wednesday afternoon about the presence of ICE in Maine.","Uh, but this is an opportunity. Uh, for us, for us. To answer any questions and concerns you might want to express, now that ICE has engaged in their enforcement action, not only in the city of Portland, but it appears in the metro as well. So I want to respond to the fact that. Our communities feel anxious and fearful. They see this action as unpredictable and *** threat to their families. Collectively and individually, we've done everything we can to assure them and that. We believe in their right to be safe. And we've tried to direct resources their way to support their capacity to stay here in Portland. From hybrid education schools offering food sustenance. And just getting the rights and responsibilities out to all key parties so they know what to do should they engage *** federal officer. I want to underscore one important point. While we respect the law. We challenge the need for *** paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. Federal immigration law is lawful. Its administration and enforcement is lawful. While we may dispute the basis for those laws as individual citizens. The fact remains it is federal law. What we've been concerned with as *** council is the enforcement tactics. That ICE has undertaken in other communities, which to our mind appear to threaten and intimidate populations. If they change the way they do their business, then we can focus on doing our responsibility as citizens and changing policy through our elected officials. So this council doesn't stand apart from our immigrant communities, but we stand with them. As *** reminder. The Portland Police Department does not involve itself in the enforcement. Of civil Administrative violations under federal immigration statute. As police officers, if there is *** call. For support Having to do with imminent threat to life. or serious bodily injury, no matter who the agency or individual is, we will respond as we would to any one of you calling 911. That is our duty in terms of public safety. I'll interrupt for *** moment. Councilor Fornier, you can join us up here. Thank. So we, we've received *** lot of information from the public that, uh, enforcement contacts have occurred in the community, um, and that has come in the form of text or phone calls or shared videos, so we know they're there. um, I will remind the public, allow officers to do their work, do not obstruct. Uh, the best thing you can do is to be the best possible witness should the facts that come before you are needed by any future, uh, investigation or judicial inquiry. All right. If officers are acting with warrant, they are within the law. And this is not the place or the time to challenge that. I want everyone safe. Interrupting law enforcement action is *** risk conduct. It may feel appropriate in the moment, but it could lead to outcomes neither party wished upon each other when they began the transaction. So I want to make that clear. I also respect the right to dissent, to protest, to express your misgivings or rejection of current government policy. If all of you decide to do that, our police department has demonstrated an exemplary history in in. Protecting That expression Of constitutional right and we will continue to do so. Before I came out here, someone came in and said, if we did *** protest, we would be safe. And I assured him that the Portland Police Department would do its job, as it always has, impartially, professionally. The other concern we had about ICE arriving, and I put it this way, as *** former member of law enforcement. What Mayor Shalene and I expect is that federal agencies and their agents will conduct themselves in *** professional manner, respect the rule of law. And treat our citizens without the use of provocation. Exercise the restraint. That's necessary. These are standards that are not alien to anyone who carries *** badge. It's the standard we expect of our municipal police officers, and I hope and pray it's *** standard that the director of ICE would exercise against their agents. So With that, I'll open it up for questions. Mayor. Yes, are you aware that there are *** number of businesses in town that have put signs in their windows, uh, saying that ICE is not welcome? You. Want to talk about it. I want, I, I wanna allow, uh, Councilor. fellows here to address that because one of the businesses is in his district. Introduce yourself. Full name, spelling. Uh, I'm West Pelletier, W E S P E L L E T I E R. I'm the city councilor in District 2, which is that way. Um, I want to be really clear, this is *** war of terror that's being waged on our city by the federal government, um. We've seen, um, people of all ages getting thrown on the ground and getting thrown into trucks. Um, and in response, people in Portland, business owners, um, Teachers, uh, college kids have formed *** network, um. To make sure that we have early warnings. And that we are able to get there in time to at the very least get *** name before someone disappears. Um, We have people delivering groceries to mothers that need diapers, but they're too afraid to leave because they know correctly that as soon as they leave, there's going to be 4 guys in the unmarked car outside their driveway that will throw them to the ground and take them, nobody really knows where. Um, While every single abduction that's happened. Is *** wound to Portland. Um, it's been very clear that Every single one has underlined just how important immigrants are to our community. They're the backbone of our economy, um. They are the kids that are getting on school buses. They are the families that go out to eat and, and make life what it is. And No one asked the federal government to come here. This is one of the safest cities in the country. But because of, uh, you know, an agenda of white nationalism and, um, might makes right. Uh, we now have *** war on our streets. So, you know, what I would ask, I don't expect much from Senator Collins, from the administration, um, but I'd ask that the Democrats who are supposed to have our backs, grow *** little bit of *** spine. And do what *** random mother in any of our neighborhoods is willing to do and take action to abolish ICE. Uh, thanks. I can also answer questions. Do you have any sense, Mayor, of how many arrests have taken place in the last couple of days in the greater Portland area? I don't. I mean, If it was just based on videos I received, it'd be less than 6. I know ICE has, uh, declared there's been 50 in Maine. So it's an open question. And are you getting any communication from ISDHS anyone in the federal government on this? No, I mean, but that's *** consequence. Uh, in the years preceding this council being seated, our predecessors passed an ordinance that limits, uh, the cooperation of the foreign police as it applies to the enforcement immigration statutes from the federal level, so. If we're not cooperating, I think it's reasonable to anticipate they're not calling. And we're not calling them either because we're clear about what our mission is, is to protect the overall public safety, and they have *** very discreet narrow responsibility to enforce immigration law. What have you heard from the crowd? What is happening? How aggressive are they? What is the worst? I, I, I think I've heard narratives, um, from the ground that suggest real anxiety and fear just with their presence. Councillor Ellie. I'll turn to Councilor Ali. He's the mayor pro tem, and, uh, he does engage many of our diverse communities in the city for his opinion. Uh, thank you, Mayor. I Come again. Uh my name is Pius, P I O U S and my last name is Ali. And uh uh what I would say is that uh people on the ground are organized. I think one of my colleagues have said that earlier, uh people are afraid, they are scared, people's anxiety has have gone up because they don't know what to expect. Imagine you are *** parent and you step out to put your kid in *** school bus. By the time, by the time you turn around, you are surrounded by uh uh uh ICE agents and they are ready to take you with them. Who is going to take your child when they come back from school? So, because we don't want that to happen in our community, there have been *** lot of community groups coming together. We have created different channels where anything that somebody need, whether it is food or if they want their kids to be put in the school bus on their behalf, there are people on the ground that are going to do that. And uh uh I also wanna add this. I think if the federal government is looking for anyone in this country, so far as the person engaged the system. The federal government knows how to get that person. Without intimidation. Without unleashing terror on our streets. And I would say that we are here and we are willing to support our community as much as we can within the boundaries of the laws. And we are not going to be intimidated. By what is happening on the streets. Thank you. The Somali community in Minnesota has been *** focus of the ice enforcement happening there. Is that also true and important? Well, I don't know. But based on uh photos that were published uh by ICE, it seems the case that it's people of color, not necessarily from Somalia, and I'll discuss that in *** moment. Any other questions? What happens if ICE doesn't comply with the rules like you said they. Did you respond? Obviously this is something that we saw in Minneapolis where they're withholding investigative materials. Well, you can't decide how you're going to cross the bridge till you get there. Right, I, I, I think that's important. I don't like to, to speculate on what's gonna happen. As *** lawyer and as lawyers would agree, *** cause of action has to be established by conduct and speaking of conduct, I think Minneapolis was characterized by *** notable massing of federal agents entering *** neighborhood and I think the narrative of invasion arose from that. The perspective What I'm hearing from and I think and I talked with mayors today in other parts of the state we're seeing very individualized activity by ICE, *** person here, *** neighborhood there, um, their conduct at least. As it's current in Maine seems to be focused, which would indicate to me, and this is the speculation, is that they're functioning on the basis of an actual court warrant. So therefore they've identified *** party they have an address, they know who they're looking for specifically as opposed to this random show me your papers kind of experience. So by doing so, I don't think we're gonna see groupings of agents just patrolling the neighborhood. I think we're gonna get individualized reports from families like I, I received one. Uh, from *** mother saying that her son was arrested at *** grocer, uh, as he came out of work, and I've heard *** rumor that *** hospital saw some of their staff removed, um, but it seems like it's more specific. If that's the case, it appears that ICE may have evolved the way in which they want to engage the community for purposes of enforcement. And I, and I appreciate the US attorney's comments that he was paying attention to the situation and, uh, wanted for peaceful transactions by all parties. So we'll see. At the end of the day, we'll see. That's why it's important to document with your witness in the future there may be. Individuals, attorneys, or judicial processes that will need your information. Anything else? Go ahead. Do you have any message for business owners who are not just posting signs, but you know, are very fearful about, you know, carrying on doing new businesses, any reassurances the city can provide that they will be safe and can continue to do commerce? Well, we want them to do commerce. I mean, one of the meetings I participated with, uh, Representatives from the immigrant community, immigrant businesses in the chamber was to set up *** communications channel. We provided them with resources so they'd be clear about their rights and what steps they could take to protect, um. Their employees But it's hard because it's individualized if they're coming for one specific person that's gonna have *** different outcome on the business as opposed to saying you appear to have hired *** number of individuals who may have come from another country we're gonna line them up outside and check their papers. I don't think we're there, to be fair. I think we're in the individualized piece and just to reinforce about the signs in the window. I mean, last I checked, that is the First Amendment. All right. It may not have been perfectly expressed. It may have not taken the tone or language that some could appreciate, but I think. I can't speak to the operation of the mind of the owner of that business, but I think her intent was to. Display her rejection of adverse ICE activity, especially at her place of business. So and when we did talk at the chamber, we also talked about business continuity, what happens if the person doesn't come back quickly from from the detention and what the uh business could do. So we have been talking to *** lot of people on this issue. Yes, what message do you have to the federal government and the president at this time? I don't know if I'm gonna communicate to the president. I, I'm gonna communicate to the US attorney. Because he's made, we're made. And I think he has sent *** message that he has *** similar expectation that we do about how the federal government. Will behave as they conduct their lawful duties. I think if the president is to receive *** message, let him receive it from our senators and our congresspersons. That's their responsibility. That's their role, and I hope that that would have more impact than the Portland City council alone because I think our position is quite clear. In terms of Information I, I sent out. Who they arrested, right? Did you all get that with some mug shots? All right, let me do some homework with you. I was not afflicted with the idea of becoming *** lawyer, but I spent 32 years in law enforcement. So I actually read this. And I went to the photos. The first individual. It says um Mr. Ali is *** criminal illegal alien from Sudan convicted for false imprisonment, aggravated assault, assault, obstructing justice. And the violation of protection order. I think that's meant to frighten you. I think that's meant to infer that this criminal person was free in our com on our community, but you missed the word convicted. He's been convicted. He's been through the process. If so, has he served *** sentence? Is he considered now *** free person as far as the criminal justice? System is concerned. And that's one of the elite arrests now he might be in violation of *** civil infraction under the immigration code. That's your job to find out the next one. Ambassador Burney, *** criminal illegal alien. From Ethiopia convicted for aggravated assault and cocaine possession. Like convicted, what's the actual termination of that case? What's its posture? Did he become illegal as *** consequence of the conviction or did he enter this country lawfully, as many have, and that's always lost in the narrative. Elmara Correa, *** criminal illegal alien from Angola, previously arrested. For endangering, endangering the welfare of *** child. Was she found not guilty? Or are we just going to be satisfied that she was arrested? This is *** problem for the 4th estate. We are not members of your estate. That's your work. And last but not least. Because it appears that the assistant director. was indicting communities. Danny Lopez-Cortez, *** criminal illegal alien from Guatemala, convicted. For OUI. Right? Those were her 5 top picks to show you the state of crime and justice in in Maine. Oh I. It If we're going to talk about this issue, let's talk about facts. If we're gonna provide guidance, let us be calm, let us be leaders. If ICE has an issue with criminal aliens, let them actually be criminals. Right? And we can come to terms. Bye. I don't know. You're the judge of that. With the I didn't plan on taking the podium this long. From California. Thank you. I remember first name, last name, um, April Fournier, *** P R I L F O U R N I E R. Um, I'm one of our city's at-large councilors, um, and I apologize for my casual state of dress as I was out today in the community doing observing like we've asked so many of our community members to do, um, because one of the things that I know as an indigenous person, Um, as I have *** lot of friends and relatives in the Minnesota and Minneapolis area. And so what they have seen is detention of our very own indigenous community members. And so when we were notified that we would have ICE operations here in Portland, one of the most important things to me was to be out in the. Community with our neighbors with our relatives um watching and observing and really trying to reinforce with everyone because this is not day to day business for us is to to observe to show up for your community um to make sure that everyone understands that really immigrants are what make Portland just such an incredible place to be. And what we're not only going to see the social impact and what we all feel when these operations are happening in our neighborhoods, in front of our schools, in front of our grocery stores, is we're also going to see an economic impact. These are now families that will have potentially the primary breadwinner in their household have, has been disappeared. So how are they going to make rent? So we have the potential for. Increase of evictions. We're seeing impacts to our schools for all of these members who are teachers, who are students who are working in the cafeteria or working, um, as bus drivers. If they're not available, our schools are now short-handed. We're seeing that, you know, with businesses around the city, if these people are being disappeared, there's also *** gap. And so these are just such critical members of our community. Um, if we saw that this immigration enforcement was consistent, was following the law, uh, with this administration, I don't think any of us would have the level of anxiety that we're having right now. And so, um, again, I apologize that I am *** little casual today, but it's because I believe if you're going to be of the community, you need to be out in the community, um, and having eyes on. And so, as, uh, Councillor Ali mentioned, there are networks that have been set up for communities to stay in communication with each other to make sure they're checking out. Up on each other, observing, recording so that we have this information to be able to provide back to any of the legal entities if we do see that operations are not being carried out as they're supposed to be according to law. Um, but I'm so proud here to stand with this council and with our mayor and with all of our city staff and our school staff, um, and our school administration to continue to keep Portland operating and being the place that we know that it is, despite what's happening right in this moment. Thank you. I'd also call Councilor Sarah McNevitch, who represents probably the most diverse district in the city. Thank you, Mayor. Uh, that's, uh, Sarah McNevitch, District one, S *** R *** H M I C H N I E W I C Z. Um, as the mayor said, this is the most diverse district in the city and the state. Um, we have *** large immigrant population that continues to grow and thrive and bring value and vitality and economic benefit and, um, and Life to the city. Um, it's our responsibility to stand up for the communities that make our city what it is. Um, we have *** tremendous opportunity here to look out for them, um, to stand up, to record, to monitor what's going on lawfully, legally, um, As my colleagues have alluded to, uh, it's, it's, there are legitimate reasons for immigration enforcement. Um, it's the methods that are being employed and the broadcast approach that is so objectionable to so many. Um, there's, there's no legitimate purpose that's being pursued that cannot be achieved through due process. And I think that's the sticking point for *** lot of us. Um, I would encourage everyone to pay attention to what's going on around you, to look out for your neighbors, to know your rights, to know your responsibilities, and to know your resources, to know where to turn, uh, when you want to either report something or to share information or to assist other people, whether they be, you know, walking to school or just looking to have groceries to survive day to day in their homes. Um, That's, that's our strongest asset in Portland is our sense of community and our sense of pride. And our sense of knowing what is right. And that's what this council stands for. That's what I stand for. That's what the mayor stands for. And I know that's what the vast majority of our citizens stand for and what we will continue to support and continue to act on no matter what comes forward in the coming days. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor. Last but not least. Councilor Phillips. Uh, thank you, Mr. Mayor. Regina Phillips, R E G I N *** P H I L L I P S I represent district three. You know, as I sit here with my colleagues, uh, there isn't anything new that I can say to you other than, um, with this, you know, I don't know if there's warrants out there or, you know, whatever. All I know is what I hear is, is that some folks, um, are just being detained just because, right? We're very similar to Minnesota. They're just being detained because they are. My concern is with the children that are being left behind. We have, we have families that are, people, um, men and women, uh, um, mothers and fathers that are literally being dragged away from their children is what I hear. And, You know, if you have *** child, um, that is either in the grocery store or at home with *** parent, they don't know how to use *** cell phone. They don't know how to get in touch with their other parent. They don't know how to get in touch with *** relative. And as we know, ICE is not coordinating with anybody. They're not coordinating with our police department. They're not coordinating with the Department of Health and Human Services to make sure these children are safe. um, and so we have to mobilize because there are kids out there that are literally being dragged away from their parents. And that's the most concerning to me is what is actually happening to those children with their parents are being taken away literally at the gas station or the grocery store or at schools because they just don't have the means. And the ability to reach out to their relatives and say, hey, I'm stuck. I'm here by myself. And then where do they go? Where do they go? Because we know our foster care system is completely and utterly is overwhelmed. And so that's the concerning thing if you have *** warrant. If you want to detain somebody, like the mayor says, there's probably not much we can do about that, but do it in *** manner where children are not left by themselves. That's just cruel. Thank you, Councilor Superintendent. Chair. No, no, both of you. Listen, um One part that can be left behind is When *** city is going through this type of journey. And you, you heard it at the beginning of the conversations with Councilor Phillips. It's just not about what's occurring to the adults. The kids are there and the kids suffer along with us or celebrate along with us or made anxious because they don't understand what adults are actually trying to do. So one of the first persons that called me the morning that we knew ICE was in the city was Superintendent Scola. So, we protect our constituents, they protect our families, and the most important thing that we all agree on, our kids. So I'd I'd like to defer the podium to the chair, Sarah Lentz, and, uh, I'll stand with the councilor. So if you have any questions that are geared to families in the schools, they're here to respond to that, Madam Chair. Thank you. I'm Sarah Lentz, uh, S *** R *** H. Last name L E N T Z, and I'm chair of the board here in Portland. Um, I told, uh, *** reporter this morning *** story about my own child, who, when I picked him up from school, said to me, first off, he said, today my teacher told me there was ice on the playground and we needed to be careful. And I thought that there were people there to get me and my friends. That level of worry and anxiety is what all of our children are carrying as they go into the classroom. And we know that learning doesn't happen when kids are hungry, when they are scared, and when they don't feel safe. And what is happening in our community right now is making our community not feel safe. And that is not OK. As so many counselors have said today, there are other ways to do this. There are other ways that don't impact our kids and their families in the ways that they are feeling impacted right now. And I just want to say thank you to all of the community members, the individuals, and the organizations that are literally working around the clock right now to make sure that our kids have food in their house, that they can get to work or to the bus stop. That they can be connected to legal services and other resources that they need because they are fearful of coming out of their house. These are the impacts that we're seeing on *** daily basis. Our attendance rates are way down. Kids are not coming to school and their families are holding in their houses. So that's where we are. And that's where we're going to stay and we're going to hold the line and do whatever we can as educators and community members to make sure that our schools are safe and predictable spaces for everyone that are there. Yeah, at this point, are you aware of any students, staff, or family members of students who've been detained by ICE in the last few days? I can confirm that there have been people detained, but that's as much as I'm going to share. Can you give us the number? How, how much is attendance now and uh how? What, what percentage of the of the student population is uh minorities or immigrants? Yeah, so I'm happy to give *** little bit of background and then I'll ask the superintendent to give, um, uh, specific numbers on attendance. But in the Portland Public schools, we have 53% or 52% students of color in our district. About *** third of our students are multilingual learners. Um, and we also have about 500 students who are currently housing insecure. Um, so those are just some of the statistics of our, of our students, uh, right now, but I'm happy to turn it over to the superintendent who can talk more about attendance. Uh, good afternoon. Ryan Scallon, R Y *** N S C *** L L O N. Um, attendance varies significantly, um, as the impact is not even across our school community. So as Chair Lentz just shared, we are about 52, 53%, uh, students of color. Um, and we see *** range of attendance impacts. Um, our overall attendance is down more than 5% points, but we have some schools where the attendance drop is closer to 15 to 20%, uh, down. And so there's ***, there's *** wide range of how it's been impacting. Are there any measures being taken to make remote learning available? Any plans in the works to have entire schools go remote if need be? So, we know from the research coming out of COVID, as well as what we see happening in schools, that the safest, best place for students to learn for social reasons, for physical reasons, for academic reasons are in person. So as much as possible, we are planning to maintain in-person learning. The last two days I've been in our schools and I've seen that they continue to make sure that it's *** safe, welcoming place for all of our students. And so as much as possible, we want that to be. It would also not be prudent if we weren't planning for the range of contingencies. And so leadership in our district, including our school leaders, uh, have engaged and have done some planning around the potential for, uh, an online piece, but at this point, our intent is to remain in person. So I haven't heard anything about this, but just want to confirm with you, have you had any, um, any confirmed sightings of ICE agents on or near Cortland public school campuses? So, we have not had any sightings or reports of agents, um, on our, uh, property around schools. Uh, obviously, there is *** lot of information going on around, um, ICE action, and obviously, we are *** small city and with schools throughout the city. And so there's nothing that is in the immediate vicinity, but certainly in the neighborhood. If there's nothing else, we can all say goodnight.

I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency,"" DeLauro said, while also stressing that the bill ""is more than just ICE.""
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said that it ""puts no meaningful constraints on the growing lawlessness of ICE, and increases funding for detention over the last appropriations bill passed in 2024.""
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of several Democrats expected to run for president in 2028, also spoke out against the bill, telling NBC News that ""it is a surrender to Trump's lawlessness.
Some critics of recent immigration actions have suggested that any Democrat who still supports funding ICE should be primaried.","As congressional negotiators on Tuesday released a proposed spending bill for the US Department of Homeland Security, with the January 30 funding deadline rapidly approaching, critics of President Donald Trump's deadly immigration operations renewed calls for Democrats to oppose any new money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""You can't count on Dem leadership to do much, but you can for sure trust these warriors for democracy to hustle like hell to pass a bipartisan deal to fully fund the Gestapo currently attacking our cities, rather than using this one moment of leverage to try to stop them. Bravo!"" quipped progressive organizer Aaron Regunberg on social media.

Since an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, congressional Democrats have faced mounting pressure to significantly rein in DHS and its agencies, including ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). While some progressive lawmakers have embraced such calls, neither Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) nor House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has shown serious interest in using the appropriations process to that end.

Both Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) tried to frame the DHS bill released on Tuesday as taking ""several steps in the right direction,"" in the words of DeLauro, who also acknowledged that ""it does not include broader reforms Democrats proposed.""

""I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE. I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency,"" DeLauro said, while also stressing that the bill ""is more than just ICE."" She specifically pointed to funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, and the US Coast Guard.

As a bill summary from Murray's office states, the legislation funds those and ""other critical programs Americans count on"" while cutting ""funding for CBP by $1.3 billion relative to fiscal year 2025, providing $18.3 billion in total.""

It also ""flat-funds ICE at $10 billion, preventing any growth to ICE's annual budget, and it cuts ICE's enforcement and removal budget,"" the document details. ""The bill provides $949 million (-15%) less in funding for ICE enforcement and removal operations than House Republicans' and $708 million (-11%) less than Senate Republicans’ proposed bills—and $114 million less than the fiscal year 2025 level.""

Taking aim at the DHS secretary, Murray said in a statement that ""what we have seen from Kristi Noem's Department of Homeland Security is frankly sick and un-American. ICE is out-of-control, terrorizing people, including American citizens, and actively making our communities less safe.""

Sometimes, when members of Congress can't strike a deal before a funding deadline, they'll pass a continuing resolution that provides short-term funding to prevent a federal government shutdown and keep up negotiations. However, Murray suggested in a Tuesday statement that a CR is not a viable option because of the $75 billion for ICE included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed last July.

""ICE must be reined in, and unfortunately, neither a CR nor a shutdown would do anything to restrain it, because, thanks to Republicans, ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap whether or not we pass a funding bill,"" Murray said. ""The suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality: Under a CR and in a shutdown, this administration can do everything they are already doing—but without any of the critical guardrails and constraints imposed by a full-year funding bill.""

Murray also nodded to Republican control of Congress that the November midterms, arguing that ""the hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need... ""If you believe that we should be putting more of our taxpayer dollars towards healthcare and that our immigration enforcement should be focused on actual criminals instead of tear-gassing American children, then we need to speak up again and again—and we must take our fight to the ballot box.""

Other Democrats in Congress swiftly rejected the proposal. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said that it ""puts no meaningful constraints on the growing lawlessness of ICE, and increases funding for detention over the last appropriations bill passed in 2024.""

""I understand Democrats in these negotiations had a hard job—no new budget for DHS is going to cure all the rampant illegality happening within the department. But this bill doesn't put CBP agents back at the border where they belong and doesn't put checks on ICE’s out-of-control arrest and enforcement operations,"" he explained. ""Democrats have no obligation to support a bill that not only funds the dystopian scenes we are seeing in Minneapolis but will allow DHS to replicate that playbook of brutality in cities all over this country.""

The leadership of the nearly 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus last week vowed to ""oppose all funding"" for US immigration enforcement in any upcoming appropriations bills without substantial reforms. CPC Chair Emerita Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) made her personal opposition to Tuesday's proposal clear, declaring that ""it simply does not meet the moment we face in this country with the lawlessness"" of ICE and CBP agents.

""We have seen ICE and DHS descending on cities across this country, racially profiling, and rounding up immigrants and US citizens alike—many of whom have committed no crimes,"" said Jayapal, an immigrant herself. ""We have watched in horror as they have dragged people out into the snow and as they have shot and killed US citizens. As they foment this terror and chaos on our streets, 37 people have died in ICE custody since Trump came back to office.""

""Meanwhile, across the country, over 70,000 people are being incarcerated in immigration jails run by private, for-profit prison contractors and being denied due process and bond hearings in Trump's mass detention effort that dozens of judges have said is not lawful,"" she stressed. ""All of this is dangerous—not just for immigrants but for every single American worried about the erosion of Constitutional rights.""

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of several Democrats expected to run for president in 2028, also spoke out against the bill, telling NBC News that ""it is a surrender to Trump's lawlessness. I will be a strong no and help lead the opposition to it.""

The progressive group Indivisible has urged voters across the country ""to light a fire under Democrats to demand they use their leverage on the DHS appropriations bill to rein in ICE and deny the Trump regime one penny more for its mass deportation machine.""

""While most Republicans continue to rubber-stamp Trump's atrocities, some are becoming bolder in criticizing ICE's lawlessness and pattern of shredding constitutional protections,"" notes the group's webpage on reining in ICE. ""The louder we are and the more we organize our communities to take action, the harder it will be for Republicans to continue backing Trump's terror campaign.""

""Democrats need to stop whining about the limits of minority power and start fighting as hard as their constituents are to stop this regime’s mounting atrocities,"" the Indivisible page adds. ""We're not accepting excuses, and we will hold every member of Congress accountable who chooses complicity and cowardice over courage.""

Some critics of recent immigration actions have suggested that any Democrat who still supports funding ICE should be primaried. Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch made that case Tuesday, writing that ""the lack of appetite for utterly dismantling the DHS regime—despite its culture of violence and disrespect for law-abiding refugees—reminds too many voters of the cowardice that branded the Dems as losers in the first place.""

""Dismantling the ICE regime needs to be the floor, not the ceiling"" he added, ""and any Democrat in Congress who doesn't get with the program can—and should—be replaced in the primaries to avoided another debacle with alienated or apathetic voters in November.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62907540&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417,N,,2026-01-21 18:58:42.987639

No one was struck by gunfire in the shooting, reported at about 7:30 a.m. in the 2400 block of 126th Street, but federal authorities said a Customs and Border Patrol officer was injured. Details about the injury were not immediately available.

The Los Aneles County sheriff's Department said federal agents were conducting an operation in the area when there was a brief pursuit that ended in a crash. Video from NewsChopper4 showed a BMW with front-end damage and what appeared to be deployed air bags.

Shots were fired by a federal agent as officers were attempting to detain the target of the operation, authorities said.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said DHS officers were conducting the targeted operation early Wednesday in nearby Compton to ""arrest a violent criminal illegal alien from El Salvador."" The agency said William Eduardo Moran Carballo was part of a human smuggling operation and has two prior arrests for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.

An immigration judge issued a final order of removal from the United States in 2019, the DHS said. NBC4 Investigates is attempting to obtain more information about Carballo's criminal record.

""In a dangerous attempt to evade arrest, this criminal illegal alien weaponized his vehicle and rammed law enforcement,"" the DHS spokesperson said. ""Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots. The criminal illegal alien was not hit and attempted to flee on foot. He was successfully apprehended by law enforcement. The illegal alien was not injured, but a CBP officer was injured.

""These dangerous attempts to evade arrest have surged since sanctuary politicians, including Governor Newsom, have encouraged illegal aliens to evade arrest and provided guides advising illegal aliens how to recognize ICE, block entry, and defy arrest. Our officers are now facing a 3,200% increase in vehicle attacks. This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming.""

The move by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered a win to the Trump administration, which had vowed to appeal the lower court's order that restrained federal agents.

In her order last week, U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez said agents appeared to have engaged in ""chilling conduct"" and ""intimidation tactics."" She noted actions such as the ""drawing and pointing of weapons,"" the ""use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions"" and ""actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, speaking on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" called Menendez's order ""a little ridiculous"" and said it didn't ""change anything for how we're operating on the ground.""

The appeals court decision comes as legal battles escalate between the Trump administration and local and state officials in Minnesota following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross.

The Department of Justice on Jan. 20 delivered subpoenas to the offices of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, among other Democratic officials, related to allegations that they impeded the work of federal agents. Walz and Frey called the move ""a partisan distraction"" and effort to ""intimidate local leaders.""

Meanwhile, Menendez is weighing whether to halt immigration operations after the state, Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating state rights.

JD Vance to visit Minneapolis amid protests, ICE raids

Vice President JD Vance will visit Minneapolis on Thursday, Jan. 22, a person familiar with his plans said Jan. 20.

Vance will hold a roundtable with community members and deliver remarks in the city where the Trump administration is fighting to continue its immigration operations.

Vance as been among the most ardent supporters of the agent who shot and killed Renee Good. He called the shooting ""a tragedy of her own making"" and alleged she was part of vast left-wing extremist network.

Statewide 'ICE out of Minneapolis' protest planned for Friday

Organizers in Minneapolis asked people to not go to work, skip school and refrain from buying anything as part of a protest against the ongoing immigration operations in the state.

""Faith leaders, business owners, workers, and concerned Minnesotans have called for a statewide day of public mourning and pause through 'No Work, No School and No Shopping' and a massive, peaceful march in downtown Minneapolis that afternoon,"" said a news release about the demonstration scheduled for Friday, Jan. 23.

In recent weeks, schools across the state have held walk-outs as protesters on the street have clashed with federal agents and recorded immigration enforcement operations.

Off-duty cops targeted by immigration agents in Minnesota: officials

Immigration agents have stopped off-duty officers in Minnesota ""solely because of the color of their skin,"" a group of local police chiefs alleged on Jan. 21.

Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley described an incident in which ICE agents blocked in an off-duty officer and demanded proof of citizenship. Bruley said agents knocked the officer's phone out of her hand when she tried to record the interaction and that the federal agents ""had their guns drawn.""

""I wish I could tell you this was an isolated incident,"" Bruley said, flanked by other heads of local law enforcement agencies. ""If it is happening to our officers, it pains me to think of how many of our community members are falling victim to this every day. It has to stop.""

In a statement to USA TODAY, the Department of Homeland Security said, ""DHS is able to find no record of ICE or Border Patrol stopping and questioning a police officer. Without a name, we cannot verify these claims. We will continue to look into these claims.""

Feds investigate protest at St. Paul church

The Department of Justice opened a probe into a protest that interrupted a Sunday service at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota.

A group of protestors entered Cities Church on Jan. 18, alleging that Pastor David Easterwood serves as the ICE St. Paul Field Office acting director. Videos show dozens of protesters changing ""Renee Good,"" and ""don't shoot,"" as some verbally confronting churchgoers.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the DOJ is investigating the protest as a potential violation of the FACE Act, a federal law that prohibits the use of force, threats or physical obstruction to block people from reproductive health care or access to religious worship under the First Amendment's right of religious freedom.

St. Paul Police Department Public Information Officer Nikki Muehlhausen told USA TODAY the department is actively investigating the protest as disorderly conduct. In a statement, Walz's office said the governor ""in no way supports interrupting a place of worship.""

What do we know so far about DOJ subpoenas

The subpoenas delivered by the FBI on Jan. 20 seek records and testimony related to an investigation into Democratic officials accused of impeding federal law enforcement, officials said.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the subpoenas – sent to Walz, Frey and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison – will help build a case against the officials.

""When you have subpoenas out, it is not rocket science. Investigations are done by acquiring records, investigations are then furthered by putting witnesses in the grand jury and making a presentment for a case with our partners at the Department of Justice,"" Kash said in an interview on Fox News' ""Hannity.""

Those subpoenaed all criticized the investigation, calling it political theater. Ellison noted on X that the subpoenas came within days of him suing the Trump administration for the federal intervention in Minnesota.

""Trump is weaponizing the justice system against any leader who dares to stand up to him,"" Ellison said.

State and local officials are opposed to Trump's mass deportations.","Vice President Vance is heading to Minnesota on Thursday, and he's not planning any peace offerings to Twin Cities officials and protesters opposed to the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.

Why it matters: Vance's planned events and speech underscore how the administration isn't backing down from its controversial raids and stops that resulted in the fatal shooting of protester Renee Good and damaged President Trump's poll numbers.

""JD took Minnesota on as an issue where he's going to lead. He wants a strong response,"" an adviser said. ""He doesn't want to back down. Neither does the president.""

Zoom in: Vance plans to hold a roundtable with community leaders, give an exclusive interview to the conservative outlet Newsmax and then conduct a news conference where he'll be flanked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Vance ""will point out how Minneapolis' sanctuary city policies have degraded public safety and endangered ICE officers. He will also celebrate the essential work ICE agents have done to take dangerous, criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,"" a White House official said.

Vance also is expected to emphasize the creation of a new Justice Department assistant attorney general position to oversee prosecuting large-scale fraud and abuse of taxpayer-funded programs.

Zoom out: The ostensible theme of Vance's visit is to emphasize the administration's ""unwavering support"" for ICE, but Trump advisers inside and outside the White House hope to continue shifting focus away from the unpopular enforcement actions and more toward prosecuting fraud.

For six years, the Minneapolis and St. Paul have been gripped by sprawling fraud cases, many surrounding the Somalian community.

Federal prosecutors and nonpartisan watchdogs warned for years that ""inadequate"" state oversight left several programs vulnerable to ""industrial scale"" waste and abuse.

After recent reports about fraud in his state, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz decided not to seek reelection.

Meanwhile, a grand jury investigating whether state officials have unlawfully interfered with ICE sent subpoenas Tuesday to the offices of Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties.

DOJ is also investigating the anti-ICE protestors who stormed a church while it was in service over the weekend.

DOJ blocked local police from investigating the ICE agent who shot Good but is investigating her widow, which prompted the protest resignations of six federal prosecutors who'd been handling the fraud cases.

Minnesota is ground zero for aggressive ICE law enforcement, replete with masked agents stopping people, asking for proof of citizenship and raiding homes.

""The mayor has been pursuing all channels with the goal of reducing tensions and violence in his community,"" a spokesman for Frey said.

Behind the scenes: Despite the escalations publicly, Trump's team has been in private communication with officials in Walz's government and major state-based businesses.

On Jan. 8, the day after Good was killed, Vance held a White House press briefing, defended the shooting as justified, tried to shame the news media for its coverage, announced a task force to investigate Somalian immigrant fraud and called on Walz to resign.

Vance and Walz have had a hostile relationship since 2024: They faced off at the vice presidential debate in 2024, when Walz was then-Vice President Harris' running mate.

Friction point: So far, the two sides can't find common ground because of their differences on immigration enforcement.

Trump administration officials want local police to help accompany them on immigration raids, which the federal government says are targeted.

State and local officials are opposed to Trump's mass deportations. They've decried ICE's tactics since the surge, pointing to reports of racial profiling and lawful residents being detained by federal agents.

Many local jurisdictions in the Twin Cities have policies prohibiting law enforcement from cooperating with ICE, but Walz's Department of Corrections says it notifies the agency of noncitizens in its custody and coordinates with ICE on their release.

An attorney representing the Minnesota Sheriffs' Association told the Star Tribune that limited resources and the threat of lawsuits add practical barriers for local law enforcement who might otherwise cooperate with ICE.",https://images.axios.com/fL4LenBratUOKVNp1UkkztKMcHo=/0x0:3604x2027/1366x768/2026/01/21/1769022976108.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 17:58:31.793715

“Wake up. Pay attention to what’s happening before it’s too late,” one man at the protest said.

ICE officials told NBC News in November that the warehouses would ""increase efficiency” in deportations and described them as “mega detention centers.”

Among protesters holding up signs and drivers honking in support, Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. April McClain Delaney joined.

When asked if officials knew any details about the plans for the warehouse, Van Hollen said they don't know anything yet.

""We’re asking ICE for answers,"" Van Hollen said. ""In fact, just today, Senator Alsobrooks and Congresswoman Delaney and I sent the Secretary of Homeland Security a letter asking her about what their plans are [and] what are they planning here?""

With the Trump administration unwilling to do so itself, the question remains whether states can hold immigration agents criminally or civilly accountable.
Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration quickly sued Illinois—and it remains unclear whether such laws violate the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.
Instead of responding to public concern, the Trump administration is closing ranks and escalating.
By continuing to weaponize crime and immigration, Trump is betting that fanning the flames of a culture war will protect him in the long run.","On January 7 in Minneapolis, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross fired his gun four times into Renee Nicole Good’s car, killing the 37-year-old mother and United States citizen after she stopped to support her immigrant neighbors—who, since early December, have been in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s extreme deportation agenda. As with the murder of George Floyd, also in Minneapolis, video evidence has fueled nationwide outrage over Good’s killing, with more than eight in 10 U.S. voters reportedly having seen the footage.

The administration has thrown its full weight behind ICE, with Trump calling Good “very violent” and “very radical” and Vice President J.D. Vance calling her “brainwashed and a victim of left-wing ideology.” However, a majority of people in the United States disagree—and increasingly disapprove of Trump’s approach to immigration. In a poll released a week after Good’s killing, 53 percent think the shooting was not justified, and only 35 percent said it was.

In just its first year, the second Trump administration has provoked numerous explosive crises. It remains to be seen whether this tragedy will be more tinder for the pile—or the spark that ignites it all.

The latest tragedy in ICE’s long history of violence is speeding up crises already in motion.

Over the past year, ICE’s enforcement operations have been given the political green light to operate with no accountability. Since Trump returned to office, immigration agents have opened fire at least 17 times, killing four people and injuring another eight—though clear data is hard to come by. Video evidence from another shooting in Minneapolis, of Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, also disputes ICE’s narrative of violent resistance.

For those in ICE custody, 2025 was the deadliest year in more than two decades, with 32 reported deaths—followed by at least four so far in just the first few weeks of 2026—and widespread allegations of torture. The recent death of Geraldo Lunas Campos at a Texas detention facility may be ruled a homicide, as a fellow detainee witnessed guards choking him. By repeatedly lying about these incidents, the administration’s already-minimal credibility continues to plummet—even among its own agents.

In response to ICE’s invasion, mass protests have erupted in Minneapolis and across the country, with a predictably violent reaction from federal agents. There were more than 1,000 events recently as part of the ICE Out For Good Weekend of Action. In response, federal agents—with Trump’s rubber stamp—have battered protesters and community monitoring groups, shooting less-lethal rounds at point-blank range, dragging a woman out of her car, and deploying tear gas from convoys (hospitalizing at least one infant). Last Friday, a district court judge ruled that federal agents in Operation Metro Surge may not use pepper spray or nonlethal projectiles against peaceful protesters, or stop vehicles without cause—a decision the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has appealed. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has placed the state’s National Guard on standby “to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies,” according to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

For his part, Trump once again threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act. He quickly walked it back but added, “If I needed it, I’d use it.” To bolster the threat, the Pentagon has made 1,500 U.S. Army troops ready for possible deployment to Minnesota. The 1807 law grants presidents broad authority to deploy federal troops for law enforcement purposes. Trump made the same threat during the 2020 protests after George Floyd’s murder and last year in response to protests against aggressive immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago. The Supreme Court’s recent decision limiting Trump’s ability to send the National Guard to Chicago may have also pushed Trump toward the Insurrection Act as a workaround to the Posse Comitatus Act, another law from the 1800s that generally prohibits the military from performing civilian law enforcement. Experts have been skeptical about the constitutionality of such deployments, but legal challenges take time; once boots are on the ground, the damage may already be done.

Channeling outrage and growing demands for accountability, states and localities (and people in the streets) are taking action to rein in ICE.

ICE was created after September 11, 2001, with few mechanisms for accountability, which have only been further weakened in the past year. By the end of 2025, the average number of people in immigration detention daily was 78 percent higher than the year prior. The Trump administration has systematically dismantled the federal watchdog responsible for civil rights violations at DHS and imposed new restrictions on congressional inspections of immigration detention facilities. Meanwhile, Stephen Miller, the key architect of Trump’s cruel immigration agenda, assured ICE agents back in October—including questionable recruits with insufficient training—that they have “federal immunity.”

As the January 30 federal budget deadline looms and Congress prepares to fund DHS beyond its $170 billion windfall from last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, some congressional Democrats are pushing for more accountability for ICE. Funding for DHS was absent from the House’s most recent spending package, with Democrats pushing for guardrails. Democrats from across the political spectrum are threatening to withhold votes unless the funding package includes basic accountability measures, such as mandatory identification, limiting Customs and Border Protection’s enforcement actions to the border, and mandating judicial warrants to arrest suspects in immigration cases. Congressional Democrats have also introduced a litany of bills to support ICE accountability, like the Federal Law Enforcement Standards and Accountability (FLESA) Act, the Qualified Immunity Abolition Act of 2026, the PUBLIC SAFETY Act, the Stop Body Camera Paywalls Act, and the Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act—as well as articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. While these bills face long odds, they reflect mounting pressure on lawmakers to respond to public outrage over ICE violence.

A small number of Republicans have also signaled openness to minor restrictions, but ones largely focused on optics rather than structural reform. Party leadership remains committed to expanding ICE’s operational freedom, not constraining it. Failing to attach conditions to DHS funding would signal that many lawmakers are willing to legitimize ICE’s escalating use of force despite yet another episode of avoidable ICE violence.

With meaningful oversight—let alone accountability—from Congress unlikely, states and localities are moving to rein in ICE abuses. Along with the Minneapolis protesters’ lawsuit, Minnesota (along with the Twin Cities) and Illinois both filed federal lawsuits seeking injunctions to stop enforcement operations. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County moved to become the latest to institute “ICE-free zones,” which prohibit ICE from operating on county-owned property. New Jersey lawmakers also passed a package of bills to expand protections for immigrants, but outgoing Governor Phil Murphy vetoed it on his last day in office.

With the Trump administration unwilling to do so itself, the question remains whether states can hold immigration agents criminally or civilly accountable. Criminal prosecution faces steep barriers: state and local officials need access to evidence, yet the Department of Justice (DOJ) is both refusing to investigate Good’s killing and also actively blocking access to evidence—forcing Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty to plead for information from the public. Even if Ross is prosecuted, significant legal and evidentiary hurdles will likely constrain charging decisions and the likelihood of conviction.

Civil liability is also available but limited. Good’s family will likely pursue money damages from the federal government through the Federal Tort Claims Act or from Ross as an individual through a so-called “Bivens suit.” But both paths are narrow; federal tort claims are time-consuming and replete with procedural requirements, and the Supreme Court has made it harder in recent years to file Bivens suits against federal agents who violate the Constitution.

In December, Illinois passed a law allowing residents to sue immigration agents in state court for state or federal civil rights violations. Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration quickly sued Illinois—and it remains unclear whether such laws violate the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause. Regardless, states like New York and California are also moving ahead with such laws, with New York Governor Kathy Hochul prominently endorsing the legislation in her most recent State of the State address. And in the meantime, states like California, Illinois, and New York are continuing efforts to document ICE misconduct, whether for transparency alone, future litigation, or eventual prosecution.

Instead of responding to public concern, the Trump administration is closing ranks and escalating.

In a press conference hours after Jonathan Ross killed Renee Good, Secretary Noem suggested that Good was at fault for her own death, claiming she was engaged in “domestic terrorism.” While Trump has finally softened his tone, calling her death a tragedy, he initially said that Good was at fault for trying to “run over” the officer. A week later, the White House issued a press release claiming that mass deportations are responsible for lower housing costs, higher wages, and less crime. The administration’s staunch refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing by Ross or that ICE’s tactics have grown too extreme is fueling outrage from all corners—even from Tucker Carlson, who faulted Republicans for not acknowledging the tragedy of Good’s death. Trump could have easily lowered tensions by calling the killing an isolated incident and allowing a formal independent investigation to proceed. Instead, the administration is doubling down despite bleeding public support.

The administration is defending its immigration officers in two distinct ways. First, it insists that Ross was acting in self-defense. To prop up that narrative, officials have pushed out a series of stories claiming that Ross was injured during the incident, that he was dragged by a car in June, and that he is a war veteran with extensive military training. At the same time, the administration is also attempting to smear Good as a “domestic terrorist.” The DOJ abandoned its investigation of Ross to instead investigate Good’s wife over her work with a local ICE Watch group, leading six veteran DOJ prosecutors to quit in protest. Second, the administration is asserting that ICE officers have “absolute immunity”—with DHS itself tweeting at immigration officers and urging “decisive action should you be faced with an imminent threat.”

The president is also knowingly escalating the situation. Rather than attempt to calm tensions, Trump sent another 1,000 immigration officers to Minnesota, bringing the total to roughly 3,000. The administration is also ramping up a broader fight with the state, attempting to freeze funding for food stamps and sanctuary cities broadly. The DOJ is also reportedly investigating Minnesota officials, including Attorney General Keith Ellison, Governor Walz, and Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey. Over all of this looms Trump’s threat to invoke the Insurrection Act and the 1,500 Army troops on standby.

By continuing to weaponize crime and immigration, Trump is betting that fanning the flames of a culture war will protect him in the long run. In the wake of Good’s killing, his approval rating on immigration hit a new low of 38 percent. The administration knows that the polling around ICE and immigration looks bad, but it may be taking solace in the fact that 77 percent of Republicans say Good’s shooting was justified. While igniting fear about crime and disorder is an age-old playbook that Trump has exploited for decades, early signs suggest that it may not work this time. Trump and Republicans will need independent voters in the midterms, but 59 percent believe the shooting was unjustified.

Whether Congress, the courts, or the states are willing to act on that public sentiment remains uncertain. But ICE’s tactics are eroding what little is left of the agency’s political and moral legitimacy. If the administration will not back down, their fates may be tied together.",https://vera-institute.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/images/Special-Reports/inside-the-massive-jail-that-doubles-as-chicagos-largest-mental-health-facility/additional_reading/Renee_Good_Blog_XGraphic_1200x630.png?w=1200&h=630&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1769023888&s=e6ccad140acf6471fcadb7d235312bb3,N,,2026-01-21 15:02:11.621322

Sean Duffy announced the agency would withhold federal transportation funding from state and local governments that did not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
By attempting to condition transportation spending on cooperation with immigration enforcement, the USDOT was effectively attempting to rewrite federal laws passed by Congress, the states argued.
“It’s too bad that it took legal action to get the administration to simply comply with the law.” Milwaukee County uses federal transportation funds to maintain roadways and bridges.

In April, USDOT Sec. Sean Duffy announced the agency would withhold federal transportation funding from state and local governments that did not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

In May, Wisconsin and 21 other states sued the federal agency, arguing transportation and immigration enforcement are unrelated and the Trump administration was attempting to “unlawfully usurp” congressional authority over spending. By attempting to condition transportation spending on cooperation with immigration enforcement, the USDOT was effectively attempting to rewrite federal laws passed by Congress, the states argued.

Congress provides more than $100 billion annually for state and local governments to maintain transportation infrastructure. Of that, approximately $1 billion goes to Wisconsin each year.

In November, U.S. District Judge John McConnell ruled that the USDOT was violating the Constitution, writing, “Defendants have blatantly overstepped their statutory authority, violated the APA, and transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions. The Constitution demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior.”

Initially, the USDOT appealed the ruling, but last week the agency dropped its appeal, allowing McConnell’s order to stand. It is now barred by the court order from withholding funding from state or local governments for failing to cooperate with immigration enforcement.

“I’m glad that the Trump administration is seeking to put an end to its defense of this lawlessness,” Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement. “It’s too bad that it took legal action to get the administration to simply comply with the law.”

Milwaukee County uses federal transportation funds to maintain roadways and bridges. The Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) similarly uses federal transportation grants to fund new bus purchases and maintain transit infrastructure. The county was recently awarded a $25 million grant by USDOT for road safety projects.

“It’s good news that the Trump administration will not be able to restrict local control through unnecessary conditions on USDOT grants. Milwaukee County has always followed all requirements on how state and federal grant funding is allocated and used throughout the community,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a statement to Urban Milwaukee. “My administration plans to continue this track record as we keep working to invest in public transit, safer streets, and transportation infrastructure and services to enhance the quality of life for working families across Milwaukee County.”

DEI programs also targeted

When Duffy and the USDOT tried to tie immigration to transportation funding, the agency also included language threatening to pull funding from governments with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs that violate federal anti-discrimination laws. In the April letter transportation agencies, Duffy said their personnel policies cannot “discriminate based on prohibited categories.”",https://urbanmilwaukee.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0613-1024x768.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 17:58:40.015873

Honduras has emerged as a key transit country for migrants, with thousands of people entering irregularly from Nicaragua on their journey northward.

A United Methodist clinic in Danlí embodies a faith-based response, offering medical care, dignity and accompaniment to migrants in extreme vulnerability.

The clinic is housed in a government-run migrant assistance center.

A Haitian mother of three said the health clinic and migration center have given her family “peace and hope” on their journey to find a better life.

For Marie Joseph and her family, a migrant assistance center and United Methodist clinic in Danlí provided a respite on a long and arduous journey.

“We arrived very tired,” said Joseph, 32, who asked that her real name not be used in this story. “We were scared and didn’t know what to expect. But here we were welcomed warmly. We were given food and a safe place to stay with my three children for two days.

“They also cared for us at the UMCOR clinic, where we were examined and helped with what we needed,” she said, referring to the health clinic, which is supported by the United Methodist Committee on Relief and the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries’ Global Health program. “It was a great relief because we were so exhausted from the journey.”

Joseph is making her way to the United States with her three children, fleeing the violence in her home country of Haiti, where gangs control large areas. She wants to reunite with family members in the U.S.

“I feel very grateful to everyone here at the clinic and the center,” she said. “When you flee violence and poverty, you don’t know whom to turn to for help. Here we were treated with respect and care, and that gives us hope to continue our journey. My children were able to rest and recover.”

Housed at the government-run Irregular Migrant Assistance Center or CAMI (Centro de Atención al Migrante Irregulares) in Danlí, the church-supported clinic provides free health care to migrants exhausted after crossing Nicaragua or eastern Honduras. The clinic was established by the United Methodist Mission in Honduras, led by Global Ministries and Bishop Rubén Saenz, the mission’s episcopal leader.

CAMI has become a connection point for those continuing on to Guatemala and Mexico. The health clinic offers rapid medical assessments, general care, basic medications and referrals to hospitals when needed, helping migrants continue their journey.

The center’s staff provide guidance to migrants on routes to follow and appropriate behaviors to avoid legal problems upon arriving in Honduras. Migrants are also granted a five-day temporary permit to complete their paperwork before continuing on to Guatemala.

Care guided by Social Principles

Wilmer Vasquez, coordinator of the United Methodist clinic, explained the procedures they have implemented, which allow each patient to receive an individual examination that includes diagnosis, treatment and a physical assessment.

“In situations requiring more specialized care, the patient is removed from the line and treated more thoroughly in the consultation room,” Vasquez said. “This ensures that the mass-care process, which requires a certain speed, is not disrupted by the detailed attention needed for more complex cases.”

Dr. Aurora Martínez, a member of the professional team at the clinic, described the most common ailments they encounter. “We frequently see cases of gastroenteritis, dehydration and various viral infections, which are typical given the hygiene and environmental conditions migrants face along their journey to reach this point.

“Additionally, when local hospitals are overwhelmed, we are called upon to screen patients here, helping prevent overloading the ambulatory population,” she added. This reflects the level of trust the United Methodist clinic has earned with regional health authorities and has brought recognition and gratitude from those who oversee CAMI.

One of the most effective procedures implemented by the United Methodist clinic has been the distribution of medical kits to the groups that regularly arrive at the center. Dr. Silvia Reyes coordinates this process and explained to UM News how the service works.

“The kits we distribute to migrant families consist of a medical package that includes pain relievers, fever medication, antihistamines and anti-inflammatories,” Reyes said. “They also include medicines for vomiting, nausea and stomach discomfort, which are the most common issues migrant families face on their journey.”

Vasquez emphasized that the work is guided by The United Methodist Church’s Social Principles relating to human dignity, care for migrants and health. “Our service philosophy is reflected in maintaining a steady, safe flow of patients without compromising the quality of care,” he said.

For Vasquez, these Social Principles form the theological and ethical foundation of the work carried out by the United Methodist clinic in Danlí. By affirming that every person, regardless of migration status, possesses sacred value and the right to dignified medical care, these principles support a ministry that integrates faith and justice.

New migration corridors

Although some recent data shows a decline in the immigrant population in the United States, migration has not stopped. The Pew Research Center reported that after reaching a record 53.3 million immigrants in January 2025, the number fell to 51.9 million in June — the first decline since the 1960s. Despite this decrease, migration flows to the United States remain steady and diverse. In recent years, regional transit dynamics have shifted, and new routes have emerged as significant migration corridors across the continent.

Official figures from Honduras’ National Institute of Migration indicate that 369,258 irregular — or unauthorized — migrants entered the country in 2024, with 97.2% crossing through unofficial points along the border with Nicaragua. These figures confirm that the vast majority of migrants used Nicaraguan territory as a transit route in their attempt to journey north.

“The center serves four to six buses daily full of migrants, the majority of whom are Haitians and Cubans, with occasional arrivals from Pakistan, China, Ecuador and Uzbekistan,” said Gustavo Ferrufino, officer at the Migrant Rights Office of the National Institute of Immigration in Honduras.

Ferrufino notes that in early 2025, migrant arrivals had decreased significantly due to changes in U.S. immigration policy under the new administration and the closure of the U.S.-Mexico border. However, transit has been increasing since the second half of last year.

“It may be related to changes in U.S. policy that have temporarily opened pathways or provided legalization for migrants,” he said. “We’ve heard from people passing through that they receive information from missions and diplomatic agencies in their home countries about new admission procedures, while others simply follow new entry routes at the border. They just try and stay in Mexico while waiting for their opportunity to cross.”

Leaving violence for a new life

At the migrant assistance center in Honduras, Marie Joseph shared her journey toward the United States. She lived five years in the Dominican Republic and is now fleeing both the violence in Haiti and the economic and social hardships she faced in the Dominican Republic.

“I am from Haiti. Life there was very difficult; there was violence, and we couldn’t live in peace,” she said. “That’s why we went to the Dominican Republic. I lived there for five years and learned Spanish so I could communicate, but the situation was also hard: unstable work, housing problems, and I felt I couldn’t give my children a secure future. So we decided to try to reach the United States to be with some of our family already living there.”

She described her journey as a long and dangerous one.

“We didn’t come directly from Haiti,” she said. “Many migrants like us first live in or pass through other Latin American countries. In our case, we went from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then began our journey north. Some migrants travel from countries like Brazil, Chile or Mexico; others take charter flights to countries such as Nicaragua, which has more flexible requirements, and from there cross Central America toward Mexico and the United States.”

Joseph and her family arrived in Honduras from Nicaragua. For them, Honduras is not a final destination but a transit country, where they seek support and rest before continuing their journey.

According to staff members at CAMI and the clinic, many migrants become stranded in Honduras without resources or documentation and rely on the humanitarian support provided.

“I want to sincerely thank everyone who helps us,” Joseph told some of the center’s staff. “Violence and poverty shouldn’t prevent children from having a future. Thanks to you, we have been able to continue our journey with a little more peace and hope.

“It’s a difficult path, but knowing there are places that support migrants gives us strength. I want my children to have a safer life and opportunities to study and grow without fear.

“I am afraid, but I also have hope. I hope to find work, a safe place to live, and that my children can continue their education,” she said. “We want to leave behind violence and insecurity and start a new life.”

Together, the report and briefing argue that executive actions and administrative measures have pushed the country onto a dangerous trajectory, consistent with the authoritarian patterns Amnesty has documented globally for decades.

Those concerns have been sharpened by the January 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good, a queer 37-year-old Minneapolis mother and U.S. citizen who was fatally shot during a federal immigration enforcement operation.

Transgender people targeted early in Trump’s second term

Human rights leaders said the administration’s authoritarian trajectory has extended well beyond immigration enforcement to include the early and deliberate targeting of transgender people, an approach they described as both symbolic and strategic.

Jessica Stern, co-founder and co-president of the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice, said attacks on transgender people have not been incidental but central to the administration’s political strategy from the outset. Stern previously served as the Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons under President Joe Biden.

“The weaponization of trans people’s lives has been baked into the very fabric of his political identity,” Stern said, pointing to Trump’s campaign spending aimed at stoking fear around transgender rights and his decision to sign an executive order targeting what his administration calls “gender ideology” on his first day back in office.

Trump issued an executive order on his first day back in office establishing that the U.S. government does not recognize transgender or nonbinary identities, and instead recognizes people only by their sex assigned at birth.

Stern said that timing mattered. In authoritarian systems, governments often begin by singling out a small, stigmatized population to test public tolerance for rights rollbacks and to normalize the idea that certain people can be excluded from legal and social protections.

By focusing so heavily on transgender people, particularly trans youth, service members, and those seeking medical care, the administration sent what Stern described as a broader signal: that communities already vulnerable to discrimination could be treated as political adversaries rather than rights-bearing individuals, even as institutions designed to protect civil rights are weakened or dismantled.

Amnesty: U.S. mirrors global patterns of democratic backsliding

Amanda Klasing, an Amnesty International USA official who moderated the briefing, said the scope and speed of the administration’s actions set Trump’s second term apart.

“We can say categorically that President Trump’s second term has been a human rights disaster at home and abroad,” Klasing said, citing executive actions that have shrunk civic space and undermined legal safeguards.

Amnesty’s report documents attacks on press freedom, punishment of protest and dissent, intimidation of journalists and lawyers, coercion of universities and civil society, erosion of due process, and the increasing militarization of domestic law enforcement.

The organization warned that the United States now fits a familiar global pattern: governments consolidate power, discredit critics, punish protests, and weaken courts and oversight bodies until accountability becomes difficult to restore.

Immigration enforcement and civil liberties under strain

Immigration enforcement has emerged as a central proving ground for the tactics Amnesty warns are reshaping U.S. civil liberties.

At the press conference, Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch, described the expansion of third-country deportations and aggressive enforcement actions as among the administration’s most severe abuses.

“In 2025, the United States is conducting enforced disappearances,” Widdersheim said, citing the transfer of migrants to detention facilities abroad despite documented risks of torture.

Andry Hernandez Romero, a gay Venezuelan asylum seeker who worked as a makeup artist and hair stylist, was sent along with more than 200 other men to CECOT, a torture prison in El Salvador, because the Trump administration declared him to be a member of a gang. Romero has no criminal record and denies being part of any gang. He was eventually freed from confinement and described physical and sexual abuse in an interview with The Advocate last fall.

Uzra Zeya, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said the immigration crackdown has driven record detention levels and deaths in custody while spilling into broader assaults on constitutional protections.

“The authoritarian playbook that I spent decades fighting overseas has come home to our shores,” Zeya said.

Good’s killing has intensified scrutiny of those tactics. She was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross during a federal enforcement operation in Minneapolis. Federal officials described the shooting as self-defense, while witnesses, family members, and civil rights advocates have disputed that account and called for greater transparency and accountability. Video of the shooting, from several angles, calls into question the government’s assertions that Good targeted the agent. Protests following her death have linked the incident to concerns about the militarization of immigration enforcement and its spillover into routine civilian life.

“We have seen where this road leads when dissent is punished, oversight is dismantled, and people can be disappeared or expelled beyond the reach of the law,” Amnesty wrote in its report. “But we also know something else: the slide is not inevitable. There is still time to stop it.”

Smiley told reporters gathered at City Hall that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in other blue cities made the order necessary to protect the community. He said he was unaware of any ICE actions on city property since the second Trump administration took over one year ago. However, immigration officers entered the state-owned Garrahy Judicial Complex on Dorrance Street on Jan. 15, bypassing security and prompting outrage from state leaders.

“We’re taking clear action to affirm Providence’s values,” Smiley said before signing his first executive order of the year with a black pen. “We do not want — and will not allow — Providence’s public property to be used to execute what we see as unlawful immigration enforcement.”

Smiley held up a copy of a red sign city employees will post noting the use of city property as a federal immigration enforcement staging site is now prohibited. In the event ICE officers are seen on any city-owned property without a judicial warrant, Smiley said Providence police will be required to vacate the federal agents from it.

“If Immigration and Customs Enforcement presents a valid judicial warrant, we will honor it,” the mayor said. “We honor it today, but the reality is that’s not what’s happening in most instances.”

Private property owners are welcome to go to the city’s website and download and print out the signs to identify “non-public areas of their property” where ICE activity is prohibited, according to Smiley’s executive order. Property owners can use signs “at their own discretion and assume any legal risk associated therewith.”

Smiley said he has been encouraging the state’s judicial branch to enact a similar policy and also expand the use of virtual court hearings in Providence to discourage additional ICE visits.

The Jan. 15 incident at the Garrahy Courthouse was the second time in three months that ICE officers entered a state courthouse. ICE officers briefly detained a teenage judicial intern outside of the Licht Judicial Complex in Providence on Nov. 20, sparking condemnation from state and local officials, including Gov. Dan McKee and Chief Justice Paul Suttell.

ICE did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Jan. 15 incident.

The Providence Journal reported “several” masked immigration officers ran through the first floor of the Garrahy Courthouse in pursuit of two young men though apparently did not take anyone into custody.

“Allowing these barely-trained and reckless federal agents to blunder through our state, disrupting the justice system and harassing children and judges, diminishes the safety of our citizens and undermines the efforts of real law enforcement officers,” Lt. Gov Sabina Matos said in a Jan. 16 statement. “I am glad that this incident appears to have ended without harm to anyone, but we have all seen how this behavior leads to tragedy. ICE needs to be reined in and subject to the same laws that govern us all.”

The Judiciary enacted rules for virtual court hearings in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and recently posted its revised policy for requesting such a hearing using an online form. A judicial officer makes the final determination on whether the hearing must be held in person or not.

“As has been the case since the Judiciary developed remote hearing access capabilities, members of the public may request that a pending hearing be conducted remotely,” Judiciary spokesperson Lexi Kriss said in a recent email to Rhode Island Current. “These requests are to be submitted to and considered by the judicial officer presiding over the matter.”

Smiley’s order follows a move by city officials in November to amend Providence’s Community-Police Relations Act to deter local police from interacting with federal immigration officers.

Smiley acknowledged his order may put Providence further in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. The president on Jan. 14 threatened to halt federal funding to so-called “sanctuary” cities and states starting Feb. 1 if they don’t honor his mass deportation policies.

But Smiley said the fear of federal retribution is outweighed by the need to let Providence residents know the city has their backs.

The decision comes weeks after a similar operation in Minnesota incited protests and raised questions about the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Thousands of officers and agents from the Department of Homeland Security were deployed there, and ICE’s actions have come under significant scrutiny in the wake of the shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis this month by an ICE officer.

A number of asylum seekers from African countries ​who arrived in the United States during the Biden administration have settled in Maine​, joining a Somali population that started arriving there in the early 2000s​, when refugees from the country began settling in Lewiston. Yet Maine remains an overwhelmingly white state, with one of the oldest populations in the country. Some employers have begun looking to immigrants to fill labor gaps, as native-born employees have either left the work force or retired.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Maine telegraphed the upcoming operation in a statement on Monday advising people to protest peacefully.

“In the coming days, if Maine citizens seek to exercise their rights to assemble and protest, it is vital that these protests remain peaceful,” said Andrew Benson, the U.S. attorney in the state. “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

On Wednesday, Fox News reported that an ICE official took the network on a ride-along in Maine, describing the operation as targeting people with criminal histories.

“We have approximately 1,400 targets here in Maine,” Patricia Hyde, the ICE deputy assistant director, told Fox News.

A D.H.S. spokesperson said the department did not comment on law enforcement operations.

The Trump administration has put pressure on ICE to ramp up arrests throughout the past year. At one point, White House officials proposed a goal of 3,000 arrests a day — a figure the agency has yet to hit. Despite that, ICE officials have ramped up enforcement across the United States.

DHS says operation targets criminal offenders

Maine's governor opposes Trump's aggressive tactics

Support for Trump's immigration approach declines amid clashes

Jan 21 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has started an immigration enforcement operation in Maine, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday, targeting a state that is home to several refugee communities, including Somalis.

The department said in a press release that it kicked off ""Operation Catch of the Day"" on Tuesday, targeting criminal offenders. More than 100 agents arrived in the frigid Northeast state this week, one current immigration official and one former official said on condition of anonymity. The former official said the operation would focus on refugees.

Maine's political leadership and immigrant communities have been bracing for the arrival of more immigration agents. Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, said last week that the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement tactics were ""not welcome.""

President Donald Trump, a Republican, has surged immigration agents to Democratic-led cities and states since mid-2025, with some 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks. Trump says the intense enforcement operations are necessary to combat criminality, although many suspected immigration offenders arrested have no criminal charges or convictions.

Trump has been critical of Somali immigrants after some Somali Americans were implicated in a fraud scheme in Minnesota, calling them ""garbage"" and saying they should leave the U.S.

TRUMP TAKES ELECTION-YEAR CRACKDOWN TO MAINE

Public support for Trump's approach to immigration has dwindled in recent months as federal agents have swept through residential neighborhoods, tossing tear gas and clashing with protesters, Reuters/Ipsos polls show.

Tensions boiled over earlier this month when a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolisfatally shot Renee Good, U.S. citizen and mother of three.

Carl Sheline, mayor of Lewiston, Maine, said on Tuesday that the city had seen an increase in ICE agents in the 39,000-person city. Lewiston, the second-largest city in Maine, is home to Somali immigrants and other refugees, communities that have been there for decades.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin criticized Maine's governor, calling her one of the state's ""sanctuary politicians"" trying to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

""We are no longer allowing criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,"" McLaughlin said in a statement.

The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Maine will feature several competitive political races in November's midterm elections that will decide control of the U.S. Congress, and immigration is expected to be an issue.

Oppose the FY2026 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill

Congress’s fiscal year 2026 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill is poised to further increase Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) already bloated budget, allowing ICE to continue expanding its detention capacity at a time when people are dying in the system at a record pace.

The current negotiated funding bill would provide billions of new tax dollars to private contractors already profiting from the windfall of funds the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) received last summer, when Congress passed President Trump’s reconciliation bill defunding Americans’ access to healthcare and food security, affordable housing, education, and other critical services in order to increase profits for prisons, militarized immigration policing, and surveillance companies. Over the last year, U.S. communities have seen the danger of aggressive immigration policing, including the violent arrest and detention of longtime residents, children, and U.S. citizens. Giving DHS even more money to abduct and hurt our neighbors will lead to irreversible harm.

Congress already handed DHS a windfall of $170 billion dollars to supersize its deportation force and detention apparatus. Thanks to this blank check, ICE says it already has enough money to detain over 100,000 people at a time and contract 80,000 new beds. 2025 was the deadliest year ever for people in ICE detention, and six people have died in ICE detention just this month. Local investigators are looking at at least one death as a “likely homicide” at the hands of detention guards. ICE and Border Patrol agents continue to terrorize our communities, leading to violence. Renee Nicole Good’s death is a stark warning of what might still be to come. The negotiated bill provides no guardrails to prevent federal agents from abducting and deporting people at historic levels.

We urge Congress to oppose any additional funds for ICE and Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Border Patrol, and to use this bill to rein in the Trump administration’s reckless abuse and assault on our communities under the guise of immigration enforcement.

Jesse Franzblau, associate policy director, National Immigrant Justice Center, said: “Congress should not provide another dime for the Trump administration’s violent assault on our communities across the country. We know that the deadly arrest and detention operations will only escalate as long as ICE and Border Patrol have a blank check to operate. Congress must stop taxpayer funds from going to the private contractors profiting from the deadly system, assert its authority by demanding real accountability, cutting funds for immigration prison camps and deportations, and investing in communities.”

Marisol Hernandez, senior advocacy manager, Detention Watch Network, said: “ICE kills — full stop. Decades of evidence illustrate that no one is safe in ICE custody. With a record number of people in detention and record number of deaths in ICE custody, including six deaths just this month, Trump’s cruel mass detention and deportation agenda is being executed at the expense of Americans receiving lifesaving healthcare and millions of kids having school lunches. We demand that Congress stop funding ICE, an abusive agency to its core. Now more than ever, we need real leaders who aren’t afraid to unite against Trump and advocate for the rights and dignity of everyone, including immigrants.”

Jamie Beran, CEO, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, said:“Congress cannot reward ICE for the horrific daily assaults, the murder of Renee Good, the shooting of Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, and the deaths in custody with yet more money. More Americans are waking up to the reality that ICE does vastly more harm than good and it is time our elected officials join their constituents in that reality. As American Jews, we have seen before what happens when a government scapegoats and targets immigrants. We have seen the violence that results when government officials use the false, antisemitic and racist Great Replacement conspiracy theory to justify harassing, deporting, detaining, kidnaping, or targeting anyone who disagrees with them. Congress must intervene and stop the flood of funding to the agencies terrorizing our communities.”

Kate Voigt, senior policy counsel, American Civil Liberties Union, said: “In less than one month, six people died in ICE detention facilities while federal immigration agents have recklessly arrested and even killed members of our communities in the name of immigration enforcement – and these daily horrors are being funded with our taxpayer dollars. Our message to Congress is clear: rein in ICE.”

Amy Fischer, director of refugee and migrant rights, Amnesty International USA, said: “As ICE is terrorizing communities with brute force and warrantless arrests, and the Trump administration is expanding the cruel and deadly immigrant detention system with a total lack of accountability, it is shameful that Congress is playing business as usual and considering giving millions more taxpayer dollars to an agency with a documented track record of human rights abuses. Congress has an obligation to not fund human rights violations and should instead be cutting funds to ICE and creating guardrails against the agency’s lawless behavior. This bill is not the answer, Congress must vote no.”

Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, senior policy counsel, National Immigration Law Center (NILC), said:“After a year of lawless violence and intimidation at the hands of ICE and CBP, communities from coast to coast continue to show up for one another. It’s time for Congress to do its part. NILC calls on all members of Congress to reject any more funding for ICE and CBP in the current DHS appropriations bill.”",https://assets.nationbuilder.com/jewishaction/pages/33694/meta_images/original/image_720-2.png?1769015067,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:15.691188

The local protest was also fueled by recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in York County.

Protesters across York County gathered on town squares and at busy street corners on the same day that 100 immigration enforcement vehicles were spotted in York City.

The precise actions being taken by U.S. Immigration and Customes Enforcement agents remained unclear Tuesday afternoon, as a spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Several unconfirmed reports of ICE actions emerged on social media, including one just across the county line in New Cumberland.

In all, nine ""Free America Walkout"" events were staged across the county on Tuesday, including in the town squares in Dover, Hanover, Red Lion and York. Several hundred were held nationwide on the anniversary of President Donald Trump's second inauguration. The movement called on people to withhold their labor to object to what organizers described as the ""escalating fascist threat.""

""This is not America. This is the greatest country on Earth, and we've turned to hell under Trump,"" said Marcy Glatfelter, of Hellam Township, as she stationed herself on Continental Square in York City.

Immigration raids, anti-LGBT rhetoric and attacks and mass surveillance were among the walkouts' focuses. Locally, protesters donned signs with messages such as ""Make America Trumpless again"" and ""Hands off our democracy.""

The Women's March, a feminist-led movement against oppression, mobilized walkouts in all 50 states and internationally. By interrupting the usual daily routine to publicly assemble, protesters at more than 800 demonstrations hoped to defend their freedoms and use collective outrage to spark action.

Anger only grew inside Glatfelter in the hours leading up to the protest. She brought multiple signs condemning the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

""They're rounding up York people today, right now,"" she said.

Less than four hours earlier, The York Dispatch captured video of more than a dozen black and gray law enforcement vehicles leaving the federal ICE facility along Clugston Road at a high rate of speed. Earlier in the morning, as many as 100 vehicles were reportedly staging there.

Glatfelter said that seeing the ramp-up in activity fired her up and made her feel scared for anyone those presumed-to-be ICE agents may encounter.

""They have no authority to pull people over, and they're pulling them over asking for papers,"" said Glatfelter. ""What is this, Berlin 1939?""

Later on Tuesday night, people spoke about ICE's presence during public comment at the York City Council's meeting. They expressed concern over the agency's increasing presence, and asked what the city is doing to protect its undocumented community and others who may be subject to profiling due to their skin color.

""I have seen the fear that it causes firsthand. There are people in our community afraid to leave their houses, afraid when they're going to work, afraid when they're picking their children up,"" said Alyssa Jackson, who works in York City.

Jackson told the council she felt a responsibility to her community to attend the meeting and ask questions.

Likewise, resident Jackeline Alvarez urged the council to swiftly address ICE's presence while upholding transparency, accountability and the safety of everyone in the city.

""How does the city make sure local police aren't participating in excessive force and that no one is targeted based on race, ethnicity, or national origin? How can residents safely report incidents if they occur? Will anyone answer?"" asked Alvarez.

She said the city needs to ensure that local resources aren't directed to federal ICE efforts, emphasizing that, in her view, the agency uses unnecessary force and violates rights.

After the meeting, Alvarez told The York Dispatch that she is extremely concerned about the 287(g) agreement West York borough entered into with ICE and wants to see the York City Council do something to reassure vulnerable populations that the city's police won't sign on to the partnership program.

""My concern — everyone's concern, really — is, who will be there for us if ICE racially profiles people here?"" Alvarez said.

Presently, York City does not cooperate with ICE in non-criminal matters. But efforts to legislate protections through a codified ordinance, dubbed the ""Trust Act,"" failed a year ago when then-Mayor Michael Helfrich vetoed the council's narrowly approved vote.

The ordinance would have enshrined protections for immigrants and refugees in the city, promising that police and other city employees would not ask anyone for their immigration status. Helfrich cited the financial burden — he estimated it at $2 million or more — the city would endure if the Trump administration moved to withhold funding from municipalities it deemed so-called ""sanctuary cities.""

Jackson told The York Dispatch that she was unaware about the Trust Act efforts but that she would be happy to see something like that enacted. She said she intends to keep speaking out until something changes.

""Obviously, everybody can see now that everything looks very scary,"" Jackson said.

At the demonstration, Katie Landis, of Red Lion, held up a sign reading, ""Do not comply in advance,"" an anti-fascist principle that she said is more important now than ever.

""I've been worried since the moment Trump got elected over 10 years ago,"" Landis said. ""All of the worries that I've had, I've been slowly watching come to fruition. The situation with ICE in Minnesota feels like a tipping point.""

Renee Nicole Good, a Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen, was killed by an ICE agent earlier this month. She wasn’t herself a target of ICE officers. The incident ""terrified"" Landis, who was already concerned for the safety of immigrants and people of color in her community.

Following what happened in Minneapolis, Alvarez also expressed worry after the council meeting that law enforcement and onlookers could escalate peaceful protests locally. She asked the council to respond with a course of action within the next few weeks.

ICE's increasingly violent conduct under the second Trump administration alarmed Porter Hedge, of Spring Garden Township, and pushed him to participate in the York City walkout. He said ICE has strayed from decades-long protocols, no longer following immigration law and enforcement practices but rather exerting a ""disturbing"" abuse of power.

""They seem to be an untrained group of people hired for their capacity for violence,"" Hedge said. ""I fear for the people who have become targets of an undisciplined method of law enforcement.""

Protesting and causing disruption can slow the spread of fascism, if not stop it altogether, Landis said. She said most people blindly comply with the authority's rules, and that those who have the privilege to dissent should do so.

""All of our family members, all of our ancestors, came here to stolen land,"" said Eve Adler, of Springettsbury Township.

Adler said people don't understand what's really happening to immigrants in this country, so showing up and speaking out is crucial.

""I feel like (ICE) is just people who do not have the right to detain innocent people, and injure and murder innocent people, such as Renee, and all of the protestors of innocent immigrants who have come to make our communities a better place,"" Adler said.

Similar sentiments are why others, such as Hedge, want to attract attention from people across the country. He said he thinks it's necessary to avoid what he referred to as ""an un-American downfall.""

""It's gonna get personal very quickly for a lot of people,"" said Landis. ""I just wish more people would look at it, because if we don't look at it, how do we stop it? How do we fight against it?""

But not everyone protesting believed their individual or even collective presence would convince onlookers who might support ICE to see things differently. While most people driving by either honked in support of the protestors or made no acknowledgment at all, a few hecklers yelled profanities and praised Trump.

The invective didn't trouble Glatfelter, who encouraged people to take action — both in the form of protest and in communications with elected officials.

""If you care about your neighbors, call your congressman, call the Senate, call the White House. Write letters,"" she said.","https://www.yorkdispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/20/PPYD/88272609007-img-3773.jpeg?crop=3864,2178,x0,y404&width=3200&height=1804&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 15:58:19.646997

A federal complaint and affidavit filed in court by an F.B.I. agent differed in some details from the description provided by the Department of Homeland Security after the shooting last Wednesday. Two men, Alfredo A. Aljorna and Julio C. Sosa-Celis, who are Venezuelan nationals, were accused in the court records of assaulting the agent with a broom before the agent opened fire, striking Mr. Sosa-Celis.

Both men appeared on Wednesday in Federal District Court in St. Paul, where a judge found probable cause for the case to proceed. Neither man entered a plea or spoke about the incident.

The shooting happened a week after another immigration agent shot and killed Renee Good, a U.S. citizen, on a residential street in a different part of Minneapolis. Both shootings touched off protests in the city, which the Trump administration has flooded with immigration agents in recent weeks.

The newly unsealed court records provided the government’s fullest account yet of the second shooting, which an F.B.I. agent said happened after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on a temporary assignment in the state ran a license plate on a Ford Focus and found that its Minnesota tag was registered to someone in the country illegally.

The two ICE agents believed that the driver, Mr. Aljorna, was the person who owned the vehicle, the F.B.I. agent wrote, but that turned out not to be the case. The affidavit said that the ICE agents, driving an unmarked vehicle, turned on their lights and siren to pull over the Ford. The F.B.I. agent said that Mr. Aljorna instead sped off and “recklessly zig-zagged through traffic” in a chase that lasted between 15 and 20 minutes.

The affidavit noted that the ICE agents “were not familiar with the area,” and said that they eventually lost track of Mr. Aljorna until discovering that he had crashed into a light pole. The agents said they then saw Mr. Aljorna run toward a nearby apartment building, and that one of the ICE agents chased after him. Another person, identified in the affidavit as Mr. Sosa-Celis, was standing on the porch and urged Mr. Aljorna to run faster, officials said.

The F.B.I. agent wrote that Mr. Aljorna eventually fell, and an agent caught up to him. The two then fought on the ground, the affidavit said, before Mr. Sosa-Celis grabbed a broomstick and started hitting the agent in the face. The affidavit said that the agent thought he saw another man, who was not named, approach holding a snow shovel, and that the agent was also struck with the shovel.

Mr. Aljorna eventually freed himself from the agent, the affidavit said, and grabbed the broom. The ICE agent, the affidavit said, was “exhausted, alone, on the ground and in fear.” The agent sustained a gash on his hand while deflecting a blow, the F.B.I. agent wrote.

The ICE agent drew his pistol and fired one round, the affidavit said, and was initially unsure if anyone had been hit. The two men had started to run toward the apartment building “simultaneously” when the agent fired, the affidavit said.

The two men went inside the building. After more law enforcement officers arrived, the affidavit said, they used tear gas and the men surrendered. Mr. Sosa-Celis was found to have “a non-life-threatening gunshot wound to his upper right thigh,” according to the affidavit.

Katherian Roe, the federal defender in Minnesota, who is listed in court records as the lawyer for both men, indicated in an email that she is often initially listed as the lawyer of record in cases that will later be assigned to another lawyer. She did not comment on the circumstances of this case.

The account of the incident relayed by the F.B.I. agent largely matched what federal officials said in the immediate aftermath, as protesters were gathering at the scene and clashing with law enforcement. But it also included notable differences from that initial description and from a more detailed statement released by the Department of Homeland Security the following day.

In earlier descriptions, federal officials said that the incident started with “a targeted traffic stop in Minneapolis of an illegal alien from Venezuela,” but did not mention that the driver the agents were trying to stop was not who they first believed him to be. Officials have said that Mr. Aljorna and Mr. Sosa-Celis are both from Venezuela and are both in the country illegally.

In its more detailed statement on the day after the shooting, the Department of Homeland Security indicated that Mr. Sosa-Celis, not Mr. Aljorna, was the driver. The agency also used a different spelling of Mr. Aljorna’s last name. That statement accused a third man, also from Venezuela and also in the country illegally, of being involved in the incident. While the affidavit says that the agent believed a third man assaulted him with a shovel, only Mr. Aljorna and Mr. Sosa-Celis are accused by name in the complaint.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to an email on Tuesday night asking about those differences.

The F.B.I. agent’s affidavit said that investigators found a broom and snow shovel outside the apartment building. The affidavit also said that law enforcement officials decided to leave that building “without executing a full search warrant” because of “unprecedented civil unrest that developed in the vicinity.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/20nat-minnesota-shooting-1-cptq/20nat-minnesota-shooting-1-cptq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:37.822244

National headlines have mostly skipped over Memphis, perhaps because it’s a smaller city in the South, far from the headquarters of national media. On the ground in Memphis, local policy organizer Amber Sherman explained, the fear— and resistance — are similar to what we see in bigger cities.

It’s not so much the National Guard, she said, but around the city, there are some 1,500 federal agents from the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force working alongside existing police and using traffic stops — reportedly more than 35,000 in two months — as a way to get their hands on people. This is the very issue — pretextual stops— that Memphis activists organized against so effectively after police killed artist and skateboarder Tyre Nichols two years ago. ​“It’s just scaring the hell out of people,” Sherman said. ​“A lot of people just aren’t going anywhere, and that’s really impacting all the economics. No one is going out to buy anything. People aren’t taking their kids to school.”

Unlike Illinois and California, Tennessee has a governor who is thrilled to have Trump’s troops. Gov. Bill Lee led the charge to overturn the police reforms that Memphis activists like Sherman had fought for, as I wrote in 2024. Cities under attack by the state government is a common story in the South, but the Memphis activists are also disappointed in their city government, which has offered to cooperate with the federal agents.

“We’re threatened constantly, and some people are susceptible to those threats,” Sherman said.

Activists in the city have fought for social services and youth programs that effectively lowered violent crime to a 25-year low— according to the police themselves. But too often the governor and state legislature overturn that work or its funding.

“Our mayor doesn’t want to push back because he knows that they’ll not fund or not give us grants for different programming,” Sherman said. ​“That’s how they keep us in check.”

What Memphis does have in common with most other cities on Trump’s list is Black leadership, a large Black population and powerful activist communities. And it’s beginning to fight back, too, against the tech takeover, embodied in Memphis in the form of Elon Musk’s xAI data center. So Trump sent in the task force — which had, between Oct. 1 and early December, made more than 3,100 arrests, and it won’t disclose who it has arrested or why. Local outlet MLK50 analyzed one day’s worth of arrest data to find that, despite the governor’s claims that the force is arresting violent criminals and gang members, ​“most of the people arrested were not charged with a violent crime, and immigrants are being arrested on administrative — not criminal — warrants.”

“It is meant,” Sherman said, ​“as a way to quell dissent.”

The rebellions have, so far, given us two iconic images of resistance. In Portland, Ore., we have the inflatable costumes—beginning with the frog and expanding to a whole menagerie. In Los Angeles, the indelible image is that of a string of automated Waymo taxis, put to the torch.

The costumes have quickly been seized on and replicated around the country, most visibly at the massive No Kings marches in October 2025. But as Julia Carrie Wong wrote in the Guardian, clowning in a frog suit is a de-escalatory tactic, designed to make masked agents of the state appear ridiculous.

By contrast, the flaming Waymos express something else: a targeted defiance of tech-enabled Trumpism with material consequences. If you’re going to treat our neighbors as disposable, the burned-to-a-crisp robotaxi says, we’re going to make you pay.

The flaming Waymos express something else: a targeted defiance of tech-enabled Trumpism with material consequences.

The Waymo is, after all, a privatized, automated taxi run as a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and rolled out in high-tech hubs like San Francisco, Phoenix and Austin, Texas.

Tech journalist Brian Merchant saw the husks of incinerated Waymos firsthand in Los Angeles and reported, ​“Protesters were reportedly calling them ​‘spy cars’ as they were vandalized and set ablaze, and some noted how the cars can share data with the LAPD.”

Merchant goes on: ​“ICE raids are carried out using data provided by Silicon Valley companies. … Whether directly or through third party contractors, much of big tech, including Google, has made deals with ICE, too.”

A Waymo car burns in the street as smoke billows during protests in Los Angeles, California, on June 8, 2025. Following a series of aggressive federal immigration operations in Los Angeles, tensions escalated when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted a high-profile raid on a Home Depot location. The raid sparked widespread protests across the city, where demonstrators decried the targeting of immigrant communities and the separation of families. Clashes soon broke out between protesters and federal agents, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to the city, a move harshly criticized by California officials, including the governor, as ""purposefully inflammatory."" (Photo by DAVID PASHAEE/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)

A photo posted of one Waymo, presumably before it was put to the torch, showed it splashed with graffiti, ​“Eat the Rich” and ​“Tech Fuels Fascism.”

The same tech hubs in which Waymo has so proudly unfurled its service, after all, were also increasingly unlivable before the camouflaged gun-toting goons marched in, where homelessness is rampant and gig workers sleep in their (non-self-driving) cars.

Driving for one of the various rideshare and delivery apps was one way that working-class people, immigrant or otherwise, could maybe piece together a living; now, robotaxis and a horde of delivery robots cheerily automate their jobs away. The workers so recently called ​“essential” in the days of Covid-19 lockdowns are tossed aside or fed into the deportation machine.

Communities have been disintegrating under the weight of supposed prosperity. As Eric Garcetti, then-mayor of Los Angeles, famously said in 2020: ​“In a good economy, homelessness goes up.”

What the Waymo represents, then, is the question of what happens in an increasingly automated economy, when more and more of us will no longer be “workers” at all.

Wealthy residents and visitors to LA can cruise past homeless encampments in a driverless car, ignoring the people rendered surplus when parts of the servant economy are mechanized. California Gov. Gavin Newsom personally joined the clearance of one LA camp, ostentatiously shoving items into a trash bag.

The symbolism couldn’t be clearer: When we no longer value your labor, you will be discarded.

What the Waymo represents, then, is the question of what happens in an increasingly automated economy, when more and more of us will no longer be ​“workers” at all.

What happens when U.S. capitalism simply needs fewer humans?

The idea of people being superfluous isn’t new, but it’s become a dominant structure of feeling in recent years. Over and over, when I was reporting on the Covid pandemic, workers told me some version of, ​“They say we’re essential. What they really mean is we’re expendable.”

They felt this way in the middle of lockdown, when suddenly the importance of grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, line cooks and farmworkers was made abundantly clear. Immigrant-dominated industries were suddenly so important that the president demanded they keep working; meanwhile, undocumented people were excluded from most of the benefits offered to Americans to survive the crisis. Five years on, with the government shut down for some six weeks and SNAP benefits for more than 40 million people only recently restored, those suspicions of expendability have been proven correct, and not only about immigrant workers. Sherman noted that Tennessee has a rainy day fund of more than $2 billion, and it would have taken only a fraction of that to cover food aid for the 700,000 estimated residents of the state who rely on SNAP.

The United States has a long history of absorbing workers, particularly from Latin America, when demand is high, and removing them when demand falters. As I recently wrote for In These Times, ICE enforcement can be scarce in the months after a disaster, only to swoop in after cleanup.

But this story goes back further.

Famously, there was the Bracero Program, established in 1942, which brought guest workers from Mexico for the farming season, issuing millions of temporary visas. There was the also the overlapping, repugnantly named Operation Wetback, a crackdown by border agents to deport people back to Mexico or push them into the Bracero standards.

Guest workers were preferable because they could not stay — they were sent back as soon as the need for their labor was done.

This same reason is why Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have advocated for expanded guest worker programs in tech — cheaper workers are easier to remove if they make trouble. In low-paid farmwork, the excuse is that ​“Americans won’t do this work”; in tech, the argument is Americans lack the skills. Both arguments offer cover for the continued desire for cheap and easily controlled workers.

Since the end of the Bracero Program, the United States has tightened the border more. Presidents of both parties have targeted Mexican and Latinx immigrants, fast-tracked deportations, and, in Daniel Denvir’s words in All-American Nativism, ​“us[ed] undocumented workers as leverage.”

The result is the continued dehumanization of migrants — at best, valued as units of labor power rather than human beings, and, at worst, demonized for simply daring to exist in the United States.

Today, it seems, the Trump administration’s smash-and-grab approach to deportations might finally have changed the calculus. Beyond just keeping migrants super-exploitable to drive down wages for us all, ICE has become the shock troops of a regime led by a man who posts AI-generated slop of himself raining shit on the people he governs; they arrest and brutalize citizen and migrant alike, grab children on their way to school, terrorize people in their homes.

This is occurring at a time of skyrocketing inequality, when decent jobs and affordable housing are harder and harder to come by. White Americans, particularly men, who are used to being first in line for the good stuff, are now feeling the loss in status. Meanwhile, demagogues aplenty are telling them their loss has been immigrants’ gain. The reality is that the capitalists, in tech and other industries, care little for any of our lives: White workers, as well as immigrants, are disposable, and the investments being poured into so-called artificial intelligence are in the hope that more expensive workers — whether skilled coders held up so often as the ideal, or Hollywood writers, or journalists — can be replaced by an algorithm.

The gigification of so many jobs by the app-based economy (the Ubers and Lyfts) laid the groundwork. As Emily Bender, co-author of The AI Con, explained, ​“If the work can be broken down into little replicable units that people can slot into, then you don’t need to see workers as people with expertise, with careers, with relationships. They are just providers of content or annotations or labeling or, in big scare quotes, ​‘intelligence.’”

The flaming Waymo, then, is not a symbol of nebulous or even misdirected rage. It is a symbol of the way that more and more people are being rendered surplus, through organized abandonment or deliberate removal.

It’s Taylorism for the 21st century, and there is no industry that the tech overlords would not like to apply it to. Whether we are deskilled (and devalued), or literally packed off to prison or a deportation flight, capital will keep flowing into the pockets of the Zuckerbergs and Musks. (Musk, we should recall, is also rolling out supposedly self-driving taxis.)

Rooting for Trump to deport all the immigrants is a desperate bid to stave off one’s own expendability. The better solution, as striking Hollywood writers proved, is organization. Or, as the people of LA and Chicago and everywhere else remind us, to raise hell.

The flaming Waymo, then, is not a symbol of nebulous or even misdirected rage. It is a symbol of the way that more and more people are being rendered surplus, through organized abandonment or deliberate removal. As Merchant wrote, ​“The Waymo contributes to congestion, surveils neighborhoods, replaces the Uber or cab driver, and sends any resultant future profits upstream to a tech company in Mountain View.”

The protesters know exactly why — and for whom — it exists.

We are in a new age of uprising, as Joshua Clover wrote in Riot. Strike. Riot. These rebellions are often kicked off by state violence, spurred by a recognition of the racial dimension of this disposability. From Memphis, Minneapolis and Ferguson, Mo., to Los Angeles and Chicago, police murder a Black person and are granted impunity; ICE stuffs someone who looks Latinx into an unmarked van as community members film and shout and sometimes succeed in pulling their neighbors back. The forces of so-called order operate above the law, and more and more of us know it.

As Clover also stressed, the return of the riot comes as profitability and ​“economic growth” have stagnated. He noted that capital’s ​“tragic flaw” is that, in Marx’s own words, ​“it presses to reduce labor time to a minimum, while it posits labor time, on the other side, as sole measure and source of wealth.” Capital needs us, even as it needs to replace us. It automates the labor, rendering more people surplus, even as it captures their skill in the machine and the algorithm — what Marx referred to so famously as ​“dead labor.”

So-called generative AI is a clearer illustration of this principle than Marx could have imagined. As Molly Crabapple and others wrote in an open letter, playing on his words, it is ​“vampirical, feasting on past generations of artwork even as it sucks the lifeblood from living artists.”

More prosaically: Machine learning sweeps up vast swaths of existing works of art, literature, journalism and scholarship, and vomits it back out in a fraction of the time it took to create the original, but mashed together, sometimes deliberately imitative. As we create and our work is made public, it is vacuumed up by the machine — a machine that requires ever more computing power, electricity and water. Trump uses AI to express his contempt for protests and, by doing so, expresses his contempt not just for the value of human labor but for the planet.

Meanwhile, people are rendered surplus along manufactured, racialized lines: the prison, the police killing, the migrant detention center, the deportation flight. Labor’s long-dear principle of last-hired, first-fired meant Black workers felt deindustrialization’s sting first and fiercest, though the stories we hear today nearly always figure the redundant worker as a white man. Factories moved overseas to wring greater profits from cheaper workers, and those left behind went into services, or gig work, or languished.

This cycle is familiar, and within it, the ICE raids — like the ar - rests of protesters with the movement to end the genocide in Gaza— work, as historian Robin D.G. Kelley told me, like a lynching: a public demonstration to instill fear and compliance. The ICE raid is a tool of discipline. And the bigger the surplus population, the more discipline needed.

Today’s rebellions have usually faced down the state, Clover noted, because ​“the state is near and the economy far.” The strike was the tactic of choice for the proletariat in the days of industrialized production because most people could reach out and touch the economy. But many cannot do so directly now because they are locked out entirely or their manager is an algorithm, an app, a ghost.

The riot is, as Clover argued, a struggle that ​“unfolds in the context of consumption, featuring the interruption of commercial circulation.” Protesters have, over and over, in the uprisings of recent years, taken to the streets, shut down transit, destroyed cars and looted shops, taking things because why do they deserve less than the rich? What Clover called the ​“surplus rebellion” mucks up circulation to be heard.

As humans are increasingly closed out of circulation, the targeting of tech makes more sense. As Brian Merchant noted, tech companies like automation ​“because it promises not just to remove labor from the equation, but accountability. There is no driver to blame if something goes wrong with the self-driving car, it’s a glitchy algorithm; or better yet, it was probably somebody else’s fault because Google’s algorithm is safe and sophisticated, even if it won’t tell you how that algorithm actually works.”

The protesters, though, turned that setup on its head: ​“There is no one around to stop them from hailing a Waymo car and destroying it.” The tech company has created a place where they can touch — and torch — what’s killing them.

The destruction of the Waymo also recalls an earlier period of transition, from the first round of riots to the strike. In the early days of industrialization, workers would smash the machine that replaced (or sped up and deskilled) their jobs. The Luddites were the most famous, and a series of books (by Gavin Mueller, Merchant himself, and Jathan Sadowski) have brought them back to public consciousness. The Luddites, far from opposing technology for its own sake, were well aware of who controlled the tech and how their labor was being encoded into it. Breaking the machine was not a symbolic action, but a direct one: The smashed machine can’t work, and the burned car doesn’t run.

“[M]achine-breaking,” Clover wrote, ​“is what the swing from riot to strike looks like.”

You may not be able to destroy the algorithm, but its avatar, roaming your streets, is still, necessarily, tangible.

AI is not produced out of nowhere. The Cloud is a bad metaphor. All of those searches we plug into ChatGPT or Midjourney are carried out on physical machines, and the mad rush to build more data centers means one of them is likely coming to a community near you.

In Memphis, there are no Waymos, but Elon Musk’s Colossus supercomputer has drawn the ire of many who are angry about its gas turbines and the pollution they bring to already-bad air. ​“They really weren’t ready for the level of pushback they would get,” Sherman said. The company is building another center and ​“they have all these private security guards that are everywhere” due to protests, she said.

Tech companies, said Sherman, seem to be ​“trying to get everything that they have wanted to do done right now because they have this president that’s supporting them.”

Just up the Mississippi, in St. Louis, local organizers are also fighting data centers. A project has been proposed for the middle of the city, at the Armory, a former entertainment venue located conveniently in a district that allows tax incentives and a lot of secrecy. They don’t know whose data center it will be just yet, said Jeremy Al-Haj, executive director of the Missouri Workers Center, but they know the city helped underwrite bonds for it.

The coalition — which includes organizations ranging from SEIU’s healthcare local to the Democratic Socialists of America to Metropolitan Congregations United and the Missouri Sierra Club — held a town hall and packed a local church with voices almost entirely in opposition. Their reasons, Al-Haj said, ​“ranged from the environmental concerns around the data center, water usage and electrical usage, the increased utility rates and the noise level from the data center,” as well as ​“just the very idea that this should be in the center of the city. And … outrage about AI and the automation of professional middle-class jobs and human creativity that implies.”

AI has proved a crappy replacement for humans — it’s not an accident that the common term for its digital output is ​“slop.” But it has contributed to the turning of decent jobs into lousy temporary gigs. In his book Work Without the Worker, Phil Jones noted, ​“AI does not tend to create fully automated systems but rather systems that partially automate jobs and outsource certain tasks to the crowd.” That crowd, he further pointed out, can be located anywhere that an internet connection can reach: automation and outsourcing continue to go hand in hand.

The Waymo car, Joanne McNeil pointed out, is a perfect example of this phenomenon. Remote contractors do the work that the algorithm and the robot can’t, but they’re hidden from view in what Astra Taylor called ​“fauxtomation.” Waymo’s co-CEO, McNeil noted, denied the cars have remote drivers, but this, she wrote, contradicted the company’s own filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, which ​“cited the remote workers in its automation chain as a critical safety feature.” Those workers can move the Waymo if the software fails; the company got its expansion approved because human involvement helps ​“minimize risk.”

Human workers compiled and cleaned the dataset that trained those workers in the first place — human drivers in Google Street View cars and humans behind computers deciding whether an object in a photo is a stop sign. Humans help train systems about which they know almost nothing; you’ve probably helped it yourself if you’ve ever had to use a reCAPTCHA to access a website. That data can be recycled, whether to train a Waymo or an armed drone. Bombing raids in Gaza were guided by AI; Memphis touts its new AI-powered surveillance hub.

Humans are present in every stage of the system, even as it renders them invisible, as Jones wrote. The AI is vampiric at first the way a mosquito is: a little nibble here and there. But mosquitos transmit viruses that kill.

The data centers are as distributed as the outsourced workers. In Mexico, communities battle the same pollution as Memphis, emitted by the same companies; electric grids falter under Microsoft and Amazon. Water shortages make people sick. The director of industrial development for Querétaro, where many of Mexico’s 110 data centers are, bragged in the New York Times of constructing data centers that would use the same amount of energy as 1.25 million U.S. homes. Meanwhile, the state plans to recycle sewage for drinking water.

This is the growth, domestically and internationally, that late capitalism offers. ​“Data center construction accounted for 92% of growth in U.S. GDP this year,” Al-Haj noted. ​“The New York Times just reported that Amazon’s planning to automate 75% of its workforce.” The Missouri Workers Center has been organizing with Amazon warehouse workers for several years, and those workers, he said, are worried: ​“And while they might create some small number of jobs for certain segments of the working class, for the remainder, they spell the loss of jobs.”

The algorithms and the robots are driven by humans, and their deployment is a human decision. The white supremacists who fear the so-called Great Replacement have their targets all wrong, in other words. The real great replacement they ought to worry about isn’t immigrants, but man (and woman, and everyone else) with machine.

In this economy, then, expect to see more machine-breaking.

Worker groups like the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and community organizations like Organized Communities Against Deportations have been building networks of communication, hosting know-your-rights trainings for migrants and concentric circles of activists who have documents, so they can join a rapid response or a more distant protest, amplify stories, serve as legal observers and more. Such groups, as I wrote in Necessary Trouble and From the Ashes, capture some of the outrage from moments of rebellion and build from it in strategically necessary directions.

In Memphis, Sherman said, as in many other cities, organizers have set up a rapid response hotline to report ICE or police activity. They’re canvassing and sharing information in multiple languages. She and others are organized under ​“Free the 901,” and their website offers know-your-rights flyers and information. ​“We post warnings about the different areas to avoid,” Sherman said. The group has also launched a rideshare program — the antithesis of the Waymo, a gesture of explicit human accompaniment — so people don’t have to brave the streets alone.

Organizers in Missouri have found they can indeed defeat the data centers. In St. Charles, community outrage seemed, to Jeremy Al-Haj, ​“pretty organic,” led by farmers who organized quickly. ​“It was also the case that the mayor’s cousin owned the plot of land that was going to get purchased, and the city council and the mayor had all signed nondisclosure agreements about the project.” Concerns about corruption, in other words, dovetailed with the anger at the secrecy and culminated in a yearlong construction ban.

Capturing the energy of a rebellion is like capturing lightning in a bottle. It doesn’t hold its form well. Not everyone is willing or able to come to weekly organizing meetings. That does not mean nothing has been learned in the streets, that knowledge-sharing isn’t taking place. During the LA rebellion, social media was overflowing with such sharing: Images from Hong Kong’s protests proliferated, and tips about tear gas were proffered by unlikely suspects, including one dermatologist who went viral.

In such moments, people learn the contours of their power. They learn how it feels to be part of a crowd, to have the scary thing happen and to stand up. In LA, successive generations of workers and organizers have survived police crackdowns and showed up again. Echoes of not just the 1992 LA riots or the 1965 Watts rebellion, but the 1990 police assault on a Justice for Janitors demonstration in Century City, could be seen in LA this summer.

David Huerta was one of those who cut his organizing teeth on the Justice for Janitors campaign. Now the president of SEIU California and of SEIU United Service Workers West, Huerta was arrested attempting to protect his community when the ICE raids began June 6. His arrest helped take the LA story national, as union leaders — even those less inclined than Huerta to put their bodies on the line — denounced his arrest.

The question is not how to organize every single person, but rather, how to prepare for the moments of explosion while focusing on what people need day to day.

Since Huerta’s arrest, ICE has escalated to arresting Brad Lander, the third-highest elected official in New York City, and California Sen. Alex Padilla, among others. Huerta’s original felony charge has been downgraded, though he still faces trial.

The Watts rebellion, Kelley noted, ​“grew not from chaos but from a mobilized community seeking change.” There were civil rights groups but also arts collectives; after the uprising, activists created more cultural spaces and joined more radical political groups, including the Black Panther Party. They built a network to monitor police abuses.

Communities dispersed by policing, economic displacement, deportations — by all the tendrils of organized abandonment — have a harder time coming together, but history reminds us it’s not impossible. We are seeing in the streets what political theorist Rodrigo Nunes called ​“distributed action” in Neither Vertical Nor Horizontal, as different forms of organizing ​“combine, communicate, relate and establish positive and negative feedback loops with one another.” Such action operates at multiple scales and times; it involves the collectivities in the streets as well as the long-term membership organizations that stay when national reporters leave. There is little that is absolutely right or wrong: What matters is whether it works, not whether it proves prior ideas.

To those who ask what good setting a Waymo car on fire does, then, we might reply, ​“too early to tell.” But there is power when long-term organizing and battle-tested strategists come into contact with the righteous anger sparked by repression. The question is not how to organize every single person, but rather, how to prepare for the moments of explosion while focusing on what people need day to day.

We know this means protecting people in our communities when the masked agents arrive, to the best of our abilities, and that requires getting to know those people ahead of time. We know the issues that will move people to act are the ones that, as Ruth Wilson Gilmore says, bite into their existence: the rent, the workplace, the police, the cost of groceries. Different organizations may focus on each, and when the flashpoints come, may be able to lead — or sometimes, importantly, to follow where the riot goes, and to learn in motion what it is that the people will no longer abide.

“We’re doing everything we can to keep our community safe,” Sherman said. ​“We want to make sure that we are answering the call of what people need in the moment.”",https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/itt-images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/5001w.F1Main.GettyImages-2219237857L.jpg?mtime=1767971869,N,,2026-01-21 15:02:27.512584

Quilala,” and then reduced his hours, removed him from an assignment, and ultimately terminated his employment after he complained.
Because the EFAA serves as a statutory limitation on the FAA’s enforcement mandate, the court held that judges must evaluate its applicability as a ""gateway"" question of arbitrability before compelling arbitration.
Substantively, the opinion also clarified the threshold for alleging a sexual harassment dispute sufficient to trigger the EFAA in the employment context.
As a result, none of Quilala’s remaining claims – including those involving wages or general wrongful termination – could be compelled to arbitration.","The First District Court of Appeal’s decision in Quilala v. Securitas Security Services USA, Inc. underscores the significant reach of the federal Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA) in California employment disputes and the judiciary’s principal role in determining the availability of arbitration when sexual assault or harassment claims are alleged. In that case, Francisco Quilala sued his former employer, Securitas, asserting twenty-two causes of action arising from his employment, including claims for sex, gender, and sexual orientation harassment under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). He alleged that supervisors questioned his sexual identity, asked intrusive questions about his sexual activity, spread rumors about his sexual orientation, repeatedly mocked him as “Mrs. Quilala,” and then reduced his hours, removed him from an assignment, and ultimately terminated his employment after he complained. When Securitas moved to compel arbitration under a predispute arbitration agreement signed during onboarding, the trial court denied the motion, concluding that the EFAA barred enforcement of the agreement, and Securitas filed an appeal.

The Court of Appeal held that trial judges possess an independent duty to determine whether a dispute falls within the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Because the EFAA serves as a statutory limitation on the FAA’s enforcement mandate, the court held that judges must evaluate its applicability as a ""gateway"" question of arbitrability before compelling arbitration. In this instance, the trial court raised the EFAA on its own initiative in a tentative ruling, even though the plaintiff had not cited the statute in his opposition. The appellate court emphasized that since the EFAA expressly mandates its applicability be “determined by a court, rather than an arbitrator,” a judge is empowered to raise the issue regardless of whether it was briefed by the parties, provided that fundamental due process is respected.

The appellate court further clarified that the trial court satisfied due process by identifying the EFAA as a potential bar in its tentative ruling and granting the parties an opportunity to argue the matter at the subsequent hearing. Under this framework, there is no obligation for a court to solicit supplemental briefing before relying on the statute. Additionally, the court ruled that a plaintiff “elects” to proceed in court for purposes of the EFAA simply by filing a lawsuit and opposing a motion to compel arbitration. No formal or express invocation of the EFAA is required for a claimant to benefit from its protections, as the act of seeking relief in a judicial forum sufficiently demonstrates that choice.

Substantively, the opinion also clarified the threshold for alleging a sexual harassment dispute sufficient to trigger the EFAA in the employment context. Securitas argued that Quilala’s allegations did not rise to the level of actionable harassment, but the court, applying current FEHA standards, held that conduct altering the conditions of employment need only be “sufficiently pervasive” or “extremely serious” and must be evaluated in light of Government Code section 12923 and recent California Supreme Court authority. The court concluded that repeated derisive references to “Mrs. Quilala,” intrusive and humiliating questions about sexual activity, and adverse actions allegedly tied to perceived sexual orientation described more than “simple teasing” and plausibly alleged a hostile work environment. Because Quilala stated a cognizable sexual harassment claim under FEHA, the court held that the dispute qualified as a “sexual harassment dispute” within the meaning of the EFAA, rendering the predispute arbitration agreement unenforceable once the plaintiff elected to remain in court.

Finally, the Court of Appeal confirmed that once the EFAA applies, it does so at the level of the “case” rather than individual claims, and employers cannot salvage arbitration of non-harassment causes of action by attempting to carve them out. Relying on the statute’s use of the term “case,” and in line with prior California decisions such as Doe v. Second Street Corp., Liu v. Miniso Depot CA, Inc., and Casey v. Superior Court, the court held that the presence of a qualifying sexual harassment claim brings the entire lawsuit within the scope of the EFAA. As a result, none of Quilala’s remaining claims – including those involving wages or general wrongful termination – could be compelled to arbitration. For employers, Quilala serves as a timely reminder that even a single adequately pled sexual harassment claim can invalidate enforcement of an otherwise enforceable arbitration agreement for the entire action and that courts, not arbitrators, will be the ones to make that determination in the first instance.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15036_5440.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:00:51.212941

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under Democratic President Joe Biden helped return Trump, a Republican, to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden's former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

""It's not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people's civil and human rights,"" she told The Associated Press. ""This country has done that before, and it can do it again.""

Violent scenes force a strong Democratic response

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

""I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,"" said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,"" Garcia added, ""which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.""

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats.

On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared with 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

""If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,"" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

""I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what's paying for ICE to be doing this,"" New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last week. ""The cuts to your health care are what's paying for this.""

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

Trump faces his own public opinion challenges

The president's approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling, from 49% in March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

""Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it's going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,"" he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party's strategy since Good's death was captured on video.

""I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,"" he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

""Are we really going to be the Gestapo?"" he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state's Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said ""there's a lot of pain and anguish.""

""It's heartbreaking,"" he said in a recent interview. ""It's chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.""",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-20T222655Z_369020490_RC285JA2I107_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:31.333257

A few days later, the violence ICE is perpetrating in our city arrived, literally, on our doorstep: Armed masked men raided our neighbors’ homes, remaining at our corner for two long hours. As we prayed and cared for those around us, several of our pastors and staff were among those who were pepper-bombed.

Our city is under siege, and when we asked the children in our congregation how they are feeling, they told us, unsurprisingly, that they feel scared. One youth, the child of an immigrant, texted his grandmother in the middle of the night: “I’m scared every day i live in fear and I don’t know what to do if your awake please call me.”

How can we comfort our children? We feel scared too.

We can start by acknowledging that we — unlike Renee Good, unlike George Floyd — have lived to breathe another day. For one more day, we have the privilege of following the way of Jesus, who called on us to feed the hungry, clothe the naked — and welcome the stranger.

And so, in this climate of fear, we turn to that life-affirming work. Immigrant families are afraid to venture outside. We’ve had to cancel our children’s choir practice until we can confidently gather the children safely.

Yet a few children and their moms still rallied to go grocery shopping for immigrant families, delivering boxes to a local McDonald’s where many immigrants work. In distributing Happy Meals to the appreciative children, the assistant manager offered a lesson in how mutual care strengthens the bonds of community. “When you share,” he explained in his accented English, “we share.”

We wish that feeding one another during these terrible times would be enough. But our young people tell us it is not. As one of our youth said, “I want to make sure my friends are not stolen from their families.” Another child asked, “Could you make ICE disappear? They hurt people.”

Jesus understood what it meant to live under an occupying force — in his case, the Roman Empire. He understood the helplessness. He understood the stakes, and yet he persisted in showing us, before ultimately dying from the violence, that another way — a way of love — is possible.

So we will continue to deliver groceries. We will make arrangements so that, if the unfathomable happens, the children can stay with other families. And from the epicenter of this occupation, we send out the children’s plea: Please. Make the people who are hurting people disappear.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN251208_223-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:02:30.435650

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents increasingly have staked out court hearings in the state to arrest people amid President Trump's mass deportation effort. A WBUR analysis previously found court arrests jumped threefold in January through October 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

The legislation would require ICE agents obtain and show a judicial warrant to court personnel in order to take someone into custody at a courthouse for a civil immigration matter, such as overstaying a visa.

Federal agents often arrest people without a judicial warrant for civil infractions. If passed, this law would require a judicial warrant for officers to arrest someone on a civil matter on courthouse grounds in the state.

The proposed law also would ban anyone inside a courthouse from wearing a mask and require all law enforcement officers to identify themselves and state their purpose to court officials.

The East Boston senator said her bill protects access to justice by making sure no one is scared to go to court.

""When you don't feel safe to go to court — especially if you're a witness to a crime — that makes it harder for all of us to feel safe because how are we going to prosecute?"" she said.

Edwards, who co-chairs the Legislature's judiciary committee, said the bill will make it possible for the attorney general to file lawsuits on behalf of Massachusetts residents when there are violations.",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1210_east-boston-court01-1920x1281.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 17:00:19.565822

The United States cannot convincingly claim to stand with Iranian protesters while simultaneously deporting Iranians to a country that it vociferously condemns as repressive.
Temporary Protected Status and the reinstatement of asylum procedures would not resolve the complex challenges facing Iran or U.S.–Iran relations.","Over the past several weeks, protests have once again erupted across Iran, driven by a deepening economic crisis and broader demands for political accountability. In response, the Trump administration has issued strong rhetorical support for Iranian protesters and sharply criticized Tehran’s heavy-handed repression. President Trump and senior officials have repeatedly framed the demonstrations as evidence of the regime’s illegitimacy and brutality toward its own people.

Yet there is a striking contradiction at the heart of the U.S. response. Even as the administration condemns Iran’s treatment of its citizens, it has suspended asylum hearings, maintained sweeping travel restrictions, and deported Iranian nationals from the United States. These actions undercut Washington’s professed concern for human rights and weaken the credibility of its support for protesters inside Iran.

If the United States wishes to align its policies with its rhetoric, it should take an immediate and concrete step: designate Iran for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and fully reinstate asylum procedures. Doing so would not only provide humanitarian relief to vulnerable individuals, but would also send a clear signal that U.S. support for human rights extends beyond words.

What Temporary Protected Status is — and why it matters

Temporary Protected Status is a humanitarian program that Congress authorized to allow nationals of designated countries to remain and work legally in the United States when conditions in their home country make return unsafe. TPS is typically granted in response to armed conflict, natural disasters, or extraordinary and temporary conditions such as political instability and widespread repression.

TPS does not provide permanent residency, nor does it offer a pathway to citizenship. It is, by design, a limited and reversible measure, but it can be lifesaving. For individuals already in the United States, TPS offers protection from deportation, provides work authorization and the ability to live without fear while conditions in their home country remain dangerous.

The current situation in Iran clearly meets the threshold for TPS designation. Protesters have faced mass arrests, violent crackdowns, and internet shutdowns. This is occurring at a time when the Iranian economy is in freefall. Political dissent, whether expressed on the streets, online, or abroad, has been treated as a criminal offense, with protesters being called “enemies of God.” For Iranians who have participated in protests, expressed opposition to the regime, or are simply associated with diaspora activism, forced return carries significant risk.

The gap between rhetoric and policy

The Trump administration has framed itself as a defender of Iranian civil society, issuing direct language to condemn the regime. This rhetorical stance suggests an awareness that U.S. credibility on Iran depends on aligning itself with the Iranian people in this time of flux.

However, domestic immigration policy tells a different story. In recent months, the administration has suspended or delayed asylum hearings, leaving Iranian asylum seekers in legal limbo. It accelerated deportations of Iranian nationals last year. And it has kept longstanding travel bans and visa restrictions in place, reinforcing the perception that it views Iranians primarily as security threats rather than as individuals fleeing persecution.

Why TPS would strengthen US credibility

The administration has moved aggressively to terminate TPS designations for other countries, arguing that the program has been misused to provide indefinite relief rather than temporary protection. Iran presents a distinct case because the administration’s own characterization of the regime as uniquely brutal and unstable suggests that conditions genuinely are extraordinary and temporary — making Iran precisely the kind of situation TPS was designed for.

TPS would bolster American credibility in a number of ways.

First, it would offer immediate protection to Iranian nationals already in the United States who may face retaliation if forced to return. This includes students (who also should be considered for Special Student Relief), scholars, journalists, and family members who have been politically active or simply associated with opposition networks.

Second, TPS would demonstrate that U.S. concern for human rights is not selective or purely symbolic. Unlike sanctions or rhetorical condemnations, which often have indirect or ambiguous effects, TPS directly benefits individuals affected by repression. It is a tangible policy that aligns humanitarian principles with foreign-policy messaging.

Third, TPS would impose little cost on the United States. The Iranian-born population in the U.S. is relatively small, highly educated, and economically integrated. Allowing these individuals to remain and work legally would not strain public resources; in many cases, it would do the opposite by enabling continued participation in the labor market.

Reinstating asylum is equally essential

TPS alone is not sufficient. The administration should also reinstate full asylum processing for Iranian nationals. Asylum is a core commitment under both U.S. law and international refugee conventions. Suspending or delaying hearings during periods of heightened repression effectively denies protection to those most in need.

Importantly, asylum and TPS serve different functions. TPS provides blanket, temporary protection based on country conditions, while asylum offers individualized protection to those who can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. Reinstating asylum procedures would ensure that Iranians with strong claims — such as political activists, religious minorities, or journalists — have access to durable legal protection.

Together, TPS and asylum would form a coherent humanitarian response: immediate protection for many, and long-term solutions for those facing the gravest risks.

Aligning values with action

At its core, the case for TPS for Iranian nationals is about credibility. The United States cannot convincingly claim to stand with Iranian protesters while simultaneously deporting Iranians to a country that it vociferously condemns as repressive. Words of solidarity ring hollow when paired with policies that expose people to harm.

Temporary Protected Status and the reinstatement of asylum procedures would not resolve the complex challenges facing Iran or U.S.–Iran relations. But they would represent a clear, humane, and achievable step toward aligning American actions with American values.",https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2615305755-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:34.389106

The trove appears to be the largest known breach of Department of Homeland Security staff data. It follows the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis.

""It is a sign that people aren't happy within the U.S. government, clearly,"" ICE List founder Dominick Skinner told the Daily Beast.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other officials have condemned the ""doxing"" of agents and threatened to prosecute offenders.

The big picture: This form of strategic hacktivism has been more common overseas in recent years, particularly during uprisings, invasions and geopolitical conflicts.

Think of hackers taking sides in the war in Gaza, or Ukraine mobilizing local hackers at the start of Russia's invasion.

The intrigue: Sensitive data and surveillance have become central to the battle between ICE and those protesting its operations.

DHS directed much of its $75 billion cash infusion from President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act toward new surveillance contracts, including those with Israeli spyware vendors and Palantir to track potential targets for deportation.

U.S. activists have increasingly weaponized leaked data and built counter-surveillance tools since 2020, when the Black Lives Matter protest hit a fever pitch, Cooper Quintin, security researcher and senior public interest technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Axios.

Zoom in: Hackers and digital activists have targeted the wide array of surveillance tools ICE uses in its mass deportation efforts.

Protesters have built tools to map Flock Safety cameras, flag Bluetooth signals from law enforcement surveillance devices, and report ICE raid locations.

One YouTuber found a flaw in Flock cameras that allowed anyone to access the internal interface controlling the live surveillance feed.

The Com, a loose-knit hacker community behind a wave of major data breaches, leaked the personal information of hundreds of DHS and ICE officials in October.

Flashback: These efforts are far more controlled, strategic and quiet than the U.S. is used to seeing from hacktivists, Quintin noted.

Anonymous, the hacking collective known for attacking major companies, governments and religious organizations, leaned on louder tactics — like boasting about its work on YouTube and Twitter — than today's digital protesters.

What to watch: The litigation threats to hackers and other activists chronicling ICE's actions online are very real.

ICE has been pushing courts to give it ""unlimited subpoena authority"" to force social media companies to identify people running anonymous accounts tracking and monitoring the agency's work.

Three women were indicted in September for allegedly following an ICE agent to their home, livestreaming the encounter, and posting the agent's home address on Instagram.",https://images.axios.com/DXq8aPf4mar_sCd5WDgfEiC12P0=/1366x768/smart/2020/04/10/222827-1586557707373.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 12:03:14.475991

Why it matters: Jeffries' opposition comes as Democrats both inside and outside of Congress are lining up against the bill, which they say isn't nearly sufficient to constrain ICE following the shooting of Renee Good.

At least five House Democrats spoke up against the bill in the Wednesday morning meeting, with none speaking for it, sources told Axios.

Swing-district Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.), coming out of the gathering, told reporters he is a ""hell no.""

The progressive group MoveOn ""sent over 40,000 letters in just three days opposing any funding for ICE and Border Patrol until their lawless and dangerous behavior is reined in,"" spokesperson Britt Jacovich told Axios.

Driving the news: Jeffries told his members that Democratic leadership made five requests for ICE accountability measures and other related language that Republicans rejected, several sources told Axios.

As such, he said, he is opposed to the bill even as he supports the other appropriations bills the House is set to vote on separately this week.

Jeffries' speech came after Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Lizzie Fletcher (D-Texas) all spoke against the bill in the meeting, according to sources.

Yes, but: Several battleground-district and centrist Democrats exited the caucus meeting saying they remained undecided on the bill.

That includes Reps. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), the battleground representative to leadership, and Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), the chair of the center-left New Democrat Coalition.

""I'm going to continue to speak with my colleagues and speak to my team around it,"" Rep. John Mannion (D-N.Y.), a swing district member, told Axios.

Between the lines: Lawmakers are under considerable pressure from their grassroots to oppose the bill.

MoveOn urged its members on Tuesday and Wednesday to call their representatives and senators, urging them to oppose the bill, Jacovich said.

MoveOn and Indivisible are also organizing a ""pause on economic daily activities"" in Minnesota — such as school, work and shopping — calling for Congress not to fund ICE.

Said Mannion: ""The American people are demanding, certainly in my district, that there has to be something that resembles law enforcement in this country ... and this is not it.""

State of play: The DHS funding bill is set to be voted on this week, separately from a government spending package that funds the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Transportation.

The DHS bill is likely to pass the House along party lines, though Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), an arch-centrist who negotiated the DHS bill as ranking member of the relevant appropriations subcommittee, told Axios he is a ""yes"" on it.

The other government package, often referred to as a ""minibus,"" is expected to pass the House with bipartisan support.

The bottom line: ""If Democrats in Congress truly want to stop ICE in Minnesota and across the country,"" Jacovich said, ""here's their chance to do it.""

But the aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good during a confrontation with federal agents, has scrambled the party's playbook.
Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

""The cuts to your health care are what's paying for this.""","Democrats had planned to campaign in the midterm elections on affordability and health care, two issues where Americans are particularly unhappy with President Donald Trump. But the aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good during a confrontation with federal agents, has scrambled the party's playbook.

Now Democrats are trying to translate visceral outrage into political strategy, even though there's little consensus on how to press forward on issues where the party has recently struggled to earn voters' trust.

Some Democrats want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a proposal that echoes ""defund the police"" rhetoric from Trump's first term, and impeach administration officials such as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Others have taken a different approach, introducing legislation intended to curb alleged abuses by federal agents. But those ideas have been criticized by activists as insufficient, and there is mounting pressure to obstruct funding for deportations.

""We're Democrats. I'm sure we're going to have 50 different ideas and 50 different ways to say it,"" said Chuck Rocha, a party strategist who is advising several House and Senate candidates on immigration this year.

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under Democratic President Joe Biden helped return Trump, a Republican, to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden's former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

""It's not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people's civil and human rights,"" she told The Associated Press. ""This country has done that before, and it can do it again.""

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

""I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,"" said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,"" Garcia added, ""which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.""

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats. On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared with 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

""If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,"" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

""I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what's paying for ICE to be doing this,"" New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last week. ""The cuts to your health care are what's paying for this.""

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

The president's approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling, from 49% in March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

""Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it's going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,"" he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party's strategy since Good's death was captured on video.

""I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,"" he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

""Are we really going to be the Gestapo?"" he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state's Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said ""there's a lot of pain and anguish.""

""It's heartbreaking,"" he said in a recent interview.

At least six schools in and around South Seattle and Beacon Hill were under shelter-in-place protocols at one point Tuesday, according to Seattle Public Schools: Aki Kurose Middle School, Cleveland STEM High School, Maple Elementary, Mercer International Middle School, Dearborn Park International and Beacon Hill International.

It wasn’t clear whether ICE officers were actually in the area, and the district didn’t provide details about the initial reports that spurred the shelter-in place decisions.

“During shelter‑in‑place, students continue their regular class schedules but remain inside the building,” a district statement said. “Seattle Public Schools Safety and Security staff have been present throughout the day and have not observed any ICE presence. Staff remain on alert as a precaution.”

The district said “a shelter‑in‑place is a standard safety practice often used when there is any reported law enforcement activity nearby.”

While Seattle hasn’t seen a surge in immigration enforcement akin to that currently taking place in Minneapolis, the schools’ actions on Tuesday reflected just how high tensions are — and the effect even unconfirmed reports of ICE presence are having on the daily lives of students and their families.

Aki Kurose lifted its shelter-in-place at noon and Cleveland lifted it after lunch, according to the district. The others were expected to lift it at their dismissal times Tuesday afternoon.

The notifications sent to parents varied in their details: At Cleveland STEM High, Principal Jeff Lam told families in an email Tuesday that there were “credible reports of ICE activity in the community and possibly at other school campuses,” though not at Cleveland.

Maple Elementary School families received a message from principal Daisy Barragan saying a “nearby private school reported suspicious vehicle activity in the neighborhood,” but that there was “no activity directly involving Maple.”

Aki Kurose registrar Katie Jolgren said the middle school was notified by Seattle Public Schools that ICE agents may be trying to draw out families who were warned of ICE activity and were coming to school to pick up their children.

Jolgren said external doors were locked, and students were required to stay inside and couldn’t go to the field or playground. They could only leave if a family member came to pick them up, but it was business as usual inside.

Some parents picked up their children early out of caution, Jolgren said. Security support staff were expected to be watching over pickup and drop-off locations.

At pickup, Kate Reddy, who has a sixth grader and eighth grader at Aki Kurose, said she’d been at work when she got an email notification that the school was under a shelter-in-place order.

She said the incident was “very scary,” and made her think about ways Seattle families could be of help to others: For example, forming a network of community members who could offer carpools to kids whose parents are afraid of encountering ICE agents, she said.

That’s an effort already taking place in Minneapolis, where parents are organizing car rides and perimeter patrols to get students to class safely.

“The things we’re seeing on the news are going to happen here,” said Reddy, who lives in Columbia City. “It made me tear up.”

Parent Josh Apfel had been at home sick with his 13-year-old son when the teen got a text from a friend that Cleveland STEM High School was under a shelter-in-place order. Soon, he got another text from his 12-year-old confirming that Aki Kurose was under a shelter-in-place, too.

“I’ve been expecting things like this, so it’s not a surprise, you know?” Apfel, 53, said.

Apfel texted his child that they were safe inside the school, but that he could pick them up if they wanted. His child declined.

Apfel’s 13-year-old son texted his sibling that he was glad he was home sick from school that day, Apfel said.

According to Fox News (whose reporters the agency brought with them into the area), ICE has already detained nearly 50 people. ICE is reportedly targeting about 1,400 people in the state that it says have criminal convictions.

Of the 50 people that ICE agents (many of whom were masked and all of whom were blurred out in the Fox News footage, which left detainees’ faces unblurred) it’s unclear how many of those people were on the list of people ICE says it’s in the state to target.

Regardless, it’s clear that ICE agents will be spreading fear throughout Maine cities and putting people at risk of detention, deportation, injury or even death. People in the targeted communities are working alongside allies at lower risk to protect and aid people impacted by ICE tactics. Here’s what you can do:

Regardless of who you are or where you’re from or your immigration status, if you think you might be at risk, make a safety plan

Immigration attorneys and community groups recommend that families make a plan before any encounter happens. That includes identifying trusted emergency contacts and memorizing their phone numbers, as well as ensuring children’s schools or day care providers know who is authorized to pick them up.

Parents are encouraged to provide written authorization allowing a trusted adult to make medical and legal decisions for their children if they are detained.

Whether you’re at risk or are an ally, know and defend your rights

If you are engaging with ICE agents in any context, you will probably be scared. But advocates stress the importance of staying calm. Do not run, argue, resist, or physically interfere with officers. You have the right to remain silent when ICE agents question you – but anything you say can later be used in immigration court.

If you’re stopped by someone who identifies as “police”, they may actually be an immigration officer. If this happens, you can ask the officer whether they’re from a local police department or from Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection.

Keep your documents with you If you are a U.S. citizen or have documentation, you may show documentation such as a passport, green card, or work permit. If you do not have documentation, you do not have to answer questions about your immigration or citizenship status.

You don’t have to let ICE agents into your home If officers come to your home, you do not have to open the door unless they present a warrant signed by a judge. ICE administrative warrants — which are signed by ICE officers, not judges — do not give agents permission to enter a home without consent.

If you see ICE activity nearby, stay safe and record Move to a safe indoor space if you believe immigration officers are in the area. Mainers who feel safe may observe and document activity from a distance. You are allowed to video record ICE agents.

Report ICE activity If you see suspected ICE agents, you can contact the Maine ICE Watch Hotline at (207) 544-9989. Trained volunteers verify reports before sharing information with community members.

Try to remember the SALUTE acronym when reporting:

S: Size (How many agents?)

A: Actions (What are they doing?)

L: Location and direction

U: Uniform or clothing

T: Time and date

E: Equipment, including vehicles and license plates

We need a statute of limitations for immigration violations.","Immigration is one of the most divisive issues facing the United States, as it is in many countries. An ICE agent’s killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis is only the latest outrage that has brought the issue to the fore.

Facing a 30 January deadline to renew funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, Democrats are now insisting on limits on ICE, at risk of another shutdown. It may be a pipe dream, but it is worth asking whether now might finally be a time to forge the long-elusive bipartisan agreement on immigration.

I believe deeply in the value of immigration – my father was an immigrant, as were my mother’s parents – but even I must admit that the current system needs fixing. Until recently, immigrants flooded the US-Mexican border. Rather than trying to sneak across as in years past, most presented themselves at a formal border crossing and sought asylum.

They proceeded entirely lawfully, but because their numbers overwhelmed the asylum system, it could take years for a claim to be considered, effectively allowing long-term residence in the United States before any ruling on the merits. That contributed to the perception that the asylum system was broken.

Joe Biden’s administration addressed the problem by maintaining the theoretical right to seek asylum but imposing restrictions, including making many migrants wait in Mexico where they were vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Donald Trump has essentially withdrawn the right to seek asylum at the border, denying people fleeing war and persecution the opportunity to find a safe haven.

So what is the solution? Given the prominence that Trump gave the issue during his campaign, it is safe to read his 2024 electoral victory as a mandate to tighten enforcement at the border. That could involve beefing up border patrols to deter people from sneaking in. It could even involve extending his notorious wall.

But rather than destroy the right to seek asylum, a more appropriate response would be to increase the number of immigration judges – a funding issue – so that claims could be heard fairly yet expeditiously. Cutting the backlog would greatly decrease the time that asylum seekers without valid claims stay in the country.

Trump’s deportation raids in neighborhoods and workplaces are far more controversial. Of the estimated 14 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, at least two-thirds and possibly as many as 80% have been in the country for five or more years. About 45% have been in the country for 20 years or more.

The equities of deporting them are very different from deporting a recently arrived immigrant. The recent arrival has put down few if any roots. But immigrants who have been in the country for five or more years often will have US citizen spouses and children. They typically will hold jobs, pay taxes and have friends and relationships in the community. In short, the look like Americans in all but the papers they carry.

Advocates of tighter immigration enforcement justify deporting them by noting that they are in the country “illegally”. But that’s not the end of the matter.

If a person is accused of a crime, the criminal code contains a statute of limitations that, other than for the most serious conduct, bars prosecution unless charges are filed within five years of the alleged offense. Even most civil-law violations have a statute of limitations. That doctrine reflects in part the view that, even if someone’s conduct is illegal, they should be allowed at some stage to move on with their lives – that there is something unfair about upending their lives for something they did years ago.

A crime is more serious than merely entering or staying in the United States without authorization, but in this respect US law treats the issue more severely: there is no recognized statute of limitations for immigration violations. An undocumented immigrant can be detained and deported even if they have had productive lives in the United States for many years or decades.

Some prior administrations have tacitly recognized this unfairness by focusing immigration enforcement on recent arrivals along the border – a policy rather than a legal solution. Trump’s raids in neighborhoods and workplaces across the country end that approach.

We need a statute of limitations for immigration violations. If immigrants have not committed a serious crime while in the United States, as few of those being deported by Trump have done, they should be allowed to stay if they have been in the country more than five years. Immigration opponents will undoubtedly howl that this is a dreaded “amnesty”, but it is no different from the statute of limitations that already exists in the criminal law, which hardly could be said to amnesty criminality.

Why would immigration opponents support this measure? Because it could be part of a grand bargain. In return for beefing up enforcement at the border and increasing the capacity of the asylum system to expedite rulings, we would recognize the unfairness of deporting people who have built lives in the United States.

That is the right thing to do. It would be a nod to reality, since the truth is that despite the high profile of Trump’s deportation raids, they are capturing only a tiny fraction of undocumented immigrants.

There would also be political advantages to both sides. Democrats would make clear that they do not stand for open borders, which are broadly unpopular. And Republicans could rid themselves of ICE conduct that is becoming toxic as Americans sour on the idea of summarily deporting their colleague at work or their neighbor down the street.

A grand bargain on immigration wouldn’t solve everything. It wouldn’t determine how many immigrants should be admitted as skilled workers, allowed family unification, resettled as refugees, or granted temporary protected status. But it could address a big part of what Americans have found wrong with the old approach to immigration and what they dislike about Trump’s new approach.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61a2f16411ff10c24194387000942e2412a2fd06/362_0_2325_1860/master/2325.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=38db51791e51750475111a1fb8fda500",N,,2026-01-21 12:02:59.791697

Trump’s fragile political standing is one indication that the administration’s narrative is increasingly at “odds with what people see – their lived experience”, Ben-Ghiat said.","Three hundred and sixty-five days after Donald Trump swore his oath of office and completed an extraordinary return to power, many historians, scholars and experts say his presidency has pushed American democracy to the brink – or beyond it.

In the first year of Trump’s second term, the democratically elected US president has moved with startling speed to consolidate authority: dismantling federal agencies, purging the civil service, firing independent watchdogs, sidelining Congress, challenging judicial rulings, deploying federal force in blue cities, stifling dissent, persecuting political enemies, targeting immigrants, scapegoating marginalized groups, ordering the capture of a foreign leader, leveraging the presidency for profit, trampling academic freedom and escalating attacks on the news media.

The scale and velocity of what he has been able to accomplish in just a year have stunned even longtime observers of authoritarian regimes, pushing the debate among academics and Americans from whether the world’s oldest continuous democracy is backsliding to whether it can still faithfully claim that distinction.

“In 2025, the United States ceased to be a full democracy in the way that Canada, Germany or even Argentina are democracies,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, the prominent Harvard political scientists and authors of How Democracies Die, and the University of Toronto professor Lucan Way, wrote in Foreign Affairs last month. They argued that the US under Trump had “descended into competitive authoritarianism”, a system in which elections are held but the ruling party abuses power to stifle dissent and tilt the playing field in its favor.

There is no universally accepted definition of democracy. Some argue the US is a “flawed” or “illiberal” democracy, or a democracy facing substantial “autocratization” – a process that began long before Trump came to power a decade ago but which his presidency has rapidly accelerated. Still, others believe the concerns are overblown, or reflect an intense partisan dislike of the current president.

Since Trump’s first term, scholars have warned that it can happen here. But many now say this moment is different – not only because Trump’s approach is more methodical and his desire for vengeance more pronounced, but because he now faces far fewer internal constraints.

The president’s Republican critics have mostly been driven from public office and those who remain say they fear retaliation for speaking out. Trump has repeatedly circumvented the GOP-controlled Congress, on spending, tariffs and war powers. And the US’s European allies are scrambling to respond to Trump’s threats to acquire Greenland, by force if necessary. In an interview with the New York Times earlier this month, Trump declared that the only constraint on his presidential power was “my own morality”.

Quantitive assessments of the country’s democratic health point are bleak.

Ratings of US democracy by scholars – and Americans overall – dropped “significantly” after Trump took office last year, according to data from Bright Line Watch, a non-partisan democracy-monitoring initiative that surveys political scientists and the public on potential threats and erosions. In its September survey, experts rated US democracy 54 on a 100-point scale, placing the country closer to illiberal or hybrid regimes than to the full democracies of G7 peers such as Canada or the United Kingdom.

An assessment by the Century Foundation’s new democracy indexing project found that the US had recorded a staggering 28% “collapse” in democratic health over the past year – from 79/100 in 2024 to 57/100 in 2025, the kind of sudden decline more typically associated with coup or other major shock.

Nate Schenkkan, the report’s lead author and a former research director at Freedom House, hoped to help Americans distinguish between the “push-pull” of partisan politics and the “authoritarian behavior” of the current administration.

“When a major change happens in a political system, it’s very unevenly distributed,” Schenkkan said. “Certain people will feel it first. Certain communities will feel it harder and faster. And it is really important to recognize that just because it hasn’t come to you doesn’t mean that it won’t.”

The sense of alarm is especially acute among those who witnessed democratic backsliding elsewhere. Last year, a network of former intelligence and national security professionals applied the same analytical methods they once used to assess the fragility of democracies abroad to the United States. In October, they published an intelligence-style report, concluding with “moderate to high confidence” that the country was “on a trajectory” toward authoritarian rule.

The White House has repeatedly rejected claims that the president’s actions amount to authoritarianism, dismissing such criticism as “deeply unserious” and rooted in what the president calls “Trump derangement syndrome”. When pressed, the president has said he was handed a broad mandate to restore “law and order”, secure elections and dismantle what he has described as a corrupt federal bureaucracy.

“Here’s the reality: President Trump was resoundingly re-elected by the American people based on his America First agenda,” White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, said in a statement. “Now, he’s delivering on all his campaign promises – that’s democracy in action.”

Not all scholars agree that American democracy is in imminent peril. Some are wary that democracy indices rely too heavily on subjective indicators, which can amplify pessimism and media alarm over objective markers of democratic breakdown.

“I think we should be a little cautious – not that the experts are necessarily wrong,” said Andrew Little, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, whose research has found that scholars who rate democratic threats tend toward pessimism. He favors a “minimalist” approach to measuring the health of a democracy: “Is the country having free elections, and are people following the results of those elections?”

Especially worrying for scholars of contemporary authoritarianism is the president’s close relationship with tech billionaires, or the so-called “broligarchy”, many of whom donated to and were front and center at his inauguration ceremony a year ago. At the start of his presidency, Trump appointed the Tesla and SpaceX head, Elon Musk, to lead the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge.

Oligarchs typically exert influence from the outside, said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a prominent historian and author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present. But with Doge, the “oligarch of oligarchs was allowed to come inside the government and was basically given the key to access our treasury, the payment systems and data systems of a superpower”, she said. “So we are innovating the autocratic playbook.”

While at the White House, Musk took a chainsaw to the federal government, firing thousands of workers in sweeping, indiscriminate cuts that were quickly challenged in court. Estimates suggest more than 300,000 federal workers left in the Trump-era exodus, draining the government of top scientists, researchers and analysts.

Traditionally autocratic regimes expand social services for supporters as a way to buy loyalty, while stripping away their political rights, Ben-Ghiat said: “That’s how they get so many people to go along and look the other way.” But Trump, she said, has diverged from that model: rather than shoring up the social safety net, his administration, abetted by congressional Republicans, has moved to “kneecap” public health and social programs, including childcare benefits – cuts Democrats plan to foreground in this year’s midterm elections.

Even the most grim assessments stress that democratic decline is not irreversible – and warn that fatalism itself can accelerate backsliding.

“History suggests that it is possible to recover from democratic erosion – but far from a guarantee,” Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College and a co-director of Bright Line Watch, said by email.

Staying engaged, protesting, voting and supporting Republicans who dissent were all ways to contest Trump’s power, he said, adding: “The survival of democracy depends on people believing in its continued viability and fighting to defend it.”

Last year, millions joined No Kings rallies to denounce a president they say has wielded power like a monarch.

At the ballot box, Democrats won a series of victories in the 2025 off-year elections, and are well positioned to retake the House – and possibly the Senate – in the 2026 midterms. Trump, meanwhile, remains unpopular nationally – a vulnerability for his party heading into this year’s elections. A CNN poll found that a majority of Americans believe Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, and 58% call his first year a failure.

Trump’s fragile political standing is one indication that the administration’s narrative is increasingly at “odds with what people see – their lived experience”, Ben-Ghiat said. The more that gap widens, she said, “the more people will wake up”.

She pointed to Minneapolis, where Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act as a response to protests against the killing of a 37-year-old US citizen by a federal immigration officer. Instead of retreating, hundreds of Minnesotans registered for training to become “observers” of enforcement activity.

In the courts, Trump’s executive actions have been met with robust legal resistance. The ACLU, which has filed over 200 legal challenges against the Trump administration in the past year, touted a nearly 65% success rate in “defeating, delaying, or diluting federal policies”.

“We judge the moment we’re in not by examining the president’s actions alone, but by evaluating the system’s response to those provocations as well,” Ben Wizner, deputy legal director at the ACLU, said.

Despite the supreme court’s conservative supermajority – cemented by Trump in his first term – and the president’s sustained campaign to delegitimize judges, Wizner retained a measured optimism: “I am confident that we will emerge from this latest stress test to our democracy with our fundamental rights intact.”

Looking ahead, many scholars predict Trump’s assault on democratic norms and the rule of law is likely to worsen in the lead-up to the 2026 midterms – an erosion that could become entrenched if Democrats fail to secure a check on his presidency by winning back a chamber of Congress.

The most recent Bright Line survey found experts increasingly worried about political violence following the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Concerns also focused on the administration’s aggressive response to peaceful protest, the weaponization of government agencies to punish political opponents, and the president’s unprecedented push to gerrymander congressional districts in Republican states.

Elsewhere, Democrats and political observers have raised fears that Trump could dispatch the national guard to polling places as an intimidation tactic, while others worry about the expansion of ICE operations in Democratic-run cities.

In an interview with Reuters last week, Trump mused that he had accomplished so much in 2025, “we shouldn’t even have an election” in 2026. The White House said he was “simply joking”. Though the federal government cannot unilaterally cancel the midterms, Trump has already taken extraordinary steps to try to change how elections are conducted.

“Autocrats try to convince us that we’re hopeless and helpless. That they’re always going to be there, and there’s no point in resisting,” Ben-Ghiat said. But political dissidents of repressive regimes know better, she said, recalling a conversation with Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal colony.

She had asked Navalnaya how she viewed the US after Trump’s return to power. “You still have elections,” she replied. “And you can use them.”

But there’s a personal issue for just about any Illinois resident among the dozens of fights Raoul’s office is waging against the White House, the Democratic AG said while marking a year since President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Raoul’s office has joined or filed 51 lawsuits challenging administration policies since then, and has submitted more than 100 amicus briefs in the process to push back against sweeping funding cuts, military deployments in Chicago, restrictions on gender-affirming care, environmental protection rollbacks and other Trump priorities.

Raoul called it “365 days of chaos, 365 days of attacks upon civil rights, on the rule of law, and on the Constitution itself.”

“We are not demoralized, and we are certainly not exhausted,” Raoul said in front of his team of attorneys at the state’s West Loop office building. “We are standing our ground to defend the rights of the people of Illinois and the rule of law, and we’re winning in the courts.”

He pointed to Trump’s failed effort to federalize the National Guard to patrol the streets of Chicago as “an example of why to remain optimistic.” Trump gave up that effort — for now — after the conservative U.S. Supreme Court declined to lift a lower court’s block on the deployment.

Perhaps the premier court fight for Raoul’s office early in 2026 is the state’s legal challenge against Trump’s “occupation of Illinois and Chicago” by an influx of federal immigration agents.

“Our communities have faced masked agents with semi-automatic rifles who have created war zones by using tear gas, chemical weapons, and pepper balls against our law-abiding neighbors, including local police officers and journalists,” Raoul said. “We faced it here, we witnessed it in Los Angeles, in Portland, and now we watch the horror unfolding in Minnesota.”

Conversely, the same policies lambasted by Raoul and other Illinois Democratic leaders were celebrated by the White House Tuesday on a list of “365 wins in 365 days” for Trump, including driving “the number of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children crossing into the country to a record low.”

The president highlighted “targeted enforcement operations in Chicago, resulting in the city’s fewest murders since 1965” — although in fact, the White House can’t take all credit for crime falling in the city. It started dropping before he took office, and experts have yet to fully explain why violent crime figures have fallen precipitously in Chicago and beyond since a COVID-19 pandemic spike.

“It’s been an amazing period of time,” Trump said in the White House press briefing room, boasting of accomplishing “more than any other administration has done by far.”

Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender who has positioned himself as one of the most forceful national voices against Trump, staged a roundtable at an Uptown coffee shop with local business owners and other professionals decrying the effects of Trump policies, from reduced day care funding to increased supply prices.

“When tariffs go up, Illinois manufacturers feel it,” Pritzker said. “When trade wars escalate, Illinois farmers pay the price. When health care costs surge, Illinois families have to make impossible choices, and when Washington breaks its promises, real people bear the consequences.”

Pritzker underscored “the uncertainty that has caused more than just anxiety. It’s actually keeping people away from seeking services… They’re threatening to take something away, then we take them to court and it gets restored.”

Raoul suggested his office could use more resources from state lawmakers to stay afloat in the sea of legal battles. He pushed for increased funding from Springfield in last year’s budget season, though that $15 million boost was mostly neutralized by a decline in proceeds from his office’s other litigation.

“The strain has been a real one,” Raoul said. “But even if we didn’t have this type of administration, I would be appealing to the General Assembly to do more, so we can serve the public in all areas.”

Pritzker will deliver his budget proposal next month, with lawmakers on the clock to pass a spending plan by the end of May.

“Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop.","Three hours before Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s inauguration, former Gov. Phil Murphy pocket vetoed a pair of bills designed to protect the rights of New Jersey’s immigrants, drawing ire from advocates who had pushed Murphy to sign the lame-duck legislation before his departure.

In a press release, Murphy said he would reject a data-privacy bill because of a “drafting oversight” that would have put the legislation into conflict with federal law. Murphy said the second bill — which would have codified the Immigrant Trust Directive, a policy that generally bars New Jersey police from cooperating with federal agents on civil immigration enforcement — goes beyond the initial policy, potentially opening the Immigrant Trust Directive to a court challenge.

“Re-opening the door to judicial scrutiny of our State’s immigration policies, combined with the Trump Administration’s increasingly targeted actions against states and cities, is a recipe for disaster for our immigrant brothers and sisters and puts them in greater danger,” Murphy said in the release. “And that is not something I am willing to risk when the Directive is secure for the foreseeable future.”

The Legislature cannot override a pocket veto.

The two bills were part of a trio of immigration-related bills that landed on Murphy’s desk last week. Murphy signed the third: the “Safe Communities Act” directs New Jersey’s attorney general to develop policies requiring “sensitive” locations — like schools, hospitals, and courthouses — to remain accessible to all residents.

Immigrant advocates like Nedia Morsy, the executive director of Make the Road New Jersey, said the bills were designed to act like a package. The New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, a coalition of New Jersey-based organizations pushing immigration rights, said Murphy “walked away from his promise.”

“The three immigrant protection bills were designed to work together—to protect families not only in public spaces, but also from surveillance, data sharing, and coercive entanglement with federal immigration enforcement,” Morsy said in a release. “Our communities asked for protection, and today, they were denied.”

The first bill would have limited the collection of certain data, like immigration status and place of birth. Murphy said the legislation included a “drafting oversight” that wasn’t noticed until after the bill was on his desk; he said the oversight could have cost the state billions in federal funding.

Murphy said he is “hopeful that the Legislature will reintroduce and pass this version of the legislation in the coming weeks so it can be signed into law at the soonest possible opportunity.” If the Legislature does so, it will be up to Sherrill to sign the bill.

Former Attorney General Gurbir Grewal implemented the Immigrant Trust Directive in 2018 in an effort to build trust between the state’s law enforcement agencies and immigrants. A6310, the second bill Murphy pocket vetoed, would have codified the Immigrant Trust Directive. The directive has survived several challenges in court, but Murphy says the bill deviates slightly from the directive, putting the directive at risk.

“I am extremely concerned that signing this bill, which differs from the Immigrant Trust Directive, would open New Jersey up to a new court challenge and renewed judicial scrutiny from judges who may not render the same decision upholding these critical protections,” Murphy said. “Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop. I cannot in good conscience allow that to happen.”

Viri Martinez, the deputy director of strategy at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said Murphy’s decision was defined by fear.

“This decision reflects how Trump’s authoritarian playbook has seeped into our state, paralyzing decisive leadership and allowing fear, rather than values, to dictate who is protected and who is left behind,” Martinez said. “There is no other way to describe Governor Murphy’s refusal to sign all three immigrant protection bills but fear of the Trump administration, elevated above the will of the people.”",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/KBS_0975-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:45.967505

I just spoke out for Palestinian rights.
For months, I slept in a plastic shell, known as a “boat,” surrounded by cockroaches and only a thin blanket.
Leqaa Kordia is a 33-year-old Palestinian woman and New Jersey resident currently detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.","For more than 10 months, I have been locked in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Alvarado, Texas.

My arrest came after my participation in protests for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s siege on Gaza at the gates of Columbia University in April 2024. The Department of Homeland Security publicly stated that it had targeted me because of my advocacy for Palestinian rights.

Though I was not a student, I felt compelled to participate. After all, Israel, with the backing of the United States, has laid waste to Gaza, forcibly displacing my family, killing nearly 200 of my relatives.

Since that time, an immigration judge has twice called for my release. But the Trump administration has exploited rarely used procedural loopholes to keep me confined, a practice now being challenged in federal district courts across the country, with many finding the practice unconstitutional.

My detention began on March 13, 2025, when I voluntarily went to ICE headquarters in Newark, New Jersey, for what I believed to be routine immigration questions. I came to the United States on a valid visa in 2016, and mistakenly relinquished my student visa on my path to pursuing permanent residency through my U.S. citizen mother.

Instead, I was thrown into an unmarked van and sent 1,500 miles away from my home in Paterson, New Jersey, where I had been working various jobs in waitressing and retail to help support myself, my mother and my younger brother with special needs.

I am not a threat. I just spoke out for Palestinian rights.

I don't consider myself a leader or an activist. I am a devout Muslim who is deeply committed to my faith and community. I am a daughter, a sister and a best friend. I’m a Palestinian woman who enjoys playing the oud, making pottery and hiking. Speaking out against what rights groups and experts have called a genocide is my moral duty and – I thought – a constitutionally protected right for all in this country. Except, it seems, when that speech defends Palestinian life.

I was spurred to action by my conscience and personal loss, inasmuch as I was by my lived experience growing up as a Palestinian under Israel’s brutal military rule.

I was born in occupied East Jerusalem and raised in the West Bank with my father. I grew up smelling tear gas on a daily basis and seeing him humiliated by Israeli soldiers. I once woke up to an Israeli soldier pointing his rifle at my head as I lay in bed. I was only 9 years old.

I spent the first few years of my life in Gaza with my mother until the Israeli siege no longer made travel back and forth possible. I was separated from her for nearly 20 years before reuniting with her here in the United States in 2016. In a cruel twist of fate, I now find myself forcibly cut off from her once again.

I am neither a flight risk nor a national security threat, as Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has claimed.

In a landmark decision in 2025, Judge William Young found the Trump administration’s efforts to revoke visas, detain and deport noncitizens ‒ such as Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi and Badar Khan Suri ‒ for their pro-Palestinian activism were unconstitutional, because they enjoy the same free speech rights as U.S. citizens.

All have been released, but their fight against this administration's ideological deportation and enforcement policy continues. It is past time for me to be released as well.

Through my continued detention, the Trump administration aims to send a chilling message: People who speak out for Palestinian rights or criticize Israel will face retribution. This is not only morally outrageous and unconstitutional; it is deeply unpopular among Americans.

If Donald Trump is willing to trample on the Constitution to silence critics of Israel, how can he call himself an America First president? Why is his administration spending taxpayer dollars keeping me and others locked up for protesting a genocide instead of funding schools and health care?

ICE detainees are people, too. No one deserves to be treated this way.

Inside the ICE facility where I’m being held, conditions are filthy, overcrowded and inhumane. For months, I slept in a plastic shell, known as a “boat,” surrounded by cockroaches and only a thin blanket. Privacy does not exist here.

As an observant Muslim woman, I struggle to find a clean, quiet space to pray. I have lost a significant amount of weight. The food is so bad that it makes me vomit. I now avoid eating it, instead opting to consume packaged food from the commissary. Despite my continued requests, I have been denied reasonable access to halal food.

Still, I consider myself one of the lucky ones. Many women come and go through this hall of sorrows, and I try my best to help them where I can. There are others with me who cannot afford legal representation. Some have diabetes or terminal cancer, or are wheelchair bound.

Ours is a daily battle for basic dignity. None of us deserve to be treated this way. All of our voices deserve to be heard. I think, too, of the thousands of Palestinians languishing in Israeli prisons, who are subject to beatings, torture and starvation.

My detention has only increased my resolve to be a more vocal advocate for all people facing injustice.

I solemnly marked my 33rd birthday in detention. Like most people my age, I have many dreams and goals. But more than anything, I long for my freedom, to return to my mother’s warm embrace and to help her care for my younger brother.

But this story is much bigger than me. It is about the struggle for the liberation of all Palestinians and those who speak up for a freer and more just world inasmuch as it is a struggle for the soul of America.

The U.S. may have moved on to another immigration crisis, but Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student who was arrested last spring after participating in pro-Palestine protests, is still in the middle of his legal battle. Khalil was taken into custody in March, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely used mechanism in federal immigration law that claimed that the student’s actions would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” The 30-year-old green-card holder was detained for three months, missing the birth of his first child, but was released in June. Last week, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a devastating blow to Khalil’s case: A three-judge panel dismissed his habeas corpus petition challenging the federal government’s attempts to detain and deport him.

In a 2–1 decision, the court ruled that the lower district court of New Jersey—which had ordered Khalil to be released from immigration detention in June—did not have jurisdiction to consider his habeas petition. The panel’s majority declared that these petitions challenging a final order of removal can be heard only in immigration court, a system overseen by the attorney general, who also handpicks immigration judges.

Khalil essentially has one option left before being forced to go through immigration court: request a rehearing en banc. If that is approved, all 14 judges on the 3rd Circuit would hear Khalil’s case. But not only does the current makeup of this particular court lean conservative; it received a notable new member last year—Emil Bove. A former defense attorney for President Donald Trump and the former deputy attorney general, Bove has been mired in controversy throughout his tenure in the second Trump administration.

To make sense of Khalil’s options, I spoke with Elora Mukherjee. A professor at Columbia Law School and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Mukherjee submitted an amicus brief in defense of Khalil, along with other students, scholars, and professors who have been charged under the same foreign-policy deportability ground that Khalil currently faces. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: Before we get into the 3rd Circuit’s latest opinion, can you bring us up to speed on how exactly Khalil’s case ended up there?

Elora Mukherjee: On the night that Khalil was wrongly arrested, detained, and targeted for his speech—peaceful speech that should be protected by the First Amendment—he was initially detained at his apartment in graduate student housing at Columbia University. That night, his lawyers immediately filed a federal habeas petition for him with the Southern District of New York.

But by the time that petition was formally filed in federal court, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had already transferred Khalil to a detention center in northern New Jersey. For that reason, the initial federal judge assigned to Khalil’s case in SDNY found that he didn’t have jurisdiction to hear the habeas petition. Instead, he transferred it to the New Jersey federal district court. That transfer was done over the objection of the federal government, which argued that because Khalil was detained in Louisiana, the case should be either dismissed outright or transferred to the federal district court for the Western District of Louisiana.

The federal government again tried to get Khalil’s case transferred to Louisiana by filing a motion with the New Jersey district court but was denied. Eventually, the question [of who should hear the case] landed with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

And what do you make of the circuit court’s latest opinion?

The decision is wrong. It was a split decision with two judges in the majority and one judge in the dissent. Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas were in the majority—President George W. Bush appointed Hardiman, and Trump appointed Bibas during his first term. The majority interprets provisions of immigration law that were introduced with the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act as stripping federal courts of jurisdiction to hear the constitutional claims of individuals like Khalil, who are alleging that their rights are being irreparably harmed.

According to these two judges, Khalil is not eligible to file a federal habeas petition. The only recourse available to him is to raise any defenses that he has, first in his immigration court proceedings before the Board of Immigration Appeals, then to the federal circuit court that has jurisdiction over the immigration court that initially heard his removal proceedings—in this case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

This is exactly what the Trump administration wants. The government has claimed that the jurisdiction stripping provisions of the IIRAIRA are broad in cases over the years, but that position has consistently been rejected in federal courts—including, most recently, in the U.S. Supreme Court, in Jennings v. Rodriguez, a case from 2018. In the Jennings case and in similar cases, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have consistently affirmed that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas claims.

If the right to habeas corpus is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, how can the 3rd Circuit essentially take that away from Khalil?

This is what much of this litigation has been about. The Trump administration’s position is that there should be only one proceeding, and the only proceeding that Khalil is entitled to contest is in Louisiana immigration court. Once he loses in immigration court, he can appeal that to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Once he loses at the BIA, he can appeal that to the relevant federal circuit court, which for him, the administration would argue, is the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. That would be the administration’s position because Khalil was detained for the longest period of time in the Western District of Louisiana, and Louisiana is where the immigration judge issued the removal order against him.

In my view, and the position of reasonable people across party lines who care about the rule of law, is that federal habeas proceedings must be available to individuals who are targeted by the executive branch in violation of basic constitutional protections. There is a doctrine that allows for people to go to federal court and file habeas petitions when their constitutional rights have been violated, and it doesn’t require waiting months or years to first exhaust the immigration court proceedings, waiting again for the BIA to rule, and finally getting to a federal circuit court of appeals. By that point in time, Khalil could have been detained for months or years, during which time he would have suffered irreparable harm because of the Trump administration’s violation of his First Amendment rights.

The quick summary of this doctrine is this: If a person is suffering irreparable harm affecting their constitutional rights, then they should be able to seek relief through federal habeas court proceedings without first needing to wait months or years for their immigration proceedings to be exhausted.

Can Khalil appeal the 3rd Circuit’s decision? What options does he have now?

He can request a rehearing en banc with the 3rd Circuit, which is an opportunity for all the judges on the court to rehear his case. The full en banc panel could request a new briefing on these issues from both sides, asking what they think about the panel decision that was issued last week, and it would be extremely likely to have oral arguments. All the judges on the court would have a chance to weigh in on the en banc court’s final opinion, or opinions, as there would likely be a split decision from the 3rd Circuit, given the makeup of that court.

Through the Biden administration, the 3rd Circuit was considered a swing court, in that its makeup was about half appointees from Democratic presidents and about half appointees by Republican presidents. In the last year or so of the Biden administration, there was an opportunity to appoint a judge to the circuit that would result in the court being composed of a slight majority of federal judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Unfortunately, as the Biden administration ended, it left a vacant seat on the 3rd Circuit, and last year that seat was filled by Emil Bove.

If the en banc’s majority also ends up ruling against Khalil, at that point he would have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court grants cert in Khalil’s case and issues an opinion, it would likely have consequences for other noncitizen students and scholars who have spoken out against the Trump administration. It also could have broader consequences for noncitizens who are trying to seek habeas relief after they have been wrongly arrested and detained by the executive branch.

While this case has been unfolding, Khalil has had a separate legal challenge active in Louisiana’s immigration court. What’s going on with that one?

This is very confusing, because there are multiple proceedings taking place simultaneously. So there is a proceeding in immigration court in Louisiana, and that is taking place before an agency called the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It’s housed within the Department of Justice and is presided over by an immigration judge. This is one track that was proceeding at the same time the federal habeas proceedings were going forward in the District of New Jersey.

My understanding is that his case is currently pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals. I don’t know what the briefing schedule is, but it’s worth mentioning that over the past year the Trump administration has fired or reassigned all the reasonable members of the BIA. In 2025, I believe, with one exception, dozens and dozens of cases and opinions issued by the board almost uniformly narrowed the protections available to noncitizens. So there are real questions about whether the BIA is still a meaningful administrative appellate body.

Immigration judges here are also hired by the attorney general, but over the past year, more than 100 immigration judges who didn’t toe the administration’s party line have been fired—they don’t have any of the protections, such as life tenure, that one expects of federal judges. And in hiring announcements for what has historically been called immigration judges, the administration is now calling them deportation judges. The Trump administration is very clear about what it wants these administrative law officers to do. Lastly, the federal district court in the Western District of Louisiana has, the last time I checked, the lowest grant rate for federal habeas petitions in the country. Plus, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is known for being the least likely federal appeals court to protect people’s civil rights.",https://compote.slate.com/images/b5746aa0-0174-4dd2-8cfc-4ddea2628c75.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-21 11:03:28.146698

According to the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the naturalization ceremonies — two sessions, each swearing in about 1,300 people from more than 80 countries — are expected to proceed as scheduled, even as the region has become a flashpoint in the national debate over immigration enforcement.

The setting itself carried symbolic weight. The Pasadena Civic Auditorium will be filled not with celebrities but with former refugees, green-card holders, and longtime residents who had passed civics tests, submitted to background checks, and waited years for this moment. The ceremony itself would last barely 45 minutes.

Since Dec. 2, when the Trump administration expanded its travel ban to 39 countries following the shooting of National Guard members in Washington, D.C., by an Afghan national, some naturalization applicants have been “pulled out of line” at ceremonies nationwide — their approvals revoked at the last moment, their oaths deferred indefinitely. The ceremonies continued around them.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has “paused all adjudications for aliens from high-risk countries,” according to agency Policy Memo PM-602-0192, issued Dec. 2, 2025, “while USCIS works to ensure that all aliens from these countries are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

The affected nations span Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and Central America — including Afghanistan, Somalia, Haiti, Venezuela, El Salvador, and Guatemala.

It is not known if any of Wednesday’s 2,600 scheduled applicants received last-minute cancellation notices. USCIS does not publicly disclose the figures.

But the agency’s own data from past Pasadena ceremonies suggests the impact could be significant: at a June 2019 ceremony, the top five countries of origin were Mexico, the Philippines, China, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Two of those nations — El Salvador and Guatemala — are now on the restricted list.

More than 117 Democratic members of Congress have signed a letter to the Department of Homeland Security secretary and USCIS director condemning the selective cancellations. Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington has led efforts demanding that USCIS disclose the number of affected individuals and provide a timeline for ending the pause.

For those who do take the oath on Wednesday, the ceremony follows a script unchanged for generations. Applicants arrive hours early for security screening and document verification. They surrender their green cards — the plastic rectangles that had defined their legal status, sometimes for decades.

As the president wages war against the Fed for not lowering interest rates quicker, Trump has looked to sack Fed governor Lisa Cook by accusing her of mortgage fraud, which she denies.

Lower courts sided with Cook. The justices have punted a decision for months on Trump’s emergency appeal until they hold oral arguments, which are set to kick off at 10 a.m. EST.

Here’s what to watch for as the argument gets underway:

How the justices interpret ‘for cause’

The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 only permits the president to remove Fed governors “for cause.”

The statute does not explicitly define “cause.” Wednesday’s case turns on how the justices interpret it.

Everyone concedes that disagreeing with a governor’s votes on interest rates isn’t sufficient. Beyond that, the sides diverge.

The Trump administration contends that “for cause” gives the president broad discretion to fire Fed governors for reasons related to their conduct, ability, fitness or competence.

If the justices agree, the administration says it’s an easy case and that the mortgage fraud accusations against Cook easily pass the test.

Cook’s lawyers push back. They say Congress intended “for cause” to be comparable to the standard in place at a handful of other independent agencies, which spell out inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance as the three preconditions to firing.

Watch to see if the justices agree with the Trump administration’s proposal, or if they agree with the concerns of Cook that it would imperil the Fed’s independence.

Does Cook’s due process argument gain steam

Regardless of whether Trump had valid “cause,” Cook will advance several other arguments Wednesday.

She asserts that due process protections under the Constitution and federal law guaranteed her a hearing to deny the mortgage fraud accusations.

“She unequivocally does, and she is prepared to refute the allegations in an appropriate forum,” Cook’s lawyers wrote.

The Trump administration says no such hearing is legally required and that Cook has not explained what it would look like or how it would make any difference.

Additionally, the administration will try to convince the justices that even if she was wrongfully removed, the lower courts had no power to grant an injunction reinstating Cook as the litigation plays out.

If the justices tip their hand on FTC decision

The case comes to the court weeks after the justices heard arguments on Trump’s power to fire Rebecca Slaughter, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

The cases both involve the bounds of Trump’s presidential power, but they raise distinct issues.

At the Fed, Trump purports to have valid cause in sacking Cook.

But at the FTC, the president does not. Instead, he argues Slaughter’s firing protections infringe on the separation of powers — a broad assertion of presidential power that appears to have drawn sympathy with the Supreme Court’s conservative majority.

The Trump administration has not made that argument for the Fed, which the justices have signaled has special status that may justify its protections.

Under the court’s typical procedures, the justices would’ve taken an initial vote on Slaughter’s case in the days following the December argument. The opinion would’ve been assigned, and drafting would commence.

Watch on Wednesday to see if the justices’ comments tip their hand on what they plan to do in Slaughter’s case.

How Powell’s attendance impacts the case

Wednesday’s argument only directly concerns Cook’s firing, but watch to see if the justices connect it to Trump’s broader threats against the central bank for not lowering interest rates quicker.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will attend Wednesday’s argument at the Supreme Court, a source familiar with his plans tells our colleagueSylvan Lane, The Hill’s business editor.

For months, Trump has mused about firing Powell. But the president has yet to do so as the clock ticks closer to May, when Powell’s term as chair ends (he may remain on the board until 2028).

In the lead-up to Wednesday’s argument, things took a turn. The Justice Department issued a subpoena to the Fed, bringing its criminal investigation into Powell to light.

The investigation centers on congressional testimony Powell gave concerning the Fed’s multi-billion-dollar renovation of its headquarters, which has faced significant cost overruns. Powell denies wrongdoing and has cast the investigation as an attempt to influence the central bank’s monetary policy.

As the Fed’s chair, Powell is formally named as a defendant in Cook’s lawsuit.

His attendance makes him the elephant in the room. Government officials typically sit near the front of the public gallery, which is in the back half of the courtroom behind the bar section.

We’ll be in the room Wednesday to watch the justices — and Powell. So stay tuned.

IN FOCUS

Looking back at 1 year of Trump v. the courts

President Trump entered the second year of his White House term this week.

As his first year rapidly remade Washington, it flooded courts across the country.

Democratic state attorneys general, legal groups formed to oppose Trump, civil rights organizations and more asked judges hundreds of times to to rule pieces of Trump’s agenda unlawful — and halt them in the meantime.

Lawsuits began flying while Trump was still in the Capitol Rotunda for his inauguration ceremony.

Within minutes of Chief Justice John Roberts administering the oath, three lawsuits sought to dismantle the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) before it even got started.

They claimed DOGE was a federal advisory committee that wasn’t following transparency requirements. No judge has yet to endorse the argument, and some of the cases were later dropped.

Still, it became the first of hundreds of legal battlefronts to come.

And in the early months of the administration, challenges to DOGE dominated.

Some contested the administration’s assertion that Elon Musk was not formally in charge of the group. Others sought to subject DOGE to the Freedom of Information Act. But by and large, the cases concerned efforts to implant DOGE personnel at agencies across the government and allegations they were violating the Privacy Act.

Government unions led the charge in many of the cases. And as they would go on to do on issue after issue, left-leaning legal groups like Democracy Forward and Democracy Defenders Fund represented many of the plaintiffs in court.

And within months, they secured dozens of injunctions from federal district judges, stymying Trump’s agenda. Temporarily.

Repeatedly over the past year, the administration filed emergency appeals all the way to the Supreme Court, almost always emerging successful.

In total, the administration brought 32 Supreme Court emergency appeals. That’s more than former President Biden’s Justice Department filed during his entire four years in office.

Trump’s critics say the barrage reflects how he is acting lawlessly.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D), speaking Tuesday at an event celebrating the 54 lawsuits his office has brought against Trump, summed up the president’s first year as a “sweeping, often illegal campaign to remake America.”

“We said then if he breaks the law, we will take him to court. We are here today to say we have fulfilled that promise,” Bonta said.

The president’s legal allies push back, suggesting the nonstop pace reveals how lower judges have overstepped their authority by granting one injunction after another.

The real score is the administration’s record at the high court, those allies argue.

The exact tally depends on how you count a few mixed rulings, but on our scorecard, the administration has lost only four cases and emerged victorious in roughly 20.

Among others, that list includes greenlighting the administration’s efforts to fire more than 16,000 probationary employees, ban transgender troops from serving openly in the military, revoke temporary legal protections extended to more than 300,000 Venezuelans and parole for 532,000 people from Latin American countries, freeze $65 million in teacher preparation grants and lay off roughly half the Education Department

Only in a few cases, like Trump’s bid to deploy the National Guard in the Chicago area, did the court rule against the president.

What’s in store for his second year? Here are five issues that will define the legal landscape:

Does Trump’s string of Supreme Court victories continue as the justices begin handing down final decisions on the merits of Trump’s policies — like his sweeping tariffs and efforts to control independent agencies — rather than preliminary decisions on the emergency docket?

Will the Justice Department criminally indict more prominent Trump foes, like Powell, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and former Special Counsel Jack Smith?

Will the Supreme Court rein in judges who’ve granted nationwide relief to plaintiffs by signing off on class actions in the wake of the justices clawing back universal injunctions?

Will Trump’s rapid pace of executive orders, which now exceeds 200, slow down?

Will Trump invoke the Insurrection Act?

Alien Enemies Act back in court

One of the most prominent legal battles of Trump’s first year back in the White House returns to the courtroom later this week.

Last March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.

It began with sending dozens of migrants to a Salvadoran megaprison. Another wave in April was underway when the Supreme Court intervened in the middle of the night to halt the flights at the pleas of the American Civil Liberties Union.

The deportations became a prominent sign last spring of Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda.

In the months since, the legal battle has calmed in some respects. It’s about to return to the spotlight.

On Thursday, all 17 active judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will convene at the federal courthouse in New Orleans to hear oral arguments on whether Trump legally invoked the Alien Enemies Act.

It’s slated to be a blockbuster session that appears likely destined for the Supreme Court. More than a half-dozen other legal challenges to Trump’s use of the law are on hold, all awaiting word from the 5th Circuit.

The Alien Enemies Act allows the president to summarily deport migrants when a foreign nation perpetrates an “invasion” or predatory “incursion.” It has only been invoked three prior times: the War of 1812 and World Wars I and II.

Trump claims Tren de Aragua is perpetrating an invasion against the U.S., and he has tied the transnational criminal gang to the Venezuelan government.

In April, the Supreme Court ruled that migrants detained under the Alien Enemies Act must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal before they are deported.

That decision leaves several questions unanswered that have been simmering ever since. The 5th Circuit will get the next bite at the apple Thursday.

American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt will argue the Alien Enemies Act requires a a declaration of war or a military attack for the president to invoke the law.

The statute requires the attack be committed by a foreign nation, and Gelernt will make the case that Trump can’t tie his concerns about Tren de Aragua to deposed President Nicolás Maduro’s regime.

And even if the president did lawfully invoke the statute, Gelernt will argue that migrants should be afforded at least 30-days’ notice to ensure the Trump administration can’t deport them without judicial review.

The Trump administration will be represented by Drew Ensign, who leads immigration litigation for the Justice Department. He will assert that the Alien Enemies Act compels the courts to provide the president extreme deference.

Tren de Aragua has perpetrated an invasion “by any metric” and is sufficiently connected to Maduro’s government, administration wrote in court filings. The administration has also argued requiring 30-days’ notice is unwarranted.

ORDER LIST

Cases the Supreme Court is taking up — or passing on — this term.

IN: Roundup weed killer, geofence warrants

The court took up four new cases at Friday’s conference, perhaps the final cases that will be argued this term.

First, the court agreed to hear Bayer’s appeal to limit liability for its Roundup weed killer, which has come under thousands of lawsuits alleging it causes cancer and did not include a proper warning label.

Bayer argues the state lawsuits are preempted by federal law, which does not require the warning. The case is Monsanto Company v. Durnell.

In Chatrie v. United States, the Supreme Court took up its next major Fourth Amendment case.

The justices will review whether geofence warrants, which allow law enforcement to seize information on cellphones online at a location during a specific time window, violate constitutional protections against unreasonable searches.

The court will also review an employment retirement plan case interpreting the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, (ERISA).

In Anderson v. Intel Corporation Investment Policy Committee, the justices will examine whether plaintiffs alleging their employer’s plan underperformed must show a “meaningful benchmark,” which would make it more difficult to bring ERISA lawsuits.

Finally, the court agreed to hear Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA v. Amarin Pharma.

The fight between the two pharma companies poses broad implications for so-called “skinny labels,” which allow generic drugmakers to bring products to market faster by carving out a product’s brand-name, patented use on the label.

OUT: SCOTUS fee waivers

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court’s juniormost liberal justice, has thoughts on how the court handles filings from incarcerated defendants.

The Supreme Court chooses what cases it hears. But anyone can try their luck, so long as they submit a $300 filing fee and pay to print 40 bound copies (yes, this is still a requirement in 2026, and Jackson noted it’s usually the much higher cost).

The justices routinely waive the fee for poor incarcerated defendants who can’t afford it. But if the defendant then repeatedly tries to file frivolous litigation, the court cuts them off.

The court did so Tuesday for a handful of defendants, including Danny Howell, who was sentenced to 70 years in prison after being convicted of child molestation and other charges. The clerk will no longer accept “any further petitions in noncriminal matters” from Howell unless he pays the fee.

“Even if Howell were to identify meritorious grounds for habeas relief or wanted to bring a justifiable challenge to his conditions of confinement, he will now be prevented from doing so unless he pays the filing fee—no matter what,” Jackson wrote in dissent.

“A categorical, forward-looking filing bar is a questionable restriction as to any litigant who cannot afford to pay a filing fee. For me, it is an intolerable one as to incarcerated individuals.”

(And also a few million more than Mr. Trump’s own estimates of 21 million from July.)
Most metrics do not support Mr. Trump’s claim of transforming the economy from the “worst” to the “best.” Inflation was 3 percent in January 2025, when Mr. Trump took office.
But those measures rose slightly from January, when Mr. Trump took office, not from record lows.
In contrast, local officials in Democratic-led cities and states have resisted Mr. Trump’s deployment of troops.","In the first year of his second term, President Trump has cited an arsenal of falsehoods, baseless claims and distortions to justify significant policy changes on the economy, immigration and deployments of the military.

His case for ushering in a turnaround rests on inaccurate superlatives (the “worst inflation” ever under his predecessor and the “best numbers” now under his presidency), mathematically impossible figures (a “600 percent” decline in drug prices) and evidence-free assertions (the decimation of maritime drug smuggling).

Here’s a fact-check of some of the falsehoods that fueled Mr. Trump’s first year back.

This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump has long overstated the unauthorized migration under his predecessor and has wrongly portrayed most migrants as criminals. Likewise, contrary to his claims, most migrants deported in his first year back in office had no criminal convictions.

First, the 25 million figure is more than double most credible estimates of unauthorized migration under the Biden administration. (And also a few million more than Mr. Trump’s own estimates of 21 million from July.) Mr. Trump has also not provided any evidence of his repeated assertion that “many” of those migrants were criminals and “some of the worst people on earth.”

From the 2021 to 2024 fiscal years, officials recorded roughly 11 million “encounters” of unauthorized migrants at borders and ports of entry, including about seven million at the southwestern border with Mexico. More than a quarter of the migrants were repeat offenders. Republican lawmakers have estimated that about 2.2 million more unauthorized migrants evaded detection during this time. And a March report from the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank that supports lower levels of immigration, estimated that 11.5 million to 12.5 million migrants — both legal and illegal — settled in the United States under the Biden administration.

Most migrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Mr. Trump’s first year had no criminal convictions. In late November, of the 65,000 people in detention, about 26 percent had a criminal conviction, 26 percent had pending charges and 47 percent had immigration violations, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonprofit at Syracuse University.

A New York Times analysis of ICE arrests and detentions from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15 of last year found that just 7 percent of those arrested nationwide had a violent conviction. Thirty-seven percent had a previous conviction, with driving under the influence and traffic violations as the most common offenses. A third had no criminal charges at all. And in locales where ICE has conducted high-profile operations — Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and across Massachusetts — more than half had no charges at all.

False. Most metrics do not support Mr. Trump’s claim of transforming the economy from the “worst” to the “best.”

Inflation was 3 percent in January 2025, when Mr. Trump took office. That was far from the “worst” recorded — inflation was much higher in the 1980s, when it topped 14 percent. The rate declined slightly to 2.7 percent in December, the most recent month with available data.

Unemployment grew to 4.4 percent in December 2025, up from 4 percent that January. For comparison, unemployment surged to 14.8 percent in April 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, and it was 6.4 percent in January 2021, the last month of Mr. Trump’s first term.

Nominal median wage growth, too, fell to 3.7 percent by December 2025 from 4.2 percent in January of that year. After adjusting for inflation, real hourly earnings grew at 1.1 percent in both December 2024 and December 2025, while real weekly earnings grew to 1.1 percent in December 2025 from 0.5 percent in December 2024. None of those figures were historically high or historically low.

Gross domestic product did increase to a robust 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2025, compared with 1.9 percent in the last quarter of 2024. In comparison, the economy grew at a faster clip in the third quarter of 2023 at 4.7 percent and contracted in the first quarter of 2025 by 0.6 percent.

A White House official cited two less commonly cited economic measures — the Federal Reserve’s industrial production index and its count of shipments of manufacturing orders — hitting record highs under Mr. Trump. But those measures rose slightly from January, when Mr. Trump took office, not from record lows.

Trade

What Was said

First, his $18 trillion figure is almost double the White House’s own tally of investments ($9.6 trillion). While it is possible that the pledges will result in economic gains, those effects have yet to come to fruition.

The $9.6 trillion also includes broad pledges and previously announced projects. And more than half of that amount comes from informal pledges from foreign countries to invest in the United States that experts warn may be unrealistic. For example, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates each pledged more than $1 trillion in investments, which is more than their gross domestic products.

And so far, there is little evidence that Mr. Trump’s tariffs have ushered in a manufacturing renaissance, job and wage growth, or a decline in drug prices. Economists have said that the sustained economic growth in the United States was in spite of tariffs, not because of them.

The manufacturing sector shed 63,000 jobs from January 2025 to December 2025. Construction spending in manufacturing has also declined. Economic activity in the sector in general contracted for 10 consecutive months in 2025, according to a longstanding survey by the Institute for Supply Management.

Mr. Trump’s claim that his tariffs brought a decline of 400 to 600 percent in drug prices is not mathematically possible. A 100 percent decline would mean that the product is free.

The White House cited data from Customs and Border Protection showing that officials with the agency’s Air and Marine Operations in the United States seized a record amount of drugs in July — more than 220,000 pounds — and that number has since fallen to 2,000 pounds in December. But of that figure of 220,000 pounds, more than 200,000 pounds was of marijuana and it is unclear where those interdictions took place. Moreover, C.B.P. is not the only agency that seizes drugs.

As the strikes occurred, the Coast Guard continued to conduct other maritime drug enforcement operations. For example, the Coast Guard reported seizing nearly 20,000 pounds of cocaine across 10 days in November as part of Operation Pacific Viper. The Coast Guard also announced on Thursday the seizure of more than 2,200 pounds of cocaine in a 45-day patrol in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.

Jeremy McDermott and Steven Dudley, the co-founders of InSight Crime, a Latin America crime and security think tank, wrote in a recent post that while the military strikes had likely disrupted some drug routes, the campaign had not halted trafficking altogether.

“This has not stopped the flow of drugs; it simply forced traffickers to use different routes and modus operandi,” they wrote.

Executive Power

What Was said

This is misleading. Mr. Trump has justified deploying National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities by overstating their crime rates, and then overstating the impact of those deployments. After the Supreme Court ruled in December that he could not deploy the Guard over the objections of local officials in Illinois, Mr. Trump instead asserted his authority to deploy more conventional troops to American cities — an authority, he argued misleadingly, that most other presidents had exercised.

Mr. Trump’s claims about the National Guard’s effect on crime in Portland, Ore., were particularly inaccurate, as the Guard barely had a presence in the city.

In late September, after protests over immigration enforcement in Portland, Mr. Trump announced he would deploy the Guard to the city. Local officials challenged the deployment in court almost immediately. Emails released in court showed — and a Justice Department lawyer acknowledged — that about seven to 10 members of Oregon’s National Guard were briefly sent to an ICE building in downtown Portland from about 11:30 in the morning on Oct. 4 and left sometime at night, after a judge barred the deployment in the afternoon. After the Supreme Court ruling in December, Mr. Trump abandoned his efforts to deploy the Guard to Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles.

The White House cited a decline in crime from September, when Mr. Trump announced the deployment, to November. But even before the announcement and the half-day deployment of a handful of troops in October, crime in Portland had been falling, with homicides already declining by more than 50 percent in the first half of 2025 and violent crime down by 17 percent. Last year, the local police recorded 4,000 to 5,200 monthly offenses from January to November, the month with the most recent data available. The greatest number of offenses were recorded in October, the month with the brief appearance of National Guard troops.

Mr. Trump’s contention that half his predecessors have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807, which gives the president broad authority to mobilize troops domestically under certain conditions, is overstated and leaves out critical context.

Since the 1790s, 17 presidents have used or invoked the Insurrection Act a total of 30 times, according to a timeline compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice. That’s about 38 percent of all presidents. Most invocations — 19 instances — occurred before 1900. Many of the invocations in the last century occurred during the Civil Rights era. For example, President Dwight D. Eisenhower invoked the act after the governor of Arkansas deployed the state’s National Guard to stop nine Black students from enrolling at a high school in Little Rock.

Most recently, President George H.W. Bush invoked the act twice, not 22 times as Mr. Trump said, in 1989 to quell looting after a hurricane in the Virgin Islands and in 1992 to quell unrest after the police beating of Rodney King.

State and local leaders are not confirming anything credible right now, even as advocacy groups and immigration lawyers prepare for the worst.

More than a hundred students at Red Mountain High School in Mesa on Tuesday took to standing up against ICE operations around the country. Communities in the Valley are bracing for what could happen here.

“The concern is that if ICE and border patrol were to come to Arizona as they’re doing in Minneapolis, that is concerning to us,” said Jose Patino, with the immigration advocacy group Aliento.

Groups like Aliento say they have not heard anything concrete about whether ICE could surge in the Phoenix metro. That is not stopping them from preparing the community for anything: Teaching people to have their documents ready and to know their rights.

“We always tell folks not to panic, but be prepared. You just never know when it’s going to rain,” said Patino.

For their part, ICE Director Todd Lyons told Scripps News their job is to keep neighborhoods safe.

“Over 70 percent of people that are in ICE detention right now either have a criminal conviction or a pending criminal charge,"" said Lyons.

ABC15 contacted local ICE officials to ask about enforcement in Arizona, but we did not receive a response.

ABC15 anchor Javier Soto also sat down with Governor Katie Hobbs earlier this month to ask about immigration enforcement.

“There was a report last week that said Arizona, specifically Phoenix, was the next target for mass immigration sweeps. Have you been able to confirm that, and what’s your response to that?” asked Soto.

“So I’m not going to act on rumors, and there’s a lot of reporting out there. We want to make sure we’re getting in front of misinformation. We’ve been in contact with the administration. We can’t confirm anything,” replied Hobbs.

But how much will Arizona law enforcement work with federal immigration officers?

According to ProPublica, of at least 106 municipal police departments, sheriff's offices, and county attorneys in the state, only nine currently have agreements to cooperate with ICE in making arrests, as of late last year.

Maricopa County Sheriff Jerry Sheridan posted on social media over the weekend, promising to protect ICE agents and arrest anyone interfering with their work.

One immigration lawyer we spoke with says it is only a matter of time before ICE shows up here in full force.

Regardless of who's doing the enforcement, immigration agents deployed to interior cities are creating more problems than they're solving, said Minneapolis council member Jason Chavez.
Federal agents raided two construction sites in a suburb east of town on Jan. 15.","Federal immigration agents pulled over a Hispanic high school football coach driving his players to a game and pointed a pistol at his head.

They swarmed a high school parking lot to question Hispanic students about their citizenship. When the teens explained they were U.S. citizens, agents loaded them into a Border Patrol vehicle anyway.

Agents plowed their vehicles through the high school's baseball diamond and football fields. And they questioned the school secretary's citizenship on her way home from work.

This wasn't Minneapolis, Los Angeles, or Chicago in recent months. It was El Paso, Texas – back in 1992.

The U.S. Border Patrol at the time was operating with impunity, aggressively going after anyone who looked Hispanic and lived in aneighborhood near the U.S.-Mexico border.

A rights movement gained traction in the wake of a community lawsuit, and grassroots organizers soon began warning the rest of the country that tactics applied at the U.S.-Mexico border eventually could be exported to American cities everywhere.

""We were saying: The border will become the nation,"" said Fernando Garcia, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights. ""And then it happened.""

Enhanced powers in the border zone

The 19 million people living in the Southwest border zone, which extends 100 miles inland, are under constant surveillance. They're at risk of getting in the way of the Border Patrol's high-speed vehicle pursuits. And they're surrounded in all directions by federal highway checkpoints where they must affirm or prove their U.S. citizenship.

Sito Negron, 59, originally from the Bronx borough in New York, moved to El Paso as a teenager in the 1980s and quickly learned the exceptions to ""normal"" American life on the border.

""The first time I went through an interior checkpoint, I was like, 'What the (expletive) is this?' "" he said. He had believed, until then, ""that Americans are free because we don't have armed, uniformed, paramilitary officers roaming around to verify my identity and my ability to move around.""

But in the border zone, by law, federal agents can push the limits of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments in ways they cannot in the country's interior. (The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches; the Fourteenth guarantees equal protection under the law, regardless of race.)

What's less known is that the 100-mile zone doesn't just include border cities and towns like San Diego, Tucson in Arizona, or El Paso and Brownsville in Texas. It stretches 100 miles inland from every coast and along the northern border to include Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, New York, Miami, New Orleans and Houston. It includes more than 200 million people ‒ nearly two-thirds of the nation's population.

Within that sprawling zone, much of it rarely enforced as a ""border"" until now, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers and agents can board public transportation, set up checkpoints and question people about their immigration status – without a warrant or probable cause, according to the Southern Border Communities Coalition. American Civil Liberties Union affiliates are challenging these actions in Washington, DC, Chicago and Minneapolis, which are more than 250 miles from the Canadian border.

Despite the distances and the agency's documented history of rights abuses, the executive branch, backed by the courts, has fortified Border Patrol ""with extra-Constitutional powers,"" Garcia said.

""Now Border Patrol, trained at the U.S.-Mexico border, is the one leading immigration enforcement agencies in other areas of the nation,"" he said.

Immigration enforcers, two different agencies

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has emerged as the brand-name enforcer of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign. ""ICE Watch"" groups in Minneapolis and other major cities track immigration enforcers' movements. Protestors chant slogans, calling for ICE's abolition. Hollywood stars are sporting ""ICE out"" pins on red carpets.

But in social media videos and photographs of violent encounters, including in Minneapolis, it's often agents wearing Border Patrol patches conducting the enforcement.

CBP is the nation's largest law enforcement agency, with more than 25,000 customs officers and more than 19,000 Border Patrol agents.

ICE, the agency tasked with conducting immigration enforcement in the nation'sinterior, was small by comparison with roughly 6,000 deportation agents before a recent hiring spree. Historically, ICE targeted immigrants who had committed serious crimes, surveilling and quietly arresting them.

In Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Minneapolis, Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino has directed enforcement operations, aided by an elite, El Paso, Texas-based Border Patrol force known as BORTAC.

It's essential for border agents to find and arrest migrants who arrived during the Biden administration and weren't properly vetted, said Art Del Cueto, a retired Border Patrol agent.

""I can't say it's a great look when all these individuals are heavily armed in camouflage in city streets,"" he said, ""but they're there for the ineptitude of the last administration.""

In a post on the social media site X, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both ICE and Border Patrol, said ""Operation Metro Surge"" in Minneapolis has so far led to the arrest of 2,500 alleged ""murderers, fraudsters, predators and gang members.""

The DHS declined a USA TODAY request for a breakdown of Border Patrol agents and ICE officers among the roughly 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minneapolis.

Regardless of who's doing the enforcement, immigration agents deployed to interior cities are creating more problems than they're solving, said Minneapolis council member Jason Chavez.

""You have our immigrant neighbors driving to work … shaking as they are holding their wheel and praying to God that they are going to make it to work and then make it back home,"" Chavez said.

On Jan. 15, the ACLU sued the Border Patrol, its commanders and other federal agencies, alleging a ""startling pattern of abuse"" in Minneapolis that includes ""violently stopping and arresting countless Minnesotans based on nothing more than their race and perceived ethnicity.""

Minnesota also sued the DHS to stop the ongoing immigration enforcement, describing it as a ""federal invasion."" On Jan. 14, a federal judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order to halt the operations.

The Minnesota Star Tribune's next-day, front-page headline could have been torn out of an old El Paso newspaper: ""Citizens sue, seek ruling to rein in agents' tactics.' ""

Border Patrol's actions 'didn't make the community safer'

El Pasoans won relief in that 1992 lawsuit, and it opened the door to better communication and cooperation between the community and Border Patrol.

""The judge recognized the boundaries that were being pushed,"" said U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas. ""The way Border Patrol was acting during that era created a chilling effect in the community and it didn't make the community safer. It created mistrust.""

El Paso shares an urban border with Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, and Bowie High School – the center of the 1990s enforcement controversy – overlooks the borderline. Today, the city is more than 80% Hispanic and votes majority Democrat, but Trump gained traction in the last election.

It's a region of contradictions, where immigration enforcement is militarized, but Border Patrol agents coach the local soccer team; where a majority of residents can trace their roots to Mexico, including border agents themselves; where racial profiling is an uncomfortable reality of daily life for many, by agents who are also Hispanic.

Ruby Montana, 44, grew up in El Paso; her dad was a Border Patrol agent in the 1980s and ’90s. She recalled how he kept photos of himself posing over handcuffed migrants, ""as if they were hunting trophies,"" she said. She fought with him about it, reminded him that his own parents came from Mexico without permission.

Today, Montana is a Chicano studies professor at the University of Texas at El Paso and works closely with Border Patrol to rescue animals found along the border. She sees the two faces of the agency, the institutional biases that can lead to heavy-handed enforcement, but also the individuals who call her for help with abandoned animals.

""People will say, 'Border Patrol is just following the laws,'"" she said. ""Technically, people here illegally are breaking the law – a misdemeanor – and agents are following their orders. Slavery was the law of the land. Hiding Jews from Nazis was breaking the law. A lot of people are conflating laws with morals.""

After the 1992 lawsuit,Garcia's Border Network for Human Rights became the conduit for an engagement model that included regular roundtables with Border Patrol leadership and led to a sharp reduction in complaints about the agency's tactics.

That cooperation has largely ended under Trump, Garcia said.

""There was a successful story in the past,"" he said. ""Now the relationship is in limbo.""

Federal agents raided two construction sites in a suburb east of town on Jan. 15. Concerns about the old days of blanket enforcement prompted local Democrat officials to hold a news conference and call for restraint.

""We were being aggressively occupied in that era,"" Negron said. ""The federal government heard the community and realized it was wrong. Now they're doing this in the rest of the country.""

He added, ""Americans should not get used to living in these conditions.""

It’s being run by (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security) Kristi Noem, who I have no respect for,” Pinsley said.","A sitting county controller and U.S. House candidate maintains that a federal agency hasn’t paid its rent to Lehigh County since 2022, despite occupying office space owned by the government body.

Mark Pinsley, the Lehigh County controller, announced Tuesday that Homeland Security Investigations — which falls within the broader Immigration and Customs Enforcement framework at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — owes the county $115,426, not including late fees of $7,600.

“I don’t think as a county government we should be supporting anything like that,” said Pinsley. “We should deport ICE out of our building so that we’re not associated … We should be supporting our residents in every way that we can.”

Following Pinsley’s findings, newly elected county executive Josh Siegel said he would move to “evict” federal agents, according to the Morning Call.

Pinsley’s held his position since 2020 and ran unsuccessfully for state auditor general in 2024. He’s now in a crowded Democratic primary to challenge first-term U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican aligned with President Donald Trump. The Lehigh Valley’s 7th District is a perennial toss-up and closely watched by politicos nationwide.

He spoke to the Capital-Star Tuesday ahead of the announcement, tying a recommendation to issue an eviction notice with a repudiation of the federal agency’s recent actions in Minnesota and beyond.

The outsized presence of federal officials in Minneapolis has increased city tensions, prompting protests, mass arrests and networks of private citizens countering agency actions. A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found the majority believe ICE was being “too tough,” while 54% of those interviewed believed that immigration officer Jonathan Ross was “not justified” in the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.

Neither Homeland Security nor ICE immediately responded to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.

Lehigh County isn’t among the agencies in the commonwealth that has a formal agreement to help ICE with immigration enforcement. The county’s policy is to cooperate with the agency “to the fullest extent legally possible.”

What happened?

In late 2022, Homeland Security Investigations signaled an intent to lease the fourth floor of Allentown’s Hamilton Financial Center, a 10-story building owned by Lehigh County. First, the two government agencies would sign a Memorandum of Agreement for ten months, followed by a three-year lease from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 31, 2026.

The former would net the county $29,250 while the latter would bring in another $111,745, according to an agreement attached to a Board of Commissioners meeting agenda from November 2022.

Commissioners didn’t spend more than five minutes discussing the agreement during its first reading on Nov. 9, 2022 or its final vote on Nov. 22, 2022.

“I think this would be a great opportunity with the county and Homeland Security and give us the opportunity to welcome them into our county,” said sponsoring commissioner Zakiya Smalls at the latter meeting.

But only the first document ever got the required signature from HSI, while the lease remained unsigned.

“Normally, once a contract gets signed, it goes into our computer system and then we know to expect revenue,” said Pinsley. “In this case, that never happened because it was never signed.”

Pinsley reported that the federal government told him that Special Agent in Charge William S. Walker “lacked proper authority” to sign the memorandum. At the time, media described Walker as a deputy special agent for Homeland in Philadelphia who oversaw investigations into sex and drug trafficking.

According to his LinkedIn, Walker was working as an acting assistant director when he left the agency in September 2025 to become a senior vice president at an anti-trafficking nonprofit.

Lehigh County’s Pinsley said that a tip to his office following a recent administration change at the county level brought the lack of payment to the forefront as the federal agency explores a new lease past the expiration of the original proposal — which he said could be signed with ICE, not HSI.

“I don’t think we should be housing HSI at all. It’s being run by (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security) Kristi Noem, who I have no respect for,” Pinsley said. “I don’t care if they call it HSI or ICE. It doesn’t matter what the name is.”

Two of Pennsylvania’s 19 U.S. House members signed onto an effort to impeach Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, last week. Noem has repeatedly defended her agency’s actions, backtracking after initially claiming officers weren’t using chemical weapons like pepper spray against protesters. The effort would need Republican support, since the party holds the majority in both the House and Senate.

Next steps

Pinsley said he is “hopeful that we will be able to collect the money that is owed.”

“Ultimately, they did reside in our county and it was never meant to be free, and so they should have to pay,” said Pinsley. “I believe they should have to pay market rate, which is definitely above” the rate included under the unsigned lease.

Pinsley said he would also recommend that the county launch a database allowing locals to report alleged ICE misdeeds, such as the physical altercations or damage to personal property reported in Minneapolis.

He additionally called for “stability” in the nation’s immigration system that didn’t change from administration to administration, as well as a “path to citizenship” for “someone who’s been working here ten years and is paying taxes and is a good neighbor.”

“When (President Donald Trump) was talking about this, he was talking about violent felons. But we’re not going after violent felons — they’re going after grandma now,” said Pinsley. “And when they’re doing that, they’re causing a lot of fear. They’re tear gassing people; they’re using pepper balls; they’re putting on masks in American cities. I have no tolerance for that.”

According to December data analyzed by the New York Times, one-third of immigrants arrested by ICE have no history of criminal charges, compared to 7% with violent convictions.

In contrast, Mackenzie offered his support to ICE agents during a public appearance last week, telling the Lehigh Valley News that in the Good shooting, “When situations are in the heat of the moment, law enforcement has to take proper actions to keep themselves safe. That’s what this individual did.”

Democrats are targeting Mackenzie’s swing district seat in their effort to flip control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Along with Pinsley, six other Democrats are running for a chance to challenge Mackenzie:

Bob Brooks, firefighter and president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association

Former federal prosecutor Ryan Crosswell

Bethlehem resident Aidan Gonzalez

Former Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure

Former PPL Electrics Utilities executive Carol Obando-Derstine

“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said.
Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home.","Federal immigration agents forced open a door and detained a US citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out on to the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by the Associated Press.

ChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law woke him up from a nap on Sunday afternoon and said that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

“I was shaking,” he said. “They didn’t show any warrant; they just broke down the door.”

Amid a huge surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protesters and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” said Kaohly Her, the St Paul mayor and a Hmong American, in a statement about Thao’s arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”

Thao, who has been a US citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.

Instead, as his four-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao’s family alone.

Thao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere” and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a US citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

The US Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao’s home as a “targeted operation” seeking two convicted sex offenders.

“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”

Thao’s family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims”.

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property’s owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

The DHS did not respond to a request from the Associated Press seeking the identities of the “two convicted sex offenders” or why the agency believed they were present in Thao’s home.

Thao’s son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin’s boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

The family said they were particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the US government because his mother had to flee to the US from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao’s adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the US government’s “secret war” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, “treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with US personnel”, her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he is planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against the DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

“I don’t feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn’t do anything.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82165fd0c75e3fe4f4a29f34e32e51f797f9518c/463_0_4769_3816/master/4769.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77a465c59d05240809516dd9f910cbfa",N,,2026-01-21 09:58:03.871704

Just in the past few weeks, a woman in Minneapolis was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, the U.S. government attacked Venezuela and captured its head of state, and Trump withdrew the United States from more than 60 international cooperation efforts. It’s a dangerous and volatile moment in U.S. history, one that is a culmination of a huge slide toward authoritarian practices many of us could never have imagined.

Amnesty International has long documented authoritarian practices in many countries and contexts. We recognize the warning signs and so are ringing the alarm bells. And we also know there is still time to stop it.

Trump silences free speech and punishes journalists

Over the past year, the Trump administration has leveraged multiple tools, including government censorship and targeting protesters, to try to crush dissent. Peaceful protesters, particularly students and activists advocating for Palestinian rights, have been singled out for punishment, with the clear aim of spreading fear among all who might dare to raise their voices.

Universities have come under pressure to suppress student voices, with academic freedom and freedom of expression thrown to the wayside. Mahmoud Khalil, a student protester at Columbia University, was detained for months before a judge ordered his release, simply for speaking his mind.

Despite his release, he continues to face immigration proceedings. Leqaa Kordia, a 33-year-old Palestinian woman, has been arbitrarily detained since March following a protest at Columbia University. Their examples send a clear message: Exercising the right to speak out can put your liberty and your future in this country at risk. The goal is clear: to instill fear and make dissent too dangerous to attempt.

At the same time, the administration has sought to limit press freedom. Journalists covering protests and human rights violations have been detained, harassed, threatened and, in some cases, like U.S.-based Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara, deported. Punishing journalists is a key feature of authoritarian practices, as it denies the public the needed information to hold those in power accountable, thus enabling human rights violations to go unchecked.

These attacks on freedom of speech and press are reinforced by the expansion of surveillance and increased law enforcement and military presence in our communities. Across the country, militarized federal forces have been deployed − often over the objections of local officials and in defiance of court rulings.

Protesters challenging or recording cruel ICE tactics have been met with riot gear, tear gas, rubber bullets, threats of arrests and pointed guns, deterring others from speaking out. And sometimes with deadly consequences, as we saw in Minneapolis.

Trump's policies hurt human rights agreements

Vilifying and targeting immigrants while cracking down on protests against Trump’s cruel policies are central to this administration’s authoritarian practices. People seeking safety at the border are denied their right to seek asylum. Immigrants are being detained and deported at historic levels, many without warrants or due process. People are being held in inhumane conditions, enduring torture, denied medical care and cut off from legal counsel.

What makes this moment especially dangerous is the administration’s simultaneous assault on the institutions designed to restrain power and ensure oversight and accountability. The Trump administration is attempting to curb the authority of courts when they issue rulings the White House doesn't agree with and threatening lawyers and judges.

It isn’t only in the United States. Not even three days into 2026, President Trump attacked Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, raising grave concerns for further escalation of human rights violations in Venezuela and the entire region. This followed months of U.S. air strikes on boats that killed more than 100 people off the Venezuelan coast and in the Pacific.

Furthermore, the administration has significantly altered critical global human rights agreements and bodies, cruelly and chaotically zeroed out foreign assistance, and modeled a disregard for human rights and global norms. In short, President Trump’s actions on the international stage are a dangerous wrecking ball to accountability and justice – and lethal to life and liberty.

After a year, a clear pattern has emerged: systematic erosion of human rights, and open disregard for the systems meant to protect human rights. The Trump administration has violated international law, punished protesters, silenced journalists, militarized communities and sidelined the courts.

The question now is not whether more rights will be eroded, but whose will be next. The future of human rights in the United States and beyond depends on whether we confront this crisis now or allow it to deepen unchecked.

This moment demands action from all of us. We must call on lawmakers to hold the Trump administration accountable by investigating abuses, cutting funding to agencies that violate rights and establishing real oversight over a lawless administration. We must demand that colleges and universities safeguard students’ rights to learn, be safe on campus and express themselves freely, without fear or punishment.

We must demand that the United States reengage globally by rejoining and committing to global human rights initiatives and systems. Courts must continue to serve as a check on executive abuses. We must not turn away or normalize attacks on freedom of expression and protest. We must not accept this.

We all have the human right to live freely, equally and in dignity. Together, we must move forward on the path of accountability, courage and collective action.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/09/USAT/88103821007-usatsi-27965893.jpg?crop=5994,3372,x0,y310&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 06:59:24.874419

Best, Mayor Erin Mendenhall _______","Reports have circulated that federal immigration authorities are exploring the use of a Salt Lake City property for a potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility.

City officials confirmed they have not been formally notified of a finalized proposal, but Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall sent a letter on Jan. 15, 2026, to Ritchie Group principal Ryan Ritchie outlining zoning and infrastructure concerns tied to any high-occupancy or restricted-movement use of the site.

According to the mayor’s office, the letter was sent without confirmation of a specific parcel, but was based on media reporting of the proposed location and the Ritchie Group’s ownership of several industrial sites within that area.

Utah reported among states for potential ICE detention center

The property in question, the mayor writes, is located in an M1 zoning district, which the city says is intended for light industrial uses that do not significantly impact nearby properties.

In her letter, Mendenhall noted that if the building were used to house more than 20 individuals whose movements are restricted, the site would be required to meet a different set of building and safety standards, including requirements for bathrooms, exits, and fire suppression systems.

The mayor also raised concerns about the area’s water and sewer capacity, stating the surrounding utility infrastructure was designed for warehouse-level use, not for a large residential or detention population.

City officials said any lease or occupancy permit would require those issues to be addressed before approval. As of publication, neither ICE nor the Ritchie Group has publicly confirmed whether negotiations are underway.

A spokesman for the mayor's office said they have not received a response from Ritchie or the Ritchie Group.

Request for comment from the Ritchie Group about the letter or the prospect of an ICE detention facility at one of their properties was not immediately returned Tuesday.

Here is the full text of the letter sent by Mayor Erin Mendenhall to Ryan Ritchie:

Dear Ryan,

I am reaching out after learning of the potential interest by federal agencies in property owned by Ritchie. Although I lack solid information on both their interest and your engagement with them, I wanted to provide some potentially relevant information regarding the property and applicable City regulations.

The property of note is located within an M1 zone, intended to provide an environment for light industrial uses with no significant impact to nearby properties.

If the property were to be utilized for the housing of more than 20 individuals whose movements are restricted in any way, it would need to comply with our building code and its requirements for bathrooms, exits, fire suppression systems, and more.

Additionally, any potential usage changes would have an enormous impact on our water and sewer infrastructure and capacity. The area’s utility system has been built specifically for warehouse use, not high occupancy, and there are downstream constraints. We do not have the public utilities infrastructure to serve a large residential population.

If you intend to lease the building, please note that all of these concerns would need to be addressed before receiving an occupancy permit.

Should you or your team want to discuss these factors with the City, we are always happy to connect.

Best,

Mayor Erin Mendenhall

The Department of Homeland Security said Mr. Thao’s arrest was made amid an attempt by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain convicted sex offenders.
It was unclear on Tuesday whether the two men were the intended targets of Sunday’s raid, or were connected in some way with Mr. Thao.
But in an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Thao said the agents did not explain or apologize for the arrest.
Mr. Thao is not listed in the Minnesota registry of sex offenders.","It was over in a flash.

Masked federal agents descended on a one-story home in St. Paul, Minn., on Sunday and dragged a man wearing nothing but his underwear and slip-on shoes from his doorstep, through an icy snowbank and into an idling S.U.V.

Tires screeched. Whistles sounded. Neighbors shrieked in the background. And then the agents and the man were gone.

The arrested man was identified as ChongLy Scott Thao, a Hmong immigrant and naturalized U.S. citizen with no criminal record, according to his family. He was released about an hour later without being charged, they said.

The images of the diminutive, barely clad man being led away through freezing temperatures spread instantly. The Department of Homeland Security said Mr. Thao’s arrest was made amid an attempt by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain convicted sex offenders. But in a community on edge, the operation quickly came to represent what critics call a callous and brutal enforcement campaign.

It has also has touched off panic on St. Paul’s east side, where a large population of Hmong people has lived for decades. Neighbors in the area have described a surge of immigration raids in recent days targeting people of Asian descent.

The Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that the arrest had been part of a targeted operation seeking two sex offenders who lived at the address with Mr. Thao. On Tuesday, they identified two men from Laos and said both are wanted for sexual assault. It was unclear on Tuesday whether the two men were the intended targets of Sunday’s raid, or were connected in some way with Mr. Thao.

Local officials and Mr. Thao’s family have disputed the department’s account, describing instead a chaotic case of mistaken identity and an incursion of armed agents who forcibly removed a U.S. citizen from a residence without presenting a warrant or allowing him to show identification.

“ChongLy was taken outside in freezing weather wearing only underwear and Crocs, placed into an SUV, and driven around for nearly an hour while being questioned,” Louansee Moua, Mr. Thao’s sister-in-law, wrote in a description of the event on a GoFundMe page fund-raising for Mr. Thao’s legal fees and other costs.

The family declined to comment further on the arrest on Tuesday. But in an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Thao said the agents did not explain or apologize for the arrest. “They didn’t say sorry or anything,” he said.

Mayor Kaohly Her of St. Paul, who said she knows the Thao family personally, said that available evidence showed that agents had the wrong person and were offered information to confirm that. “And they just ignored that information,” she said.

Dana Haberman, a neighbor who witnessed the raid, said roughly 10 vans carrying federal agents appeared on the street. The agents, some of whom carried rifles and riot shields, walked up the front steps to Mr. Thao’s home and knocked several times, waiting about a minute, before using a battering ram to break down the door, he said.

“Seeing this elderly man being taken out like that,” Mr. Haberman said, “the frustration is palpable.”

Mr. Thao was driven around for almost an hour while the agents questioned him. After fingerprinting him and running his information, they returned him home, Ms. Moua said.

In its statement on Monday, homeland security said that Mr. Thao had refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified and that he had matched the description of the two sex offenders they were seeking. “It is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department, wrote on social media. It did not appear that any other members of the family were arrested on Sunday.

Mr. Thao is not listed in the Minnesota registry of sex offenders.

The ordeal has been particularly painful for Hmong residents in the Twin Cities, many of whom fled Laos as refugees after supporting the United States in its fight against communism during the Vietnam War. The Twin Cities has one of the largest concentrations of Hmong immigrants in the United States.

""They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.""","The U.S. Department of Justice said Sunday it is investigating a group of protesters in Minnesota who disrupted services at a church where a local official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement apparently serves as a pastor.

A livestreamed video posted on the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, one of the protest's organizers, shows a group of people interrupting services at the Cities Church in St. Paul by chanting ""ICE out"" and ""Justice for Renee Good."" The 37-year-old mother of three was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month amid a surge in federal immigration enforcement activities.

The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors — David Easterwood — also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.

U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations ""by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.""

RELATED STORY | Federal immigration crackdown engulfs Twin Cities in daily clashes

""A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!"" she said on social media.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

""When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,"" said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. ""If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.""

The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents ""knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.""

""Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,"" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. ""They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.""

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.

""If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?"" Cullars-Doty said.

After hovering around the $10 billion mark for years, ICE's budget suddenly benefited from a meteoric spike.
ICE is now the lead agency in President's Trump immigration crackdown, sending thousands of agents into U.S. communities.
By late 2024, fewer migrants were arriving at the border, due to U.S. asylum limits and Mexico bolstering enforcement.
In just one year, the agency says, it ""more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000.""","Just 10 years ago, the annual budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, was less than $6 billion — notably smaller than other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security. But ICE's budget has skyrocketed during President Trump's second term, becoming the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency, with $85 billion now at its disposal.

The windfall is thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacted last July. After hovering around the $10 billion mark for years, ICE's budget suddenly benefited from a meteoric spike.

""With this new bill and other appropriations, it's larger than the annual budget of all other federal law enforcement agencies combined,"" said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy institute.

ICE is now the lead agency in President's Trump immigration crackdown, sending thousands of agents into U.S. communities. As its funding and profile has grown as part of those efforts, ICE has come under increasing criticism for its officers' actions, from masked agents randomly stopping, questioning, and detaining people and thrusting them into unmarked vehicles to the recent killing of Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis.

A cycle of more migrants, more money and a larger ICE mission

ICE's sudden growth spurt follows roughly two decades of relatively modest funding since 2003, when the agency was created by merging the U.S. Customs Service with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 2015, for instance, Congress approved a budget of around $5.96 billion, which was nearly $1 billion less than then-President Barack Obama had requested.

In 2019, during the first Trump administration, border control officer's encounters with migrants attempting authorized entry to the U.S. spiked. Those numbers then plummeted as the COVID-19 pandemic prompted invocation of the Title 42 public health law, allowing CBP to expel migrants more quickly, with restricted pathways to asylum.

Encounters rose sharply under former President Joe Biden and soared above 3.2 million in 2023, when Biden lifted Title 42. By late 2024, fewer migrants were arriving at the border, due to U.S. asylum limits and Mexico bolstering enforcement.

When Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he sought to empower immigration authorities to quickly remove migrants and announced a crackdown led by ICE.

Under the 2025 law, ICE has a $75 billion supplement that it can take as long as four years to spend, along with its base budget of around $10 billion. If the agency spends that money at a steady pace and current funding levels continue, it would have nearly $29 billion on hand each year. That essentially triples ICE's total budget from recent years.

To give that large number a sense of scale, consider that the Trump administration's 2026 appropriations request for the entire Justice Department, including the FBI, stands at a little over $35 billion.

The Trump administration has set lofty goals for ICE, aiming to deport 1 million people each year. And the One Big Beautiful Bill Act also allocates $45 billion for ICE to expand its immigration detention system — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last June that the agency will be able to hold up to 100,000 people in custody daily. By comparison, the federal Bureau of Prisons currently holds over 153,000 inmates.

As of Nov. 30, 65,735 people were held in immigration detention, according to the data tracking project Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

With those metrics in mind, ICE went on a hiring spree in 2025, fueled by its bigger budget. In just one year, the agency says, it ""more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000."" (The Office of Personnel Management, which tracks federal workforce statistics, is only updated through Nov. 30 and does not reflect any hiring made by the DHS in the last quarter of the year.)

According to the DHS, ICE received 220,000 applications in 2025, thanks in part to a generous incentive package with perks like a signing bonus of up to $50,000, disbursed over the course of a five-year commitment, and up to $60,000 in student loan repayment.

ICE is still on that hiring spree, looking to hire deportation officers in at least 25 cities around the U.S., according to a job listing on the USA Jobs website that will remain active through the end of September. The starting salary for an ICE deportation officer in the Enforcement and Removal Operations division, or ERO, ranges from $51,632 up to $84,277.

The dramatic growth came in the same year that the Trump administration sharply reduced the number of federal workers, firing thousands of employees and inviting many more to resign.

What else will the new funds be spent on?

With base level funding for DHS and ICE due to expire at the end of January, Democrats in Congress are calling for changes to how ICE operates. It comes after a year in which deaths of people in ICE custody spiked to the highest levels in decades, with ICE reporting seven deaths in December, and three more in 2026, as of Jan. 16.

ICE's increased budget makes sense to Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the right-wing Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group advocating for lower levels of immigration. He says the funding boost "" is directly commensurate with the size of the task the agency is addressing.""

""ICE exists to find and remove people who are in the country illegally,"" Mehlman said, referring to a category that grew when the Trump administration stripped legal status from 1.6 million immigrants in 2025.

The focus of the new spending reflects President Trump's emphasis on arrests and removals, said Margy O'Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center's liberty and national security program who worked at the DOJ in the Biden administration.

O'Herron said she agrees with the idea that, for years, a reasonable case could be made that DHS agencies such as ICE and CBP needed more money. But other parts of the immigration system aren't getting as much help, she said.

""All of the money is going to enforcement to arrest, to detain and to deport,"" she said. ""It's not going to things like immigration hearings or immigration judges, to conduct additional review of whether or not somebody should be in the country. And that is a real problem for the system.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860+0+0/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F20%2F22%2F55db3f65464c9460c780ae2cf733%2Fap25330456653535.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 05:58:26.246797

Why it matters: Democrats largely agree that the bill doesn't go far enough in constraining ICE and Customs and Border Patrol officers, but some in the party still feel compelled to vote to fund the department as a whole.

""It's going to be a tough vote for everyone,"" said Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), who represents battleground-district House Democrats in leadership, telling Axios she is personally undecided.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) isn't offering any guidance so far, telling Axios: ""We're having a conversation about it in the caucus meeting tomorrow.""

State of play: The House is set to vote this week on a package of appropriations bills that would fund the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Labor, along with DHS.

The bills would effectively head off a partial government shutdown through September, which would offer Congress substantial breathing room as it heads into the 2026 midterms.

The package was negotiated by top lawmakers in both parties, but the DHS bill — which is expected to be voted on separately — is already garnering vocal opposition from some corners of the House Democratic caucus.

What they're saying: ""The whole fact that they separated it out is because they know that so many of us have huge concerns about this,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told Axios.

Jayapal announced her opposition in a statement, saying that while the bill includes new oversight measures for immigration agents and funding for body cameras and inspections, it ""simply does not meet the moment.""

Several other prominent progressives, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), said they are opposing the bill for similar reasons.

The intrigue: It's not just progressives. ""I'm incredibly concerned that the agencies are so unresponsive, and ... these agencies are not in charge of themselves and Trump's not king,"" said Rep. Adam Gray (D-Calif.).

Gray, who represents a swing district and is a member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, told Axios that ""people either start responding to things, or it forces Congress' hand to vote 'no' just to heel these folks.""

""So I could see voting against it for that reason,"" he said, but ""as far as the funding for DHS I'm generally supportive of that stuff. So I could go either way right now.""

Yes, but: Another centrist House Democrat, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Axios there will ""be some members for"" the DHS funding bill even as the ""overwhelming majority"" of Democrats are expected to oppose it.

Lawmakers want to ""send a signal to Trump"" and ""put some guardrails,"" on the one hand, the member said, but centrists also need to stay ""strong in supporting border security and law enforcement.""

""You'll get a bunch of frontliners supporting it,"" the Democrat predicted.

The bottom line: ""We're just going through it. I'm on page 12 of 1,000,"" House Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) told Axios when asked if leadership will back the bill.",https://images.axios.com/8I9hrHbfjWIlu8-Pq8pL7NvMTf8=/0x84:3500x2053/1366x768/2026/01/21/1768955493563.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 09:58:28.549556

U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, an Aurora Democrat, sponsored the law that requires DHS to permit congressional oversight visits and is among the plaintiffs.","WASHINGTON • A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week’s notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who is based in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn’t violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Cobb stressed that she isn’t ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs’ attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn’t subject to her prior order, which she issued in the plaintiffs’ favor.

The plaintiffs’ lawyers had asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis.

Video footage showed Good’s SUV stopped sideways in the street and agents approached the vehicle, one of whom attempted to open the driver’s side door. As the SUV moved forward, the ICE officer, standing near the front of the car, fired at least two shots into the vehicle. The SUV then traveled a short distance before crashing into a parked car, where Good was found with a gunshot wound to the head.

Details of the shooting are in dispute. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other federal officials described the shooting as self-defense, calling Good’s actions “domestic terrorism.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey had called the account “bulls—” and alleged Ross “recklessly” used force. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he believes the video evidence shows an “escalation by the officers” and that Good was trying to evade, not attack.

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn’t disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

On Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.

“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” the judge wrote.

Twelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused the Trump administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in illegal immigration enforcement operations.

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds is being used to implement the latest notice policy.

“Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,” plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.

Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.

“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.

“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.

U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, an Aurora Democrat, sponsored the law that requires DHS to permit congressional oversight visits and is among the plaintiffs.

“The law is clear: Members of Congress have a legal right to conduct oversight of federal facilities,” Crow said in a statement to Colorado Politics. “I’ll keep fighting to hold this administration accountable and bring much-needed transparency to taxpayer dollars being spent on these facilities.”

Government attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for legislators to be worried that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. The judge had rejected those arguments last month.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.

The survey, shared with Salon by the Public Policy Polling, found that 53% of Americans believe that “ICE agents are going too far” with their immigration raids, while half, 50%, say that ICE tactics are making communities “less safe.” In contrast, around 40% of respondents said that they did not believe ICE was going too far and 42% said that ICE tactics were making communities “more safe.”

55% of responders supported the idea that the Trump administration was focusing “too much” on immigration and not enough on “on fixing the economy, inflation and the rising cost of living,” and 57% said that ICE officers “should be required to adopt police officer standards like working without a mask and displaying a visible badge number.” Just 37% disagreed that the Trump administration was focusing too much on immigration and 33% disagreed that ICE officers should be held to the standards of police.

The survey also found that 76% of Americans had heard “a lot” about Ross’s killing of Good, while just 16% had heard either “just a little” or “nothing at all.”

Half of the respondents said that they agree that “the ICE officer shot and murdered Renee Nicole Good when she tried to drive away” while 42% said that they believed the administration’s line, that Ross killed Good in “self-defense.”

More broadly, 52% of respondents disapproved of President Donald Trump’s handling of immigration, while 45% approved of his performance on the issue. Another 50% agreed that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “should be fired,” and 53% said that they believe Congress should exercise more restrictions on the behavior of ICE officers before agreeing to fund the agency. Just 31% said they did not think ICE should face more restrictions.

Mars Segovia, who created flyers for the walkout, was surprised by the turnout.

But the aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota, including the killing of an American mother during a confrontation with federal agents, has scrambled the party's playbook.

Now Democrats are trying to translate visceral outrage into political strategy, even though there's little consensus on how to press forward on issues where the party has recently struggled to earn voters' trust.

Some Democrats want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a proposal that echoes “defund the police” rhetoric from Trump's first term, and impeach administration officials like Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Others have taken a different approach, introducing legislation intended to curb alleged abuses by federal agents. However, those ideas have been criticized by activists as insufficient, and there's mounting pressure to obstruct funding for deportations in an ongoing funding debate.

“We’re Democrats. I’m sure we’re going to have 50 different ideas and 50 different ways to say it,” said Chuck Rocha, a party strategist who is advising several House and Senate candidates on immigration this year.

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under President Joe Biden helped return Trump to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden's former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

“It’s not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people’s civil and human rights,” she told The Associated Press. “This country has done that before, and it can do it again.”

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Renée Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

“I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,” said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. “We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,” Garcia added, “which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.”

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats.

On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared to 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

“If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

“I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for ICE to be doing this,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said last week. “The cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this.”

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

The president's approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to AP-NORC polling, from 49% last March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

“Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it’s going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,” he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party's strategy since Good's death was captured on video.

“I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,” he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

“Are we really going to be the Gestapo?” he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state's Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said “there's a lot of pain and anguish.”

“It’s heartbreaking,"" he said in a recent interview. ""It’s chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1fc638c1-e064-4748-99ad-ac736c1f6f0f/wirestory_1108b6228c0f088aa85d4c6d8ce744ba_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-21 04:59:04.722854

Free America Walkout organizers urged people to walk out of work, school and to avoid shopping as a form of protest against the administration’s policies during the first year of Trump’s second term.

The demonstrations are aimed at Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, presidential policies affecting immigrants and transgender people, and increased government surveillance. The goal, organizers said, is to create disruption that forces the administration to take notice.

More than 800 walkouts planned nationwide

Organizers said more than 800 events were planned across all 50 states, with over 38,000 people signed up for rallies stretching from Tampa to Los Angeles to New York City.

At 2 p.m. local time Tuesday, protesters nationwide plan to step away from their daily routines as part of what’s called the “Free America” movement. The group’s slogan: “In the face of fascism, we will be ungovernable.”

Organizers said the action is designed to interrupt normal routines, not just draw crowds.

The demonstrations come in the wake of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Macklin Good, 37, by an ICE officer in Minnesota, which organizers argue has become a rallying point.

The Women’s March, one of the groups behind the effort, said walkouts are also planned internationally, including in Canada, France, Italy and the Netherlands.

With tensions still high around immigration protests, questions remain about public safety. Officials said they were expecting peaceful protests, and the Women’s March said it has a clear nonviolence policy in place.

Protests have surpassed those in Trump’s first term, data shows

Last summer’s “No Kings” demonstrations drew an estimated 5 million people nationwide. While most demonstrations were peaceful, some clashes led to arrests, serious injuries and one death. Officials have stressed that those incidents were the exception, not the rule.

In the year since Trump’s second term began, the number of protests in the U.S. has surpassed those seen at the same point in his first administration, according to data from the Crowd Counting Consortium.

According to the data, more than 10,700 protests occurred in 2025, a 133% increase from the 4,588 recorded during Trump’s first term in 2017. A majority of U.S. counties, including 42% that voted for Trump, have seen at least one protest since his second inauguration, the data showed.

Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., introduced the Realigning Mobile Phone Biometrics for American Privacy Protection Act on Friday to regulate how immigration units within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can use facial recognition technology to screen individuals in the field.

The legislation centers on Mobile Fortify, an application first reported last fall that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to use facial recognition technology to scan faces and retrieve information on individuals captured by their mobile devices’ cameras.

In two separateletters, lawmakers pressed ICE for details on the technology, including how it was tested, when it was first used, and whether it is legal.

“When ICE claims that an image its snaps and runs through an unproven app can be enough evidence to detain people for possible deportation, no one is safe,” Thompson said in a statement about his proposal. “ICE’s use of Mobile Fortify to determine a person’s legal status is an outrageous affront to the civil rights and civil liberties of U.S. citizens and immigrants alike.”

“DHS should not be conducting surveillance by experimenting with Americans’ faces and fingerprints in the field – especially with unproven and biased technology. It is time to put an end to its widespread use. We can secure the Homeland and respect the rights and privacy of Americans at the same time,” he added.

The legislation would require DHS to establish standards and guidelines for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties; prohibit the department from using Mobile Fortify except for at ports of entry; ban DHS from sharing similar apps outside of the department; and require that the apps be removed from DHS systems and made inoperable on non-DHS systems.

In addition, the legislation would mandate the destruction of any biometric information of a U.S. citizen captured previously by the app.

The proposal is cosponsored by Reps. Lou Correa, D-Calif., Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., Grace Meng, D-N.Y., and Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y.

“Using an unproven technology in the United States to determine a person’s citizenship or legal residency is dangerous. This sets a dangerous precedent,” Correa said in a statement.",https://meritalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shutterstock_618887135-min.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 12:03:10.398432

It serves as a counterpart to Alligator Alcatraz, an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades that has attracted controversy due to instances of abuse and negligence toward its detainees.
Mason said she decided to protest Deportation Depot because she thinks immigration policies have reached an extreme.
A Mexican woman living in Florida, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said she speaks with inmates at Deportation Depot.
Deportation Depot doesn’t have the same problems that other detention centers like Alligator Alcatraz have, Bilbao said.","About 50 people gathered in rural Baker County Sunday along the side of the highway in opposition to Florida’s second immigration detention facility Sunday.

The state-run immigration detention center, “Deportation Depot,” is located at the former Baker Correctional Institution in Sanderson and opened in 2025 to hold up to 1,300 detainees. It serves as a counterpart to Alligator Alcatraz, an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades that has attracted controversy due to instances of abuse and negligence toward its detainees.

The crowd was made up of members of north Florida organizations including the Party for Socialism & Liberation, Baker Interfaith Friends, Jacksonville Immigrant Rights Alliance and Florida Immigrant Coalition. Bundled up to fight the cold, rainy day, protesters were holding signs reading, “No ICE detention in Florida,” “Abolish ICE” and “Justice for immigrants.”

The protest’s goal was to promote human rights and discourage the cruelty occurring in the detention center, according to Andrea Mason, a member of North Central Florida Indivisible Group, a left-wing advocacy group. Mason said she decided to protest Deportation Depot because she thinks immigration policies have reached an extreme.

“There’s the right way to do things, and right now, this is just about being as cruel as possible and harming people,” she said.

Mason said she has heard stories about suspected immigrants being abused and mistreated in detention centers that have stuck with her and motivate her to advocate for them. These people deserve to be treated better, she said.

Mason said the one way she could make her voice heard and incite change was peaceful protest. Her goal, she said, was to raise awareness and inspire others.

A Mexican woman living in Florida, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said she speaks with inmates at Deportation Depot. She said they receive contaminated water, solitary confinement and can go up to a week without sunlight.

Her friend and inmate at the center, Jose Antonio Martinez Marino, is depressed and frustrated, she said. Marino, who is from Cuba, has been in detainment for over a year and has no hope of being released. Many are in the same condition, she said.

She said she feels anxious in her everyday life and was nervous to be protesting, as she is still in the citizenship process. She feels America is not a home for her, she said, but she is also scared of going back to Mexico after President Donald Trump suggested military action.

“I don’t feel at all that this can be a place where I can feel safe right now, or worthy,” she said.

Vilerka Bilbao, an attorney for Bilbao Law Firm in Jacksonville and the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said this detention center is one of the facilities the association is monitoring.

Bilbao said she has nine clients being detained at Deportation Depot. Her clients come from all over the world, she said, such as Mexico, Vietnam and Venezuela. The majority of them do not have criminal records worthy of detention, she said.

Since November 2025, Bilbao’s caseload has been increasing. There were 200 arrests last week in Jacksonville, she said.

Deportation Depot doesn’t have the same problems that other detention centers like Alligator Alcatraz have, Bilbao said. Her clients have access to regular sunlight, meetings with an attorney and a law library.

However, her clients said detainees are not getting adequate medical help. She said she has clients who need specialists or X-rays, but are getting refused those services. She’s also heard complaints about the air conditioning being turned off and the flu being spread around the center.

Bilbao said many immigrants get deported to third-party countries, meaning countries that agree to take deported individuals if their native country refuses to take them back. She has one client who immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba in 2021 and is being deported to Ecuador, she added.

There is a false narrative that every detainee is a criminal illegal alien, she said, and that is not the reality. The reality she sees are business owners, nurses, teachers, mothers and fathers being detained sometimes through illegal arrest, she said.

“Businesses are suffering, families are suffering,” Bilbao said.

Miles Gibbs, a 27-year-old Gainesville resident, said he was protesting ICE facilities after hearing about killings and disappearances of suspected immigrants. Though he doesn’t personally feel endangered by ICE, he said he’s worried for people in Minnesota, where a U.S. citizen was recently shot and killed by an agent.

Gibbs has a personal connection to the cause — his family members were arrested in a Chicago ICE protest.

“ICE is out in full force. They’re taking people, they’re heckling protestors. They’re making life hell for people,” he said.

Rebecca Hutman, the pastor of Westminster Presbyterian Church in Gainesville, said she came to protest as a person of faith.

“Jesus tells us to love our neighbours. I don't know — I don’t feel like putting our neighbors into cages is anyone’s definition of love,” she said.

She said she thinks the “rampant cruelty of centers like this” motivates her to figure out how to speak against it.

Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong ""procedural vehicle"" to challenge it.
She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week's notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.
A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes.
Government attorneys have said it's merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Cobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong ""procedural vehicle"" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.

Plaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week's notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Good's death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs' lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

On Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.

""The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs' motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants' January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,"" she wrote.

Democracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.

""We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration's efforts to hide from congressional oversight,"" she said in a statement.

Twelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE's amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump's administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs' attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn't shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.

""Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,"" plaintiffs' attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.

Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.

""This is really a challenge to a new policy,"" Richer said.

Plaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS's annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.

""This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,"" the lawyers wrote.

Government attorneys have said it's merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.

""The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,"" wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2026/01/20/AP26010560028866_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-21 09:57:52.668974

The grand jury subpoenas were delivered a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation of Walz, Frey and other Democrats who have criticized Trump’s deportation drive in Minnesota.
Walz, who unsuccessfully ran for vice president in the 2024 election won by Trump, said the federal justice system was being weaponized to intimidate Trump’s political adversaries.
The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit brought on behalf of a group of citizens who said their constitutional rights had been infringed by federal agents.","The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday subpoenaed the offices of Minnesota’s governor and attorney general, and mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, as it weighed whether their public opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement surge in the Twin Cities amounts to a crime.

One of the jury subpoenas, shared with the media by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, orders his office’s custodian of records to produce documents since the beginning of 2025 related to “cooperation or lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities.”

The federal grand jury subpoenas were served on six offices of state and local Democrats, according to a Justice Department official, including those of Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison.

“Whether it’s a public official, whether it’s a law enforcement officer, no one is above the law in this state or in this country, and people will be held accountable,” U.S. Attorney Pam Bondi said in a Fox News interview after arriving in Minnesota on Friday.

“Our men and women in law enforcement deserve to be safe, and that’s what we’re going to do in Minnesota,” Bondi added, without explicitly addressing the newly issued subpoenas.

Walz, Frey say public at risk

Trump, a Republican, has sent thousands of Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into the Minneapolis area in recent weeks to conduct deportation roundups, unprecedented in scale, that have led to numerous violent confrontations with residents.

The agents have carried rifles through the city’s snowy streets, dressed in military-style camouflage, tactical gear and masks, drawing loud but mostly peaceful protests from residents.

Walz and Frey have denounced the ICE operations as reckless political theater that was putting the public at risk and was designed to provoke chaos that Trump would use as a pretext to exert an even greater show of force.

Although he has urged protesters to remain orderly, Walz also has openly encouraged citizens to record video of any arrests or other encounters between ICE agents and members of the public to create a database for potential “future prosecution” of wrongdoing by federal law enforcement.

Trump administration officials have accused Walz and Frey of deliberately stoking interference with ICE operations in “collusion” with anti-government agitators, which the governor denies. Justice Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.

The hostility of many residents to the ICE crackdown has only deepened since one agent fatally shot an American woman, Renee Good, in her car nearly two weeks ago.

Federal officers have used tear gas and other chemical irritants against protesters, and have drawn outrage for racially profiling Black, Latino and Asian U.S. citizens, including a man who was wrongly arrested and pulled out of his home on Sunday dressed in underpants and sandals.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, said officers who broke down the man’s door with gun’s drawn were seeking two “criminal illegal aliens” from Laos who are subject to deportation orders.

One of those men, who ICE officials pictured on “Wanted” posters and described on Tuesday as still at large, was actually in a prison south of Minneapolis serving a four-year term he received in late 2024 for kidnapping, according to public court records and the state online inmate locator.

The man who was wrongly detained, and later released, ChongLy “Scott” Thao, 56, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said the agents who arrested him presented no warrant.

Government agents are forbidden under the U.S. Constitution from forcing their way into homes and other private property without a warrant signed by a judge, or to arrest someone without “probable cause” that a crime was committed.

The grand jury subpoenas were delivered a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation of Walz, Frey and other Democrats who have criticized Trump’s deportation drive in Minnesota.

Walz, who unsuccessfully ran for vice president in the 2024 election won by Trump, said the federal justice system was being weaponized to intimidate Trump’s political adversaries.

He has pointed to investigations opened in recent weeks against such figures as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has criticized as being too hesitant to lower interest rates, and several U.S. military veterans serving in Congress who issued a video statement urging members of the armed forces to resist illegal orders.

It would be highly unusual for federal prosecutors to bring a criminal conspiracy case based on statements from public officials about government policies.

The Justice Department has struggled in some cases to secure indictments, an unusual rebuke from grand juries given that prosecutors alone present evidence to those panels and need only show probable cause that a crime was committed, a lower legal standard than it takes to obtain a conviction at trial.

Grand juries twice rejected the DOJ’s attempts to re-indict New York Attorney General Letitia James after a judge threw out a criminal case against her and also refused to sign off on several cases connected to Trump’s law enforcement surge in Washington last summer.

Democrats have called for calm

Democratic politicians in Minnesota have also sued the Trump administration, asking a judge to order an end to what they call the unconstitutional excesses of his enforcement surge.

On Friday, a federal judge in Minnesota barred immigration agents deployed en masse in the Minneapolis area from arresting, detaining or using pepper spray and other crowd-control munitions against peaceful protesters or individuals who were merely observing ICE activities.

The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit brought on behalf of a group of citizens who said their constitutional rights had been infringed by federal agents.

“Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace rather than with baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,” Walz said in a statement on Friday.

Frey said separately that the federal government was trying “to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs” and that “every American should be concerned.”",https://minnlawyer.com/files/2026/01/ICE-Minnesota-Reuters-w-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 04:59:08.678440

Thousands of union members, religious faithful and ordinary citizens are expected to participate in a massive statewide economic strike on Friday that organizers are hoping will bring an end to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Minnesota.

The event, called “A Day of Truth and Freedom,” is being organized by union representatives, faith leaders and community members. They are urging Minnesotans not to go to work, school or go shopping in response to the ongoing federal immigration enforcement surge in the state.

Officials from the Minnesota AFL-CIO, the state’s federation of more than 1,000 affiliated local unions, said Tuesday that they voted to endorse the event to protest “against ICE’s occupation of our communities and the unconstitutional detention of countless innocent Minnesotans, including a significant number of union members.”

“They are indiscriminately targeting Minnesotans of color, regardless of citizenship or immigration status,” Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham said. “Many people are fearful of daily activities like going to work, shopping for groceries and sending their children to school.”

She said union members on Friday would join fellow Minnesotans “to call for ICE to leave our state, no additional funding for ICE, legal accountability for ICE’s killing of Renee Good and for Minnesota’s large corporations to stop cooperating with ICE.”

Good, 37, of Minneapolis, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7. The shooting was recorded on several phones, including one held by Ross.

ICE enforcement in the state has intensified since the shooting, causing many workers to fear for their lives, said Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation of the AFL-CIO, which represents more than 175 local unions and 80,000 union members.

Some workers represented by the union have been detained or are afraid to go to work, Gabiou said at a press conference on Monday. “They’ve had to make gut-wrenching, life-altering choices about whether or not they’re going to go to work, so they can put food on the table, or whether they’re going to stay home, and stay safe, and stay alive,” she said.

Stores closing

Businesses and stores across the metro area have announced plans to be closed on Friday. Among them is Mississippi Market Co-op, which has three stores in St. Paul, joining forces with the two Wedge Community Co-ops in Minneapolis, Eastside Food Co-op in Minneapolis, the Seward Community Co-op locations in Minneapolis and River Market Co-op in Stillwater.

“As a cooperative, we believe our shared labor, time, and economic participation are powerful tools,” Mississippi Market officials wrote in a statement shared on social media. “This coordinated statewide pause reflects our commitment to democratic action, mutual responsibility, and concern for our communities. Acting together is one way we live our cooperative values. We stand with those calling for justice and demand ICE leave Minnesota now.”

Dozens of St. Paul restaurants and bars also are planning to close Friday in support of the strike, including 620 Club, the Black Hart of St. Paul, Caydence Records and Coffee, Claddagh Coffee, Emerald Lounge, Estelle, Hyacinth, J. Selby’s, Lost Fox, Marc Heu Patisserie, Mucci’s Italian, Quixotic Coffee and others.

Craft stores Wet Paint and the Yarnery also plan to close for the day.

Some businesses are modifying their approach: Catzen Coffee, on Grand Avenue in St. Paul, plans to pause its regular business model to open for the day as a community space with free drip coffee.

Holly Weinkauf, the owner of the Red Balloon Bookshop on Grand Avenue, called the decision to shutter her shop on Friday “complex.”

“The biggest thing for us is wanting to be in solidarity with our community, with our neighbors who are being significantly impacted.”

Weinkauf said her employees were unanimous in their support of the closure. “Everyone felt that this was the best way to show up for our community,” she said. “They felt strongly that, whether they were paid or not, we should be closed. I made the choice that people will be paid for that day.”

The whole situation already is taking a financial toll on the Twin Cities, she said, but she thinks Friday’s strike will send a message if enough people participate.

“I do struggle with the financial impact to our cities that are already struggling with so much,” Weinkauf said. “It is important. It is beyond not normal.”

“We need to suspend the normal order of business and demand the immediate end of ICE actions in our state,” said Lisa Erbes, a co-leader for Indivisible Twin Cities, which is helping organize the event. “We demand that the federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to many Minnesota residents be held accountable, and we call for Congress to intervene immediately.”

ICE activity is “violating the constitutional and human rights of Americans and our neighbors,” Erbes said, and businesses must “do their part in getting ICE out of Minnesota.”

Somali business owners were planning their own news conference Wednesday in Minneapolis to endorse the Friday shutdown.

Reflection, prayer, solidarity

Clergy from around the country are expected to come to Minnesota on Friday to participate in the economic strike.

Asad Zaman, executive director and imam with the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, spoke at a press conference Tuesday morning at Redeemer Lutheran Church in St. Paul that was organized by St. Paul-based nonprofit ISAIAH.

“Over the last few weeks, Minnesotans have witnessed scenes we imagined do not happen in our country,” Zaman said. “We have witnessed elderly people dragged out of their homes in their underwear. We have witnessed workers being assaulted and kidnapped when they are at work trying to take the garbage out. We have witnessed people being beaten up for the simple act of videotaping and photographing activities. And we have witnessed a mother being murdered moments after she dropped off her child,” in reference to Good.

While the “heavy-handed tactics” appear to be designed to spread fear, Minnesotans “have responded with calm … and peaceful protests, and we intend to continue to do so,” he said.

Clergy are asking for Friday to be a “day of reflection, of prayer, of invocation, and a day of solidarity,” he said. “We ask for all Minnesotans to stay home or to protest peacefully as they are called to do so. We call upon all employers to take the day off so the people can spend a day in solidarity and in quiet prayer and reflection.”

The Minnesota Nurses Association supports participation in the economic strike, but is not calling for a work stoppage or walkout.

“Nurses hold a unique and essential role as caregivers and patient advocates, and MNA encourages members to honor the no-strike provisions of their contracts and report to work as scheduled,” officials said in a statement. “Continuing to provide care is not an absence from this moment — it is an act of solidarity. By showing up for patients while standing together, nurses are protecting Minnesota’s most vulnerable community members in the ways only nurses can.”

The union represents nurses and health care workers, including many who are immigrants or have immigrant loved ones directly impacted by ICE enforcement, officials said.

The University of St. Thomas will continue with normal operations on Friday “to serve its students,” according to a statement from the university. “However, employees who wish to participate in this, or any other peaceful demonstration, can work with their managers and request time off to attend.”

A spokesman for Macalester College in St. Paul declined to comment.

A rally, march — and plea

“A Day of Truth and Freedom” will culminate in a 2 p.m. rally and march through downtown Minneapolis. The rally will start at the Commons, at 425 Portland Ave. S., organizers say.

While the work stoppage will be hard on small businesses, business owners “recognize that this is an emergency,” said Kate Havelin, a spokeswoman for Indivisible Twin Cities. “We have to stop ICE. This is an emergency, and we have to deal with it.”

Organizers of the economic strike are particularly calling on officials at Target, Home Depot, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Hilton and Delta Airlines to “speak out and demand ICE leave Minnesota,” according to Havelin.

Two employees who were working at the Target in Richfield were arrested inside the store by ICE agents. Both young men were U.S. citizens, she said, and Target officials did not intervene.

“Target and other businesses could post signs saying ICE is not allowed in unless they have a signed warrant,” Havelin said. “There is something businesses can do to protect their workers and to protect their customers because when you are letting ICE wander into your store or hang out or stage in your parking lot, you are not protecting your staff, and you’re not protecting your customers. And that doesn’t seem like good business sense.”

Target officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It’s a state led by Democrats — including Gov. Tim Walz, who ran on the ticket against Trump in 2024. It has a large immigrant population, including Somalis, who Trump has described as “garbage.” It became a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment and civil unrest after George Floyd’s killing by a police officer in 2020. Allegations of fraud in federally funded programs have given Trump an opening to assert control.

“There’s really nowhere else in the country that ticks all of those boxes,” said Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor, who added that the White House’s push in Minnesota comes with a strategic benefit: the federal appeals court that would review legal challenges to Trump’s actions in the state is dominated by Republican appointees.

The administration and its allies see Minnesota as uniquely recalcitrant and forceful in its pushback to the Trump administration’s agenda on almost every front. Though other Democratic-led cities and states and have resisted Trump’s deportation push and have battled his policies in court, they say the across-the-board opposition in Minnesota — and the uniquely aggravating factor of a burgeoning fraud scandal — has led to the culmination of legal and political battles in the state.

Here’s a look at the legal battles playing out in Minnesota, a microcosm of the nation:

Mass detention of deportation targets

Trump’s most visible assertion of power in Minnesota is the infusion of federal officers and agents — dubbed “Operation Metro Surge” — into Minneapolis, St. Paul and the surrounding region. Courts estimate that as many as 3,000 federal officials have descended on the state to carry out immigration operations,which have drawn protests and inflamed tensions with local residents and elected officials.

Those efforts have resulted in a corresponding surge of litigation, particularly by detained immigrants targeted for deportation, who say they’re being held illegally without the opportunity for bond.

Judges across the country have almost uniformly rejected the administration’s position in similar cases. Cases in Minnesota have been skyrocketing since Operation Metro Surge began, with dozens of new petitions filed each day. And the results have been consistent: Judges, even those appointed by Trump, have called the mass detention illegal and ordered the administration to provide bond hearings or release detainees outright.

Force against protesters

Protesters in Minnesota are challenging the use of force by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and others involved in Operation Metro Surge as well, mirroring litigation that followed deportation operations in Los Angeles and Chicago.

That led to a ruling Friday by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez barring ICE and other federal agents involved in the surge from using certain crowd control tactics, arresting peaceful protesters and conducting vehicle stops in ways intended to chill free speech. Menendez found that ICE agents had repeatedly used retaliatory force against peaceful protesters, a dynamic that became even more fraught after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good.

Appeals courts blocked or narrowed rulings curtailing Trump’s actions in Chicago and Los Angeles, and the administration is betting the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals will follow suit and block Menendez’ ruling.

Protected status for Somali immigrants

Trump has repeatedly railed against Somali immigrants in the wake of allegations of pervasive fraud in federally funded programs. And last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to revoke “temporary protected status” from several thousand Somalis living in the U.S. after fleeing war and strife in their homeland.

That move mirrored similar cancellations of protected status for Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and others. Lower-court judges sought to block those cancellations, saying they were authorized on false or discriminatory pretenses — only for appellate courts and the Supreme Court to allow the administration to proceed.

Threat to invoke the Insurrection Act

Trump sent the National Guard into Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon over the wishes of state and local officials to shore up what he characterized as immigration operations besieged by violent resistance. And in each case, federal courts found the deployments exceeded Trump’s authority.

The Supreme Court agreed last month, finding that Trump did not have the authority to deploy National Guard troops — typically controlled by governors — into American cities without first determining the “regular forces” of the military were unable to control the unrest. That leaves Trump with an option he’s long flirted with: Invoking the Insurrection Act to send the military directly into U.S. cities.

Trump made his threat to Minnesota explicit last week, noting that other presidents had invoked the Act to quell unrest. But state and local leaders say the presence of uniformed military on the streets of an American city would further inflame tensions and violate historical norms about turning the military on civilians.

Targeting political adversaries

Trump has been increasingly overt about his desire to turn the machinery of the Justice Department against those he sees as political foes, pressing Attorney General Pam Bondi to move quickly even when career prosecutors view his preferred cases as weak or meritless.

Now, the Justice Department has signaled it is investigating Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — both Democrats, and two of the state’s most outspoken critics of ICE’s actions — for impeding immigration officials. Little is known about the status of the investigation, but the probe appears rooted in the officials’ public opposition to the federal government’s aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota and ICE’s tactics in the Twin Cities.

Walz and Frey have rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing and argued they’re being targeted for their opposition to federal policy and views.

Unilateral funding cuts

Trump has also vowed to yank billions in funding from Minnesota over allegations that Somali fraudsters had bilked federally funded programs. The administration has already sought to pull funds from so-called “sanctuary” cities and states, where local leaders decline to assist with federal immigration enforcement, and has targeted nutrition assistance funding in Minnesota and elsewhere.

Last week, a federal judge in Minnesota, Laura Provinzino, blocked the Department of Agriculture from slashing funding to Minnesota for administering the SNAP program, saying that the state had fully complied with legal requirements for verifying eligible recipients. Instead, the judge said USDA had “pulled the rug out from under Minnesota without offering any reasoned explanation” by making new, onerous demands that were virtually impossible to satisfy.

Judges have blocked the administration from nixing disaster relief fund over “sanctuary city” policies, but Trump has recently vowed to pull all federal funds out of Minnesota over what he has characterized as rampant, unchecked fraud in federally funded programs.

Suing over the voter rolls

Minnesota is also one of 22 states the Justice Department is suing to gain access to voter registration files, a nationwide push that has begun to meet resistance in courts as well.

A federal judge in California last week shot down DOJ’s effort in the state, calling it a thinly veiled effort to disenfranchise legal voters.

“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the Executive without action from Congress and public debate,” wrote U.S. District Judge David Carter, a Clinton appointee to the federal bench in Santa Ana. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections our country promises and the franchise that civil rights leaders fought and died for.”

In Minnesota, the battle is taking place before Menendez, who has a hearing scheduled on the issue for early March.

Blocking lawmakers from ICE oversight

A day after the Good shooting rocked Minneapolis, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem implemented a new policy blocking members of Congress from visiting ICE detention facilities without one week’s notice. That policy echoed a similar one that had been blocked by a federal judge last month.

Noem didn’t publicly announce the updated policy, and three Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota were turned away when they sought to enter an immigration detention facility in Minneapolis — one of them even carrying a printout of the December ruling in their favor.

The earlier, blocked policy was rooted in an effort by DHS to keep Democratic lawmakers from making unannounced visits to ICE facilities to spotlight what they have described as abuses or unsafe conditions — but visits that DHS officials have described as publicity stunts. But U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb found that the policy violated federal appropriations law that prohibits the use of certain funds from being used to interfere with congressional oversight visits.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fee%2Ffe%2F87aa85994340a3792e6501ff6777%2Ftrump-one-year-photo-gallery-23593.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 21:57:05.540381

ICE and Border Patrol officers have used aggressive tactics during the recent crackdown, including breaking down the door of a family's home without a judicial warrant and pulling people from vehicles.

Immigration officers' tactics are ""born of necessity,"" Bovino said, and ""well-grounded in law.""

""Everything we do is legal, ethical and moral,"" he said.

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, expressed frustration that advocates have no way of knowing whether the government's arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.

Meanwhile, federal prosecutors served grand jury subpoenas Tuesday to Minnesota officials as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded law enforcement during a sweeping immigration operation in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, a person familiar with the matter said.

The subpoenas, which seek records, were sent to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, the person said.

The person was not authorized to publicly discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The subpoenas are related to an investigation into whether Minnesota officials obstructed federal immigration enforcement through public statements they made, two people familiar with the matter said Friday. They said then that it was focused on the potential violation of a conspiracy statute.

Walz and Frey, both Democrats, have called the probe a bullying tactic meant to quell political opposition. Frey's office released a subpoena, which requires a long list of documents for a grand jury on Feb. 3, including ""any records tending to show a refusal to come to the aid of immigration officials.""

The Justice Department called the state's lawsuit, filed soon after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an immigration officer, ""legally frivolous.""

Good, 37, was killed on Jan. 7 as she was moving her vehicle, which had been blocking a Minneapolis street where ICE officers were operating. Trump administration officials say the officer, Jonathan Ross, shot her in self-defense, although videos of the encounter show the Honda Pilot slowly turning away from him.

Since then, the public has repeatedly confronted officers, blowing whistles and yelling insults at ICE and Border Patrol. They, in turn, have used tear gas and chemical irritants against protesters.

These unprecedented moves weaponize what should be an impartial judiciary and instead seek to make it a component of the immigration enforcement apparatus.","One year into President Trump’s second term, federal immigration policies are systematically dismantling the right to due process. From the early days of his administration, Trump has launched a widespread crackdown on immigrants, enacting a series of policies that have vastly expanded detention, deportation, and enforcement while gutting long-standing protections for due process—the right to fair treatment under the law. Due process is a fundamental right guaranteed to everyone in the United States by the U.S. Constitution and underpins democratic governance. Yet in just one year, Trump has turned the U.S. immigration system into a weaponized force of exclusion, harming community members, sidelining values core to the functioning of a healthy democracy, and posing grave threats to noncitizens and citizens alike.

At the one-year mark of this administration’s efforts to dismantle due process, here are some of the core policy measures that have curtailed immigrants’ rights, separated families, destabilized communities, and undermined our democratic values.

The Trump administration has vastly expanded immigration detention, subjecting hundreds of thousands of people to unnecessary and prolonged detention.

As a presidential candidate in 2024, Trump promised “the largest deportation program” in the country’s history. Since returning to office, he has made good on that promise, making mass deportation a core component of his administration’s agenda. Thanks to Congress’s passage of an unprecedented $170 billion spending package for immigration enforcement and detention, the president has the tools to carry out this cruel promise, including $45 billion explicitly for expanding civil immigration detention.

This colossal allocation of funds—coupled with policies to restrict bond, expand mandatory detention, and use racial profiling as a basis for arrest—has funneled more people into immigration detention than ever before. People in detention experience grave health risks and difficulties accessing essential services, with predictable results; 2025 holds the grim distinction of having the most people die in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in decades. Even analysis of the government’s own data shows that detention is unnecessary to deter immigration or ensure people show up for their immigration proceedings.

Nevertheless, the administration has widened its net and targeted more and more people for detention, including new mothers appearing at scheduled immigration appointments, foreign students targeted for their speech, and even U.S. citizens. According to an analysis by the Vera Institute of Justice, more than 290,000 people have been detained since the start of Trump’s second term through mid-October 2025, a 19 percent increase compared to the same period the year prior.

Needing the infrastructure to facilitate this mass detention agenda, the administration has co-opted county jails, federal and state prisons, and military bases for immigration purposes. It has also designated Guantanamo Bay as a holding site for deportations, sent people to a notorious prison in El Salvador, and facilitated deportations to third countries where immigrants have no ties, threatening to create legal black holes where U.S. protections—including due process rights—may be impossible to enforce.

Beyond the obvious denial of liberty, these policies treat detention as the default, pressuring people to lose hope, abandon valid legal claims, and accept deportation orders simply to escape indefinite confinement. Those who stay to fight their case face harsh detention conditions and a high likelihood of being transferred to facilities across the country, far from their families and attorneys. Collectively, these efforts make it more difficult to find increasingly limited legal representation, significantly reducing people’s chances of getting a fair day in court.

The Trump administration has turned courthouses and routine immigration appointments into enforcement zones, punishing people for following the law.

People fulfilling their legal obligations by attending hearings and mandated check-ins with ICE are now being targeted for arrest when they appear at what used to be routine immigration appointments. These arrests funnel people actively following the legal process into immigration detention, where they are either quickly deported without the chance to defend their legal rights or forced to continue their immigration case behind bars, away from their families and communities. This undermines due process by punishing people for complying with the law and sends a dangerous message that participation in the legal system carries the risk of detention and deportation—making communities less safe.

VIDEO:

The Trump administration has militarized immigration enforcement, deploying armed forces to occupy U.S. cities and empowering ICE to implement violent tactics.

The administration has falsely and harmfully equated immigration with crime and “invasion” to justify its agenda, including the deployment of more than 35,000 federal troops nationwide, in part to aid ICE operations and quell anti-ICE protests. The deployments, which have often gone against the wishes of the states’ governors, have been met repeatedly with legal challenges and court rulings against the federal government. Aggressively militarized immigration enforcement efforts undermine public safety, community trust, and civil liberties—recently resulting in the tragic killing of a Minnesota woman, Renee Good, by an ICE officer in January. These actions divert resources from state and local governments to vastly expand the federal government’s enforcement apparatus, place millions under military occupation, and erode the constitutionally protected rights of noncitizens and citizens alike.

By conducting massive operations that treat cities as war zones and use the cover of “Kavanaugh stops” to conduct door-to-door enforcement and other stops in immigrant neighborhoods on the basis of “apparent race” and other factors, the administration is manufacturing a crisis to do away with due process rights.

The Trump administration has bypassed immigration courts, denying people the right to fair hearings.

The president and vice president have both decried the existence of immigration courts as barriers to enacting their mass deportation agenda, even going so far as to call immigration court a “fake legal process.”

The administration has sidestepped the courts and the ability of people to defend their rights wherever it can. It has dramatically expanded the use of “expedited removal,” a process that authorizes immigration officers to deport people who meet certain (and rapidly multiplying) criteria without a hearing. This fast-tracked process makes it nearly impossible for people to consult with counsel, present evidence, or otherwise contest the case being made against them before a judge—all essential components of due process.

Without access to the courts, there are few safeguards preventing the government from permanently expelling anyone deemed undesirable, noncitizens and citizens alike. The result has been wrongful deportations of people with valid legal claims, including asylum seekers fleeing persecution and long-term residents with deep family and community ties. By stripping away access to the courts, this policy dismantles one of the most fundamental protections of due process: the right to a fair and just hearing.

The Trump administration has weaponized the courts and undermined judicial independence to new extremes.

An essential component of due process is the ability not only to have one’s case heard before a judge, but to have an impartial judge. Immigration courts, however, have never been independent judicial bodies, as they are administered not by the judicial branch but by the executive. As a component of the U.S. Department of Justice, they are overseen by the attorney general—who is appointed by and executes the policies of the president.

This fact, which has long hindered the impartiality of the immigration legal system, has been fully exploited by this administration. Despite more than 3 million currently pending cases, the administration has fired more than 100 experienced immigration judges, many of whom have backgrounds in immigration legal defense, and eliminated nearly half of the body responsible for reviewing appeals. Attorney General Pam Bondi, using her authority to refer cases to herself due to the courts’ position in the executive branch, has further vacated judges’ decisions with which she disagrees.

To fill the gap created by their own firings, the administration has loosened the requirements and training needed to be an immigration judge. The government is also turning to unqualified military lawyers without any experience in immigration law to serve as what have been referred to as “deportation judges.” Immigration law is notoriously complex; it is unfathomable that someone without experience and little training would preside over cases that can often mean the difference between life and death. These unprecedented moves weaponize what should be an impartial judiciary and instead seek to make it a component of the immigration enforcement apparatus.

The Trump administration has sought to eliminate federal funding for legal access and representation programs for people facing deportation.

Unlike in the criminal justice system, there is no right to government-appointed representation in immigration court for people who cannot afford to hire an attorney. Yet it is nearly impossible for someone to understand the complexity of immigration law without a lawyer. Research consistently indicates that immigrants represented by a lawyer are significantly more likely to successfully defend against deportation and obtain legal relief. People in detention face even more challenging circumstances, with limited access to a small pool of volunteer attorneys and difficulty obtaining evidence to use in their defense from within the confines of detention.

Over the past year, the Trump administration has slashed federal funding to help people access legal information and representation. It has sought to eliminate funding for virtually all immigrant legal service programs, including those for children and people with mental health disorders unable to represent themselves. While cuts to some programs, like the Unaccompanied Children Program and the National Qualified Representation Program, have been paused while litigation is pending, the administration has continued its attempts to undermine their efficacy and independence through other actions. These efforts leave millions of immigrants, including children, asylum seekers, and families, without meaningful access to counsel.

Without the support of an attorney, people of all ages face a system drastically stacked against them, forced to argue their case alone against a trained government lawyer—a massive undermining of the fairness of immigration proceedings.

The Trump administration has threatened citizenship and revoked legal status from people in the country lawfully—subjecting more people to detention and deportation in a system increasingly devoid of due process.

The administration is seeking to curtail the very act of immigration itself by limiting legal immigration pathways—both preventing the arrival of newcomers and stripping people lawfully in the country of status. The administration has stripped visa holders of their legal status for political speech with which they disagree, revoked temporary protected status from migrants from certain countries, and reduced refugee admissions to historic lows—with priority given to white South Africans. And in November 2025, the administration announced it would halt all asylum decisions, placing thousands in legal limbo. It has even planned to denaturalize certain U.S. citizens—setting a quota of up to 200 people per month in 2026—and sought to eliminate constitutionally protected birthright citizenship.

These actions actively criminalize people who are fleeing violence in their home countries and push them into increasingly dangerous and desperate situations. But immigrants are central to our culture, our families, our economy, and our communities in the United States. Welcoming newcomers and providing ample legal pathways to citizenship, security, and stability promotes our collective well-being and prosperity. Americans agree: polling shows that a record-high 79 percent consider immigration to be good for the country.

Yet the administration is acting against public sentiment and is instead attacking both noncitizens and citizens—whose legal status and citizenship were thought to be inviolable—vastly expanding the number of people who can be targeted by its dangerous detention and deportation enforcement tactics.

The bottom line: due process is essential to our democracy and cannot be taken for granted.

Despite these attacks, people across the political spectrum in the United States are increasingly opposing the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and mass detention efforts.

More than 100 lawsuits have been filed against the administration for its immigration policies. Federal courts have already reaffirmed the right to bond hearings for many people facing deportation; challenged the government’s position that it can indefinitely detain people it seeks to deport to a third country; and rejected the use of detention in retaliation for exercising constitutionally protected speech. They have further upheld New York State’s ban on warrantless arrests in state and local courts and barred warrantless arrests in Chicago and Washington, DC, absent a demonstration of probable cause. Many more cases remain pending. Members of Congress have also introduced legislation to protect people appearing for routine legal hearings and appointments in immigration court. Despite these wins, litigation will continue to be dynamic, with appeals and new filings certain to continue to impact the rights and legal options of people at risk of deportation for as long as the administration pushes its hardline agenda.

In addition, local and state governments are supporting community members targeted by the administration. According to the Vera Institute of Justice, in the past year, jurisdictions like Massachusetts, California, Baltimore, and nearly 30 others—including many of those in Vera’s Safety & Fairness for Everyone (SAFE) Network—have stepped up to increase or initiate legal defense funds for immigrants. They join the more than 70 jurisdictions nationwide that have invested in deportation defense programs since 2014 to keep families together, stabilize communities, and safeguard due process. Yet with millions still facing deportation alone without the support of legal counsel under incredibly challenging circumstances, more must be urgently done.

The right to due process and fair treatment under the law is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution to all people in the United States, regardless of where they were born. The systematic erosion of these rights poses grave threats to the safety of immigrant community members and to everyone in the United States. As the Trump administration acts to dismantle a basic tenet of our democracy, leaders at all levels of government and community members alike must continue to push back to safeguard our democracy and advance immigration policies that respect fairness, family unity, and human dignity.",https://vera-institute.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/images/Special-Reports/inside-the-massive-jail-that-doubles-as-chicagos-largest-mental-health-facility/additional_reading/One_Year_of_Trump_Explainer_Blog_XGraphic_1200x630.png?w=1200&h=630&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1768586579&s=fe757c4b3b8084dfccdb4300f5375b9f,N,,2026-01-20 23:58:39.143443

PAUL, Minn. -- Federal immigration agents bashed open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.

ChongLy ""Scott"" Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law alerted him on Sunday afternoon that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

""I was shaking,"" he said. ""They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

""ICE is not doing what they say they're doing,"" St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. ""They're not going after hardened criminals. They're going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.""

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn't want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him ""to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a ""targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

""The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,"" DHS said. ""The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets.""

Thao's family said in a statement that it ""categorically disputes"" the DHS account and ""strongly objects to DHS's attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.""

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS later released the names and photos of two people it described as ""violent illegal alien sexual offenders"" that it was seeking to detain in St. Paul. Thao said he had never seen these men before and they did not live with him.

DHS did not respond to an earlier request from The Associated Press asking why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend, whose first name matches that of one of the men DHS said it was seeking. Chris Thao said he did not know the boyfriend's last name.

Family fled Laos after helping US

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao's treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's ""Secret War"" from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

""I don't feel safe at all,"" Thao said. ""What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.""

District of Columbia federal Judge Jia Cobb issued an order denying a request from a dozen Democratic lawmakers on the technical grounds that an amended complaint or a supplemental brief must be made to challenge a seven-day notice policy instituted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this month for oversight visits.

“The court emphasizes that it denies plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge defendants’ January 8, 2026, memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” according to Cobb’s order.

Earlier this month, Democrats brought an emergency request to Cobb after a handful of Minnesota lawmakers were denied an unannounced oversight visit to a federal facility that holds immigrants following the deadly shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer.

Under a 2019 appropriations law, any member of Congress can carry out an unannounced visit at a federal facility that holds immigrants, but in June, multiple Democrats were denied visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Those 12 Democrats sued over the policy that required a week’s notice, and in December, Cobb granted the request to stay Noem’s policy, finding it violated the 2019 law.

Noem has now argued that the January incident does not violate Cobb’s stay from December because the ICE facilities are using funds through the Republican spending and tax cuts law, known as the “One, Big Beautiful Bill,” and not the DHS appropriations bill. Noem argued that those facilities are therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits by members of Congress.

At least 170 U.S. citizens were detained by ICE through October of 2025, according to a ProPublica investigation that was denied by Noem.

Zoom in: DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that encounters shown in videos posted online are not ""racially based"" and said ""there's a lot of fear-mongering going on by the media.""

Noem said Thursday that officers are acting appropriately and ""in every situation, were doing targeted enforcement.""

""If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they're there and having them validate their identity,"" Noem said at the White House.

But immigration attorney Allen Orr told Axios that ""at her level, there is no way that [Noem] can tell you about Minnesota, or anywhere else, that every one of her officers are acting appropriately.""

The big picture: A shadow-docket ruling from the Supreme Court last September allowed these immigration check stops to occur when there's a combination of suspicions — including appearance, language, accent and workplace — in response to litigation from last summer's Los Angeles immigration raids.

But this is not the final ruling in the case and the case continues to be argued through the lower courts.

Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the initial decision, saying it would eliminate ""judicial micromanagement.""

""We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent on the ruling.

Between the lines: DHS is being sued in several cases for its arrest tactics used against citizens and noncitizens, alike. Many of the lawsuits argue that using a person's appearance for this kind of immigration enforcement in the country's interior does rely on race.

In Chicago, Colorado and Washington, D.C., lawsuits have stopped warrantless arrests and even led to the release of people who are undocumented but were arrested without warrants last year.

There have been long been issues with mistaken arrests and detentions. An investigation from NPR found that more than 800 citizens were detained by ICE from 2007 to 2016.

Driving the news: The ACLU of Minnesota filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging DHS arrest tactics in the Twin Cities and across the state, particularly stops and arrests made allegedly without reasonable suspicion, probable cause or warrants.

Questioning someone about their immigration status in roving patrols risks violating the Fourth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause, the lawsuit alleges.

The case claims that people of Somali-origin and Latinos have been particularly impacted.

Zoom in: One plaintiff in the case is Mubashir Khalif Hussen, 20, a U.S. citizen who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia. DHS agents arrested him in December while he was on his work lunch break in Minneapolis.

Hussen was grabbed and put in a headlock by agents, who then refused to let him show his ID or a photo of his passport card that he had on his phone, according to the suit.

Hussen repeatedly told the agents that he is a U.S. citizen. But the agents said they needed to scan his face or he'd be taken into custody.

""They ignored both his statements and his documentary proof that he is a U.S. citizen. And at no point did the officers ask Mr. Hussen about his ties to the community,"" the lawsuit says.

Hussein was released from an ICE field office hours later without charges, and without being placed into immigration removal proceedings.",https://images.axios.com/78ic_IuwM2H0EymO9T9i-SfLcU8=/0x0:3900x2194/1366x768/2026/01/20/1768919329853.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 21:58:23.664836

The US justice department has issued subpoenas to Democratic Minnesota officials, alleging they conspired to impede federal immigration officers in the state.

The offices of Governor Tim Walz, state Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were among those served with legal summonses as US Attorney General Pam Bondi visited Minnesota following intense protests.

US President Donald Trump meanwhile said he ""felt horribly"" about an ICE agent fatally shooting protester Renee Good, 37, describing her death as a ""tragedy"".

Walz called the probe a ""partisan distraction"", saying the justice department ""does not seek justice"" in the killing Good, whose death sparked unrest.

In a statement to the BBC, Frey said the justice department was pursuing him for disagreeing with the Trump administration. Ellison accused Trump of weaponising the justice system.

The justice department did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.

Ellison, the state's top prosecutor, said on X that the justice department sent him a grand jury subpoena for records and documents related to his office's work with respect to federal immigration enforcement.

""Everything about this is highly irregular, especially the fact that this comes shortly after my office sued the Trump administration to challenge their illegal actions within Minnesota,"" he said.

A spokesman for Minneapolis city hall confirmed to the BBC that ""the Office of Mayor Jacob Frey was subpoenaed"".

""When the federal government weaponizes its power to try to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs, every American should be concerned,"" Frey said in a statement.

""We shouldn't have to live in a country where people fear that federal law enforcement will be used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with.""

Subpoenas were also sent to St Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and Mary Moriarty, the Hennepin County prosecutor.

Bondi threatened legal action against state leaders on Sunday if they refused to ""act responsibly to prevent lawlessness"" after a church was targeted during protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Justice department officials, who accuse the activists of ""desecrating a house of worship"", have said they will investigate them for alleged civil rights violations.

Tensions have been rising in the state since ICE ramped up operations in Minneapolis this month as part of Trump's immigration crackdown, with federal officials saying they are targeting the ""worst of the worst"" there.

But unrest escalated after the fatal shooting on 7 January of Renee Good by an ICE agent.

The Trump administration says the ICE agent acted in self-defence, but local officials argue the woman posed no danger.

Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks and 1,500 troops are reportedly on standby.

The US Department of Homeland Security says it has arrested 3,000 ""of some of the most dangerous offenders"" in the past six weeks under Operation Metro Surge.

At a news conference on Tuesday, officials for the Twin Cities - the Minneapolis–St Paul metropolitan area - accused federal agents of racial profiling.

They said off-duty officers had been stopped and asked for proof of citizenship.

""Every one of these individuals is a person of colour,"" said Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley.

Walz and Frey have demanded that ICE leave the area and the state has sued the Trump administration to block the deployment of immigration agents.

Last week, Trump raised the prospect that he could invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act following a night of protests and vandalism in the Minnesota city.

The disorder erupted after an agent was allegedly attacked with a shovel by three Venezuelan migrants and he shot one of them in the leg.

During a press briefing on Tuesday, the president spoke sympathetically about Good and, having learnt that her parents were Trump supporters, he said he hoped they would still vote for him.

He also doubled down on his criticism of the protesters, calling them ""professional agitators and professional people that want to see our country do badly"".

Trump has repeatedly linked the ICE surge in Minnesota to fraud cases that the justice department says involve mostly defendants from the state's large Somali community.

In endorsing a bill that would carry forward a huge spike in funding to ICE, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, acknowledged it excludes most of the ICE reforms Democrats have demanded since the Jan. 7 shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis. But a shutdown or a short-term spending patch, she argued, would be worse.

“A continuing resolution will jettison the guardrails we have secured while ceding authority to President Trump, Stephen Miller, and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem,” she said Tuesday morning.

The strategy is tailor-designed to win bipartisan support for the DHS bill and prevent a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30, when funding is set to expire.

But the outcry from progressives in both chambers is inevitable given the uproar over the Minnesota shooting, and it was already becoming public.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said in a video statement on the social platform X he will vote no on the bill and will help lead the opposition against it.

“It’s a moral disgrace. It has an $18 billion dollar plus up for the ICE agency. That’s right. They are tripling ICE’s budget at a time that ICE is ripping American citizens out of their cars and arresting and shooting American citizens,” he said.

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said on X that she “will not vote to give ICE a single cent.”

“No more blank checks for a rogue agency that operates above the law, escalates violence, and erodes our most basic freedoms,” she added.

The DHS bill includes a few targeted reforms aimed at appeasing Democrats, including a $115 million reduction in funding for ICE enforcement and removal operations, a decrease of 5,500 ICE detention beds and a $1.8 billion cut in Border Patrol funding. It also strengthens oversight of ICE through the Office of the Inspector General and Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

But those figures are a drop in the bucket relative to the funding increases for immigration enforcement included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And liberals had wanted party leaders to go much further by slashing ICE’s budget and installing new rules governing the conduct of ICE officers, including a ban on face masks and explicit warrant requirements prior to arrests.

Those Democrats say the death of Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen and mother of three, at the hands of an ICE officer in Minnesota is evidence Congress needs to rein in an out-of-control agency.

They likely don’t have the numbers to block the bill, given the support of leadership in both parties, but their resistance could create headaches for Democratic leaders, who have faced outside criticism that they haven’t fought back fiercely enough against Trump’s norm-breaking return to office, including on immigration enforcement.

“I think ICE should be abolished, to be honest with you,” Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said last week. “This is like Trump’s secret police that is armed en masse, wandering the streets going door to door.”

“It’s got to be a new iteration of immigration enforcement,” echoed Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas). “I think ICE has — its usefulness as an organization, because of what it’s become, has expired.”

Liberals aren’t expected to take issue with only the DHS bill.

The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday rolled out three other spending bills that would fund the departments of Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and other related agencies. The bills are bundled into a single package, known as a minibus, that the House will vote on later this week.

The House Rules Committee will meet Wednesday to consider the minibus and the DHS bill.

Notably absent from the minibus, however, is an extension of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, long sought by Democrats. It also doesn’t address Trump’s threats toward Venezuela and Greenland.

The health care issue is what precipitated last year’s 43-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.

As an exhibit in her case, she submitted a copy of the federal government’s written solicitation for applicants for the position of “deportation judge.” The solicitation says: “YOU BE THE JUDGE.","A 23-year-old Iowa man who has lived in the United States since he was a year old was detained by federal immigration agents and jailed in Muscatine County while being unlawfully denied a bond hearing, a federal judge has ruled.

The ruling comes in a civil case where the federal government’s efforts to hire “deportation judges” — normally referred to as immigration judges — is alleged by the plaintiff to be part of an effort to hire judges whose views align with President Donald Trump’s political goals.

The case involves Giovanni Uribe-Gonzalez, 23, of Hawkeye, who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in November 2025 after a drunken driving arrest and then placed in the Muscatine County Jail pending possible deportation.

According to court filings by Uribe-Gonzalez’s attorney, Amy Cummings, he was brought to the United States by his mother when he was 1 year old.

“As toddler, he took his first steps on Iowa soil, and he learned to read and write in Iowa classrooms where he was always liked by his peers and teachers. He recited the Pledge of Allegiance each morning and cheered the fireworks every Fourth of July,” Cummings told a federal judge last month. “His every recollection and dream starts and ends in the Hawkeye state, and his identity, values and culture were forged here shaping him into a quintessential American Midwesterner.”

Cummings told the court that in 2021 Uribe-Gonzalez’s family had saved enough money to pay his $495 filing fee for citizenship under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act (DACA). While the government accepted the fee, Cummings alleged, it never fully processed his application and that matter is still pending with no final action taken.

After graduating from West Central High School in Maynard, Uribe-Gonzalez enrolled in a training program for railroad welders, earned his certification, applied for jobs and was then rejected due to his citizenship status. In 2025, he was twice arrested for drunken driving, with both arrests resulting in a conviction on a charge of first-offense drunken driving.

Court records show that after his second arrest in November, he was detained Chickasaw County, where ICE placed a hold on him, preventing his release although an Iowa judge had allowed him to post bond.

According to the court records, David Bindert, an Iowa-based deportation officer with ICE, noted in his written report of the detention that Uribe-Gonzalez had a DACA application pending, but added that Uribe-Gonzalez had “no legal presence in the United States” and was subject to being detained by ICE.

Uribe-Gonzalez was then taken to the Muscatine County Jail for holding, and ICE initiated deportation proceedings.

Attorney cites ad for ‘deportation judges’

As with thousands of other ICE detainees across the country in 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice took the position that the federal law providing for the mandatory detention of detainees applies not just to people who apprehended at the border — which is how the law has been interpreted and applied for decades — but also to people who may have entered the country illegally months or years earlier.

The DOJ’s new mandatory-detention stance has resulted in immigration judges across the country denying detainees the opportunity to argue for release on bond while their case is pending.

Since July 2025, more than 300 U.S. District Court judges in 1,600 cases have rejected that argument, finding the new interpretation of the law is contrary to ICE’s own regulations, its published enforcement guidelines, previous court rulings, and “the overall logic” of the nation’s immigration system.

Despite those rulings, ICE and county jails in Iowa and the rest of the country have continued to hold individuals for indefinite periods without affording them the opportunity to argue for their release on bond. The cases where those practices have been rejected are those in which the detainees have taken their case to U.S. District Court and argued their due process rights are being violated.

On Dec. 16, 2025, Cummings filed such a lawsuit on behalf of Uribe-Gonzalez in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, naming President Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and others as the respondents.

As part of her petition seeking a bond hearing for her client, Cummings noted that the federal government has fired dozens of immigration judges and then advertised for “deportation judges” that Cummings argues are intended to “better align” with Trump’s political goals.

As an exhibit in her case, she submitted a copy of the federal government’s written solicitation for applicants for the position of “deportation judge.”

The solicitation says: “YOU BE THE JUDGE. Help write the next chapter of America. Apply today to become a deportation judge and you may be entitled to these benefits: $159,951 to $207,500 per year… DEFINE AMERICA FOR GENERATIONS… Preside over cases in federal Immigration Court and determine whether an alien has to leave the United States or gets to stay. Make decisions with generational consequences… Restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system.”

Recently, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher ruled in Uribe-Gonzalez’s favor on the bond-hearing issue, noting that district courts across the nation have ruled that such detainees are entitled to a hearing at which they can argue for their release.

The available court records don’t indicate whether such a hearing has been held.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ad-Gavel2.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:59:27.450653

And they expressed concern that the Trump administration’s surge of some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota was undermining residents’ trust in law enforcement and disrupting daily life.

“Can we find a way to make sure that we can do these things without scaring the hell out of our community members and freaking everyone out?” Chief Axel Henry of the St. Paul Police Department asked at a news conference on Tuesday. He added that many people in his city “are scared to death” and “afraid to go outside.”

Federal officials responded by criticizing state and local politicians and defending agents’ actions.

“Our operations are lawful. They’re targeted and they’re focused on individuals who pose a serious threat to this community,” Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol official, said in a separate news conference in the Minneapolis area.

The local officials’ news conference, which also included Sheriff Dawanna S. Witt of Hennepin County and Chief Mark Bruley of the Brooklyn Park police, revealed the escalating tensions between federal officials and Minnesota law enforcement leaders.

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly criticized state and local policies that limit coordination with immigration agents. On Tuesday, the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the offices of at least five Democratic officials in Minnesota — including Gov. Tim Walz, Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and Mayor Kaohly Her of St. Paul — related to their policies on immigration enforcement efforts in the state, according to two people familiar with the matter. Mr. Walz dismissed the investigation in a statement as a “partisan distraction.”

“Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace than baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,” the governor said in a statement.

Elected leaders in Minnesota have repeatedly called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to leave the state, and a lawsuit filed by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul claims that the surge is unconstitutional.

The Trump administration has defended its work in Minnesota as necessary to crack down on illegal immigration and root out fraud in state social service programs. In a court filing on Monday, the administration said that more than 3,000 people who were in the country illegally had been arrested during the campaign. Many of those people, federal officials said, had been convicted of serious crimes.

Mr. Bovino described a highly organized opposition to federal agents in Minnesota, beyond what he had seen in other places, that had made it challenging to carry out their work. Responding to local officials’ criticism of federal tactics, Mr. Bovino said that “those tactics are born of necessity” and that “what we do is legal, ethical and moral.”

Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson warned Maine protestors on Monday not to interfere with federal immigration enforcement.","Community members continue to take precautions amid sightings of federal immigration agents in Maine, though an increase in operations is unclear as the Trump administration remains mum.

Multiple sightings throughout Southern Maine on Tuesday, beginning during the morning commute with five armed agents in three unmarked vehicles in Portland, have been confirmed by volunteer verifying teams working with a community watch hotline.

Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, said the hotline has received increased calls in recent days, from roughly one per day to now one to three calls per minute.

“The calls are a mix of people having questions about safety and what’s going on, people needing to be connected to resources, a big number of bad faith callers and the potential sightings,” Torres told Maine Morning Star.

These sightings come after the mayors of Portland and Lewiston announced last week that they were expecting an increase in federal immigration enforcement in their communities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not confirmed nor denied a forthcoming escalation in Maine and did not respond to requests for comment on the recent sightings.

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said Tuesday there was an “increased presence” of ICE agents but did not respond to questions about how he made his determination. It’s unclear at this time whether recent sightings amount to an uptick. Immigration arrests have been occurring across Maine, with an acceleration beginning in June as President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda got underway.

The hotline, organized by MIRC and the People’s Coalition for Safety, is built for the purpose of identifying federal activity — with more than 300 people trained as verifiers. Organizers are now working to gather details about people who have been detained. They’ve also raised alarm about AI-generated images and the importance of thoroughly investigating each tip before sharing it publicly.

Portland, Lewiston prep for potential uptick in federal immigration operations

As this work ramps up, communities are taking precautions. Immigrants are staying home. More school absences are being reported.

Shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday, Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School in Portland were in a brief lock out, meaning external doors were closed to people entering or leaving, because of potential immigration enforcement activity on Brighton Avenue, district communications coordinator Tess Nacelewicz said.

Chief of the Penobscot Nation Kirk Francis told tribal citizens to carry their identification when traveling, especially near border regions or transportation hubs. Francis had encouraged this at the start of Trump’s second term, too. Citizens of other tribes have been picked up by ICE elsewhere in the country.

Undercover license plates

The Trump administration has begun relying on unmarked vehicles in immigration enforcement, raising concern about people being able to keep track of those taken by authorities and file legal actions without knowing the agency involved.

After receiving a request last week from U.S. Customs and Border patrol for undercover license plates, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows paused the issuance of such plates.

State law permits the use of unmarked vehicles for law enforcement when authorized by the secretary of state. The law also makes it so records for all unmarked vehicle registrations are confidential, therefore Bellows declined to share how many plates were requested. This is the first time Bellows, a Democrat, has paused these plates for federal authorities during her tenure.

Federal agencies can still request general government plates — which in their case would read “U.S. government.” Those plates are generally identifiable as government vehicles, and in the public registration database, they link back to the place of business for that agency.

DHS and ICE declined to say how many undercover plates they requested in Maine.

“DHS is not going to confirm our vehicles and put an even larger target on our officers’ backs,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, criminal rings, murderers, and rapists.”

There have been numerous instances captured on video showing agents in plain clothes not immediately identifying themselves, while arresting people who have no gang association nor criminal history. As of the latest data from November, about 73% of people held in ICE detention have no criminal conviction. And, many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.

There have also been cases where federal immigration agents detained U.S. citizens. On Sunday in Minnesota, for example, a U.S. citizen said agents raided his home at gunpoint without a warrant, forcing him outside wearing only shorts in below freezing conditions before detaining him and returning him home later that day without explanation. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced that they aim to strip more foreign-born Americans of their citizenship.

McLaughlin claimed their officers are facing a “1300% increase in assaults and 3,200% increase in vehicle attacks against them including domestic terrorists following our officers and ramming them with vehicles.”

DHS didn’t provide evidence to support those figures, or for similar claims it has made in the past. The number of assaults on ICE agents have increased, but there is no public evidence that the spike is as dramatic as the federal government has claimed.

“There are legitimate reasons for unmarked plates. Law enforcement in Maine use them routinely for undercover, confidential operations,” Bellows said. “Given what’s happening in Minnesota, and what had taken place in Illinois, we paused issuance of those plates until we can get some assurances that Maine plates won’t be used for lawless purposes.”

In Minnesota, observers have reported ICE and DHS agents switching out and removing license plates on the vehicles they’re using for immigration operations, which is generally against state law. The state has since sued ICE and DHS over that practice, among others.

Illinois and the city of Chicago also sued federal authorities over this practice, after the state launched a plate watch hotline to give residents a way to report suspected license plate tampering.

When asked what type of assurance would satisfy lifting the pause in Maine, Bellows said her department would need more information from the federal agencies about why they are needed and what they’d be used for.

Bellows, who is currently running for governor, said on Monday she was doxxed for her decision. She said she received more than two dozen threatening phone calls after her cell phone and home address were posted online.

Emphasis on nonviolence comes from all corners

Since local officials announced the suspected uptick in immigration operations, Mainers have peacefully gathered to protest around the state. But, the district’s chief federal prosecutor is still calling for protestors to heed to his warning about violence. At the same time, a so-called militia group with a rallying cry to stop “left-wing violence” is trying to build its ranks.

In Portland, hundreds denounced ICE during a protest on Sunday in Monument Square. In Wells, about 130 people stood out near Route 1 demanding the federal agency leave Maine, an action that corresponded with Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

Local organizers have long been preparing for ICE to arrive, emphasizing that their efforts to verify activity and provide mutual aid are rooted in non-violence and focused on de-escalation tactics.

“I think there’s a narrative right now that there’s a desire to agitate, but our work really is rooted in non-violence and showing up for community and keeping loving and steady and calming presence,” said Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine.

Despite that, on Sunday a group called the “Pine Guard” announced it would be forming to counteract “far-left socialist” ICE critics, including by sending people undercover to anti-ICE actions.

“It is not the role of the Pine Guard to physically confront the far-left Socialists, but instead to expose them,” the group wrote on social media.

Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson warned Maine protestors on Monday not to interfere with federal immigration enforcement.

Benson, who was nominated by Trump in September and formerly served as a Maine District Court Judge and homicide prosecutor, wrote, “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property, or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat who is also running for U.S. Senate, has also called for protests to be peaceful — “to meet any hostility with reserve and resolve.”

Without pointing to specifics, the Maine Law Enforcement Coalition issued a statement Saturday in response to what the group categorized “inﬂammatory political rhetoric and misleading public narratives.”

“Recent portrayals suggesting sudden or extraordinary activity are inaccurate and contribute to unnecessary alarm,” the coalition wrote about federal law enforcement actions. “Political spin and sensational media coverage distract from facts and place officers and community members at greater risk.”

Increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents have been documented under the Trump administration: smashing in car windows, shoving people to the ground, and spraying chemical agents. In some cases, immigration agents are using banned chokeholds that cut off breathing.

On Friday, a federal judge gave a significant victory to Minnesota protesters, granting a preliminary injunction preventing federal officers from retaliating against demonstrators.

Since Trump took office, immigration detention has expanded by 83 percent with 73,000 people currently detained each day.","Donald Trump’s return to the White House in 2025 has been a nightmare for immigrants and for the country. The administration’s mass detention and deportation agenda brought forth an onslaught of cruel, violent policies intended to sow fear, suppress dissent, and vilify immigrants. Taking stock of all of Trump’s actions on immigration in 2025 is nearly impossible. This is, of course, by design. The Trump administration’s goal was to “flood the zone” with a flurry of policy changes to overwhelm us. But in spite of its efforts to quash any opposition, activists, organizers, lawyers, journalists, and ordinary people across the country have mounted an incredible resistance to the mass deportation agenda.

A year into Trump’s second term, the White House’s blanket defense of the brutal murder of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis has rattled the nation. Conditions inside detention have deteriorated so much that at least six people have died while in ICE custody since January 3, 2026. (In comparison in 2024 a total of 11 people died in detention). Calls to abolish ICE are once again gaining steam. The years ahead will no doubt continue to be violent (and deadly) for immigrants and those who support them. But this moment presents an opening to build toward dismantling the enforcement apparatus. Reflecting on 2025 through an abolitionist lens is critical as we develop strategies to combat the ongoing mass deportation agenda.

Although Trump 2.0 has inaugurated a new era in state and vigilante violence against immigrants, the administration’s actions build on a long history of anti-Black racism, criminalization, and U.S. militarism that have fueled the detention and deportation machine’s growth over time.

In the first half of 2025, a radical new order for the U.S. deportation regime appeared to be on the horizon. A series of stark new policy departures sowed widespread panic and threw affected communities and political opponents into disarray. Terrifying as the administration’s draconian actions were, many of its early measures were defeated by resistance, rejected by the courts, or collapsed due to poor planning.

An early trial balloon occurred in March when ICE began arresting international student activists, such as Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, who had been involved in Palestine solidarity efforts. In their cases the guise of immigration enforcement was used to detain and punish immigrant students for what were essentially thought crimes, sending a chilling message about the limits of free speech. These pretextual detentions dwindled after being challenged in the courts and eliciting ferocious public disapproval.

The Trump administration also rapidly moved to start detaining immigrants outside the country. At first, interest focused on Guantánamo Bay, where detention capacity would be raised to 30,000, and in an echo of the war on terror, “high-priority criminal aliens” were to be held.

When this plan largely fell through, the offshore experiment continued when Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in the spring to justify transferring over 200 immigrants to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a mega-prison in El Salvador. The administration emphasized false allegations that those sent to CECOT, who were mostly Venezuelan, were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, using innocuous tattoos as supposed evidence.

The unlawful detentions at CECOT were paired with a right-wing media campaign featuring Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Republicans in photo ops that evoked the images of U.S. soldiers posing with people tortured at the Abu Ghraib prison during the Iraq War.

The transfers to CECOT represented another sensational action used to scare immigrant communities and vilify Venezuelans who have, like Palestinians, been on the receiving end of U.S. foreign policy. Yet the threat of mass deportations to El Salvador and the prospect of incarcerating U.S. citizens at the prison have been stalled by multiple layers of resistance.

Despite this, the administration has doubled down on third country deportations, where immigrants are sent to countries to which they have no ties and where they are often subject to detention or other forms of punishment upon their arrival. The Trump administration and State Department have reached out to at least 58 countries, the vast majority of which are on the African continent, to establish transfer agreements for these deportations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this is intentional: “The farther away from America the better, so they can’t come back across the border.”

The small numbers of individuals sent to South Sudan or elsewhere have been vitriolically branded “barbaric criminal illegal aliens.” Yet Orville Etoria, a 63-year-old Jamaican immigrant who had lived in the U.S. for nearly 50 years, poignantly described the experience of being expelled to Eswatini in an interview with The New Yorker: “To be honest, it helped me imagine how the slaves might have felt, going to another land in shackles and chains — that loneliness, that disconnect, that sense of loss.”

Although the absolute number of people being detained offshore or deported to other countries is relatively small, it is important that we challenge these practices for what they portend.

While the Trump administration excels in creating terrifying spectacles, the most significant development of this last year, and one that builds on decades of bipartisan support for immigration enforcement, was the passage of the massive funding bill in July. Congress’s budget reconciliation bill, which allocated an additional $170 billion for immigration enforcement over four years, was an ominous milestone in the history of U.S. immigration policy and the Trump administration’s aspiring fascism. This funding makes ICE the largest law enforcement agency in the country, with a bigger budget than the Bureau of Prisons, FBI, and most militaries in the world. If ICE’s expansion plans are realized, the immigration detention system will triple in size — detaining 120,000-150,000 people at any given time, mirroring the scale of Japanese American internment during WWII.

For years, ICE’s ability to arrest and detain immigrants depended heavily on local police collaborations. Sheriffs’ departments rounded up immigrants, making county jails a gateway to the deportation process. This local dimension was key to building up the immigration enforcement machine. Conversely, sanctuary policy effectively curtailed ICE’s use of local law enforcement in some parts of the country, bringing deportations down.

Now Trump is attempting to create his own occupying army for resistant localities. Initially this took the form of National Guard troops that — along with ICE agents — descended on Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago, carrying out military-style raids utilizing tear gas and stun grenades. But after the bill passed, ICE had more resources. In a matter of months, the number of ICE agents doubled from 10,000 to 22,000.

Now, as we are seeing in Minneapolis, where anti-Black racism and bogus fraud charges against the Somali community have driven right-wing attacks, ICE is using indiscriminate force against immigrants, their supporters, and even uninvolved onlookers. Renee Nicole Good’s murder was a preview of what’s to come if ICE continues to lay siege to our communities.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. As Harvard professor Theda Skocpol put it regarding ICE’s expansion and its potential to become a more centralized federal police force: “The Miller-Trumpites are not interested only in rounding up undocumented immigrants. They will step up using ICE and DOJ enforcements use to harass Democrats, citizen critics, and subvert future elections if they can.”

But it’s worth remembering that the Democrats have long enabled this spiraling enforcement agenda. Last time there was a major effort toward comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 under Obama, the proposed Senate bill only passed after a $46 billion border surge amendment was added at the last minute. With citizenship on the table, the Democrats were willing to make any deal, no matter how harmful it was. Their devil’s bargain of accepting more border militarization and more criminalization only served to further dehumanize immigrant communities. The pre-Trump tradition of bipartisan support for immigration enforcement and the Democrats’ failure to challenge the scapegoating and demonization of immigrants has opened the door to the paramilitarization of American life.

The growing infrastructure for detention and deportation remains the greatest threat to immigrant communities. Detention facilitates deportation, and having more bed capacity means ICE can arrest and deport more people. Since Trump took office, immigration detention has expanded by 83 percent with 73,000 people currently detained each day. ICE has increased the use of private prisons and county jails, converted federal and state prisons and military bases into camps, and is proposing to lock up another 80,000 people using warehouses. Another prison boom is taking place, and as we’ve seen with the rise in mass incarceration over time, it is much harder to bring down these systems once they are built.

It has been a terrifying start to the year. Yet the resistance to the mass deportation agenda is palpable. Roughly 1,000 actions took place across the country the weekend after Good’s death. Local communities are building neighborhood defense networks. From California to Florida, activists are challenging detention expansion through local and state level strategies: blocking zoning permits, filing environmental justice litigation, pushing state legislators, and organizing locally. In small towns in Georgia and New Hampshire, residents have resisted proposed warehouses for detention. A coalition of grassroots and national groups secured a victory when Avelo Airlines decided to end its contract with ICE. Support for ICE has gone down considerably. In a recent YouGov poll, 52 percent of people said they disapprove of how the agency is operating.

The momentum against ICE presents an opportunity for building abolitionist power against the system. It could also help open space for making the case against the broader prison-industrial complex that helped grow the detention and deportation system in the first place.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2239258674-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:58:35.259245

The secretary of health in December moved to cut children's access to gender-affirming care by barring hospitals from delivering such care under government health insurance programmes.
A record number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced across the country in 2025, including more than 1,000 targeting trans rights, according to the research organisation Trans Legislation Tracker.
The State Department's annual human rights report, published in August, had sections on LGBTQ+ rights reduced or removed, as well as on discrimination based on gender or race.
In November, a senior State Department official said U.S. officials would record DEI policies and gender-affirming care for minors in other countries as human rights infringements.","President Donald Trump's first year in office has been characterised by sweeping changes to international aid, human rights policies, immigration and U.S. governance at home and abroad.

He signed a record number of executive orders in his first 100 days, many of which targeted transgender and non-binary rights, access to gender-affirming care and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the United States.

But LGBTQ+ people have been affected across the world, with gaps in humanitarian funding, an onslaught of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, fewer discrimination protections and cuts to refugee programmes.

Here's what you need to know.

What did Trump do in his first year of office?

On his first day as president, Trump declared that the government would only recognise two genders and that federal funds would not be used to ""promote gender identity.""

He then ordered the removal of online government guidance documents on trans issues, an end to DEI programmes and that trans female inmates be sent to men's prisons.

Trump also sought to undo multiple executive orders by his predecessor Joe Biden, including directives to advance LGBTQ+ equality and combat discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

He reinstated a ban on trans people serving in the military, ended federal support for gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19 and vowed to defund schools teaching ""gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.""

Another executive order barred trans women from competing in women's categories of sport.

He also dismantled the U.S. Agency for Development, hitting HIV services and rights groups around the globe. The administration's review of funding in March confirmed 83% of the aid programmes had been terminated.

The administration later cut funding for a suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ+ youth when it slashed the Health and Human Services Department's budget.

The secretary of health in December moved to cut children's access to gender-affirming care by barring hospitals from delivering such care under government health insurance programmes.

Rainbow crosswalks were removed in Florida and Texas - including a memorial to the 49 people shot dead at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016 - to comply with the transportation secretary's instructions to make roadway markings ""free from distractions.""

What impact have the policies had in the U.S.?

A record number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced across the country in 2025, including more than 1,000 targeting trans rights, according to the research organisation Trans Legislation Tracker.

Nearly one in 10 trans adults and 5% of all LGBTQ+ adults surveyed between November 2024 and June 2025 said they had moved to a different state due to LGBTQ-related laws or politics, according to the think tank Movement Advancement Project.

In July, Kim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk jailed in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn marriage equality across the United States. The Supreme Court rejected the bid in November.

A fresh lawsuit was submitted to federal courts by Texas judge Dianne Hensley, who has previously refused to wed same-sex couples, in December.

More than 200 former employees of the Justice Department who quit their roles under Trump said the administration was ""largely abandoning its duty to protect civil rights"" and warned that the rights of all Americans were at risk.

Corporations including Mastercard, Boeing, Deloitte, Target and Walmart scaled back their sponsorships and donations to LGBTQ+ groups in 2025, with Pride organisers stating that funds for their events were cut.

Have people been impacted internationally?

The Trump administration's cuts to global humanitarian programmes and foreign aid have led to 2.5 million people losing access to HIV medication and thrown rights organisations into a funding crisis.

The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a landmark U.S. initiative from 2003 to fight HIV around the world, stopped HIV prevention for most groups at a higher risk of an infection, including gay and bisexual men.

Activists in Africa shared how Trump's rhetoric had emboldened anti-LGBTQ+ actors. For example, support for the Ghana's harsh Family Values bill has grown.

Trump reduced refugee admissions by 94%, leaving tens of thousands of LGBTQ+ people in limbo in places like Kenya and South Sudan.

The State Department's annual human rights report, published in August, had sections on LGBTQ+ rights reduced or removed, as well as on discrimination based on gender or race.

In November, a senior State Department official said U.S. officials would record DEI policies and gender-affirming care for minors in other countries as human rights infringements.

Pride organisers across Europe also lost corporate sponsorships in countries like Greece, Bulgaria, Denmark, Britain and Estonia due to the ""Trump effect.""

Roul held a news conference on Tuesday, marking one year into President Donald Trump's second term in office.

Over the past 365 days, Illinois has filed more than 50 lawsuits.

The attorney general said the state is locked in a series of legal battles with the Trump administration challenging everything from federal funding freezes to ""aggressive and unconstitutional"" immigration enforcement tactics.

Raoul said his office has been trying to combat what they deem unlawful actions in Trump's first year of his second term.

SEE ALSO | 1 year into Trump's 2nd term, here are some of the seismic shifts in foreign and domestic policies

This includes Customs and Border Patrol tactics and National Guard deployment.

President Trump has signed many executive orders the past year aimed at reducing federal bureaucracy, expanding immigration enforcement that's lowered illegal border crossings, and signed major tax legislation, which proponents argue, has lowered taxes for many Americans.

Raoul spoke about the strain the legal battles are putting on his staff.

""Just one day after the inauguration, together with my fellow attorneys general, we filed our first lawsuit during the administration to protect birthright citizenship,"" he said. ""As a proud son of Haitian immigrants born at the time that my mother was not yet naturalized, I am a birthright citizen. So, our first action could not have been more personal for me. As a survivor of the cancer that took my father and both my grandfathers, protecting funding for cancer research could not be more personal for me.""

Raoul said the AG's office has fought to protect voter registration requirements, public health programs, like infectious disease labs, birthright citizenship from being terminated, and funding for critical medical care.

In total, the AG's office says it's protected over $6.6 billion dollars in state funding.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18437855_kwame-trump-split-ap-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-20 19:58:32.590155

“The Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles received a request for confidential, undercover Maine license plates from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These requests in light of rumors of ICE deployment to Maine and abuses of power in Minnesota and elsewhere raise concerns,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said in a statement.

“We have not revoked existing plates but have paused issuance of new plates. We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,” she added.

Maine is a sanctuary state, meaning it limits local authorities’ compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) has strongly encouraged residents to stay vigilant amid the surge in immigration enforcement activity launched by the Trump administration.

“To the federal government I say this: If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused — those tactics are not welcome here,” Mills said in a video statement last week.

“To the people of Maine: I know you care deeply about protecting your neighbors, as do I. And I know that many of you are angry about the potential for any enhanced federal law enforcement presence in Maine. I feel that too,” she added.

The Democratic governor encouraged residents to meet hostility with “reserve and resolve.”

Her push for safety comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers are expected to arrive in Portland, Maine, and Lewiston, Maine, in the coming days. Mills words follow the death of Minnesota mother Renee Good, who was killed by an ICE officer. Agents told her to step out of the vehicle, but she instead tried to drive away, and an officer fired shots into the car.

5 p.m.: Kennedy Park soccer games suspended amid ICE worries

A group that coordinates pickup soccer games in Portland’s Kennedy Park has indefinitely paused operations as concerns of heightened immigration enforcement have its members on edge.

Anthony Fiori, a leader from the Kennedy Park Pickup Soccer group, said organizers canceled a game planned for last week amid rumors of upcoming U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

Fiori said he worried ICE could target the games and members who participate, noting that several of players have already been detained.

He did not know when the games might be able to resume. The group last hosted games earlier in January.

“We’re pretty nervous about the players, of course. And the players themselves are just very scared,” Fiori said on a Friday phone call. “We just really have no clue. We kind of feel like we’re working in the dark here.”

In the meantime, team members are coordinating with each other to collect details, like names and immigration statuses, of players who may be at risk, he said.

“We learned a lot of lessons from when Joel Andre got detained,” Fiori said. “If someone goes missing … we can at least search the ICE database to see if they’ve been detained and see where they are.”

“I know, given the national news, this may cause anxiety, fear or uncertainty for some in our community,” Sheline said in a written statement. “In moments like this, what matters most is how we show up for one another and that we remember who we are and what we stand for as Mainers: the rule of law, the right to peacefully protest, and compassion for our neighbors.”

Sheline asked that residents remain calm and peaceful and rely only on verified information. He also cautioned residents to check in on their neighbors and know their constitutional rights, and said anyone encountering ICE agents should remain calm.

“Lewiston is a city shaped by people from many places and many stories,” Sheline said. “Our differences are not a fault line. They are the strong foundation of who we are. Every person deserves to feel safe, respected, and treated with dignity.”

2:30 p.m.: Biddeford mayor calls rumors ‘deeply unsettling’

Biddeford Mayor Liam LaFountain called rumors of potentially increased immigration enforcement “deeply unsettling” in a statement.

LaFountain said Friday that Biddeford officials had not received confirmation of increased ICE activity but have reached out to the state government for clarity.

“Since learning of these reports, public safety has remained the City’s top priority,” LaFountain wrote.

As a matter of long-standing policy, LaFountain said, the Biddeford Police Department does not enforce federal immigration law or participate in civil immigration enforcement.

1:30 p.m.: Absences higher than normal at South Portland schools

There were an “unusually higher” number of absences Tuesday at South Portland schools as rumors of immigration enforcement spread, Superintendent George Entwistle said.

While no immigration enforcement officers have shown up on or near South Portland school grounds to his knowledge, staff and students have been on edge, he said.

The district, in partnership with the University Maine Law School’s Refugee and Human Rights Clinic, will host two training sessions related to immigration issues in the coming weeks. Those have been in the works for months, Entwistle said, but they take on new urgency in the current moment.

The first is an in-person training on Jan. 28 for all school clerks, presenting practical responses and discussion about immigration enforcement to the front-line personnel should immigration enforcement officers present themselves at schools. The second training, scheduled for Feb. 24, is virtually available to all staff members, and it will discuss current issues in immigration and schools.

“Things are very upsetting,” Entwistle said. “These trainings are a good way to feel like they can manage anything they have to manage to protect our students.”

Entwistle said his district is considering additional training for specific people, such as social workers, school psychologists and coaches.

1:15 p.m.: Penobscot Nation chief urges tribal members to carry tribal ID

Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis on Tuesday issued a statement on Facebook urging members to carry identification cards issued by the tribe.

Francis said he was not aware of any ICE activity on Penobscot lands or any interactions between agents and tribal members. However, he said, members of federally recognized tribes in other states have been arrested by ICE, and tribal identification has not always proved to be sufficient proof of citizenship.

“We know that many of you have heard reports of ICE interactions involving individuals who are, by law and by birthright, citizens of Tribal Nations,” Francis wrote. “News and social media reports indicate that ICE has detained several Native Americans throughout the country and have conducted raids on facilities located on Tribal lands. The Tribal government has verified that some of these reports are true, and some are false.”

Francis said ICE agents are inadequately trained on the use of tribal identification and documentation to prove citizenship, but that a former tribal chairman who advises U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is working to resolve the issue.

According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, tribal documents can fall into the same category as a U.S. Citizen I.D card.

Francis encouraged tribal citizens to review guidelines issued by the Native American Rights Fund in the event a tribal member is approached by ICE.

“Our Penobscot Nation has endured many challenges throughout our history, and we continue to stand strong together,” he wrote. “The Tribal Council remains committed to protecting the rights, safety, and sovereignty of our people. We will continue to monitor ICE activities and keep you informed.”

1 p.m.: South Portland schools’ plans if ICE arrives

South Portland schools’ policy directs staff members to keep students away from immigration officers and to direct agents towards the main office should they enter private property, according to a copy of the policy obtained by a public records request.

Should immigration officers appear on or near South Portland school grounds, staff members are instructed to stay calm, direct the officer to the front office and not answer any questions about students or families’ status, according to the school department’s policy.

Front office clerks should contact the principal while asking the officer to remain in the main office. The principal should then contact the superintendent’s office to review legal documents and warrants.

The policy also reminds staff that administrative immigration warrants authorizing federal officers to arrest someone for an immigration violation do not function as judicial warrants, allowing officers to access and search nonpublic spaces. The school department’s plan instructs front line staff to collect these documents and contact their principal, who would then contact the superintendent’s office for legal review.

Staff members are instructed to not physically interfere with officers should they try to move into nonpublic spaces. They should instead protect students by keeping them in the classroom when instructed, calling the principal and moving students away from officers.

If there are officers visibly near school grounds or at bus stops, administrators may opt to increase adult presence at arrival and dismissal.

The department may host information sessions for families about “rights, preparedness and available support” in partnership with legal and community organizations, according to the plan. Offerings would include a virtual option and translated materials as needed to support vulnerable members of the community.

Social workers, counselors, clerks will receive training from legal partners about what they can do or discuss and when to connect a family to an attorney.

12:45 p.m.: 2 Portland schools briefly go on ‘lockout’ amid report of nearby ICE arrest

Portland Public Schools administrators initiated a brief lockout at two campuses — Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School, both on Stevens Avenue — shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday morning after learning about potential immigration enforcement activity on nearby Brighton Avenue, district spokesperson Tess Nacelewicz said.

The lockouts involved closing external doors to people entering or leaving the schools, Nacelewicz said, but administrators determined there was no threat to the schools, and the lockouts were lifted within minutes.

“This is an understandably tense time in our community, as reports and rumors of immigration enforcement actions grow,” Nacelewicz said. “The Portland Public Schools will continue to follow our protocols for keeping students and staff safe, while also staying focused on our core work of teaching and learning.”

A video of ICE agents at a Cumberland Farms gas station on Brighton, less than half a mile from the high school, was widely circulated on social media Tuesday morning.

Nacelewicz did not respond immediately to questions about how the district was notified about the possible enforcement activity.

Subpoenas target Minnesota leaders opposing Trump's immigration enforcement

Federal agents' actions in Minneapolis have sparked protests

Minnesota Democrats call investigation politically motivated

Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice served grand jury subpoenas to the offices of Minnesota's governor and attorney general, and the mayor of Minneapolis, as it weighs whether their public opposition to President Donald Trump's surge in immigration enforcement amounts to a crime.

One of the subpoenas, shared by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, orders his office's custodian of records to produce documents since the beginning of 2025 related to ""cooperation or lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities."" Six offices were served with subpoenas, according to a Justice Department official, including those of Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison.

Trump, a Republican, has sent thousands of immigration agents into the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in a highly visible, sometimes violent surge that has little modern precedent. The agents have carried guns through the city's snowy streets, dressed in military-style camouflage gear and masks, drawing loud protests from residents. Trump administration officials have blamed Walz and Frey for the protests, accusations they deny.

The hostility by many residents has only deepened after one agent fatally shot an American woman, Renee Good, in her car nearly two weeks ago. Federal agents have used tear gas and other chemical irritants on protesters, and have drawn outrage for questioning or arresting Black, Latino or Asian U.S. citizens, including a man who was wrongly arrested and pulled out of his home on Sunday dressed in underpants and sandals.

The subpoenas arrived a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating Walz, Frey and other Democrats and outspoken critics of Trump.

DEMOCRATS HAVE CALLED FOR CALM

Democratic politicians in Minnesota have called for calm, but have also been sharply critical of what they see as a politically motivated crackdown by Trump, and have sued his administration, asking a judge last week to order an end to what they call the unconstitutional excesses of his enforcement surge.

Walz called the federal investigation ""a partisan distraction"" that ""does not seek justice.""

""Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace rather than with baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,"" his statement said.

Frey said in a statement that the federal government was trying ""to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs"" and that ""every American should be concerned."" ""We shouldn't live in a country where federal law enforcement is used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with,"" he said.

WASHINGTON – On November 5, 2024, the American people gave President Donald Trump a clear mandate to secure our borders, end illegal immigration, take criminal aliens off our streets, protect the American taxpayer, and Make America Safe Again. Since taking office on January 20, 2025, President Trump has delivered on this mandate from the American people in historic fashion thanks to the hardworking men and women the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Under the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s leadership this past year, DHS has been hard at work restoring the rule of law, delivering the most secure border ever, removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens, creating safer communities, strengthening cyber defense, fixing disaster response, launching initiatives that are reshaping American travel and national security, and making America safe for generations to come.

DHS has set the stage to break even more records and make even more history in President Trump’s second year.

“In President Trump’s first year back in office, nearly 3 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, including an estimated 2.2 million self-deportations and more than 675,000 deportations.”

“In the last year, fentanyl trafficking at the southern border has also been cut by more than half compared to the same period in 2024,” said Secretary Kristi Noem. “The U.S. Coast Guard alone seized enough cocaine to kill more than 177 million Americans.”

“Meanwhile, we have saved taxpayers more than $13.2 billion here at DHS. Countless lives have been saved, communities have been strengthened, and the American people have been put first again.”

Securing the Border to Historic Levels

President Trump ran on securing the border and fixing the border crisis that took place under his predecessor Joe Biden. In his first year in his office, President Trump delivered the most secure border in U.S. history.

Since May, the United States Border Patrol has released zero illegal aliens into the country. Apprehensions at the southern border have reached historic lows.

In fact, total U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) apprehensions along the southwest border in the first year of the current administration (90,084) were less than the average month during the Biden administration (155,485). USBP apprehensions over the last 12 months were the lowest ever recorded in CBP history (i.e., both Jan. 20-Jan.20 and Jan-Dec.)

In President Trump’s first year, USBP recorded 95% fewer encounters per day along the southwest border than during the Biden administration, with daily average encounters along the southwest border 1,936% higher during the Biden administration than during the first year of the current administration.

Currently, USBP’s daily average southwest border encounters under the current administration to date are 251. Meanwhile, USBP’s daily average southwest border encounters under the Biden administration were 5,110.

USBP nationwide apprehensions have averaged under 9,000 per month since President Trump took office – a level of sustained deterrence unmatched in modern border history. USBP had never previously recorded a single month below 10,000 nationwide apprehensions dating back to 1992.

In January 2026, the border received additional reinforcement when CBP commenced installation of the first waterborne barriers funded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the Rio Grande Valley Sector.

During the first year of the current administration, CBP also implemented 42 Presidential Actions on trade, addressing illicit drugs, public safety threats, and critical imports.

Through the end of December, CBP collected $297 billion from all tariffs, taxes, and fees (total customs revenue).

CBP will continue to play a central role in executing the President’s tariff policy as trade enforcement and revenue collection authorities and will continue working closely with DHS and other partner agencies to deliver a world-class, seamless, and secure experience for all travelers and participants at the FIFA World Cup 2026. These efforts will include implementing robust security measures while ensuring efficient facilitation, utilizing advanced technologies, strengthening strategic partnerships, and executing extensive operational planning across all U.S. host cities and key ports of entry.

The border wall will also be receiving reinforcement in 2026, with CBP moving quickly to obligate funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July 2025, with over $11 billion of the $46.5 billion in funds obligated to date, for border wall construction.

In 2026, CBP will continue to deliver the most secure border ever and continue to support ICE operations by arresting and removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our nation’s interior.

Ending the Scourge of Illegal Immigration

President Donald Trump promised to end the scourge of illegal immigration and deport illegal aliens.

Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, DHS has arrested and deported hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens across the country, including gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers, thanks to the brave men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), CBP, and other law enforcement immigration enforcement agencies. Seventy percent of those arrested by ICE are criminal illegal aliens who have been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S.

Nearly 3 million illegal aliens are out of the country, as DHS has removed more than 675,000 illegal aliens and estimated 2.2 million illegal aliens have self-deported.

ICE and CBP have conducted operations in cities nationwide, resulting in hundreds of thousands of arrests.

In late December, for example, ICE announced the successful conclusion of Operation Angel’s Honor, a 14-day operation named in honor of Laken Riley, during which the agency arrested more than 1,030 criminal illegal aliens under the authority of the Laken Riley Act — a law signed by President Trump in 2025 that mandates that any illegal alien who has been accused of a violent crime such as theft, burglary, assaulting a law enforcement officer, or any crime that causes death or serious bodily injury must be placed under arrest.

Seventy percent of those arrested by ICE are convicted criminals or have criminal charges. During President Trump’s first year, ICE arrested 43,305 potential national security risks. ICE has arrested 1,416 known or suspected terrorists (KSTs) and has removed 1,392 KSTs, and more than 7,000 gang arrests.

Now, in 2026, ICE has the ground running with 120% more officers and agents after hiring 12,000 Americans to help President Trump deliver on his signature promise.

In 2025, DHS paved the way for state and local law enforcement to arrests criminal illegal aliens off our streets in President Trump’s second year.

In President Trump’s first year, DHS secured more than 1,255 signed agreements with state and local partnerships under Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g).

Thanks to the 287(g) program, DHS partnered with the State of Florida on Alligator Alcatraz, the State of Indiana on the Speedway Slammer, the state of Nebraska on Cornhusker Clink, and the State of Louisiana on Louisiana Lockup to expand detention space by the thousands.

This tremendous enforcement of the law has resulted in safer cities, plummeting fentanyl overdoses, cheaper rents, higher wages, and a better quality of life for millions of Americans.

Finding 132,000 Children Biden’s Lost

Under President Trump, DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services have located 132,720 unaccompanied children that the Biden administration lost. Too many of these children were exploited and abused before, during, and after being trafficked over our borders. All told, the Biden administration lost more than 450,000 children because of its open border policies. We will continue to ramp up efforts and will not stop until every last child is found

Putting the U.S. Citizen First in America’s Immigration System

United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is restoring integrity to our nation’s immigration policies and has instituted dynamic changes to ensure that only individuals who love America, align with our culture, and share our values, are welcomed into the country. Most importantly, Secretary Noem and President Trump are making sure that any form of legal immigration will benefit the U.S. citizen and does not pose harm to our well-bring and way of life.

In President Trump’s first year, USCIS made history with its fraud investigation, Operation Twin Shield, the agency’s largest enforcement operation to date. Launched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, USCIS focused on more than 1,000 cases that had fraud or ineligibility indicators, attempted over 2,000 site visits to homes and workplaces, and completed nearly 1,500 in-person interviews with aliens during the operation. USCIS found evidence of fraud, non-compliance with immigration law, or public safety or national security concerns in more than 500 of cases.

In year two, USCIS is implementing the Department of Homeland Security’s new rule to prioritize the allocation of H-1B visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, which will better American protect wages, working conditions, and job opportunities for American workers.

Last week, USCIS announced a new rule that reduces wait times for thousands of religious organizations and their communities—including priests, nuns, and rabbis—who previously were required to remain outside the United States before returning to resume their essential services. This rule protects and preserves freedom and expression of religion while easing burdens on those who shape the social and moral fabric of the country.

Under an updated policy confirming USCIS’ role as an immigration enforcement agency, agency officers are once again empowered to enforce immigration law by issuing Notices to Appear. So far, they have done so in historic numbers. Since January 20, USCIS officers have issued approximately 196,600 Notices to Appear to place aliens in removal proceedings.

USCIS has begun recruiting Homeland Defenders, who will better support the agency’s mission and bolster efforts to combat fraud and other threats.

Since launching the hiring campaign on September 30, USCIS has received more than 50,000 applications — the highest in agency history. The first Homeland Defenders began reporting for duty in early December 2025.

Within hours of the November 26 attack where an Afghan national murdered one National Guard member and severely wounded another, Secretary Noem directed USCIS to put asylum processing on hold for aliens from every country, implemented a full-scale reexamination of every green card for aliens from every presidentially designated high-risk country, and placed a hold on the processing of immigration applications and petitions for all Afghan nationals and aliens from those countries of concern.

USCIS is advancing the administration’s and Secretary Noem’s goal of ending the abuse and exploitation in certain immigration programs. This includes stopping broad abuse of humanitarian parole authority and terminating the family reunification and the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole programs and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan, Syria, Somalia, and Venezuela.

Revitalizing the Coast Guard for the 21st Century

President Trump’s plan was simple when he became President of the United States. He wanted to revitalize the Coast Guard, equip it with the best technology, ships, and aircraft available, and then recruit the men and women that were necessary to run it all.

Secretary Noem put his plan into action, and now the Coast Guard is better positioned today than at any point in history to control, secure, and defend the U.S. southern border and maritime approaches; facilitate the uninterrupted flow of commerce; and rapidly respond to national and global contingencies.

In President Trump’s first year, the Coast Guard stopped drugs before they reached our shores, kept illegal aliens out of the country, rescued Americans, made the economy work, and saw a recruitment surge:

Record-Setting Counter-Drug Operations:

Since January 20th, 2025, the U.S. Coast Guard seized nearly 470,000 pounds of cocaine — enough to kill up to 177 million Americans at a 1.2g lethal dose.

Controlling, Securing, and Defending U.S. Borders and Maritime Approaches:

Coast Guard operations such as Operation Border Trident and Operation River Wall increased interdictions of illegal aliens by 44% in key regions and secured over 100,000 miles of U.S. border. Advanced unmanned systems and intelligence-driven patrols have strengthened America’s maritime domain dominance.

Facilitating Commerce and Rapid Crisis Response:

The Coast Guard enabled the safe movement of 1.8 billion tons of cargo, an increase of 13% from the previous year, supporting an economic engine projected to move $5.4 trillion in goods in 2026.

Coast Guard crews also saved nearly 5,000 lives and protected nearly $1 billion in property through thousands of search and rescue missions and rapid responses to major contingencies.

Transforming Workforce Readiness and Recruitment:

Force Design 2028 drove record-setting recruitment, exceeding 110% of active-duty enlisted goals and accessing over 5,200 new members, the highest since 1991.

The Coast Guard is on track to expand the force by 15,000 members, ensuring a healthier, more resilient, and mission-ready workforce to meet evolving demands.

Accelerating Modernization and Future Capabilities:

Looking ahead to 2026, the Coast Guard will implement major structural reforms, including the establishment of a Deployable Specialized Forces Command, expansion of training capacity, and rapid acquisition of next-generation assets.

Investments from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will further accelerate capability delivery, ensuring the Coast Guard remains the world’s most agile, capable, and responsive maritime fighting force.

These historic accomplishments are further illustrated in the Force Design 2028 Initial Update, which the Coast Guard released on January 15.

The report details the reforms the service has implemented under President Trump and Secretary Noem’s leadership, and it highlights the significant, measurable impacts these changes have delivered for the American people—including the historic 6-to-1 return on investment these efforts provided to the taxpayer.

Improved Federal Law Enforcement Training

Thanks to President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill and Secretary Noem’s vision, the American people provided Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) with $750 million in taxpayer funding, more than doubling its annual resources, to enhance the training and readiness of U.S. Border Patrol, CBP, and ICE personnel.

As a result, FLETC provided federal law enforcement with the skills, leadership, and training necessary to tackle the threats of tomorrow and to keep the peace.

President Trump’s first year in office saw FLETC focus on:

Expanding nationwide law enforcement collaboration by facilitating ICE’s 287(g) Training Program.

To date, approximately 18,500 officers across 50 states and five territories have registered and over 12,500 have completed the training, strengthening partnerships between federal and local law enforcement agencies.

Training over 73,000 law enforcement personnel, the second highest number in FLETC’s 55-year history.

That includes thousands of personnel from state, local, tribal, territorial, and campus law enforcement personnel from 51 states and five territories.

FLETC achieved record-breaking training—the highest attendance levels since 2007—by supporting over 1,000 USBP trainees daily at FLETC in Artesia, New Mexico, and demonstrating a commitment to scaling operations to meet growing security demands.

Producing America’s frontline during the 43-day lapse in appropriations – the longest in United States history – sustaining the safety and security of the nation at a time when uninterrupted law enforcement capability was essential.

Enhancing maritime training by developing and piloting the U.S. Coast Guard Opposing Force Vessel Program.

Now, FLETC projects to train approximately 90,000 law enforcement personnel over the course of President Trump’s second year in office, fulfilling the operational requirements and expectations of our training partners within DHS and across other federal agencies.

Ushering in the Golden Age of Travel

The Transportation Security Administration is ushering in the Golden Age of Travel and will continue to thrive in President Trump’s second year.

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem:

TSA ended the Obama-era “Quiet Skies” program, which was used to spy on Americans, including Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, as well as members of Congress.

TSA launched the “Shoes On” Campaign, allowing travelers to keep their shoes on while passing through security screening at TSA checkpoints.

TSA successfully implemented REAL ID on May 7 and achieved 94% compliance, which continues to steadily increase.

TSA launched two targeted campaigns including the “Serve with Honor, Travel with Ease” campaign and the “Families on the Fly” campaign, and the first-ever TSA PreCheck® Buy One, Get One.

TSA screened a record 3.1 million individuals screened on November 30.

8 of TSA’s 10 highest screening days were in 2025.

2.5 billion checked and carry-on bags screened in President Trump’s first year.

Fixing Federal Disaster Response

For decades, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was bloated by waste, fraud, and abuse. Now, under President Trump and Secretary Noem, FEMA is being transformed, empowering disaster response that is federally supported, state led, and locally executed:

At Secretary Noem’s direction, FEMA has conducted a critical evaluation of all grant programs and recipients to root out waste, fraud, and abuse and deliver accountability for the American taxpayer.

As a result, FEMA has achieved:

Radical Transparency and Contract Management FEMA’s rigorous contract reviews led to the termination of 118 contracts, generating $31.2 million in savings and $82 million in total cost avoidance, ensuring mission alignment and cost-effectiveness.

Historic Recovery of Excess Funds FEMA recovered $8 billion in excess funds—the largest in agency history—rechanneling resources into high-priority operations and setting a new standard for fiscal responsibility.

Fraud Prevention and Investigations FEMA conducted 2,092 fraud investigations, safeguarding up to $1.2 billion from external fraud and identifying 27 internal cases totaling $250,000, protecting taxpayer resources and disaster assistance funds.

Accelerated State-Led Recovery Funding FEMA expedited 106 Public Assistance projects across 9 states, delivering $762 million in upfront funding—empowering states to lead and streamline their own recovery.

Record Disaster Assistance to Communities and Individuals FEMA approved nearly $2.2 billion in Individual Assistance to households and obligated $15.3 billion in Public Assistance for communities and critical infrastructure, ensuring resources reach those most in need.

Modernized Survivor Assistance Tools FEMA improved the disaster assistance process by launching new digital tools—including an application status tracker, clearer help text, guided videos, simplified letters, and expanded payment options. The digitized payment system accelerated delivery of assistance from 2–3 weeks to 1–2 days.

In President Trump’s second year, FEMA will empower states to lead disaster response and recovery while ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars. Continued improvement will strengthen local resilience when natural disasters strike, and deliver efficient, accountable support to communities across the nation to protect the American people when its needed most.

Bringing Back “The Best of the Best” to the Secret Service

President Trump and Secretary Noem made it a priority to restore the American people’s confidence in the Secret Service by demanding excellence from the Secret Service, recruiting the best of the best, and giving them the training necessary to carry out their mission.

As a result of that focus, which led to a roughly 46% increase in applications compared to the year before. From January 20 to December 18, 2025, the U.S. Secret Service received 91,273 applications, versus 62,160 applications during the same period in 2024.

Likewise, the U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center delivered the highest number of trainings and briefings in the agency’s history - more than 364 trainings and briefings to more than 56,713 participants. NTAC training recipients included law enforcement agencies, schools, mental health providers, faith-based organizations, government agencies, and private sector entities.

Time and time again, the Secret Service made sure our nation’s biggest sports and cultural events were safe and secure.

In President Trump’s first year in office, the Secret Service:

Successfully developed and executed the security plan for four National Special Security Events:

The 2025 Inauguration of President Trump, President Trump’s Address to a Joint Session of Congress, the 2025 UN General Assembly (UNGA, 80th Session), and the Army’s 250th Birthday Celebration.

Provided Presidential protection during multiple major events, including:

Super Bowl LIX (New Orleans, LA), Daytona 500 (Daytona Beach, FL), Charlie Kirk’s Funeral (Glendale, AZ), Ryder Cup (Farmingdale, NY), Washington Commanders Game (Salute to Service) (Landover, MD), and the 126th Army-Navy Game (Baltimore, MD).

Completed 22 anti-card skimming and electronic benefits transfer fraud outreach operations in various locations around the United States. These outreach operations prevented an estimated $428 million in fraud loss.

In President Trump’s second year, the U.S. Secret Service will expand its electronic benefits transfer fraud outreach operations around the country, beginning with a 10-day, five city operation this winter.

The Service will continue to aggressively recruit and hire the best of the best in order to meet our goal of hiring 4,000 new employees by 2028, for a total of 6,800 law enforcement personnel and 10,000 total employees on board by the end of President Trump’s first year.

And it will design and execute security plans for multiple National Special Security events:

2025 State of the Union, UN General Assembly, G20 Summit, and support security efforts for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Restoring American Air Superiority

On January 12, DHS announced the launch of a new office dedicated to rapidly procuring and deploying drone and counter-drone technologies, marking a major step forward in restoring American airspace sovereignty – a top priority for the Trump administration.

Drones are transforming industries nationwide, but they are also increasingly exploited by malicious actors. The new DHS Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems will oversee strategic investments in drone and counter-drone technologies that can outpace evolving threats and tactics.

The Program Executive Office has already begun its work and will soon finalize a $115 million investment in counter-drone technologies that will be critical in securing America250 and 2026 FIFA World Cup venues, underscoring the historic responsibility of protecting events that commemorate 250 years of American independence and welcome the world for the largest World Cup in history.

President Trump has championed the protection of the country from drone threats, initially signing the law in 2018 that gave DHS Components the authority to detect and mitigate drones. Since then, the Department has conducted over 1,500 missions to protect the United States from illicit drone activities.

The new Program Executive Office will be taking the threat of hostile drones head-on and innovating ways drones can keep us safe from other threats on the ground, equipping the Department with the technology and expertise we need to keep us Americans safe.

Restoring Cyber Security

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, CISA returned back to its mission and remains steadfast in safeguarding the systems Americans rely on every day in the first year.

In year two, as our nation commemorates America’s 250th anniversary and global communities come together for the FIFA World Cup, CISA has released a new guide to empower stadium and arena owners to fortify operations, mitigate vulnerabilities, and elevate emergency preparedness.

The agency also issued three guides to help venue owners and law enforcement safeguard against risks from drones near their events and continues to support pre-World Cup 2026 exercises in host cities around the country.

Already in 2026, CISA started off the new year by retiring ten Emergency Directives, marking a significant milestone in federal cybersecurity. This is the highest number of Emergency Directives retired, after CISA determined that required actions have been successfully implemented or are now encompassed elsewhere.

CISA has co-sealed 38 joint cybersecurity advisories that continually demonstrate operational collaboration in action. By sharing timely, actionable threat intelligence and driving resilience, we help ensure our collective security.

Protecting Americans from Weapons of Mass Destruction

In its first year under President Trump and Secretary Noem, DHS’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office protected Americans throughout the country from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.

CWMD conducted a total of 1,020 operations, engagements, trainings, and exercises across 48 states and territories, including operations to protect high-profile events, including the Super Bowl, Mardi Gras, and the Club World Cup.

In the coming year, CWMD will deploy to protect the FIFA World Cup across eleven host cities, the largest deployment in CWMD history, as well as other major events like America 250.

Maximizing Intelligence & Analytics to Keep Americans Safe

President Trump and Secretary Noem are using DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis like never before to coordinate a robust defense of the Homeland.

In 2025, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) nominated over 4,600 people to the terrorist watchlist in 2025, working with DHS components, federal partners, and state and local law enforcement to ensure the Worst of the Worst are removed from America’s communities.

Last year, following encounters with CBP at various ports of entry, I&A successfully discovered derogatory information on 80 percent of the devices encountered from persons of interest seeking entry into the U.S.

This includes Rasha Alawieh, the Lebanese doctor and assistant professor at Brown University who attended Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s funeral.

I&A discovered that Alawieh had numerous contacts with known or suspected terrorists, affirming CBP’s decision to deny entry and the State Department’s decision to revoke her visa.

In coordination with fusion center partners, I&A identified and watchlisted Rawy Javier Mogolon Morillo—one of the first known members of the gang Tren de Aragua in Orange County, California.

As a result, the Homeland Security Task Force arrested this cartel associate on September 15, 2025.

Increasing Transparency, Direct Communication to the Public

President Trump and Secretary Noem understand have worked to provide historic levels of transparency and open communication to the American people U.S. citizens.

To that extent, DHS’s Office of Public Affairs delivered timely, accurate, and accessible information to the American through traditional media and social media.

In President Trump’s first year, OPA sent nearly 650 press releases and released more than 2,550 press statements to thousands of press inquiries.

OPA also harnessed the power of social media to speak directly to the American people without legacy media’s bias and fake news getting in the way.

On X alone, @DHSGov made a whopping 1.9 billion impressions in President Trump’s first term. @Sec_Noearm earned more than half a billion with 527.4 million. On Facebook and Instagram, Secretary Noem’s official account had more than 83 million views combined. DHS’ official Facebook and Instagram account had 716.8 million views combined

In President Trump’s first year, DHS also launched the critically acclaimed, groundbreaking new web page, “Worst of the Worst” (wow.dhs.gov), which allows visitors to search through some of the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens arrested during enforcement operations since the start of the Trump administration.

The Best Is Yet to Come

These accomplishments helped usher in a historic first year in President Trump’s return to office. The work, however, is just getting started. Under Secretary Noem’s guidance, vision, and leadership, DHS will continue to deliver monumental victories to the American people.

Due to ongoing litigation, the citizenship executive order remains blocked from going into effect nationwide.
Despite the litigation, however, USCIS has issued an implementation plan to take effect if the executive order is allowed to move forward.","On his first day back in office, President Trump signed dozens of executive orders on Inauguration Day in 2025, many of them related to immigration.

What followed was an unprecedented year for newcomers and the Americans that support them. Lawful pathways were shuttered, critical assistance was ended, and protections were revoked. Many of these actions were framed as temporary reviews or suspensions. However, they went far beyond good-faith reviews—solidifying over the months as lasting steps to dismantle vital systems that protect and support refugees and others in the United States and around the world.

Refugee Resettlement

Most refugees remain blocked from seeking safety in the United States.

Executive Order 14163 called for “realigning the U.S. refugee admissions program (USRAP),” the system that interviews, resettles, admits, and supports refugees in the United States. This executive order included a suspension of arrivals, beginning on January 27, 2025, and called for reviews every 90 days on whether to lift the suspension on arrivals.

Refugee arrivals were suspended within 48 hours of the executive order. Families that were weeks or even days away from resettlement had their flights to the United States abruptly cancelled.

A year later, this program-wide suspension remains largely in place, with only a few dozen previously approved refugees arriving under ongoing litigation in Washington State. The Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for this fiscal year capped annual refugee admissions at 7,500—their lowest in the program’s history, down from 125,000 in the prior fiscal year—and reserved these slots primarily for Afrikaners from South Africa.

Actions framed as a temporary suspension have become a de facto shutdown of the refugee program for new arrivals, with minimal exceptions.

Travel Restrictions

Individuals from 39 countries are now fully or partially banned from coming to the United States, and many of those already here now face delays in getting green cards, work permits, and more.

Executive Order 14161 called for a comprehensive review of countries with insufficient vetting and screening of their nationals.

This review of vetting standards was supposed to take 90 days, inspiring fear among advocates and service providers that travel restrictions based on the review would begin in the spring. A travel ban went into effect in June, placing full or partial travel restrictions on the citizens of 19 countries.

The administration has recently expanded these sweeping travel restrictions. Under a December 2025 proclamation, an additional 20 countries are now included on full or partial travel bans. Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders were also newly barred from arriving. Additionally, processing for green cards and other requests has been suspended for individuals from these 39 countries—including those already living in the United States, regardless of when they entered.

Rather than careful individualized decisions on visas and other applications, these policies amount to blanket bans on entire populations.

Humanitarian Aid

The vast majority of humanitarian aid from the United States has been abruptly shuttered, endangering millions across the world.

All United States foreign aid was also subject to a 90-day review under Executive Order 14163. Like other actions, the EO went far beyond a mere review.

Vital humanitarian assistance funding and programs around the world were quickly halted. The world’s largest donor, the U.S. Agency for International Development, was largely dismantled, with its few remaining staff and operations folded into the State Department. Assistance to refugees already in the United States through the domestic Reception & Placement program was cut off.

While some of this programming came back online later in 2025, U.S. humanitarian assistance remains drastically reduced—to the detriment of millions in need.

Asylum

Seeking asylum remains restricted, and many people who had arrived safely in the U.S. are now at risk for removal.

Executive Order 14165 ended the ability of asylum seekers at the U.S. border to schedule an asylum interview with the CBP One App. The order directed federal agencies to facilitate “safe third country” agreements, which require individuals to pursue asylum claims in the first country they traveled through after leaving their homes.

Reports indicate that the administration is designating people for transfer to third countries in order to refuse to consider (or “pretermit”) their asylum applications—putting those seeking protection without a pathway to safety and at risk of detention or removal.

Parole and Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

The administration continues to narrow or eliminate legal pathways to safety, putting those who lawfully entered the U.S. at risk of detention and deportation.

Executive Order 14165 also called for the termination of the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) parole processes—which allowed nationals of those countries to seek temporary status and work authorization in the United States. Despite litigation up to the Supreme Court, the decision to end CHNV has moved forward, ending protection for an estimated 530,000 people.

Executive Order 14159 directed review of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations, work authorization, and parole. Since January 2025, the administration has taken steps to terminate or signal termination for 12 TPS designations, including Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Haiti, and Venezuela. Many of these decisions appear at odds with harmful conditions continuing in designated countries. Afghanistan’s designation, for example, has been terminated despite ongoing repression of Afghan allies and a state of gender apartheid for Afghan women and girls.

Additionally, the administration has made it harder for people to remain authorized to work to support themselves and their families. A policy change ended automatic work authorization extensions, and there are potential plans to pause work permits for asylum seekers—a move that could negatively impact many individuals seeking protection. Global Refuge continues to monitor these policy developments closely.

Citizenship

Litigation has blocked the end of birthright citizenship for now, but the government remains poised to implement the change.

Executive Order 14160 sought to prohibit all U.S. government departments and agencies from issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship for babies in certain circumstances, despite their having been born in the United States. Due to ongoing litigation, the citizenship executive order remains blocked from going into effect nationwide. Despite the litigation, however, USCIS has issued an implementation plan to take effect if the executive order is allowed to move forward.

On December 5, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of a case that will determine the constitutionality of this executive order. Oral arguments are expected for spring 2026, and the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling by summer 2026.

California’s recent Workplace Know Your Rights Act (analyzed here) appears to have been the start of a legislative trend: states enacting laws creating new immigration-related employer responsibilities. The California law focuses on employer preparation for and responses to onsite immigration enforcement actions (e.g., an “ICE raid”), while Illinois’ new law creates employer obligations regarding the employment authorization process.

Specifically, on December 12, 2025, Illinois amended its Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act by enacting Senate Bill 2339. The amendment took effect immediately and applies to both public and private employers statewide. Under the amendment, employers may not:

Impose stricter employment authorization or re-verification standards than those required under federal law

Take adverse employment actions (like suspension or termination) based solely on notifications from federal agencies not responsible for immigration enforcement notifications (like Social Security Administration “no-match” letters)

Take adverse employment actions based solely on notifications from outside vendors indicating discrepancies in employee identification documents

Required Notice

Employers must now notify any affected employee in writing within five business days of receipt of an agency or third-party notification of discrepancy. The notice must include at least:

An explanation that the federal agency or outside vendor has notified the employer that the identification documents presented by the employee do not appear to match

The time period the employee has to contest the disputed information, if such a period is required by federal law

Any action the employer is requiring the employee to take

Notice should be delivered in person and by hand; if personal notice is not feasible, it must be sent via both regular mail and email. The notice must also be provided to the employee’s “authorized representative,” if applicable. If the employee or their authorized representative requests the original notice, it must be provided.

Penalties

Civil penalties range from $100 to $1,000 per violation, with additional remedies in cases of job loss including reinstatement, back pay, and up to $10,000 in civil penalties. Repeat offenses can result in civil penalties of $1,000 to $5,000 per violation. No penalties will be imposed against an employer found to have acted in good faith after consulting with the Illinois Department of Labor or the Department of Homeland Security, or if an honest administrative mistake did not affect an employee’s pay or job status. Successful claimants may also receive attorneys’ fees and related expenses.

Relatedly, SB 2339 enhances enforcement by enabling labor unions and certain nonprofit organizations to initiate civil lawsuits as “interested parties.” Individual employees, job applicants, or their representatives may also file lawsuits directly in Illinois courts.

More States To Follow?

Massachusetts and Washington are currently considering, but have not yet enacted, comparable measures. Massachusetts Senate Bill 2665, modeled in part on Illinois’ Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act, would impose an obligation to notify employees of Form I-9 inspections and documentation discrepancies within 72 hours of an employer receiving related notice from a government agency.

Washington House Bill 2105 and identical Senate Bill 5852, collectively called the Immigrant Worker Protection Act, would require employers to notify employees when federal immigration agents are conducting inspections of employment authorization or related audits. Under the proposal, employers would have to alert workers about the results of the audit within 72 hours of receiving notice and could face penalties for noncompliance. The act was introduced by legislators on December 8, 2025, following the proposal of Washington Attorney General Nick Brown.

Mary Cavanagh(D-Redford Twp.), Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), and Jeremy Moss(D-Bloomfield) uplifted their legislation to protect the safety of Michiganders, immigrant and non-immigrant alike, from the dangerous immigration enforcement tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) that are endorsed by D.C. Republicans. As the Legislature has begun its 2026 work, the Senators reiterated how critical this legislation is to protect our communities.

Unethical, terrorizing immigration enforcement tactics have been increasing across the nation under the second Trump administration. Most alarmingly, the killing of Renee Nicole Good and continued violence by ICE agents in Minneapolis have exemplified the malicious nature of ICE operations and is only one of the latest on a growing list of incidents that have happened during ICE and CBP operations.

“As the proud daughter of a Mexican immigrant and chair of the Michigan Legislative Latino Caucus, I will always stand with Michigan’s vibrant immigrant communities that have long shaped the very fabric of our state and nation. Every resident in our state, no matter their citizenship status, deserves to be treated with dignity, respect, and basic human decency,” said Sen. Cavanagh. “The federal administration’s immigrant enforcement tactics are creating panic, not protection! ICE agents do not — and should never — have the authority to intimidate, kidnap, or bring harm to our communities. I’ll continue fighting to ensure everyone is afforded the fundamental right to safety and security in their neighborhoods, workplaces, and places of worship.”

“Everyone, regardless of immigration status, deserves to feel safe and welcome in their own homes, dropping their kids off at school, at courthouses, and getting help as a victim of a crime,” said Sen. Chang. “We must do better to protect the safety and rights of every Michigander. No one deserves to have their privacy rights violated or to be ripped away from their family because of out-of-control ICE and CBP tactics. More and more Americans and Michiganders are calling on leaders to put a stop to these actions as soon as possible and I will continue to make this commonsense legislation a top priority in 2026.”",https://senatedems.com/chang/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/MDS_250319-7818-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:58:39.914109

Spain is among few EU countries touting economic benefits of migration

Migrant irregular arrivals to Spain fell by 42% last year

Rights groups criticise Spain's deals with West Africa

MADRID, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Spain opposes a push by some European Union countries to control migration by opening camps for asylum-seekers outside the bloc, calling instead to focus on curbing irregular migration at the source, its interior minister said.

Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Reuters external processing centres, such as Italy’s plan to detain migrants in Albania, were ""no magic solution"" as they posed significant legal challenges and could strain relationships with third countries.

Meanwhile, Spain's strategy of working with transit nations before arrivals occur was proving effective, he said.

In contrast to many EU states tightening their immigration policies amid the rise of the far right, Spain's leftist government has been an outlier by treating migration as an economic asset, promoting legal immigration pathways, while simultaneously reducing irregular migration.

Irregular arrivals to Spain fell 42% last year - to around 36,000 compared to Italy’s little-changed 66,000.

""I believe that our figures and migration policy overall doubtlessly ... greatly strengthen Spain's role in defining migratory policy within the European Union,"" Grande-Marlaska said.

Denmark said last month that a majority of EU countries supported the processing of asylum requests ""in safe third countries"" to deter arrivals. The European Parliament is expected to restrict migration rules this year.

To bolster its strategy, Spain has increased its presence in West African nations Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia— deploying nearly 100 police officers and various surveillance assets.

Rights groups, however, have said Spain's and the EU's support to West African countries to prevent migrants from boarding precarious boats to Spain's Canary Islands has led to abuses, notably in Mauritania where Spanish police were allegedly present during abusive detention of migrants, according to Human Rights Watch.

Grande-Marlaska said Spain had ""not seen any illegal action or action against refugees' fundamental rights"" and said Spain was working on beefing up its teams in Mauritania and Senegal and delivering more drones and vehicles to local forces.

Migrant arrivals to the Canaries fell 62% last year from record-breaking 2024 levels, Spanish data shows.

An Oklahoma warehouse in southwest Oklahoma City may soon be converted into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing center, part of a larger federal plan to detain thousands of immigrants across the country.

ICE Targets 16 Cities Nationwide

Oklahoma City is reportedly one of 16 cities under consideration by ICE for processing and detention sites. The plan, first reported by The Washington Post, would convert warehouses into one large detention center and 16 smaller processing facilities to speed up deportations.

State Senator Raises Concerns About Lack of Transparency

State Senator Carri Hicks (D–Oklahoma City) says she recently learned about the plan and is alarmed by the lack of transparency at both the local and state levels.

“This is not a rumor. It is a developed plan and it’s being executed,” she said. “And there has been no transparency and no accountability either at the local level, municipal level or the state level. And I think that should concern every Oklahoman.”

Proposed Site Near Residential Neighborhood

A letter from the Department of Homeland Security to the city’s planning commission reportedly outlines plans to convert a more than 400,000 square foot warehouse at 2800 South Council into a 1,500-bed ICE processing center.

The site is less than two miles from Western Heights Public School, raising concerns among residents and lawmakers.

Community Impact: Fear and Safety Concerns

Senator Hicks says the proposed facility could create fear and anxiety among families in the nearby community.

“It brings a lot of fear to the students and to the families… because we’ve seen bold actions that are profiling folks based on their skin color.” She also warns that a processing center could strain local resources such as public safety.

What Would the Facility Include?

If approved, the building would be redesigned to include:

Detention Space

Offices

Restrooms

Cafeteria

Medical space

Visitor areas

Lawmaker Calls for Public Action

Senator Hicks has taken to TikTok and public forums to encourage citizens to speak out and contact lawmakers.

“We need to continue to put people over politics and tell Washington that this unilateral decision will not be tolerated in our community.”

The next closest peak was 20 deaths in 2020, when COVID-19 raced through tightly packed detention centers.
By comparison, ICE reported 26 deaths during all four years of former President Biden's term.
Flashback: Deaths similarly jumped during President George W. Bush's immigration crackdown in 2004, resulting in 32 deaths.
Detained people also have access access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.","At least 31 people died in ICE custody last year, a two-decade high, as President Trump's mass-detention surge strains a system already under fire for dangerous conditions.

Why it matters: Immigrants rights groups warn deaths will keep rising as the administration floods ICE with more cash — and that the agency's facilities may not be equipped to handle the influx of detained people.

The Trump administration's policy of limiting congressional oversight visits to ICE facilities has exacerbated those fears, fueling an impeachment push against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

By the numbers: The 2025 death toll nearly tripled from the 11 deaths in 2024, according to an Axios review of ICE news releases.

The next closest peak was 20 deaths in 2020, when COVID-19 raced through tightly packed detention centers.

By comparison, ICE reported 26 deaths during all four years of former President Biden's term.

Flashback: Deaths similarly jumped during President George W. Bush's immigration crackdown in 2004, resulting in 32 deaths.

The big picture: Outrage at ICE hit a new peak after an agent shot and killed a 37-year-old mother in Minneapolis earlier this month, intensifying alarm among lawmakers and protesters who were already demanding answers about deteriorating conditions inside detention centers.

""We've been warning about this for over a year, that conditions have been deteriorating, that deaths are climbing, and now we're seeing that,"" Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the Detention Watch Network tells Axios.

""We will likely see many more deaths if things continue as they have.""

Zoom in: Amnesty International reported in December that people held at one center described ""poor quality food, extreme temperatures, permanent lighting, and limited access to clean water.""

At another facility, the ACLU says people reported being denied insulin and disability accommodations, blocked from seeing lawyers and forced to use bathrooms with sewage bubbling up from drains.

What they're saying: A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told Axios that there was ""no spike in deaths"" in ICE custody in 2025, arguing the death rate per person has remained stable.

""Every detainee receives food, water, medical care, bedding and clean clothing. All detainees are receiving three meals a day that are certified by dietitians,"" they said.

DHS says it screens everyone for medical, dental and mental health needs within 12 hours of arrival, and conducts a full health assessment within two weeks. Detained people also have access access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.

What we're watching: Congress requires ICE to publish death reports within 90 days, but ICE has not published one since the end of September, according to an Axios review of agency press releases.

DHS did not answer Axios' questions about when it would update the tracker.

“Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop,” he said in a statement. “Re-opening the door to judiciary scrutiny of our State’s immigration policies, combined with the Trump Administration’s increasingly targeted actions against states and cities, is a recipe for disaster for our immigrant brothers and sisters and puts them in greater danger.”

Murphy said his administration found “a drafting oversight” on the Privacy Protection Act that “could create significant complications when it comes to advancing our shared goal of protecting New Jersey’s immigrant communities.”

“I deeply wish there was sufficient time left to correct this issue, but it is not possible due to the expiration of the legislative session,” he said in a statement. Murphy is leaving the Legislature with recommended amendments to the bill, hoping that the measures would be reintroduced in the new session.

Murphy did not veto the two bills outright. He declined to sign them into law, allowing them to expire because they were passed within the last 10 days of the legislative session, known as a “pocket veto.”

Immigrant advocates say they are disappointed

The New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice said in a statement Tuesday that Murphy “walked away from his promise to protect immigrant families across the state.”

“He does so amid an intensification of immigration enforcement and detention in New Jersey,” the group said.

There have been reports of ICE raids taking place in Atlantic City and Camden within the last month.

“At a moment that demanded courage, Gov. Murphy chose caution,” said Viri Martinez, deputy director of strategy at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice.

She added that “fear of the Trump administration” is the only way to describe why Murphy declined to sign the legislation.

“This decision reflects how Trump’s authoritarian playbook has seeped into our state, paralyzing decisive leadership and allowing fear, rather than values, to dictate who is protected and who is left behind,” Martinez said.

Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, said the pocket vetoes have left New Jersey “without critical protections at a moment when ICE is brutalizing our communities.”

“These bills were legally sound, politically viable, and commonsense policy,” he said, in a statement. “We call on Gov.-elect Sherrill, her administration and the Legislature to establish data privacy protections and ensure state and local resources are not commandeered for federal immigration enforcement.”

Murphy signs Safe Communities Act

The governor said the state was reaffirming “our longstanding commitment to ensuring the people of New Jersey — particularly our immigrant families — are safe, secure, and supported in navigating their daily lives easily and confidently.”

“Public spaces such as houses of worship, schools, hospitals, and courthouses are places of trust that should welcome and safeguard every member of society,” he said in a statement. “Whether you’re praying in a church, studying in school, receiving medical care at a hospital, or seeking legal relief, no one should live in fear or uncertainty or be deterred from seeking essential services due to their immigration status.”

The Safe Communities Act, which takes effect immediately, requires the attorney general to propose policies on how to interact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers when they visit sensitive locations such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.

The law also requires certain government departments and agencies to adopt the policies within 180 days of being issued. Policies must be equal to the attorney general’s model or provide greater protections.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gov-murphy-ap-2026-01-08.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:58:33.795449

Meanwhile, some states are looking at their options for protecting their Medicaid data.","In a win for President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a recent court ruling has cleared the way for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to resume using states’ Medicaid data to find people who are in the country illegally.

The case is ongoing. But for now, immigrants — including those who are in the country legally — will have to weigh the benefits of gaining health coverage against the risk that enrolling in Medicaid could make them or their family members easier for ICE to find.

Last summer, 22 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration to block information sharing between ICE and Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program that primarily covers people with low incomes. But at the end of December, a federal judge ruled that ICE can pull some basic Medicaid data to use in its deportation proceedings, including addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and citizenship or immigration status.

The court ruled that in the states that sued, ICE is not allowed to collect information about lawful permanent residents or citizens, nor records about sensitive health information. In the 28 states that didn’t sue, however, the court did not place any limits on the Medicaid information ICE can access.

The U.S. District Court in San Francisco essentially said that government agencies can share some data, including basic identifying information. “That kind of data sharing is clearly authorized by statute,” the decision states.

But the court also ruled that agencies can’t share more sensitive data without adequately explaining why they need it. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria wrote that ICE and federal Medicaid information-sharing policies were “totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process.” He said the states had shown they would “suffer irreparable harm from these vague and likely overbroad” policies.

Worried about surveillance, states enact privacy laws and restrict license plate readers

By law, federal Medicaid money cannot be used to cover people who are in the country illegally.

But in recent years, nearly half of states, including some led by Republicans, have chosen to use their own Medicaid money to extend coverage to certain groups of people, such as children and pregnant women, regardless of immigration status.

Advocates for immigrants and some state officials worry that ICE’s use of Medicaid data will cause widespread fear among immigrant families, keeping them from seeking the health care that states have said they’re eligible to receive. California’s health department recently called the administration’s actions “a grave breach of public trust.”

“States have constantly reassured people that their health care information won’t be used against them, and that’s changed,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization focused on immigrant rights.

Court filings in the lawsuit illustrate the potential impact of the ruling.

In Chicago, for example, a patient at an Esperanza Health Center delayed her first prenatal visit until her third trimester because she worried enrolling in Medicaid could put her husband at risk of deportation, the clinic reported in a December court filing. By the time she received care, she had complications that could have been addressed with earlier health visits. Another patient refused to apply for Medicaid for her child, a U.S. citizen, because she worried that seeking benefits would allow ICE to locate her.

“The expectation of privacy that we all have when we seek to enroll in a health care program has been compromised,” said Broder.

“Not only undocumented immigrants but people who live in families with immigrants and the broader community are going to feel less comfortable in applying for these health programs, over concerns their information is going to be weaponized against them or their family members.”

An about-face

Several months into Trump’s second term, ICE gained access to the personal data of 79 million Medicaid enrollees as part of its efforts to find people who may be living illegally in the United States.

Data on Medicaid enrollees is routinely exchanged between states and the feds, including to verify eligibility to receive federal funding. But the new agreement marked an about-face from past federal policies of not using such information for immigration enforcement.

The effort is unprecedented at the national level, said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor at Penn State Dickinson Law who specializes in health and immigration.

“Previously the federal government has balanced immigration enforcement interests with the protection of health-related interests,” she said. “Now they’re weighing much more heavily the interests of immigration enforcement.”

That puts the federal government at odds with states that have expanded health coverage as a matter of public health and economic policy, she said. Many states have extended coverage to a wider swath of people on the premise that broader coverage helps prevent the spread of disease, prioritizes preventive care over more costly emergency treatment and reduces economic losses when employees miss work because of illness.

The judge’s order will stand until the case is resolved, as the judge considers what kinds of data can be released for use in immigration enforcement.

ICE courthouse arrests meet resistance from Democratic states

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said in a July statement that the Trump administration’s data-sharing move was illegal and “created a culture of fear that will lead to fewer people seeking vital emergency medical care.”

Federal officials say they’re allowed to use lawfully collected information for immigration enforcement purposes.

The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

Broder, of the National Immigration Law Center, said it isn’t clear whether the limited information the court has allowed the Department of Homeland Security to use can be cleanly separated from data belonging to citizens and lawful permanent residents. The ruling says that if that basic data can’t be separated from data that’s still protected, Medicaid can’t share it with ICE.

California’s Department of Health Care Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, emphasized that concern in a statement updated earlier this month. The department said the feds haven’t provided any information about how they plan to implement the court’s order.

Meanwhile, some states are looking at their options for protecting their Medicaid data. Oregon Health Authority Director Dr. Sejal Hathi called the move to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement “disappointing, to say the least” in a public board meeting earlier this month.

She said her agency is “committed to doing all that we can within our authority to protect the health privacy of our members” and is working with health providers to “ensure that Oregonians, no matter their background, can continue to seek and receive quick and responsive health care without worrying about the safety of their health information.”

States step up

In recent years, an increasing number of states have used their own money to extend health insurance coverage under their Medicaid programs to some noncitizens, such as people with green cards, refugees and those with temporary protected status.

For example, 14 states and the District of Columbia cover income-eligible children regardless of immigration status, while seven states and the district offer state-funded coverage to some adults with low incomes, regardless of immigration status. Nearly half of states — including a handful of red states — cover income-eligible pregnant women, regardless of their immigration status.

Makhlouf, of Penn State, directs a legal clinic at her law school where law students assist people who face legal barriers to getting health care and other public benefits. The students have fielded questions from parents — even those who are in the country legally — who have asked if applying for Medicaid for their children, who are U.S. citizens, jeopardizes their own legal status or exposes household members to scrutiny from ICE.

“We see the chilling effects directly,” Makhlouf said. “Folks have many more questions about the risks versus the benefits of applying for government programs. It should be an easy decision for families to accept help, but it’s not easy anymore.”

In the past year, the Trump administration also has ordered states to hand over personal data from sources including voter rolls and food stamps, even as it consolidates information held across federal agencies into a trove of information on people who live in the United States.

In November, a federal judge blocked the IRS from sharing taxpayer information for immigration purposes.

“We call on everyone, including powerful institutions who have stayed on the sidelines, to commit to promoting democracy and resisting autocracy.","Washington, D.C. – One year into the second administration of Donald Trump, the courts have served as a critical guardrail against the harmful excesses of the Trump-Vance administration according to a new analysis released by leading pro-democracy legal organization Democracy Forward today.

The Trump-Vance administration has faced more than 600 lawsuits from people and communities across the nation and has lost in court more than 70% of the time. The administration has faced losses in front of courts with judges appointed by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, and President Trump himself, with less than 5% of these cases going to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“Over the past year, the nation has been reminded of the resilience and determination of the American people. As powerful institutions have stayed silent or, worse, collaborated in what is an autocratic power grab unfolding in our nation, the people have stepped forward, including in the courts where the people have filed–and won–hundreds of legal cases. At Democracy Forward, we are proud to be shoulder to shoulder with people and communities across the country, as well as with the nation’s legal community, in defending people and the rule of law against what are existential threats to the wellbeing of people and our nation’s present and future,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “While the devastation and pain that the Trump-Vance administration continues to cause is immoral and unjustifiable, we find hope in the people’s determination to resist this autocratic powergrab.”

Critical pro-democracy court victories that have been achieved by public interest organizations, civil rights and civil liberties advocates, state attorneys general, private practice lawyers, and cities and counties over the past year – and that remain in place – include:

Blocking the administration’s nationwide freeze on federal funding and essential services;

Blocking the administration’s deployment of the National Guard in states and cities across the nation;

Blocking the administration’s retaliation against law firms, civic institutions, associations, and non-profit organizations;

Blocking the administration’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deprive people of due process;

Blocking the administration’s attempt to defund educational institutions that do not align with the White House’s views;

Blocking a number of the administration’s anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility initiatives;

Blocking the administration’s efforts to reverse the Constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship;

Blocking key provisions of the administration’s so-called “election integrity” Executive Order;

Blocking the administration’s efforts to deprive 42 million Americans of supplemental nutritional assistance (SNAP);

Blocking the administration’s attempts to deprive 2.2 million people of health care, raise costs for working families, and undermine the Affordable Care Act’s core protections; and

Blocking attempts to undermine the free press –whether through court orders that blocked attempts to decimate the Voice of America or blocking the administration’s attempts to deprive press of access to public spaces.

Many of these victories have been achieved through a broad coalition of public interest organizations and pro-democracy state attorneys general. Democracy 2025, the strategic legal network of 675+ organizations housed at Democracy Forward, has been credited with coordinating the largest and most effective legal strategy against unlawful administrative action in modern history. Democracy 2025 is the strategic hub to protect people and their rights against the Trump-Vance administration’s efforts to unlawfully strip away freedoms and prosperity. The effort has been credited with filling the gap that was left when a number of large elite law firms pulled back from their pro-bono work and/or capitulated to the White House’s demands.

Democracy Forward in the past year alone has taken more than 400 legal actions to stop executive branch excesses, including through filing more than 150 lawsuits, initiating more than 250 public records investigations, and filing numerous supportive friend-of-the court briefs. Democracy Forward has also submitted more than 1,700 Freedom of Information Act requests and other demands since January 2025.

In addition to Democracy 2025, Democracy Forward has launched a number of additional collaborative projects to build further support for the pro-democracy movement – both inside and outside of the courts. Those include:

Civil Service Strong, a collaborative effort by civil society, non-partisan good government and watchdog organizations, lawyers, and unions to ensure our nation’s civil service is able to continue to serve the American people and our Constitution, deliver for our nation, and support our communities.

Democracy Works 250, an innovative and collaborative effort to reimagine and build foundations for a people-centered government and democracy, including through a nationwide listening project to catalogue the expectations and experiences of the American people and through optimizing the expertise of former civil servants and fired federal workers to contribute to plans to rebuild government.

We Hold These Truths, a nationwide campaign dedicated to promoting unity and cross-ideological support for the five non-negotiables of American Democracy: voting and elections, personal freedom, equality, due process, and the rule of law.

Together for Democracy, an initiative to build community and encourage courageous action across the nation.

“As the threats from the Trump-Vance regime continue to accelerate, we are continuing to expand our efforts to protect people, the Constitution, and our nation. We are proud of the historic, peaceful, and direct actions that people and communities have taken over the last year to protect themselves, their neighbors, and our democracy – both inside the courts and outside of the courtroom. Courage is the new currency. Whether it’s Day 1, Day 365, or Day 1,000, we will continue to meet this administration in court to protect our communities and our democracy,” Perryman added. “We call on everyone, including powerful institutions who have stayed on the sidelines, to commit to promoting democracy and resisting autocracy. It is not too late to choose the right side of history.”",https://democracyforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/og-image.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:56.276148

The number of murders nationwide continued to decline, a trend that began in 2022.

The federal debt held by the public rose about 6.7%.

Analysis

Now that Trump has been back in office for one year, we’re publishing our first “Trump’s Numbers” article of his second term. That’s the schedule we have followed for these reports, which we launched in 2012. We wait a year when a new president is inaugurated to allow for the accumulation of some data on most of these metrics.

Going forward, we’ll provide quarterly updates throughout Trump’s term, as we did for his predecessors, and we’ll be able to include statistics that are missing from this report — household income, poverty and health insurance — once the data are released.

In a Jan. 13 speech, Trump himself cited “the numbers” for his economic record, making a healthy, and incorrect, use of superlatives. “By almost every metric, we have quickly gone from the worst numbers on record to the best and strongest numbers,” he said. “Just based on the numbers.”

While that’s clearly not accurate for “almost every metric,” the idea behind these articles isn’t to fact-check specific claims; rather, we simply provide the numbers. They may be expected or surprising, good or bad, depending on one’s point of view. We leave those opinions to readers, and we make no judgments as to how much credit or blame a president deserves for these measures.

Jobs and Unemployment

Job growth slowed and unemployment crept up during Trump’s second term. The number of unemployed now exceeds the number of job openings.

Employment — Employment continued growing during Trump’s first 11 months in office, but much more slowly than it had in the previous 11 months.

The most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show an increase of 473,000 in total nonfarm employment between January and December 2025. That’s barely more than one-quarter of the 1,782,000 jobs added between February 2024 and January 2025, when Trump began his current term.

(A note of caution: BLS has announced it will revise its monthly job figures substantially downward for March because its annual “benchmarking” study indicated its monthly survey had overcounted the number of jobs that month by 911,000. Updated figures going back to March 2024 are scheduled to be released in February along with the regular monthly employment report.)

Much of the sluggishness under Trump is due to the president’s deliberate slashing of the federal workforce. Federal government employment has fallen by 277,000, or 9.2%, since he took office.

Looking only at the private sector — excluding federal, state and local government workers — 654,000 jobs were added during Trump’s term so far. But that’s still less than half the 1,414,000 added in the preceding 11 months.

Back in August, Trump reacted to disappointing job-growth figures by calling them “rigged” and “phony” even though we found no evidence of that and the White House offered none. Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and nominated as her replacement E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Trump withdrew that nomination amid much criticism at the end of September and has yet to name a permanent replacement.

Meanwhile BLS reported a gain of only 50,000 jobs in the month of December. That’s even lower than the initial report of a 73,000 gain in July that prompted Trump to fire the BLS chief. The July gain has since been revised downward to 72,000.

Manufacturing Jobs — The economy continued to lose manufacturing jobs. During Trump’s first 11 months the loss was 63,000. That followed a loss of 98,000 in the preceding 11 months.

Labor Force Participation — The labor force participation rate declined a bit in Trump’s second term, dropping from 62.6% to 62.4%.

The rate is the portion of the population over age 16 that is working or seeking work. It generally has been in a long decline as the population ages and people retire.

Unemployment — The unemployment rate has remained well below the historical norm under Trump, but has gone up slightly since he took office. It was 4.0% in January 2025, and most recently was 4.4% in December.

The median rate for all months since 1948 is 5.5%.

Job Openings — The number of people officially listed as unemployed rose by 638,000 during Trump’s first 11 months, while the number of job openings declined by 616,000. There are now 7.5 million unemployed and seeking work, but only 7.1 million openings. When Trump took office, job opportunities outnumbered job-seekers.

Wages and Inflation

CPI — Trump campaigned on a promise to reduce inflation, and since he took office it has slowed little. Or maybe not. By one important measure it has worsened.

In the 12 months before Trump took office the Consumer Price Index, the most commonly cited measure of inflation, rose 3.0%. And in the most recent BLS report, the 12-month increase was 2.7%.

Over Trump’s first 11 months in office, the CPI went up 2.18%.

One particularly bright spot: The often volatile price of gasoline has eased. The national average price for regular gasoline at the pump was $3.11 the week Trump was sworn in for the second time, and had dropped to $2.78 by the week ending Jan. 12, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Inflation was much worse in 2022, when the 12-month CPI increase spiked at 9.1% in June. That was the largest 12-month increase in over 40 years. But inflation had slowed markedly by the time Trump came in.

Still, inflation remains higher than the Federal Reserve would like, and it’s going in the wrong direction as measured by the Fed’s preferred metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The central bank’s target is a 2% annual increase in the PCE. When Trump took office, the 12-month increase in the PCE was 2.5%. But the most recent report put the 12-month increase at 2.8%.

That was for the period ending in September. Not only do the PCE figures take longer to gather than the CPI, they have been delayed by the recent government shutdown. The next PCE release is now scheduled for Jan. 22 and will cover both October and November.

Wages — Wage increases accelerated under Trump, even adjusted for inflation.

The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, adjusted for inflation, rose 1.4% during Trump’s first 11 months. They were rising when he took office, but had only gone up 0.5% in the preceding 11 months.

Those figures include professionals, executives and supervisory employees, whose pay is normally higher. But rank-and-file wage earners are seeing gains just as rapid as those of their bosses. For private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees, real average earnings also rose 1.4% under Trump, after a 1.0% rise in the preceding period.

Economic Growth

After a weak first quarter, the economy showed surprising resilience in Trump’s first year back in office – largely on the strength of substantial artificial intelligence investments and household spending.

Although the first official annual estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis isn’t due to be released until Feb. 20, BEA data available so far show that real gross domestic product declined at an annual rate of 0.6% in the first three months of 2025 but then grew by 3.8% in the second quarter and 4.3% in the third quarter.

The reported third-quarter growth was the largest in two years, when the economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.7%. Fourth quarter growth, which also won’t be released until Feb. 20, may be even higher. As of Jan. 14, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model was projecting growth of 5.3%.

“This strong growth came despite the adverse trade and immigration shocks the economy has absorbed over the past year,” resulting in a “soft labor market,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, wrote in December after the third-quarter figures were released. “That interplay — a surging economy and a soft labor market — is likely to be the major economic narrative next year.”

Brusuelas described the economy as a “resilient beast.” He attributed the third-quarter growth to “[h]ousehold consumption driven by higher-income consumers and AI-related investment,” which he wrote “accounted for just under 70% of total growth during the [third] quarter.”

For the full year, Federal Reserve Board members and bank presidents expect growth to come in at between 1.5% and 2%, according to estimates released Dec. 10. Their median projection was 1.7%. Similarly, economists surveyed in October by the National Association for Business Economics estimated 1.8% growth in 2025.

Consumer Sentiment

When Trump took office, consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expressed concern about unemployment and inflation and uncertainty about the potential impact of Trump’s economic agenda.

“Concerns over the future trajectory of inflation were visible throughout the interviews and were tied to beliefs about anticipated policies like tariffs,” Joanne W. Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers, said in a press release last January, adding that “consumers of all political leanings will continue to refine their views as Trump’s policies are clarified and implemented.”

A year ago, the university’s survey showed that the consumer sentiment was 71.7. Since then, consumer confidence has precipitously declined in subsequent surveys and remains stubbornly low.

The university’s preliminary Index of Consumer Sentiment for January was 54 – 17.7 points lower than it was when Trump took office. By contrast, consumer sentiment never dropped below 71.8 in Trump’s first term, despite the economic turmoil caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.

Although those surveyed perceived some “modest improvement” in the economy in the last two months, consumer sentiment “remains nearly 25% below last January’s reading,” Hsu said. Consumers “continue to be focused primarily on kitchen table issues, like high prices and softening labor markets.”

In its most recent Consumer Confidence Survey, the Conference Board — a research organization with more than 2,000 member companies — also reported that consumer confidence declined for the fifth straight month in December.

“Despite an upward revision in November related to the end of the [government] shutdown, consumer confidence fell again in December and remained well below this year’s January peak,” Dana M. Peterson, chief economist of the Conference Board, said in a Dec. 23 press release.

Home Prices & Homeownership

Homeownership — Homeownership rates have declined slightly since Trump became president.

The homeownership rate, which the Census Bureau measures as the percentage of “occupied housing units that are owner-occupied,” was 65.3% in the third quarter of 2025 — 0.4 points below the 65.7% rate during Biden’s last quarter in office.

Although mortgage rates eased in 2025, the homeownership rate in the third quarter “remained below last year’s pace because of ongoing affordability pressures,” according to Realtor.com.

“Persistent affordability challenges and a shortage of reasonably priced homes have kept the rate from rising more meaningfully, though recent inventory gains, softer prices, and easing mortgage rates appear to be helping some previously sidelined households enter the market,” Realtor.com Senior Economic Research Analyst Hannah Jones said in a Dec. 12 article on the company’s website.

The highest homeownership rate on record was 69.2% in 2004, when George W. Bush was president. But millions of Americans lost their homes during the Great Recession, a financial crisis triggered by a housing market crash.

“Following record-high homeownership rates before the 2008 housing and financial crisis, homeownership rates have remained relatively static at the current rate of 65 percent,” HUD’s policy and research arm wrote in a July report on the history of homeownership in the U.S.

Home Prices — Home prices, which soared to new highs under Biden, slowed in Trump’s first year, as mortgage rates continued to fall.

The national median price of an existing, single-family home sold in December was $409,500, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was 2.9% higher than it was in January, when Biden left office.

Looked at another way: The median sales price in December was only 0.24% higher year-over-year.

“2025 was another tough year for homebuyers, marked by record-high home prices and historically low home sales,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a press release. “However, in the fourth quarter, conditions began improving, with lower mortgage rates and slower home price growth.”

The Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates three times in 2024. After a pause, the Fed cut rates three more times in 2025 – lowering rates last year by a full percentage point since September. While that’s not directly tied to mortgage rates, it can affect how banks set their loan rates.

As of Jan. 8, the average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.16% — down from 6.96% for the week ending Jan. 23, 2025, according to Freddie Mac. Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2025.

Immigration

In his first year in office, Trump has followed through on his signature campaign promise to — as he puts it — “close the border,” with numerous executive actions that have dramatically reshaped immigration policy and enforcement.

“The border is totally secure,” Trump told reporters on Jan. 11.

The number of apprehensions at the U.S. border with Mexico decreased 91.4% during Trump’s first full 11 months in office, compared with the same period in 2024, according to the most recent figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The monthly average (7,255) was at a low not seen since the early 1960s.

Calculating the change in border apprehensions is the method we’ve used as a proxy to measure illegal border crossings for our Numbers stories going back to President Barack Obama. But in Trump’s case, that dramatic drop tells only part of the story of the sweeping immigration policy changes that the Migration Policy Institute describes as “unprecedented in their breadth and reach.”

“While some efforts have stalled or not yet met the White House’s lofty goals, the administration has dramatically reshaped the machinery of government to target unauthorized immigrants in the country, deter unauthorized border arrivals, make the status of many legally resident immigrants more tenuous, and impose obstacles for lawful entry of large swaths of international travelers and would-be immigrants,” MPI’s Muzaffar Chishti, Kathleen Bush-Joseph and Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh wrote in their Jan. 13 article, “Unleashing Power in New Ways: Immigration in the First Year of Trump 2.0.” The “net change,” the authors wrote, “has been dizzying in its scope and speed.”

The Trump administration has “dismantled longstanding norms,” the authors wrote, invoking “archaic statutes,” enlisting “support from state and local law enforcement as well as federal agencies that historically had no immigration enforcement role,” and pressuring “foreign governments to receive deportees,” the MPI report stated. “Perhaps most visibly, it militarized immigration enforcement.”

Trump has achieved his policy mostly through executive actions, rather than with legislative help, something he has boasted about repeatedly.

“Remember Biden, he said I have to get approval from Congress,” Trump said in a speech in Detroit on Jan. 13. “Had nothing to do with Congress, had to do with respect.”

In one of his first actions upon taking office in January 2025, Trump issued a proclamation that “the current situation at the southern border qualifies as an invasion under Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United States.” He mostly blocked migrants’ ability to request asylum. He canceled humanitarian parole programs that the Biden administration extended to Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. And he reinstated the “Remain in Mexico” policy, so that asylum seekers were sent to Mexico to await their court appearances in the U.S.

In December, Trump paused all asylum decisions at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And on Jan. 14, the president indefinitely paused the processing of immigrant visas for 75 nations, including Afghanistan, Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Russia, Thailand, Somalia and Yemen. He had previously issued a full or partial ban on travel from 39 countries.

MPI estimated that in the first year of his second term, Trump has taken more than 500 actions on immigration including 38 executive orders and “hundreds of other actions via presidential proclamations and policy guidance.” That’s more actions than in all four years of Trump’s first term, MPI said.

But Congress has provided some help. In July, Republicans passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included more than $170 billion to ramp up immigration enforcement, detention and deportation.

Increasingly, the administration has turned its attention to interior enforcement. According to MPI, “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests have more than quadrupled since Trump took office, while average daily detention has doubled.”

In December, the Department of Homeland Security reported that its enforcement operations have resulted in more than 622,000 deportations since January 2025 (short of the stated goal of at least 1 million per year). And, DHS said, another “1.9 million illegal aliens have voluntarily self-deported,” some of whom were lured by government incentives — a free flight home and $1,000. MPI said the Trump administration hasn’t provided any data to back up that self-deportation claim.

A New York Times analysis of federal data disputed the administration’s figures, with its Jan. 17 analysis, covering Trump’s first year, estimating the number of deportations at 540,000, including 230,000 people who were detained inside the country, 270,000 deported at the border and 40,000 who signed up for the government incentives to self-deport. The Times speculated that the administration’s 622,000 figure “likely includes all repatriations carried out by various homeland security subagencies,” such as ship crews that are barred from disembarking.

Both the Times and MPI noted that DHS hasn’t released detailed, public reports on these statistics, as it has in the past.

In any case, the Times noted the number of deportations lagged the number in Biden’s last two years in office: 590,000 total deportations in 2023 and 650,000 in 2024, when border apprehensions were much higher than they are now. The number of people Trump has deported from inside the country, 230,000, is far higher than the 50,000 deported from inside the country in 2024.

Refugees

In his first term, Trump sharply reduced refugee admissions. But now they have nearly stopped entirely.

As we wrote last year, Trump signed an executive order on his first day back in office that called for a “realignment” of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, including an indefinite suspension of all admissions until the program “aligns with the interests of the United States.”

There have been few exceptions to the new refugee policy – notably for refugees from South Africa’s white minority Afrikaner ethnic group. In making an exception for Afrikaners, Trump claimed there was “a genocide that’s taking place” against white farmers in the country – which, as we wrote, distorts the facts.

Beginning in February, the U.S. has admitted only 1,226 refugees in Trump’s first full 11 months in office – including 1,059 refugees from South Africa, according to State Department data.

By contrast, the U.S. admitted 70,033 during the same 11-month period, from February 2024 through December 2024, under Biden. That’s a staggering 98% decline.

For fiscal year 2026, which began Oct. 1, 2025, Trump placed a cap of 7,500 on refugee admissions – which is far fewer than the 125,000 cap Biden instituted for fiscal year 2025. It’s also much less than the 45,000 cap that Trump placed on refugees in fiscal year 2018, which was his first full fiscal year as president during his first term.

Other than refugees from South Africa, Trump was forced by a court ruling to admit some refugees who had plans to resettle in the U.S. when he suspended the program.

As we wrote, an appeals court ruled (in a clarifying opinion issued April 21) that refugees who had an “approved refugee application” and “had arranged and confirmable travel plans” on or before Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order can enter the country. About 160 refugees were affected by that decision, a spokesman for the International Refugee Assistance Project told us for an article in September.

Most of the non-South Africans admitted last year came from Afghanistan. The U.S. admitted 100 Afghan refugees in the past 11 months, the State Department data show.

In addition to suspending the refugee program, Trump more recently has threatened to deport refugees who settled in Minnesota, citing an ongoing fraud investigation in that city.

In a Jan. 9 statement, the Department of Homeland Security said it is “reexamining thousands of refugee cases through new background checks and intensive verification of refugee claims,” beginning with “Minnesota’s 5,600 refugees who have not yet been given lawful permanent resident status (Green Cards).”

Trade

The international trade deficit, which Trump criticized for reaching record levels under Biden, decreased only slightly in the months since Trump took office for his second term.

Through his first full nine months in office, the U.S. imported $654 billion more in goods and services than it exported, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s about 0.9% less than the $659.7 billion gap between U.S. imports and exports during the same period in 2024.

The full impact of Trump’s new tariff policies on the trade imbalance is still to be determined. The New York Times noted that “because of a surge in imports earlier this year,” to avoid import tariffs that later went into effect, “the overall trade deficit from January to October was still up 7.7 percent from the previous year.”

Also, when the goods and services trade deficit for the month of October went down 60% year-over-year to $29.4 billion, the lowest monthly total since June 2009, the Times said that some economists attributed the decrease to “temporary fluctuations in trade in certain products, like gold and pharmaceuticals.”

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told the newspaper: “Cutting through the noise and getting to the underlying signal in the data, it suggests to me that the deficit is as large as its ever been.”

Corporate Profits

Corporate profits set records each year under Biden, but dipped in the first quarter under Trump before rebounding slightly in the second quarter and recovering fully in the third quarter.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that after-tax corporate profits at an annual rate were $3.59 trillion in the third quarter of 2025 – about $91 billion, or 2.6%, higher than the full-year figure for 2024.

The fourth quarter and annual figures for last year won’t be released until March, so it is still unclear if after-tax corporate profits for the full year will be up or down.

Under Biden, the annual average growth was 31% in 2021, 3.8% in 2022, 7.8% in 2023 and 7.9% in 2024, according to BEA data.

Stock Market

The stock market, which set records during Biden’s presidency, reached new heights again under Trump.

The S&P 500, which is made up of 500 large-cap companies, closed at 15.7% higher on Jan. 16 than it was three days before Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, made up of 30 large corporations, was up 13.5% over that same period.

And the Nasdaq composite index, comprising more than 3,000 companies, many in the technology sector, surged by almost 19.8% in that time frame.

These gains followed ample market increases during the Biden administration, when the S&P rose 57.8%, the Dow Jones went up 40.6%, and the Nasdaq increased by almost half.

Food Stamps

After a slight increase in enrollment during Biden’s presidency, the latest data from the Department of Agriculture show that under Trump fewer people are accessing benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.

About 41.6 million people were receiving federal food assistance in September, according to preliminary USDA figures published last month. The number has gone down by about 1.2 million participants, or 2.8%, since Trump took office.

The number of individuals benefiting from SNAP is expected to decline further because of the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which changed eligibility requirements for SNAP and is estimated to reduce federal spending on the program. For example, the law extends work requirements to include “able-bodied adults without dependents” aged 55 to 64, who were previously exempt.

In August, the Congressional Budget Office said that provisions in the law “will reduce participation in SNAP by roughly 2.4 million people in an average month over the 2025-2034 period.”

Crime

We won’t have annual 2025 crime data from the FBI until the fall. But other reports on part of the year show violent crime has continued to drop, a trend that began in 2022 after a spike in crime, particularly murders, in 2020.

AH Datalytics, an independent criminal justice data analysis group, produces a Real-Time Crime Index, an aggregation of crime data collected from 570 law enforcement agencies. That index shows a 19.8% decline in the number of murders for January to October 2025 compared with the same period in 2024. Longer term, the index shows the number of murders jumped in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, then leveled off and has been dropping since 2022.

The latest report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which compares Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, 2025, to the same period in the prior year, similarly found a 19.1% decline in the number of murders for 67 law enforcement agencies. The number of rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults also went down, with the latter decreasing by 10%.

A midyear 2025 report by the Council on Criminal Justice on 42 cities, which consistently published data since 2019, found the same trend, with crime levels now mostly below pre-pandemic levels. “Examining trends over a longer timeframe, violent crimes are below levels seen in the first half of 2019, the year prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic and racial justice protests of 2020,” the CCJ report said. It noted, though, that the drop in murders has been concentrated in a few cities.

“Much of the decline in the national homicide rate, which began in late 2022, has been driven by large drops in a few sample cities with high homicide levels, such as Baltimore and St. Louis,” CCJ said in a press release about its findings. “The most recent data show that all of the sample cities are now below the general peak of 2020 to 2021, but more than 60% continue to experience homicide levels above pre-2020 rates.”

Gun Sales

After reaching a record high in 2020, estimated gun sales declined every year that Biden was president. That downward trend continued during Trump’s first year back in office.

The government doesn’t collect data on gun sales. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation — the gun industry’s trade group — estimates gun sales by tracking the number of background checks for firearm sales based on the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NSSF-adjusted figures exclude background checks unrelated to sales, such as those required for concealed-carry permits.

According to NSSF, the number of background checks for gun purchases in 2025 was roughly 14.6 million – down 4.1% from about 15.2 million in 2024. But the 2025 total was still higher than the almost 13.2 million estimated sales in 2019, before the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has yet to publish its annual manufacturing figures, so we don’t know whether firearm production, specifically of handguns, increased or decreased in 2025.

Debt and Deficits

Trump’s campaign pledge that “we’re going to actually start paying off debt” hasn’t happened yet. The publicly held debt increased by about one-third on Biden’s watch and continued to rise during the first year of Trump’s second term.

As of Jan. 14, the debt held by the public, which excludes money the federal government owes to itself, was almost $30.8 trillion – up about 6.7% from more than $28.8 trillion on Jan. 17, 2025, three days before he took office.

Another annual deficit – close to $1.8 trillion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 – was a key factor. It was the fourth highest fiscal deficit of all time (behind FY 2020, FY 2021 and FY 2024) and the sixth consecutive budget gap of more than $1 trillion.

Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency had promised to cut federal spending by at least $1 trillion, a goal it did not achieve. Instead, federal spending went up a bit in fiscal 2025.

And, so far, the U.S. appears headed for another debt-increasing deficit in FY 2026 – although perhaps a smaller one. From October through December, the first quarter of the current fiscal cycle, the CBO said that federal outlays exceeded revenues by $601 billion. That’s about $110 billion less than the deficit in the same quarter of fiscal 2025.

Oil Production and Imports

Trump campaigned on a promise that the U.S. would “drill, baby, drill” during a second Trump term, and on his first day back in office, he signed an executive order with a stated goal of “unleashing American energy.”

As of October, U.S. crude oil production had increased to an average of 13.6 million barrels per day in Trump’s first full nine months in the White House, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s up almost 2.5% from the same nine-month period in 2024.

Before Trump was inaugurated, and before any of his policies were in place, the EIA had already projected in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook that average daily production would increase to a record 13.5 million barrels a day in 2025.

U.S. crude oil imports are trending in the opposite direction.

Imports were down to an average of about 6.1 million barrels per day during Trump’s first full nine months — a decrease of 6.9% from nearly 6.6 million barrels per day during the comparable period a year earlier. During the Biden years, average imports increased annually.

Carbon Emissions

EIA data also show a small increase in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption under Trump

There were approaching 3.2 billion metric tons of emissions from the consumption of coal, natural gas and various petroleum products in his first full eight months in office. That was roughly 1.4% more than the over 3.1 billion metric tons that were emitted from consuming those energy sources during the same stretch in 2024.

In early January 2025, the EIA projected that CO2 emissions would increase slightly in 2025, but remain in the ballpark of 4.8 billion metric tons emitted in 2024. The agency said it expected emissions growth due to the increased consumption of petroleum products across multiple sectors, particularly the use of diesel fuel and jet fuel.

Emissions had declined in 2023 and 2024 after increasing in Biden’s first two years as president.

Health Insurance

We don’t yet have data on how health insurance coverage has changed so far under Trump’s second term. Typically, the National Health Interview Survey has released quarterly preliminary reports on the insurance status of Americans. But the NHIS’ website now says that as of 2025, the data will only be released biannually.

The latest report, posted in June 2025, covers calendar year 2024. The NHIS is a project of the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A report on estimates from the survey for January to June 2025 is scheduled to be released on Jan. 30.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law in July, is expected to prompt a rise in the number of people who lack health insurance, starting next year. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the uninsured would increase by 10 million people over 10 years, with most of the increase due to the law’s changes to Medicaid. For 2026, the rise was estimated at 1.3 million people. (See the link to estimated changes in people without health insurance.)

In 2024, the last year of Biden’s term, 8.2% of the population, or 27.2 million people, were uninsured, according to the NHIS’ estimates, which measure those uninsured at the time they were interviewed. A Census Bureau report, released in September and measuring those who were uninsured for the entire calendar year, similarly put the uninsured rate at 8%.

Under Biden’s full term, the percentage and number of Americans who are uninsured declined, as we explained in our “Biden’s Final Numbers” report.

Judiciary Appointments

In his first term, Trump filled one-third of the Supreme Court, nearly 30% of the appeals court seats and nearly 26% of District Court seats. So far in his second term, the judiciary confirmation numbers lag a bit behind those in Biden’s first year.

Supreme Court — There hasn’t been a vacancy on the Supreme Court during the first year of Trump’s second term, just as there wasn’t a vacancy in Biden’s first year.

Court of Appeals — As of Jan. 16, Trump has won confirmation for six U.S. Court of Appeals judges. At the same point in his term, Biden had won confirmation for 12.

District Court — Twenty-one Trump nominees to be District Court judges have been confirmed, while 29 were confirmed at the same point in Biden’s first year.

Two U.S. Court of Federal Claims judges also were confirmed in Biden’s first year. None have been confirmed so far under Trump, and there are no vacancies for such positions.

As of Jan. 16, there were no vacancies for Court of Appeals judges, 39 for District Court judges with five nominees pending, and one vacancy for the international trade court.

LeTennier, the Appellate Division, Third Department issued a significant published decision that not only affirms the challenged orders, leaving the foreclosure judgment in favor of the lender in place, but also constitutes the first appellate‑level case in New York to address sanctions arising from the misuse of generative AI in legal submissions.

Hinshaw partners Ellis Oster and Robert Bailey represented the lender in this appeal.

Background

The underlying foreclosure action had already been the subject of extensive motion practice, including numerous post‑judgment attempts by the borrower to vacate or relitigate issues that had long been resolved.

The borrower continued to challenge the lender’s standing despite the Appellate Division’s prior ruling in 2020 affirming summary judgment in the lender’s favor.

When the borrower later appealed several subsequent orders—including the denial of his motion to vacate the judgment—the Appellate Division held that these challenges were either meritless or abandoned.

The Court Identifies Extensive Use of Fabricated, AI‑Generated Case Law

What distinguishes this decision is the court’s detailed examination of the borrower’s and his counsel’s reliance on fabricated legal authorities. Across multiple appellate filings, counsel submitted more than 20 non‑existent case citations generated by AI, as well as misstatements of law drawn from real cases. The court found that this conduct was frivolous under 22 NYCRR 130‑1.1.

Although the decision acknowledges that generative AI tools can have legitimate uses in legal practice, it warns that attorneys remain responsible for verifying the accuracy of any material included in court submissions. The court emphasized that reliance on generative AI does not relieve counsel of their professional and ethical duties, particularly the obligation to ensure that all authorities cited actually exist and accurately reflect the law.

Sanctions Imposed

Given the seriousness and persistence of the misconduct, the court imposed:

$7,500 sanction on the borrower’s counsel, and

$2,500 sanction on the borrower himself.

Notably, the court observed that counsel increased his use of fake, AI-generated legal authorities even after being placed on notice about the problem, which the court found particularly concerning.

Why This Decision Matters

This opinion places New York squarely within the growing national dialogue on the responsible use of generative AI in litigation. As the first appellate‑level decision in the state to address sanctions for misuse of AI‑generated content, it provides important guidance to litigants and practitioners.

The ruling aligns with the emerging expectation across jurisdictions that generative AI may be used by litigants, but only with appropriate human oversight, verification, and accountability.

For lenders, servicers, and financial institutions, the decision also reaffirms the stability of prior standing determinations, prevents continued re-litigation of settled issues, and reinforces courts’ willingness to sanction frivolous foreclosure‑related tactics.

Conclusion

Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. LeTennier establishes a meaningful precedent in New York’s appellate jurisprudence, both in the foreclosure context and in the rapidly evolving area of AI‑related legal ethics.

They were street thugs who used violent intimidation against opponents of National Socialism and assaulted non-Aryan citizens, particularly Jewish citizens.
However, under Trump 2.0, ICE has been transformed into a fascist paramilitary squad, into a “virtual state police,” as Jamelle Bouie put it.
There are terrifying reasons for ICE’s transformation from an aggressive, rogue agency into Trump’s personal paramilitary squad.
And Minneapolis has emerged as the “new epicenter of resistance to Trump,” as France’s leading newspaper Le Monde aptly put it.","Exactly a year ago today, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. He took over a nation with strong imperialistic tendencies and a democratic polity but with widespread illiberal features throughout its history and, in less than a year, succeeded in establishing a 21st-century US variant of fascism while espousing a lawless world order.

The successful transition of the United States from an imperial republic to what could be best described as imperial proto-fascism was achieved due to the ease with which the Trump administration weakened the country’s institutions meant to restrain power and the massive support that it received, and continues to receive, from the nation’s oligarchy. There are thus eerie similarities between Trump’s United States and the rise of Italian fascism and German Nazism, and none more so than those between Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and Mussolini’s Squadristi and Hitler’s Sturmabteilung (SA), respectively.

Fascism, the most reactionary regime of oligopolistic and decaying capitalism, has always relied on violent paramilitary groups to intimidate political opponents and spread fear across society. In Italy, in 1919, Benito Mussolini formed a paramilitary squad of war veterans called Blackshirts (or squadristi) whose primary goal was to terrorize fascism’s political opponents, mainly the socialists and the communists. By the early 1920s, the squadristi had wiped out the Italian left and destroyed Italian democracy. In Germany, in 1921, Adolf Hitler established the SA, known as the Brownshirts due to their brown uniforms. They were street thugs who used violent intimidation against opponents of National Socialism and assaulted non-Aryan citizens, particularly Jewish citizens. Blackshirts and Brownshirts acted with impunity as the regular uniformed police in both Italy and Germany turned a blind eye to their thuggish tactics.

Violent paramilitary groups were seen by fascists as essential tools in the struggle to uproot the previous sociopolitical and cultural order and pave the way for the success of fascism’s ultimate goals and objectives, which are to promote extreme nationalism and do away with democratic liberties and implement policies without legal or political restraints while dehumanizing those labeled as “the enemy.” Under fascism, propaganda and violence work in unity in order to secure conformity and subdue the opposition.

Fascism is not knocking at US’s door. It is already inside.

Enter the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). ICE was created in 2003 pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, following the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. The US Congress has granted ICE “a unique combination of civil and criminal authorities,” which make it a very powerful federal law enforcement agency. The primary mission of ICE is to enforce immigration laws. It has the power to search, arrest, and deport undocumented immigrants. It can also detain and try to deport green card holders by claiming that they represent a threat to US national security.

On December 19, DHS announced that it had deported more than 620,000 noncitizens while 1.9 million undocumented immigrants have “self-deported” since Trump took office. If these figures are true and haven’t been exaggerated for propaganda purposes, we’re looking at the largest forced relocation of immigrants in a single year in the history of the United States. Immigration detention has also expanded dramatically in Trump's second term.

ICE immigration raids have been accused of excessive-use-of-force tactics and violating US citizens’ constitutional rights. Unshockingly enough given that the Trump administration relies on terror to push its inhuman agenda, DHS has used a variety of loathsome names for ICE immigration raids, ranging from “Operation Midway Blitz” (“Blitz” is a German word for lightning and was used to describe the bombing campaign undertaken by Nazi Germany on British cities, ports, and industrial sites in 1940) to “Operation Dirtbag.”

ICE has always been a notorious agency, even from the time it was designed to fight terrorism, and “the subject of numerous allegation of abuses and violations,” as has been pointed out by Brazilian professor and expert in international migration Gustavo Dias. ICE became especially aggressive during the Obama administration, when US liberals like to forget that it was responsible for over 3 million deportations. However, under Trump 2.0, ICE has been transformed into a fascist paramilitary squad, into a “virtual state police,” as Jamelle Bouie put it.

There are terrifying reasons for ICE’s transformation from an aggressive, rogue agency into Trump’s personal paramilitary squad. Trump’s domestic policy agenda revolves around the reshaping of US political culture, from liberal to illiberal through rollbacks in civil and human rights, putting an end to rising population diversity and creating (or fantasizing) in turn a white paradise, and advancing the interests of corporate oligarchs and digital feudal lords. Hence the attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); hence the violent immigration crackdown and banning citizens of “shithole countries” from vising the US; hence the erasing of non-white history; and hence the war against organized labor.

The successful implementation of all of the above policies demand loyalty to Trump’s actions from servants in the administrative state, conformity from major institutional actors, and a subdued civil society. No regime, however oppressive, can implement its policies without having a large network of allies, influential entities willing to conform, and citizen control and popular acquiescence. Trump has succeeded in securing loyalty by offering key federal positions to allies and supporters and replacing public servants with political loyalists. He has forced elite institutions to bend to his will with threats and intimidation tactics while tech billionaires and other members of the oligarchy kissed his ring because they feared retribution.

However, keeping the public subdued is trickier for any regime than cowing elite institutions and members of the economic elite into subservience. This is where ICE comes into play. ICE tactics are designed to instill fear in people and create chaos in communities as part of an overarching strategy aimed to silence opposition to Trump’s overall domestic agenda and let citizens know that this is the dawn of a new era for the United States. Dissent will not be tolerated under Trump 2.0, and undesirable elements, the “radical left,” and all those deemed unpatriotic will be weeded out.

US citizens are an intended target as much as the immigrant communities across the nation by Trump’s lawlessness. ICE agents wearing masks and decked out in military-style gear reflects the militarization of law enforcement, which is a trademark of fascist regimes and brutal dictatorships. And the message intended by the unleashing of a paramilitary force, Trump’s own goon squad, throughout the nation’s communities is to let people know that you are either with us or against us. This was indeed the intended message behind the murder of Renee Nicole Good. ICE agents stopping US citizens, at random, and going from door to door demanding proof of citizenship, as has been happening in Minneapolis-St. Paul and other places, are scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany and speak volumes to the sociopolitical order envisioned by the Trump administration.

ICE is already acting in a similar way to how the Blackshirts (Italy) and the Brownshirts (Germany) functioned under Mussolini and Hitler, respectively. Fascism is not knocking at US’s door. It is already inside. And Minneapolis has emerged as the “new epicenter of resistance to Trump,” as France’s leading newspaper Le Monde aptly put it. The only question now is whether citizens throughout the land will resist to the end, until fascism is fully defeated, or surrender to fear and intimidation and, in turn, find themselves being deprived not only of their basic rights but also stripped of their dignity, which is what fascism ultimately does to human beings.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62704197&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C414%2C0%2C415,N,,2026-01-20 16:57:58.574257

(WPRI) — In his first executive order of the year, Mayor Brett Smiley has unveiled an executive order aimed at making it more difficult for federal immigration authorities to conduct enforcement operations in Providence.

The move comes on the one year anniversary of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and just months after Smiley signed an executive order reaffirming that Providence police are not allowed to assist federal immigration authorities.

The executive order titled, “Prohibiting the Use of City Property for Civil Immigration Enforcement Activities,” states that city-owned parking lots, garages, parks, or buildings can’t be used as a “staging area, processing location, operations base, or other support for civil immigration enforcement,” unless authorities are executing “lawful judicial warrants.”

“The federal actions we are seeing across the nation are threatening immigrant communities and causing fear and uncertainty for all of our neighbors,” Smiley said Monday. “Providence’s strength comes from our diverse immigrant communities, and we will continue to do everything we can to protect families and maintain trust across our neighborhoods.”

The order also stated that city property can’t be used to assemble, mobilize or deploy vehicles, equipment, materials or personnel for the purpose of carrying out civil immigration enforcement operations.

The city will also install signage on properties that would fall under the executive order, stating that they may not be used for civil immigration enforcement.

The directive also says the city will also provide “standardized signage templates” to private landowners and leaseholders, “if they choose, for display to identify the nonpublic areas of the property in which the landowner or lease holder wishes to restrict activities related to civil immigration enforcement.”

Private landowners and leaseholders can use signs “at their own discretion and assume any legal risk associated therewith,” according to the executive order.

In his last executive order, Smiley reaffirmed that the city is meant to be a “safe and welcoming place for all,” and that Providence police are not allowed to assist federal immigration authorities.

Less than a week ago, President Trump announced his administration will strip federal funding from sanctuary cities and states.

“EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY FIRST, NO MORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STATES FOR THEIR CORRUPT CRIMINAL PROTECTION CENTERS KNOWN AS SANCTUARY CITIES,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to 32 sanctuary jurisdictions, including Rhode Island, that were deemed noncompliant with federal immigration laws.

U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez declined to issue an immediate restraining order expelling some 3,000 federal agents from Minnesota.
""Any injunction here would unduly interfere with federal immigration enforcement,"" lawyers for the Trump administration said in a court filing, adding that such relief would ""effectively give Minnesota state and local officials veto power over federal immigration enforcement within the borders of Minnesota.""
In that case, Menendez barred agents from using tactics such as pepper spray and arrest against peaceful protesters in Minnesota.
The Justice Department said on Jan. 18 that it would appeal the injunction.","The Department of Justice asked a federal judge in Minnesota to allow the Trump administration's immigration operations to continue as tensions simmer over the tactics used by federal officers throughout the state.

The Jan. 19 filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last week by Minnesota and the Twin Cities, which sought to stop the deployment of immigration agents, saying the intervention violated the state's constitutional rights. U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez declined to issue an immediate restraining order expelling some 3,000 federal agents from Minnesota.

""Any injunction here would unduly interfere with federal immigration enforcement,"" lawyers for the Trump administration said in a court filing, adding that such relief would ""effectively give Minnesota state and local officials veto power over federal immigration enforcement within the borders of Minnesota.""

The back and forth comes after nearly two weeks of protests in the state following the killing of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. The fatal shooting sparked demonstrations nationwide and has deepened fissures between federal and state officials.

Menendez, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2021, is also presiding over a case brought in December on behalf of six Minnesota activists who said federal agents violated their constitutional rights and used excessive force against demonstrators.

In that case, Menendez barred agents from using tactics such as pepper spray and arrest against peaceful protesters in Minnesota. In her order, Menendez said the record indicates that agents engaged in ""chilling conduct,"" including the ""drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics.""

The Justice Department said on Jan. 18 that it would appeal the injunction.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, speaking on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" called Menendez's order ""a little ridiculous"" and said it didn't ""change anything for how we're operating on the ground.""

In Minneapolis, skirmishes have increasingly broken out between protesters and federal officers across the city. Over the weekend, demonstrators interrupted a church service, claiming that one of the church's pastors is an ICE agent.

The Justice Department, which has said there is no basis to investigate the officer who fatally shot Good, launched a probe into the protest, citing potential civil rights violations. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy troops to Minnesota, on Jan. 20 called for the arrests and potential deportation of those involved in the demonstration.

Hicks said neither city nor state officials were informed before plans were already well underway.

Community didn’t even have awareness that this was undergoing plans,” Hicks said.","OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) — Federal immigration officials plan to open a large detention facility in Oklahoma City capable of housing up to 1,500 people, a move that caught many local and state leaders by surprise and is now drawing sharp criticism from at least one Oklahoma lawmaker.

The facility would be operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of what the Trump administration describes as a ramped-up enforcement effort targeting people living in the country illegally.

According to reporting from The Oklahoman, the plan involves converting an empty warehouse near Interstate 40 and Council Road into a detention and processing center, and federal officials did not notify city or state leaders beforehand because federal law does not require it.

State Sen. Carri Hicks, whose district includes parts of Oklahoma City, said the lack of notice immediately raised concerns.

“It really caused me a lot of concern,” Hicks said.

Hicks said neither city nor state officials were informed before plans were already well underway.

“I’m an elected official and lots of people have questions and are justly concerned that this could be already developed and in plans for implementation,” Hicks said.

Discussion of a possible detention center at the warehouse began last month after The Washington Post reported ICE planned to purchase warehouses nationwide to detain as many as 80,000 people.

On Sunday, The Oklahoman reported the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to city officials outlining plans for a small-scale processing center that could hold up to 1,500 detainees arrested by ICE.

Within a day of that report, anti-ICE signs appeared outside the building.

“Folks weren’t notified. Community didn’t even have awareness that this was undergoing plans,” Hicks said. “It’s not a rumor. We’ve seen the developed plans and we know that this is coming to that particular location.”

Hicks said her concerns center on what she describes as a lack of accountability and due process in ICE’s recent enforcement actions.

“At the heart of it, we have a federal immigration policy—and what we’re currently seeing is not an extension of what we know to be the processes in which folks can come here legally and receive their immigration status and become citizens of the United States of America,” Hicks said.

News 4 previously reported on an ICE raid in Oklahoma City last April in which agents searched a home public records showed their suspect had already sold and moved out of, leaving the new family living there traumatized.

“There are some terrible and very troubling stories that continue to occur,” Hicks said, “Particularly in the south side.”

The proposed detention center would sit in a commercial district along a busy roadway and was not originally designed to house detainees.

“It’s less than two miles from Western Heights School District, where about 50% of the students are Hispanic,” Hicks said. “So as I’m thinking about those students and I’m thinking about the parents and I’m thinking about the impact to that local community, it is appalling.”

Hicks said she wants federal officials to abandon the plan altogether.

“We don’t want your detention facility,” Hicks said. “If there are specific individuals that have warrants who absolutely need to be apprehended to protect public safety, then continue to do things through our normal way of operations, continue to make sure that these are targeted operations and not community-wide sweeps that throw everything into turmoil, because when the federal government leaves, our city will be left holding the price tag of diverting public services or public safety resources, and the fallout will be immense, and we, as the local residents, will be left with that fallout.”

Because of the federal holiday, News 4 has been unable to reach anyone with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment.

The Oklahoman also reported the phone number listed for the DHS official overseeing the project has been disconnected since Friday.",https://kfor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/A-sign-along-South-Council-Road-outside-a-planned-ICE-dtention-facility-in-Oklahoma-City-.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:37.574371

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house.
There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.
“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said.
Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father.","Federal immigration agents forced open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.

ChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law woke him up from a nap Sunday afternoon and said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

“I was shaking,"" he said. “They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a “targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”

Thao's family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.”

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS did not respond to a request from The Associated Press seeking the identities of the “two convicted sex offenders” or why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

Family fled Laos after helping US

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's “Secret War” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

“I don't feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.”

Republicans control the House and Senate, albeit by slim margins, and not all Democrats are aligned on impeachment strategies.
So far in this Congress, a handful of Democratic House members have filed impeachment resolutions.
“There’s only one person responsible for the impeachment of Donald Trump, and that’s Donald Trump,” Pelosi said.
Other Democrats, meanwhile, are convinced that now is the time to look into impeachment — whether it’s destined to fail or not.","As outrage grew over the Trump administration’s immigration raids and the shooting death of a Minnesota woman at the hands of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., had had enough.

After consulting with key Democratic colleagues, she began pushing for impeachment proceedings against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in early January.

The decision drew mixed reactions. Two sources familiar with the response among Democratic lawmakers told MS NOW that, in a private meeting of top Democrats in early January, Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev., blasted the move, saying it poses a problem for “frontliners” — members in swing seats — who must appeal to more than just Democratic voters.

As battleground leadership, Lee is responsible for voicing the perspective of the party’s most politically vulnerable members.

“It got really intense,” one of the sources said, speaking anonymously with MS NOW to discuss the sensitive moment. “People are trying to figure out how to handle it right now.”

The private moment is emblematic of a larger public problem vexing Democrats: Their base wants action amid a deluge of controversial actions from President Donald Trump and his administration, and Democratic leaders in Washington — charged with winning elections and appealing to as many Americans as possible — are trying not to alienate potential swing voters by being anti-Trump or pro-impeachment.

Not that Democrats could impeach anyone on their own right now, anyway.

Republicans control the House and Senate, albeit by slim margins, and not all Democrats are aligned on impeachment strategies. Even now, multiple Democratic members — including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who quipped that he was “no mathematician” but knew the numbers — told MS NOW the votes aren’t there to move on impeachment against any Trump officials.

But Jeffries also told reporters last week that Democrats “haven’t ruled anything in and … haven’t ruled anything out.”

“Everything is on the table from the standpoint of complete and total accountability,” he said.

As Democratic leaders consider their stance, they’ve asked members to coordinate with ranking members of key committees on any potential pushes against administration officials, both to avoid surprising colleagues and to work to build consensus.

So far in this Congress, a handful of Democratic House members have filed impeachment resolutions. There’s one against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., on top of the new effort against Noem. Two members also tried to launch proceedings against Trump, who was impeached by the House twice in his first term — once for an alleged quid pro quo with Ukraine and then for his actions to foment an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. Republicans in the Senate acquitted him on both charges. And the latest resolutions died on the legislative vine last year.

Still, the threat against the president looms — including in Trump’s mind ahead of the midterms.

In remarks to House Republicans during their policy retreat earlier this month, Trump implored them to stay focused on winning the November midterm elections, because if they lose control of Congress, “they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”

But the question of accountability — how to do it and what it means — is central in this Trump era, forced into greater focus given that Democrats are in the minority with few levers of power to pull.

Do they shut down the government to oppose the “most lawless Department of Homeland Security,” as Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., has left open as a possibility? Do they offer articles of impeachment against Cabinet members? Would war powers resolutions, meant to restrain what the administration can do militarily, halt a march toward wars in Venezuela, Cuba and Greenland — even if Democrats could get Republicans on board to pass them?

At each new inflection point, there’s a dissonant response among Democrats.

Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told MS NOW in December that Trump “crossed the line” for impeachment in his first term, but suggested the actions of his second term so far don’t warrant the same reaction.

“There’s only one person responsible for the impeachment of Donald Trump, and that’s Donald Trump,” Pelosi said. “He gave us no choice, he crossed the line here and there.”

“The fact is,” she continued, “what we’re here to do is meet the needs of the American people. If he goes to a place, that’s a different story, but it isn’t something you go looking for.”

Recommended

Asked for his view on the same question a few weeks later, Murphy declined to advocate for the House starting an impeachment inquiry on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” But he said he has “common sense.”

“I know this president has committed 10 times more impeachable offenses in his second term as he did in his first term,” Murphy said.

On Capitol Hill, after Kelly’s impeachment resolution was announced, he dismissed questions from MS NOW about whether he supported the tactic.

Other Democrats, meanwhile, are convinced that now is the time to look into impeachment — whether it’s destined to fail or not.

“These individual actions are impeachable offenses in their own right, but their ever-mounting cumulative impact on our country’s stability and health puts everything in a new light,” Rep. April Delaney, D-Md., said in a statement after the U.S.’ military operation in Venezuela.

“I now believe that our Democratic caucus must imminently consider impeachment proceedings,” she added.

Beyond discussing whether impeachment would be an effort worth their time, some lawmakers also worry such a push — even a merited one — could backfire politically.

One House Democrat, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, said an impeachment push could be a “political distraction” from the top issues during this election cycle, including affordability and the cost of living.

“There are just some exuberant Democrats that are anxious to pull the trigger on impeachment, and there are many more of us who agree that a lot of impeachable stuff is happening on a weekly basis around here,” this Democratic lawmaker told MS NOW. “But it is futile to pretend that you’re actually going to do an impeachment in this Congress, and it could actually be counterproductive because it raises expectations among Democratic base voters that this is something we can actually deliver.”

“Two things can be true at the same time,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told MS NOW last week.

She said Trump had “absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt” committed impeachable offenses. And she said “accountability needs to be a core part of our governance.”

But she also noted that she personally doesn’t run campaigns as “purely anti-Trump.”

“I’ve personally never run to represent my district on grounds of impeachment or not,” she said.

“I run for health care. My community wants to hear about raising the minimum wage, expanding unions, health, strengthening health care, and I think it’s important that we have an affirmative, positive vision for the country. But that doesn’t mean that we shy away from what needs to be done in terms of having accountability.”",https://www.ms.now/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260119_Trump-Year-One-Impeachment-bk.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:24.307937

Three cardinals in the US Catholic church have criticized the Trump administration’s foreign policy, saying its push to obtain or otherwise seize Greenland, recent military action in Venezuela, and cuts to humanitarian aid risk “destroying international relations and plunging the world into incalculable suffering”.

“Our country’s moral role in confronting evil around the world, sustaining the right to life and human dignity, and supporting religious liberty are all under examination,” said a joint statement from Blase Cupich, Robert McElroy and Joseph Tobin, respectively the archbishops of Chicago, Washington DC, and Newark, New Jersey.

“And the building of just and sustainable peace, so crucial to humanity’s wellbeing now and in the future, is being reduced to partisan categories that encourage polarization and destructive policies,” it added.

Without naming Donald Trump, the statement on Monday continued: “We seek a foreign policy that respects and advances the right to human life, religious liberty, and the enhancement of human dignity throughout the world, especially through economic assistance.”

As we wait on today’s opinions from the supreme court, it’s worth remembering that justices on the bench appeared skeptical of the administration’s arguments justifying the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to slap duties on dozens of countries, citing a national emergency. A reminder that the ability to institute taxes is a power normally only afforded to Congress.

In a spree of Truth Social posts overnight, Donald Trump posted an altered image of himself, planting a US flag in Greenland, alongside JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio.

In another post, also featuring a doctored photo, it shows Trump behind the resolute desk speaking to European leaders while he shows off a map that shows an American flag covering the US, Canada and Greenland.

Trump’s campaign to acquire the autonomous territory, that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark, has reached fever pitch in recent days after he threatened tariffs against allied countries who have spoken out against his moves on Greenland. We can expect more friction as the president heads to Davos today.

Earlier, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen repeatedly criticized Trump for his levy threats, saying they would be “a mistake” and could send the relations into “a downward spiral” that benefits geopolitical rivals. She also pledged her solidarity and support with Denmark and Greenland.

Second man dies at Texas ICE detention facility in two weeks

Victoria Bekiempis

A second man being held at a US immigration detention facility in Texas has died in two weeks, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said on Monday.

Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, originally from Nicaragua, was found “unconscious and unresponsive in his room” on 14 January at the Camp East Montana detention facility in El Paso, ICE said in a press release.

“They immediately notified contract medical staff on site to conduct life saving measures,” it said, adding that emergency medical technicians arrived to the facility but could not revive Diaz, who was pronounced dead just after 4pm. ICE asserted that Diaz “died of a presumed suicide” but that the “official cause of his death remains under investigation”.

Diaz was detained on 6 January during the Trump administration’s controversial deportation blitz in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He initially entered the US through the Mexican border in March of 2024, when border patrol agents picked him up and he was given a court date with an immigration judge, then released on parole.

On 26 August of last year an immigration judge ordered Diaz’s removal “in absentia”. ICE detained him on 12 January in order to deport him. The extensive tent facility is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso …

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January. ICE said Campos was “experiencing medical distress” and that staff provided emergency treatment in the hopes of saving him. His death is potentially being investigated as a homicide.

Judge refuses to block new DHS policy limiting Congress members’ access to ICE facilities

Yohannes Lowe

In other news, a federal judge has refused to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week’s notice before members of Congress can visit – and thereby inspect – immigration detention facilities.

Judge Jia M. Cobb of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia concluded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) didn’t violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities (you can read her judgment here).

Judge Cobb, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden, had blocked a virtually identical policy by the DHS last month, citing a clause in the appropriations law that funds the department and requires facilities to be open to congressional scrutiny.

However, ICE reestablished the visitation policy on 8 January 2026, with the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, ordering the DHS to re-impose the seven-day notice requirement – but “exclusively with money appropriated by the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act),” not regular appropriations, effectively bypassing the previous court order.

The background to this is that last June, a dozen House Democrats who were blocked from visiting immigration detention facilities sued the Trump administration, accusing it of unlawfully obstructing their efforts to visit federal immigration detention centers.

Members of Congress had tried to visit the facilities amid reports of inhumane and unsanitary conditions. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, the highest number of fatalities in two decades. At least five people have reportedly died in ICE custody so far this year.

In her ruling on Monday, Judge Cobb said the plaintiffs’ attorneys representing Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge the new policy and said the lawmakers would need to revise their complaint. She did not rule on the legality of the policy.

US supreme court to hear challenge to Hawaii’s strict gun law

Eric Berger

Hawaii, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States, will see its regulations challenged before the supreme court on Tuesday.

The court will consider the legality of the state’s law that bans people from bringing firearms on private property open to the public unless they have permission from the property owner.

The case, Wolford v Lopez, was brought by three Maui residents with concealed-carry permits and a local gun group.

US supreme court ruling on Trump's tariffs could come as early as Tuesday

Yohannes Lowe

Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of US politics. The much-anticipated US supreme court ruling on the legality of Donald Trump’s tariffs is expected in the coming weeks, and possibly as early as Tuesday, according to the Reuters news agency.

Those challenging the tariffs, which include some small businesses and US states, argue the president exceeded his authority when imposing the sweeping levies last year.

Two lower courts have already found that the president did not have the authority to impose global tariffs, which were brought in using emergency powers allowing the president to issue immediate orders and bypass Congress.

The supreme court, which is dominated by conservative justices, could throw out the tariffs – the cornerstone of Trump’s economic agenda – and force the president to send refunds to the US importers that paid them.

But if the supreme court does rule Trump overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs, the White House has other ways it can bring in import taxes.

In a 15 January interview with the NY Times published on Monday, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said the administration would “start the next day” to replace the tariffs with other levies if the ruling went against Trump.

“The reality is the president is going to have tariffs as part of his trade policy going forward,” Greer said. Last week, Trump said it would be “a complete mess” if the court were to strike down his trade tariffs, which he said would be difficult to reverse because businesses and countries could claim refunds.

Hiring bonuses of $50,000. Swelling ranks of ICE officers, to 22,000, in an expanding national force bigger than most police departments in America.

President Donald Trump promised the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history, but achieving his goal wouldn't have been possible without funding from the big tax and spending cuts bill passed by Republicans in Congress, and it's fueling unprecedented immigration enforcement actions in cities like Minneapolis and beyond.

The GOP's big bill is ""supercharging ICE,"" one budget expert said, in ways that Americans may not fully realize — and that have only just begun.

""I just don't think people have a sense of the scale,"" said Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress and a former adviser to the Biden administration's Office of Management and Budget.

""We're looking at ICE in a way we've never seen before,"" he said.

Trump's big bill creates massive law enforcement force

As the Republican president marks the first year of his second term, the immigration enforcement and removal operation that has been a cornerstone of his domestic and foreign policy agenda is rapidly transforming into something else — a national law enforcement presence with billions upon billions of dollars in new spending from U.S. taxpayers.

The shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis showed the alarming reach of the new federalized force, sparking unrelenting protests against the military-styled officers seen going door to door to find and detain immigrants. Amid the outpouring of opposition, Trump revived threats to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell the demonstrations and the U.S. Army has 1,500 soldiers ready to deploy.

But Trump's own public approval rating on immigration, one of his signature issues, has slipped since he took office, according to an AP-NORC poll.

""Public sentiment is everything,"" said Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez, D-N.Y., at a press conference at the Capitol with lawmakers supporting legislation to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Americans, she said, are upset at what they are seeing. ""They didn't sign on for this,"" she said.

Border crossings down, but Americans confront new ICE enforcements

To be sure, illegal crossings into the U.S. at the Mexico border have fallen to historic lows under Trump, a remarkable shift from just a few years ago when President Joe Biden's Democratic administration allowed millions of people to temporarily enter the U.S. as they adjudicated their claims to stay.

Yet as enforcement moves away from the border, the newly hired army of immigration officers swarming city streets with aggressive tactics — in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere — is something not normally seen in the U.S.

Armed and masked law enforcement officers are being witnessed smashing car windows, yanking people from vehicles and chasing and wrestling others to the ground and hauling them away — images playing out in endless loops on TVs and other screens.

And it's not just ICE. A long list of supporting agencies, including federal, state and local police and sheriff's offices, are entering into contract partnerships with Homeland Security to conduct immigration enforcement operations in communities around the nation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has warned Democrats that this is ""no time to be playing games"" by stirring up the opposition to immigration enforcement officers in Minneapolis and other places.

""They need to get out of the way and allow federal law enforcement to do its duty,"" Johnson said at the Capitol.

Noem has said the immigration enforcement officers are acting lawfully. The department insists it's targeting criminals in the actions, what officials call the worst of the worst immigrants.

However, reports show that non-criminals and U.S. citizens are also being forcibly detained by immigration officers. The Supreme Court last year lifted a ban on using race alone in the immigration stops.

Trump last month called Somali immigrants ""garbage,"" comments that echoed his past objections to immigrants from certain countries.

The Trump administration has set a goal of 100,000 detentions a day, about three times what's typical, with 1 million deportations a year.

Money from the big bill flows with few restraints

With Republican control of Congress, the impeachment of Noem or any other Trump official is not a viable political option for Democrats, who would not appear to have the vote tally even among their own ranks.

In fact, even if Congress wanted to curtail Trump's immigration operations — by threatening to shut down the government, for example — it would be difficult to stop the spend.

What Trump called the ""big, beautiful bill"" is essentially on autopilot through 2029, the year he's scheduled to finish his term and leave office.

The legislation essentially doubled annual Homeland Security funding, adding $170 billion to be used over four years. Of that, ICE, which typically receives about $10 billion a year, was provided $30 billion for operations and $45 billion for detention facilities.

""The first thing that comes to mind is spending on this level is typically done on the military,"" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. ""Trump is militarizing immigration enforcement.""

Ahead, Congress will need to consider routine funding for Homeland Security by Jan. 30 or risk a partial shutdown in some operations. The GOP's version of the annual bill would provide about $92 billion for the agency, including $10 billion for ICE. A growing group of Democratic senators and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have had enough. They say they won't support additional funds without significant changes.

Lawmakers are considering various restrictions on ICE operations, including limiting arrests around hospitals, courthouses, churches and other sensitive locations and ensuring that officers display proper identification and refrain from wearing face masks.

""I think ICE needs to be totally torn down,"" said Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., on CNN over the weekend.

""People want immigration enforcement that goes after criminals,"" he said. And not what he called this ""goon squad.""

Big spending underway, but Trump falls short of goals

Meanwhile, Homeland Security has begun tapping the new money at its disposal. The department informed Congress it has obligated roughly $58 billion — most of that, some $37 billion, for border wall construction, according to a person familiar with the private assessment but unauthorized to discuss it.

The Department of Homeland Security said its massive recruitment campaign blew past its 10,000-person target to bring in 12,000 new hires, more than doubling the force to 22,000 officers, in a matter of months.

""The good news is that thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill that President Trump signed, we have an additional 12,000 ICE officers and agents on the ground across the country,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a December statement.

The department also announced it had arrested and deported about 600,000 people. It also said 1.9 million other people had ""voluntarily self-deported"" since January 2025, when Trump took office.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260120-minneapolis-immigration-mn-0945-00ab0e.jpg",N,,2026-01-20 11:01:13.387295

“If you’re going to do immigration enforcement you have to do it legally and constitutionally,” Krupinski said.
Asked if immigration enforcement has gone too far, 65% of Chicagoans said it has, according to a recent survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago.
Yet he’s been speaking out against the administration’s immigration enforcement methods, particularly to fellow conservatives and others who voted for Trump.
But this wasn’t the kind of immigration enforcement the campaign had promised, he said.","Frustrated with the way the country was headed, Pablo Payan cast a ballot for Donald Trump in 2024, mainly drawn to the Republican presidential candidate’s pledge to bring economic strength to the nation as well as an America First mindset.

The father of four from Merrillville usually favored Democrats in the past but was hoping for a nationwide change of direction. Less foreign aid. More border security. Lower inflation. Greater economic growth.

Yet roughly a year into Trump’s second presidency, Payan has buyer’s remorse.

“I did vote for Trump. But now I regret it,” Payan said. “He’s contradicting everything he said he would do. And now it’s extremism. And immigration. And racial profiling. And sending money to foreign countries.”

As the one-year milestone of the second Trump administration approaches, various polls indicate waning approval for the president compared with the higher ratings he had at the start of his second term.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month showed 42% of Americans approved of Trump’s job overall. This was up slightly from lower percentages throughout most of the fall and winter but still down from the 47% approval rating around the time Trump took office in January 2025.

While the president has kept his MAGA base largely intact, the Tribune interviewed several Trump voters who have expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of his leadership during the first year of his second term.

Although they favored the president over Democrat Kamala Harris during the campaign, they now share grave concerns over the Trump administration’s handling of everything from economic strategies to foreign policy to domestic problems.

Aggressive immigration enforcement was a repeated complaint from those who backed the president during the election but now have doubts about his leadership. Chicago was the epicenter of Trump’s mass deportation policy this fall, an effort that relied heavily upon racial profiling and largely failed to target the “worst of the worst” criminals as promised.

One man from Skokie grew incensed after witnessing Border Patrol agents question U.S. citizens who were working on his property during an immigration enforcement onslaught across the Chicago area on Halloween.

A Navy combat veteran was angered after immigration officials detained his wife — a foreign-born green card holder — at O’Hare International Airport over the summer.

Payan, a 41-year-old general contractor whose parents were born in Mexico, said he believed campaign rhetoric that the administration would target felons and violent criminals who were here without legal permission, a mission he supported.

But the reality of immigration enforcement — which has included turbulent protests, detained U.S. citizens and the violent arrests of both residents who are legally in the U.S. and those without legal permission — has been a stark contrast to those promises.

“Going door to door, just asking people at the gas stations or at Home Depot, ‘Hey, what’s your status?’ That’s racial profiling at its best,” Payan said.

While there isn’t evidence of a mass exodus of Trump supporters, there are signs of weakening favor among those who cast a ballot for the president, said Alexander Theodoridis, associate professor and co-director of the UMass Poll at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Of Trump voters polled in July, 69% expressed confidence in their choice and only 1% said they regretted their vote; 2% said they had some regrets and might make a different choice if they could go back, according to the UMass Poll.

Another 3% said they wished they hadn’t voted at all and 6% had mixed feelings, the survey found.

But 19% responded that they had some concerns about his presidency — a contingent the Trump administration and other Republicans might find troubling later this year in the midterm elections, which can reshape control of Congress, Theodoridis said.

Historically, the midterms often go against the incumbent party, he noted.

“We’re very likely to see it this time around too,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean lots of people are regretful of their Trump vote in an open or even self-aware way. But they might just not be enthusiastic enough to turn out and vote for … the Republican running for Congress in their district.”

The dip in support comes as some high-profile cracks are emerging among Trump’s often-lockstep base.

Once a loyal champion of the president, former U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has severely criticized Trump over his handling of files related to financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as foreign policy and health care issues.

The feud intensified with Trump calling Greene a “traitor” and “wacky,” while pledging to endorse a challenger if she sought reelection. Amid the public fallout, Greene announced her resignation in November and stepped down earlier this month.

Elon Musk, a top donor during the 2024 election and former leader of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, has posted a flurry of attacks on his X social media platform targeting the president’s handling of the Epstein files as well as spending and tariffs. He and the president seem to be on better terms now, as Musk recently shared a picture of them dining at Mar-a-Lago on social media.

And despite intense pressure from the White House, a group of Republican state senators from Indiana helped defeat a Trump-backed redistricting plan that would have favored their party.

Among them was northwest Indiana Republican state Sen. Michael Bohacek, 8th District, who threatened to vote against the redrawn congressional map after Trump used a slur for people with intellectual abilities in reference to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Bohacek, whose daughter has Down syndrome, rebuked the president’s offensive language and encouraged him to “use the next 10 months to convince voters that his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority.”

As for Payan, he’s worried about the nation’s increasingly hawkish foreign policy, climaxing earlier this month with the U.S. capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s increasing desire to control Greenland.

“It’s the dictator blueprint,” he said.

Payan said he’s faced backlash from Democrats because he voted for Trump. He’s also been castigated by Republicans for opposing the president.

But he believes it’s everyone’s civic duty to criticize leaders when they’re wrong, even if it’s a candidate they supported during the election.

“Be vocal and express your voice,” he said. “A lot of people are scared to talk because they might get fired from work or their friends might unfriend them. And I think, what’s more important? Your voice or your relationship with your co-worker or friend?”

‘Poor choices’

While voting in person on Election Day in November 2020, Morgan Krupinski spent about five minutes holding his pen and grappling with the final decision at the top of his nearly completed ballot: The options for president, as Trump faced Democrat Joe Biden.

“I couldn’t do it,” he recalled. “I voted. But I abstained from the presidential choice. It’s kind of a reflection of where our leaders are. We have a lot of poor choices, many times.”

The 30-year-old who works in technology had voted for Trump in 2016 but grew disappointed by the end of his first term, as unrest gripped the country amid the COVID pandemic and protests following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Neither Trump nor Biden seemed equipped to lead at the time, he recounted.

Afterward, the Jan. 6, 2020, insurrection in the U.S. Capitol deeply upset Krupinski.

As the 2024 election approached, he highly favored another Republican candidate, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.

He saw her as a strong leader who could help quell two major wars plaguing the globe — the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war — while uniting a largely fragmented United States.

But Haley, the last significant Republican challenger to Trump, withdrew her longshot candidacy in March 2024.

Then the July assassination attempt on Trump marked a turning point for Krupinski, who was moved by the candidate’s speech a few days later at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

“Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” Trump told the crowd. “The discord and division in our society must be healed.”

That moment held echoes of President George W. Bush’s address following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and President Barack Obama’s words after the death of terrorist Osama bin Laden, two historical messages that had seemed to bring the nation together, Krupinski recalled.

So in 2024, he returned to his polling place and cast a hopeful vote for Trump.

Krupinski was gratified by some of the president’s international accomplishments, including a Trump-led plan for peace in Gaza in early October and release of the Israeli hostages by Hamas.

There were also concerns. Krupiniski criticized the administration’s steep tariffs, which “are not really a traditional Republican free-market issue.”

The self-described Reagan-style conservative grew troubled by “hyper-nationalistic rhetoric” among some in the MAGA contingent, which he believes Trump has an obligation to condemn.

But his worries for the new administration culminated on Halloween, when Trump’s often-combative immigration crackdown touched Krupinski’s home in Skokie.

While working inside his house, several Border Patrol vehicles suddenly pulled up on his quiet north suburban street.

Led by Border Patrol Cmdr. Greg Bovino, a swarm of armed immigration agents filled the scene, demanding documents from two workers from an American company who were providing flood control on Krupinski’s front lawn.

They were able to provide proof that they were U.S. citizens. But the encounter disturbed Krupinski.

“I believe we need to have a strong border and we need to get rid of people who are committing crimes and who are doing the wrong thing,” he said. “But for that to happen in such a way that’s so indiscriminate: Going down residential streets and stopping people based on their appearance and what they’re doing, without a true, reasonable cause?”

Immigration officials had no reason to stop and question those workers, Krupinski added.

“If you’re going to do immigration enforcement you have to do it legally and constitutionally,” Krupinski said. “Now what I think is going on is a very strained and expansive view of the authority that they have. And it’s very unsettling.”

Many Chicago residents agree with him in the wake of the Trump administration’s local ramped-up immigration enforcement, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz. Asked if immigration enforcement has gone too far, 65% of Chicagoans said it has, according to a recent survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. Almost 13% of those polled supported enforcement activities and more than 8% said they have not gone far enough; 14% of those surveyed were unsure.

Krupinski believes he made the best decision he could on Election Day in November.

Yet he’s been speaking out against the administration’s immigration enforcement methods, particularly to fellow conservatives and others who voted for Trump.

Amid a highly polarized and divided political climate, they might be more inclined to listen to him than a staunch Democrat or more liberal voice, Krupinski reasoned.

“So I feel like I have a unique opportunity to speak to the people on my side of things,” he added. “I hope I can change people’s minds to say no one is above criticism and no one is above being called out when they do something bad, particularly in the government. This is the right we have as citizens.”

Partisan strife

The Missouri couple were returning home from a trip to Ireland for a family memorial when they were stopped by federal authorities at O’Hare International Airport in July.

Donna Hughes-Brown, an Irish citizen and legal permanent resident of the United States, was detained by immigration authorities.

Although she’s been a green card holder for decades, Hughes-Brown said the officials cited two misdemeanor offenses against her for writing bad checks in 2012 and 2015.

The 58-year-old grandmother was held at O’Hare for several days and then transferred to a facility in Campbell County, Kentucky, where she was detained for more than four months.

Her husband, Jim Brown, a Navy veteran who fought in Operation Desert Storm, had cast a ballot for Trump in 2024. But this wasn’t the kind of immigration enforcement the campaign had promised, he said.

“What they were doing to my wife was wrong,” said Brown. They live in northeastern Missouri about 20 miles from the Illinois border.

Homeland Security officials did not respond to Tribune requests for comment.

The case made international headlines and a contingent of Democratic lawmakers, including Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, advocated for Hughes-Brown’s release.

During a U.S. House Homeland Security Committee hearing in December, U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island grilled Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on the matter.

Brown attended the hearing as well.

“She did not come here illegally and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks, totaling $80, 10 years ago. She is currently in prison and facing deportation,” Magaziner said during the hearing. “Ms. Noem, will you thank Mr. Brown for his service to our country?”

“Thank you, Mr. Brown, for your service to our country,” Noem responded.

The Homeland Security secretary added that it’s not her job to pick and choose which laws get enforced, though Noem did pledge to review the case.

In mid-December, Hughes-Brown was released and returned to her Missouri home. The couple are now working on the process for her to become a naturalized citizen.

“I’m relieved that Donna is finally back home with her family and look forward to supporting her in her naturalization journey, but she never should have been detained in the first place,” Duckworth said in a written statement.

During a recent interview with the Tribune, Brown had harsh words for the Trump administration.

“They sold a whole different idea than what’s actually happening. The cruelty and the nonsense that’s going on right now is just wrong,” he said. “If you watched between the first Trump presidency and now, it’s completely different. We’re trying to bully other countries and do things we shouldn’t be doing.”

Yet he stressed several times that he didn’t want to “get partisan,” noting that some immigration laws the administration’s enforcing have been on the books for years. Former President Obama, a Democrat, had been dubbed “the deporter-in-chief,” by immigration advocates, Brown correctly noted.

Since his wife’s story went viral, Brown said he’s been lambasted by liberals for voting for Trump and admonished by conservatives for criticizing the administration.

The only way to improve the country is “to stop being partisan,” Brown said, adding that he blames much of the nation’s strife on the two-party political system.

“It’s the fomentation,” he said. “When you fight with each other instead of coming up with a solution.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CTC-L-trump-voters-year10.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:17.343274

In short, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—once a structural feature meant to safeguard neutral, bipartisan adjudication—has become another point of presidential control.
In establishing the MSPB, the Senate Committee Report framed this independence as a “cornerstone” of civil service reform responsible for safeguarding the merit system.","Since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Congress has assigned primary responsibility for adjudicating federal employment disputes to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The board consists of three members appointed by the president, removable “only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” To promote impartiality, no more than two members may belong to the same political party, and the board may act only with a two-member quorum.

Because the CSRA provides a comprehensive adjudicatory regime for employment disputes, employees generally must exhaust their claims before the MSPB prior to seeking judicial review in federal court. Claims submitted to the MSPB are adjudicated initially by an administrative judge. Either the government or the employee may appeal the administrative judge’s decision to the board. Then, only after the board issues a final decision may a federal employee seek judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

The MSPB is a shell of its former self. Since President Trump’s inauguration, three developments have eroded any confidence that federal employees may have had in the MSPB’s independence and impartiality. First, in Harris v. Bessent, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that Congress may not prohibit the president from removing the MSPB’s board members, thereby upholding Trump’s removal of Chair Cathy Harris. Second, the MSPB lacked a quorum to review appeals from March to October 2025, leaving employees in procedural limbo and foreclosing the possibility of judicial review. Third, and finally, the Justice Department has argued that the MSPB is legally obligated to follow interpretations of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). If accepted, that position would permit the OLC to exert control over the MSPB’s interpretations of civil service law.

On Jan. 9, the full D.C. Circuit declined to rehear Harris v. Bessent. The decision may represent the final nail in the coffin for the MSPB’s independence. Courts should no longer pretend that the MSPB operates as Congress intended. If Congress wishes to preserve independence in the adjudication of federal employment disputes, it must act legislatively—either by creating a court dedicated to civil service law or by permitting existing courts to hear such claims.

The President’s Removal Power

At the core of the MSPB’s unraveling lies a more fundamental shift in constitutional law: the steady expansion of the presidential power over administrative agencies. For much of the modern administrative state, Congress relied on for-cause removal protections to insulate adjudicatory agencies from direct presidential control. That settlement has been under pressure for more than a decade, as the Supreme Court cast increasing doubts on Congress’s authority to limit the president’s ability to remove principal officers.

Article II of the Constitution provides that “the executive power shall be vested in a President.” In Seila Law v. CFPB, the Supreme Court held that the president must have authority to remove principal officers who wield significant executive power, so that those officers “remain accountable to the President, whose authority they wield.” At the same time, the Supreme Court preserved a limited exception for officers serving on multimember commissions that exercise quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power, consistent with its earlier decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. Oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter, however, indicated that the Court is poised to overturn—or at least substantially limit—Humphrey’s Executor.

The respective removals of Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger and MSPB Chair Harris have brought these issues squarely to the forefront for agencies that govern the civil service. Following the D.C. Circuit’s decision to stay an injunction restoring Dellinger’s position, Dellinger ended his lawsuit because he believed that his “odds of ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court are long.” Meanwhile, in Trump v. Wilcox¸ the Supreme Court stayed an order enjoining Harris’s removal, concluding that the government was likely to show that the MSPB “exercise[s] considerable executive power.” The Court declined, however, to address whether the MSPB falls within the exception for multimember commissions.

Following the Supreme Court’s order, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit held in Harris v. Bessent that removal protections for MSPB members violate Article II. Writing for the majority, Judge Gregory Katsas held that the MSPB exercises “substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers that Humphrey’s Executor deemed to be merely quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial.” The panel stitched together several different precedents to narrow sharply—if not effectively hollow out—Humphrey’s Executor. In its view, Congress may delegate neither judicial nor legislative power, and, therefore, any power exercised by agencies within the executive branch must be executive in nature. Even so-called quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, the court reasoned, are executive in nature. Accordingly, the president must have the authority to remove any principal officer exercising significant quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power because these powers are executive in nature. On this logic, the majority speculated that “Humphrey’s Executor thus governs only agencies with purely advisory functions—like, say, the United States Commission on Civil Rights.” At the same time, the majority acknowledged that—unless and until the Supreme Court finally overturns it—Humphrey’s Executor still supports Congress’s power to impose removal protections on agencies that exercise the narrowest forms of quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power.

The panel adopted an exceptionally narrow understanding of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers. Under its reasoning, only the limited and historically contingent functions expressly identified in Humphrey’s Executor—such as advising Congress or acting as a judge-like adjudicator without policymaking authority—can fall within those categories. Modern forms of administrative adjudication and rule implementation, even when long understood as quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative, are recharacterized as exercises of executive power simply because they occur within the executive branch.

Applying that framework, the D.C. Circuit panel concluded that the MSPB’s authority could not be described as plausibly quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial. Emphasizing the board’s power to regulate the removal of its administrative law judges, issue final decisions, award reinstatement and back pay, and to represent itself in litigation, the court reasoned that the MSPB exercises significant executive power that places it squarely outside the Humphrey’s Executor exception. On this view, the board’s adjudicatory function is not analogous to the restrained model contemplated in 1935 but instead reflects modern administrative governance in which adjudication is inseparable from policymaking and enforcement.

The D.C. Circuit panel’s myopic conception of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power dramatically constrains Congress’s ability to insulate agencies from presidential control. By anchoring the constitutional analysis to a limited account of the Federal Trade Commission’s power in 1935, the decision ignores that the categories of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power predated Humphrey’s Executor and were understood more broadly at the time. Although the D.C. Circuit declined to “decide whether Congress may restrict the President’s ability to remove officers with solely adjudicatory functions,” its cramped understanding of what qualifies as quasi-judicial effectively resolves the question. Modern administrative adjudication—because it involves finality, remedial discretion, and the application of broad statutory standards—will almost always be reclassified as executive power, leaving Congress with little practical ability to design independent adjudicatory bodies within the administrative state. The decision by the full D.C. Circuit not to rehear Trump v. Bessent means that any effort to restore removal protections for the MSPB must come from the Supreme Court.

Some possibility remains that the Supreme Court may ultimately retain an exception from the president’s removal power for principal officers within adjudicatory agencies. During oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter, several justices pressed the government on whether Congress retains authority to structure agencies that primarily adjudicate disputes, invoking historical examples of claims courts and other adjudicatory institutions designed to operate with independence. Those exchanges point toward a narrower—and more historically grounded—path: The Court could reject the D.C. Circuit’s efforts to collapse quasi-judicial power into the executive power, reaffirm that adjudication has long occupied a distinct constitutional space, and preserve Congress’s authority to protect principal officers who perform predominantly adjudicatory functions. Whether the Court is willing to take that path remains uncertain. But if it does not, the MSPB’s fate will stand as a warning that adjudication of federal employment disputes within the executive branch may no longer be constitutionally sustainable.

The OLC’s Efforts to Control MSPB Interpretations

The erosion of the MSPB’s independence has not occurred solely through structural attacks on removal protections for the board. It has also unfolded through a subtle campaign to subordinate the board’s legal interpretations to the Department of Justice, and ultimately to the president.

The Trump administration has advanced an expansive conception of the attorney general’s authority over legal interpretation. Although OLC opinions are binding on Cabinet departments, the OLC would not issue decisions binding independent agencies without their consent. President Trump, however, has ordered that “[t]he President and the Attorney General’s opinions of questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties,” including employees within independent agencies.

In recent filings, the Department of Justice has argued that the MSPB must obey the OLC’s precedents. In Jackler v. Department of Justice, the Justice Department argued that an OLC opinion issued in September 2025 “provides binding legal advice within the Executive Branch” and therefore must control the MSPB’s handling of constitutional questions in removal cases. The OLC’s opinion purports to overturn the MSPB’s decision in Davis-Clewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs. By the department’s account, because the OLC speaks for the executive branch, any MSPB decision inconsistent with the OLC’s interpretation “does not represent the legal position of the Executive Branch” and must be vacated or remanded. This is a striking claim. The MSPB is not a litigating component of the Justice Department, nor is it an executive department subject to the attorney general’s supervisory authority. Congress instead designed the board as an adjudicatory body meant to resolve disputes between agencies and employees—including the Justice Department itself—according to law. Treating the OLC’s views as binding on the MSPB collapses that adjudicatory function into the very chain of command whose actions the board is supposed to review.

If accepted, this model fundamentally alters the nature of MSPB adjudication. The CSRA presupposes that the MSPB will apply statutes and precedent neutrally, subject to judicial review—not that it will take direction from the OLC when the executive branch dislikes the board’s answers. Allowing the OLC to dictate legal interpretation of civil service laws deprives the MSPB of its independence and enables the OLC to construct precedents that are more favorable to agency employers. Structural removal protections matter little if the board’s legal reasoning is overridden through the Justice Department’s “guidance.” In that sense, the OLC’s asserted authority over MSPB interpretation completes the transformation already begun by attacks on removal protections: the conversion of an adjudicatory body into an instrument of presidential control.

The MSPB’s Quorum Problems

The removal power and the asserted authority to control the MSPB’s legal interpretations matter only if the board is permitted to function at all. With the expansion of the removal power, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—designed as a safeguard for deliberation and impartiality—has become a point of leverage to assert presidential control.

The MSPB can act only with a quorum of two members. When the president possesses at-will removal authority, that quorum requirement becomes fragile. By removing at least two members from the board, the president can break the agency’s quorum and halt its ability to issue decisions. As recent events illustrate, the president need not remove the entire board to paralyze it; selective removals or the refusal to fill vacancies can suffice. This dynamic converts the quorum rule from a protection of collective decision-making into a tool for preventing adjudication altogether.

The consequences for federal employees are severe. During periods without a quorum, employees can receive initial decisions from administrative judges, but if either party seeks board review, those cases stall indefinitely. In Rodriguez v. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit treated the absence of a quorum as a temporary procedural defect rather than a structural denial of adjudication, leaving employees trapped in limbo.

This problem is not hypothetical. The MSPB has a long and troubling history of lacking a quorum. From January 2017 until March 2022, the board lacked a quorum for more than five years. During that period, the MSPB was unable to issue final decisions on petitions for review, producing a roughly 3,800 case backlog and leaving thousands of employees without timely resolution of claims involving removals, suspensions, and whistleblower retaliation. Although the MSPB adopted rules in 2024 to allow limited internal actions to proceed without a quorum, those measures did not—and could not—solve the core problem. The board still may not issue final, precedential decisions on petitions for review without two members and thus cannot perform its central function during quorum lapses.

The Senate confirmed a new MSPB member in October 2025, restoring its quorum. The relatively quick restoration prevented a similar backlog that resulted from 2017 to 2022, but the quorum’s restoration underscores a deeper structural vulnerability rather than resolving it. Because the president can now remove board members at will, party-balancing requirements offer little protection. A president might remove members of the opposing party, replace them with loyalists, or leave seats vacant long enough to prevent the board from acting. Even when a quorum technically exists, the threat of removal hangs over members, and the ease with which quorums are broken ensures that the MSPB’s capacity to function depends on presidential forbearance rather than statutory design.

In short, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—once a structural feature meant to safeguard neutral, bipartisan adjudication—has become another point of presidential control. Removal authority means quorums can be destroyed at will; the exhaustion doctrine prevents employees from escaping to federal court; and repeated historical failures show that these are not isolated or accidental breakdowns. Even when quorums are restored, the combination of removal power and partisan manipulation means that the MSPB’s ability to act remains contingent and fragile. Congress designed the MSPB to be an independent adjudicator. In practice, quorum fragility has converted it into an agency that can be silenced whenever its decisions become inconvenient.

The MSPB No Longer Functions as Congress Intended

The CSRA’s channeling and exhaustion regime rests on a specific legislative bargain: Congress would strip district courts of jurisdiction over most federal employment disputes and, instead, create a separate, independent adjudicator to decide those disputes before judicial review. Congress did not simply assign cases to “an agency.” It deliberately split the original agency tasked with personnel management—the Civil Service Commission—to separate the task of managing personnel from the task of adjudicating employment disputes. It created the independent MSPB precisely to eliminate the inherent conflict of having the government’s chief personnel office also serve as the appellate review in adverse actions.

In establishing the MSPB, the Senate Committee Report framed this independence as a “cornerstone” of civil service reform responsible for safeguarding the merit system. Independence was necessary to ensure that “the Board should be insulated from the kinds of political pressures that have led to violations of merit principles in the past.” Indeed, “[a]bsent the mandate for independence of the Merit Systems Protection Board, it is unlikely that the committee would have granted the Office of Personnel Management the power it has or the latitude to delegate personnel authority to the agencies.” In other words, without the MSPB’s independence, Congress would not have created the civil service system that we have today.

Those design choices are now eviscerated. If the president can remove MSPB members at will, then the statutory features Congress had treated as safeguards—partisan balancing, staggered terms, and decisional independence—become discretionary norms that survive only as long as the White House tolerates them. The same is true of the CSRA’s broader architecture.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently underscored that Congress’s decision to channel claims away from district courts was “predicated on the existence of a functioning and independent MSPB and Special Counsel,” and remanded for fact finding on whether that premise has been undermined. Contrary to the Federal Circuit’s decision in Rodriguez, the Fourth Circuit suggested that the MSPB no longer functioned as intended because it lacked a quorum and that the government had argued that the board’s removal protections violated the separation of powers. The Fourth Circuit explained that Congress’s jurisdiction-stripping design presupposes not just a process, but one capable of “adequate and independent review,” such that if key Senate-confirmed positions “go unfilled” or if the MSPB and special counsel cannot perform their duties, “the framework of the CSRA would be thwarted” and congressional intent “defeat[ed].” In other words, exhaustion and channeling make sense only if the adjudicatory institutions Congress created actually exist as Congress designed them.

If the MSPB is no longer structurally independent—or can be disabled through at-will removals and partisan restructuring—then the CSRA’s exhaustion regime risks becoming a one-way ratchet: Employees are barred from federal court on the theory that Congress provided an adequate substitute, even when that substitute no longer provides the neutral, functioning review Congress intended. At that point, Congress faces an unavoidable choice. One option is to take adjudication out of the executive branch entirely by creating an Article I court for civil service disputes. The other is more modest but immediate: Amend the CSRA to permit covered employees to proceed directly to federal district court (or to a specialized appellate path) when the MSPB lacks a quorum, cannot act in a timely fashion, or otherwise fails to provide the independent adjudication Congress designed. This all assumes that the civil service avoids the darkest possibility: a decision from the Supreme Court that the CSRA is wholly unconstitutional. Provided the administrative state weathers that possibility, Congress will need to restore the basic bargain that animated the CSRA.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/united-states-court-of-appeals-for-the-federal-circuit-washington-dc.jpg?sfvrsn=a99fcf49_5,N,,2026-01-20 12:00:13.728713

In today’s issue:

▪ 1 year of Trump 2.0

▪ Trump’s Greenland letter sparks blowback

▪ Cassidy charts path after presidential snub

▪ Putin gets Trump invite to join Gaza board

President Trump is taking a broad view of executive authority and showing no signs of slowing down on testing his own power as he enters his second year back in office.

Trump has faced off with Congress, the courts and various states as he pushes for a stronger presidential hand in his second term. He’s also increasingly focused on exerting his influence on the world stage.

The president will mark Tuesday’s anniversary of returning to office with an interview with NewsNation’s Katie Pavlich on “Katie Pavlich Tonight” airing at 10 p.m. EST, before jetting to Davos, Switzerland, to meet with world leaders and press his foreign agenda at the World Economic Forum.

Greenland and blowback to Trump’s campaign to secure the Danish territory will be top of mind for leaders at the forum, along with the president’s push to have countries join his “Board of Peace” to implement the U.S.-brokered peace plan between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

▪ The Hill: Trump starts year with Greenland tumult.

Trump’s foreign policy moves have captured much of the attention heading into the second year of his term, with the stunning U.S. operation to capture former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro jumpstarting 2026 and surprising many people, including congressional leaders.

Democrats and some Republicans pushed back against the administration’s unilateral action and Trump’s initial suggestions the U.S. would take over Venezuela with Maduro ousted. Trump has seemingly backed off on the idea the U.S. would directly control Caracas, instead focusing more on ensuring a strong U.S.-Venezuelan relationship to gain access to the country’s large oil reserves.

But an effort for Congress to reassert its authority failed in the Senate after the White House pressured enough Republicans to back off a war powers resolution that aimed to prevent the administration from taking further military action in Venezuela. Even if it passed the Senate, it was likely dead on arrival in the House, making the resolution only symbolic.

And its failure raised more doubts about the potential for success of other war powers resolutions concerning Greenland, Colombia and Iran that some Democrats have floated.

At home, immigration enforcement is a priority for the president, and the most recent front in that battle has been Minnesota, particularly after the killing of a woman earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer.

Trump has in recent days threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to send the military to respond to ongoing protests following the killing, just the latest time he’s threatened to use the centuries-old law. And multiple reports indicate the Pentagon has ordered 1,500 active-duty troops to be ready for deployment in Minnesota.

If Trump goes through with invoking the law, it would almost certainly face legal challenges questioning his authority.

The Hill’s Rebecca Beitsch reports Trump has completely shifted the U.S. approach to immigration with the most visible enforcement effort seen in the country’s history.

The administration has also targeted many who have legal status in the country, seeking to curtail ways to lawfully enter the U.S. Democrats have argued many of these actions have been unlawful, including the administration’s deportation of some migrants without allowing them an opportunity to defend themselves against allegations of gang ties.

But Beitsch notes much of the administration’s immigration push is just beginning, as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act gave ICE a major boost in funding to expand detention capacity.

▪ The Hill: Trump’s suspension of naturalization ceremonies leaves citizens in limbo.

The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) investigations into high-profile figures are also further fueling allegations Trump is pushing his administration to go after his opponents for political reasons.

The DOJ has historically had independence and a certain amount of distance from the White House to ensure legal integrity, but Trump has at times sidelined that to specifically call for certain political opponents to face charges.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell became the latest figure to be under investigation from the DOJ, apparently concerning his congressional testimony about the cost of renovations to the Fed’s headquarters.

The DOJ is meanwhile still pursuing a case against former national security adviser John Bolton and challenging the dismissal of its cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D). Other top Democrats such as Sen. Adam Schiff (Calif.) and Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) have been referred to the DOJ for prosecution.

Trump has sought to distance himself from these probes while continuing to attack the subjects of them. But the announcement of an investigation into Powell adds to the trend of another high-profile Trump critic facing possible legal action.

The administration has also battled Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds over a video they made last year in which they urged U.S. service members to disobey unlawful orders. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), a former CIA officer, said last week she’s under federal investigation while Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has vowed to fight the Pentagon’s efforts to demote his military rank over the video.

Smart Take with Blake Burman

Trump has threatened to use the Insurrection Act to send the U.S. military to Minnesota. Ronald Vitiello, a senior adviser to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told me Monday night any action would be “conditions based.” I also asked about how long ICE could be on the ground in Minnesota. Vitiello said it could be months.

“It could be a long time. Look, this could get better immediately, if the state and local officials put their hand out and ask ICE to come into these institutions to help identify the criminal element that’s also in the country illegally and work directly with ICE to get them removed,” he said.

What’s clear is the focus on Minnesota isn’t going away anytime soon. ICE could be on the ground in a large capacity for a while, and Trump is calling for a renewed focus on the fraud in the state.

Leading the Day

GREENLAND BLOWBACK: International leaders, Democrats and some Republicans are slamming the president’s letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre tying the Nobel committee’s decision not to award him the 2025 peace prize to his ongoing push for the U.S. to acquire Greenland.

Trump in the letter questioned why Denmark has a “right of ownership” over the mineral-rich island territory. The letter was shared with multiple European ambassadors.

“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump said, according to NewsNation, The Hill’s partner outlet.

Democrats denounced Trump’s comments. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called the letter the “ramblings of a man who has lost touch with reality” and Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said the U.S. is becoming the “enemy of the free world because a pathetic man got his feelings hurt.”

Some Republicans who are more willing to criticize Trump also chimed in.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) called the letter “very embarrassing conduct.”

Former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), a sharp critic of Trump, said on the social platform X that the time has come to “move Gramps into a home” and let the “adults govern again.”

The physician to the late former Vice President Dick Cheney called for a congressional inquiry into Trump’s fitness for office in light of the letter.

Trump openly campaigned to receive the peace prize throughout last year, but the Nobel committee awarded it to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado instead.

Machado gave her prize to Trump when the two met at the White House last week, though the Nobel committee has said the award can’t be formally transferred.

Støre clarified in a statement to Bloomberg that the Norwegian government doesn’t award the Nobel Prizes.

Trump told reporters late Monday that he doesn’t care about the prize but rejected the idea that Norway doesn’t control the board.

“A very fine woman felt that I deserved it and really wanted me to have the Nobel Prize,” he said. “If anybody doesn’t think that Norway doesn’t control the Nobel Prize, they’re just getting — they have a board, but it’s controlled by Norway.”

Trump also said he doesn’t expect pushback over Greenland from European leaders heading into the World Economic Forum this week in Switzerland.

“We have to have it. They have to have this done. They can’t protect it,” he said.

Trump was active on Truth Social overnight, posting multiple notes from foreign leaders, including NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.

Macron said he and Trump are in line on Syria and can “do great things” in Iran but questioned his intentions in Greenland, according to the Trump-posted message. He offered to meet with Trump in Davos and for the two to have dinner in Paris before Trump returns to the U.S.

Rutte, meanwhile, said he would use his media engagements to highlight Trump’s work in Syria, Gaza and Ukraine and is committed to “finding a way forward” on Greenland, according to the message posted overnight.

The president also posted a mock image showing Canada, Venezuela and Greenland as part of the U.S.

Trump has ramped up his rhetoric about the U.S. acquiring Greenland in recent weeks, refusing to rule out taking it by force. He threatened several European countries, including Denmark and Norway, with a 10 percent tariff beginning Feb. 1 if Greenland isn’t ceded to the U.S.

Those tariffs would rise to 25 percent if a deal still hasn’t happened by June 1.

International officials have taken Trump’s threats seriously and have rejected the idea of the U.S. taking Greenland.

The NATO secretary-general met with Danish and Greenlandic officials Monday to discuss “collective security,” while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with members of Congress to discuss various issues, including Trump’s rhetoric on the subject.

On Monday, amid rising tensions in the region, the Colorado-based North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) clarified that activities it is conducting at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland have been long-planned and coordinated with Denmark. NORAD noted that the government of Greenland was also aware of the activities.

SHUTDOWN WATCH: Lawmakers have two weeks left to avoid a partial government shutdown but face a contentious battle over funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Congress has passed six of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the government before funding runs out Jan. 30. The House has approved an additional two-bill package to fund the State and Treasury departments, which the Senate will take up when it returns next week.

But that leaves four bills for the House to clear, and the one for DHS is expected to be heated as critics push back over ICE’s tactics. Some Democrats have signaled they wouldn’t support a bill to fund the department without reforms requiring tougher oversight of ICE.

Lawmakers could pass another continuing resolution to fund the government until they can reach a deal and stave off the second shutdown in just a few months. But timing is tight, as the Senate is out of town this week and the House will be out next week, The Hill’s Sudiksha Kochi reports.

CASSIDY PLOWS ON: Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy (R) is vowing to continue with his reelection bid but is facing the toughest challenge to his political career after Trump weighed in to encourage a primary opponent to run against him.

Trump backed Rep. Julia Letlow (R-La.) for the seat in a post on Truth Social over the weekend, calling her a “total winner” and saying she would continue to deliver for Louisiana in the Senate as she has in the House. Letlow hasn’t announced a Senate candidacy but signaled after the endorsement that she may jump in the race.

“I’m honored to have President Trump’s endorsement and trust. My mission is clear: to ensure the nation our children inherit is safer and stronger,” she wrote in a post on X. “This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver.”

The endorsement comes years after Cassidy was one of a handful of Republicans who broke with their party to vote to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial for his conduct leading up to and during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Since then, Cassidy has toed a line between criticizing and defending Trump and his administration.

Despite having cast a key vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services last year, Cassidy has become increasingly vocal criticizing Kennedy’s decisions in the role.

Cassidy already had picked up a few primary challengers, including state Treasurer John Fleming and state Sen. Blake Miguez. But Trump’s endorsement would be a critical boost for Letlow if she runs and would present an even larger obstacle for Cassidy, whose reelection chances already seemed in doubt.

Still, Cassidy expressed confidence in his ability to win.

“I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win,” he wrote on X.

Letlow has until Feb. 13 to file her candidacy if she wants to run.

DOJ WEIGHS GUN POLICY SHIFT: The DOJ is considering loosening gun regulations as it tries to boost support from Second Amendment advocates, The Washington Post reports.

Some of the changes include easing restrictions on the private sale of guns and loosening regulations around shipping firearms, people familiar with the changes told the Post. Other changes could affect the types of firearms that can be imported and making licensing fees refundable.

The exact changes and the timing of the announcement are still being finalized, according to the report.

The Post reported the back-and-forth emphasizes the DOJ’s challenges as it tries to satisfy members of Trump’s base who believe the administration hasn’t been strong enough in rolling back gun restrictions while also protecting the law enforcement abilities of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

TILLIS ‘UNTETHERED’: Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) has increasingly become a leading voice within the GOP opposing Trump’s actions after having announced he won’t run for reelection this year.

Tillis announced last summer, amid the battle over the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, that he wouldn’t run for another term. The announcement came as Trump repeatedly attacked Tillis’s opposition to the legislation, which the senator ultimately voted against.

But the past few weeks have given Tillis several opportunities to speak his mind, including on Trump’s rhetoric on Greenland, the DOJ investigation into Powell and how White House aides are advising Trump, The Hill’s Alexander Bolton reports.

Tillis told Bolton in an interview that his outspokenness isn’t a conscious choice but is a result of the administration’s actions.

“The sheer volume of things that are on the threat matrix,” Tillis said. “It sort of ramped up, but you’ve got to respond when the opportunities come up.”

But Tillis’s decision has given him an amount of freedom that few others can have.

“He’s untethered,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.

PUTIN INVITED: Russian President Vladimir Putin is among the world leaders invited to join the “Board of Peace” led by Trump to oversee the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal.

The Kremlin confirmed Monday that Putin received an invitation to join the board, and officials are studying the details of the proposal. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia hopes to contact the U.S. to clarify “all the nuances,” according to the state-run news outlet RIA Novosti.

Other countries invited to join the board include the United Kingdom, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina and India. France was invited, but French President Emmanuel Macron rejected Trump’s offer to join over the charter’s language.

The invitation for Putin comes nearly four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have been trying to reach a peace agreement to propose to Putin, a deal has remained elusive.

The Trump administration signaled last week that it is launching the second phase of the Gaza peace deal after the near-completion of the first phase. The second phase includes Hamas giving up power in Gaza and agreeing to disarm, though the militant group has given mixed messages as to whether it will follow through.

The White House announced the founding members of the board Friday. They include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, World Bank President Ajay Banga, billionaire investor Marc Rowan and U.S. deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel.

The board will become official after three member states approve the charter.

And finally … Sen. Ashley Moody (R-Fla.) is set to provide Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) with cafecitos after the Indiana Hoosiers defeated the University of Miami Hurricanes in the College Football Playoff National Championship on Monday.

Ahead of the game, Moody posted a video saying she would wager her congressional team showing up to Banks’s office with cafecitos, a Cuban espresso beverage and South Florida staple, if her Hurricanes lost. Banks responded that he would provide Moody’s office with gummy bears if the Hoosiers lost.

The bet is far from the first time members of Congress engaged in friendly wagers over their sports teams. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) wore a Philadelphia Eagles jersey on the Senate floor last year, in a bet with the two Pennsylvania senators, after his Kansas City Chiefs lost the Super Bowl.

Trump attended the game along with a few members of the administration and his family.

Phil Murphy, who made protecting immigrants a pillar of his first campaign for governor, used some of his final hours in office Tuesday to veto two sweeping bills designed to expand migrant rights.

The bills left unsigned would have written the attorney general’s 2018 Immigrant Trust Directive into law — the order restricts when local, county, and state police can aid federal immigration agents — and created new safeguards for sensitive personal data provided by New Jerseyans to hospitals, schools, and libraries can be shared.

Murphy, a Democrat who is leaving office at noon Tuesday after two terms as governor, said the codification bill had significant differences from the directive that made him fear it would attract renewed judicial scrutiny. The directive has stood up in court, including at the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, he noted.

“I am extremely concerned that signing this bill, which differs from the Immigrant Trust Directive, would open New Jersey up to a new court challenge and renewed judicial scrutiny from judges who may not render the same decision upholding these critical protections,” Murphy said. “Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop. I cannot in good conscience allow that to happen.”

Murphy added that while he supported the data privacy protection bill — he conditionally vetoed the measure after a voting session last week and sent it back to the Legislature for amendments that lawmakers then hastily agreed to — his team “discovered a drafting oversight that could create significant complications.” Because a new legislative session has started since the bill passed the Legislature, it’s too late to seek new changes to the measure.

“The bill as written could be construed to conflict with federal law and, if signed, could jeopardize billions of dollars in federal funding for critical programs that serve the people of New Jersey,” said Murphy. “I deeply wish there was sufficient time left to correct this issue, but it is not possible due to the expiration of the legislative session. Therefore, the only responsible option is to decline to act on the bill at this time.”

Immigrant advocates blasted Murphy for vetoing bills they said would provide vital protections for migrants amid a time of aggressive enforcement by the Trump administration. They have warned that a future attorney general could withdraw the directive at any moment.

The vetoes are known as pocket vetoes, meaning they aren’t being sent to the Legislature for a potential override because they were passed in the final days of a legislative session.

Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), who becomes governor at noon, declined to say on the campaign trail whether she would support legislation codifying the policy, but she did express fear, like Murphy did Tuesday, that codifying the 2018 directive would open the state up to new lawsuits.

Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, which supported the bills, said he is “deeply disappointed” with Murphy declining to sign two of them.

“In failing to sign these bills, Governor Murphy has left New Jersey without critical protections at a moment when ICE is brutalizing our communities. These bills were legally sound, politically viable, and commonsense policy. We call on Governor-elect Sherrill, her administration, and the Legislature to establish data privacy protections and ensure state and local resources are not commandeered for federal immigration enforcement – we have no time to waste,” Sinha said in a statement.

In his two terms at the helm of the state, Murphy was lauded as an ally to immigrants in New Jersey and worked closely with immigrant-focused organizations. He signed landmark bills greenlighting driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants, offering pandemic relief dollars to migrants who weren’t eligible for federal aid, and expanding in-state tuition to include undocumented college students.

In New Jersey, 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant, and more than 500,000 residents are estimated to be undocumented.

The two bills Murphy declined to sign were part of a three-bill package introduced earlier this month. Murphy signed the third, which requires the Attorney General’s Office to designate specific locations where immigration enforcement will be barred.

Murphy said he’s hopeful the Legislature will reintroduce the data privacy bill and pass an amended version“so it can be signed into law at the soonest opportunity.”

The three bills were introduced, advanced in committee, and approved by the Legislature in the final weeks of its last legislative session. They faced staunch Republican opposition.

Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) told reporters last week that he believed the governor would sign the bills, “and that’ll be the law.”

“Too many people are living in fear” of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, he said.

We don’t need to go through the entire history of every law-enforcement agency.","The United States Postal Inspection Service sometimes claims to be the oldest federal law-enforcement agency, arguing that its origin dates to 1775 when Benjamin Franklin, in his capacity as colonial postmaster general, first appointed a surveyor to audit the mail. Then in 1789, the country established both the U.S. Marshals as part of the original Judiciary Act and also a U.S. Customs Service to enforce the tariff laws that, at the time, provided the bulk of revenue.

Then in 1791, George Washington created the Park Watchmen to provide security for the under-construction capital of Washington, D.C.

The watchmen evolved into what is today the U.S. Park Police, who do not police America’s national parks (that would be the National Park Service Law Enforcement Rangers) but rather urban parks that are under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. That means the National Mall and a bunch of other parks in D.C., but also some facilities in New York and San Francisco.

After the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln created the U.S. Secret Service to combat the rising problem of counterfeiting. After William McKinley was assassinated in 1901, Congress decided that presidents needed protection, and they assigned that duty to the Secret Service.

Because the original mission of the Secret Service was to combat counterfeiting, it was housed in the Treasury Department. The Customs Service was also in the Treasury Department because its core mission was collecting taxes. And when the Justice Department decided in the early 20th century to beef up federal investigative capabilities, they chose not to expand existing federal law-enforcement agencies and instead spun up their own Bureau of Investigation, which evolved into today’s F.B.I.

We don’t need to go through the entire history of every law-enforcement agency. The point is that it is a tangled web. The different agencies have narrow scopes and are also gerrymandered in weird ways. Bank robbery is handled by the same agency as counterterrorism but a different agency from counterfeiting, which is the same agency that does presidential protection, which is a different agency from protecting federal buildings.

I don’t think this makes a ton of sense compared to the setup they have in, say, Germany where the Bundeskriminalamt does detective-type stuff and the Bundespolizei does “guys in uniforms”-type stuff and that’s it.

And I’ve always felt it would make a lot of sense to reorganize the entire federal law-enforcement apparatus into either a single U.S. Police Service or else a dual structure with a German-style split. I first wrote about this back in 2012, prompted by an unrelated federal-government-reorganization proposal.

Which is just to say that my longstanding view is that we should, in fact, abolish ICE.

A federal judge refused to block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring members of Congress to give a week’s notice before visiting immigration detention facilities.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., comes after Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she and other Minnesota lawmakers were kicked out of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Minneapolis on Saturday, Jan. 10. They were asked to leave the facility after being informed about the Trump administration rule governing lawmaker visits.

Plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress asked Cobb to intervene, but the judge ruled Monday that they used the wrong ""procedural vehicle"" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new Department of Homeland Security action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.

""The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026, memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,"" Cobb wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS ASK JUDGE TO BLOCK NOEM'S REVIVED ICE VISIT RULE, SAY DHS DEFIED COURT ORDER

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled on Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Renee Nicole Good’s death in Minneapolis, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement, according to The Associated Press.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after Reps. Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

Democracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.

""We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,"" she said in a statement to the AP.

ILHAN OMAR KICKED OUT OF ICE FACILITY AFTER DHS REQUIRES WEEK'S ADVANCE NOTICE

House Democrats asked the judge earlier this month to block the new directive from Noem requiring advance notice for congressional oversight visits to ICE detention facilities, arguing in a court filing that the policy is politically motivated and violates federal spending law and a prior court stay.

Last year, Democrats had sued to block the seven-day notice requirement, arguing that the restrictions on ICE detention centers violate Section 527, a federal spending law provision that prohibits DHS from using appropriated funds to prevent congressional access to these facilities.

In December, Cobb temporarily stayed the DHS restrictions from taking force ""[u]nless and until Defendants show that no Section 527 funds are being used for these purposes.""

Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.

""I was shaking,"" he said. ""They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

""ICE is not doing what they say they're doing,"" St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. ""They're not going after hardened criminals. They're going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.""

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn't want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him ""to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a ""targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

""The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,"" DHS said. ""The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets.""

Thao's family said in a statement that it ""categorically disputes"" the DHS account and ""strongly objects to DHS's attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.""

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS did not respond to a request from The Associated Press seeking the identities of the ""two convicted sex offenders"" or why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

Family fled Laos after helping U.S.

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao's treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's ""Secret War"" from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

""I don't feel safe at all,"" Thao said. ""What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.""

Here are the themes that have shaped his first 365 days in office.

Slashing the federal workforce and agencies

Elon Musk was initially the face of the president's vow to cut waste, fraud and abuse in government. He and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, took a chainsaw to the federal workforce through buyouts, reductions in force and shuttering offices. Those efforts resulted in the loss of more than 317,000 federal employees by November, although that was offset by 68,000 hires, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Some jobs were reinstated after court challenges.

DOGE also claimed to have cut billions in federal spending, although CBS News' analysis found the savings were a fraction of what was claimed.

Agencies that didn't align with Mr. Trump's mission were targeted for cuts or elimination, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. The president is also trying to fire nearly every employee of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing it has overstepped its mission. ""RIP CFPB,"" Musk posted on X in February. In December, a judge blocked the White House from defunding the agency.

The Trump administration is currently trying to dismantle the Education Department and transfer many of its programs to other departments, arguing that doing so will help return education decisions to states.

The attorney general has also gutted the Justice Department office that prosecuted public corruption cases.

The Trump administration announced it would eliminate 20,000 jobs from the Health and Human Services Department, about a quarter of its workforce. The cuts included 1,300 who were fired from the National Institutes of Health, as well as $2 billion in funding. Public health agencies have also slashed funding for vaccine development and mental health and addiction programs, although some cuts were reversed. The president also withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization.

Nonetheless, overall federal spending has not decreased under Mr. Trump. According to federal data analyzed by the Peterson Foundation, outlays in December 2025 were $5 billion higher than in December 2024. The national debt continues to climb.

Settling scores with political foes, targeting rivals — and rewarding allies

The Trump-era Justice Department has targeted the president's political enemies, including former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell, who helped lead the impeachment charge against him during his first time in office, have also been the targets of investigations.

Mr. Trump has denied involvement in the prosecutions, but has publicly encouraged the Justice Department to look into some of his political opponents.

The administration has also targeted six Democratic members of Congress who appeared in a video in November urging members of the military to refuse to follow ""illegal orders."" Five of the lawmakers said they had received inquiries from the Justice Department, the Pentagon has moved to demote and cut the pension of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who is a retired Navy captain.

The Federal Reserve has also fallen into the administration's crosshairs, after the president has repeatedly called on the central bank to lower interest rates. Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, said the Federal Reserve was recently served subpoenas over his testimony about renovations at the central bank's headquarters, and said the move was part of a pressure campaign. The president has also sought to fire Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, alleging she committed mortgage fraud. Cook is challenging her ouster, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case this week. Powell is expected to attend.

Over the summer, the Justice Department fired dozens of employees who worked on special counsel Jack Smith's dual investigations into Mr. Trump.

The White House also revoked the security clearances of many officials, including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, members of Biden's national security team, Bolton and other current and former national security figures.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used his pardoning power to wipe away criminal charges from allies and political figures of his choosing.. He pardoned nearly everybody charged or convicted in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot on his first day in office, and he granted clemency to Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, former GOP Rep. George Santos, former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vazquez, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojavich and former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Carrying out mass deportations and immigration enforcement

Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in history. In mid-December, the Department of Homeland Security said there had been an estimated 1.9 million self-deportations and more than 622,000 deportations up to that point. As of last week, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement held 73,000 detainees in custody, the most ever recorded. The administration aims to be able to hold upwards of 100,000 immigration detainees at any given time, as part of its effort to carry out a deportation crackdown of unprecedented proportions.

The Trump administration has signed agreements with countries to accept immigrants who are not their citizens. In addition to several Latin American countries, some that are half a world away have also agreed to accept deportees, like Eswatini,Uganda, South Sudan, Laos, Myanmar, Kosovo and Rwanda.

Apprehensions at the Southwest border are at record lows. In December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended 6,478, 96% lower than the prior year.

In March, Mr. Trump invoked wartime authority to send hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. According to a Human Rights Watch report, half had no criminal history and just eight had been convicted of violent or potentially violent crimes. One Salvadoran man who was deported and held in CECOT in error, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was returned to the U.S.; officials then filed criminal charges against him and are also trying to deport him to another country. All of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT were later flown to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap.

Under Mr. Trump, DHS has launched an immigration enforcement campaign in cities across the country, sending federal law enforcement to Charlotte, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City and Portland. Immigration raids have often been met with protests.

Clashes between authorities and civilians have turned up the temperature, most recently with an ICE officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis this month.

The president deployed National Guard troops to assist and protect federal law enforcement, drawing lawsuits. California, Illinois and Oregon sued, arguing the president was reaching beyond his authority, and judges often sided with the states. The National Guard will remain in Washington, D.C., this year, but Mr. Trump sent guard members home from other jurisdictions at the end of 2025.

Despite the extensive resources being devoted to deportations, the president told ""60 Minutes"" in November the immigration raids ""haven't gone far enough.""

Flexing American power overseas, realigning U.S. foreign policy

Some of the most consequential moves of the president's term so far have involved his willingness to exert American military power overseas and upend relations with longstanding U.S. allies.

In June, the U.S. carried out major strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in an operation called ""Operation Midnight Hammer."" Mr. Trump has recently threatened to strike the Iranian regime again over its crackdown and killing of protesters.

Amid a military buildup in Latin America, the U.S. has carried out at least 34 known strikes on boats the administration claimed were ferrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. The strikes have killed more than 120 people.

In an extraordinary and controversial military feat, U.S. forces infiltrated Venezuela and captured then-President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Mr. Trump soon announced the U.S. would be running the country and taking control of Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The U.S., the White House says, will sell the oil for the benefit of Venezuelans, Americans and U.S. oil companies.

Asserting power over Venezuela is one part of the president's ""Donroe Doctrine,"" which holds that the U.S. should wield influence over the Western Hemisphere and play less of a role in Europe's affairs.

But the president's audacious campaign to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, has sparked intense concern among NATO allies, flying in the face of modern Western democracies' rejection of imperial expansion. The president has refused to rule out the use of military force to acquire the territory, and says he'll impose tariffs on European countries objecting to his efforts — telling several countries he no longer feels ""an obligation to think purely of Peace"" because he wasn't awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The president has pushed for a resolution to the war in Ukraine, but peace efforts stalled after a high-level summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August.

The Trump administration, with the help of partners in the Middle East, brokered a long-sought ceasefire and peace deal between Israel and Hamas in October. The implementation of the agreement is still underway, but all living hostages have been returned, and the tenuous peace appears to be holding.

Reshaping economic policy, focusing on trade and a love for tariffs

Mr. Trump calls himself ""the tariff king,"" and his love for tariffs — what he's called his ""favorite word"" — has reshaped international trade and international relations. Mr. Trump insists tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars for the country, although economists say U.S. consumers will ultimately pay higher prices. Studies show that U.S. importers generally pay the tariffs, not the foreign countries.

The stock market has continued to climb under Mr. Trump, although inflation, unemployment, hiring and layoff data are a mixed bag. Nearly three in four Americans say the president isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, and just over three in four Americans say their income isn't keeping up with inflation, according to the latest CBS/YouGov poll.

New U.S tariffs on Chinese goods set the stage for a trade war between the world's largest economies over everything from computer chips and rare earth metals to soybeans and TikTok, briefly sending both countries' tariffs on each other to over 100%. Mr. Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October and struck a deal that partially defused tensions.

The president's signature economic legislation, which he calls the ""big, beautiful bill,"" extended a set of tax cuts passed in Mr. Trump's first term, partially paid for through restrictions on Medicaid and food stamps.

Pushing the limits of presidential power

Despite Republican control of both chambers of Congress, Washington has passed few pieces of major legislation, with Mr. Trump relying heavily on executive actions to accomplish his objectives. He signed 228 executive orders — not including other types of executive actions — in 2025 and the first weeks of 2026, according to the Federal Register, easily outpacing all other presidents in their first year in office.

The president's use of emergency powers to levy tariffs without approval from Congress has been challenged all the way to the Supreme Court. The justices are expected to rule soon on whether the president had the constitutional right to impose the tariffs. If the court rules he did not, the U.S. government may have to find a way to repay the levies.

The president's uses of military force without congressional approval in Syria, Iran and Venezuela — and his deployments of National Guard forces to U.S. cities — have also raised questions about constitutionality and the limits of executive power. The Supreme Court blocked a Guard deployment to Chicago last month.

After an impasse in Congress led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the White House tested the limits of its power to unilaterally move money around. It kept sending out paychecks to members of the military and FBI agents, sought to lay off thousands of idled government workers and threatened to pause food stamp payments, drawing legal challenges.

Bending institutions to his will

Another theme of Mr. Trump's presidency continues to be pushing institutions to bend to his will. The president has terminated government contracts and revoked security clearances with major law firms that represented political opponents. The American Bar Association sued over the approach, calling it a ""law firm intimidation policy."" Some firms, under pressure, reached agreements with the administration to spend millions of dollars on pro bono work.

Mr. Trump has pressed both federal agencies and private employers to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, and his administration has targeted what it views as ""woke"" initiatives in the military, business, education and other aspects of American society.

The Trump administration threatened to sue or otherwise pressured universities over their diversity and inclusion practices, pro-Palestinian campus protests or granting of in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants, cutting off funding to some schools. Columbia University settled with the administration to avoid further investigations, and Brown University, Cornell University, Northwestern University and UPenn all reached some type of agreement with the administration.

The president has also personally sued multiple news organizations over their coverage. Ahead of the inauguration, ABC News parent Disney agreed to pay $16 million to settle a defamation suit Mr. Trump brought. CBS News was also among those the president sued, and then Paramount, CBS News' parent company, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a suit over a 2024 ""60 Minutes"" interview with Kamala Harris. Neither company admitted wrongdoing.

Dealmaking with companies and countries

Rather than imposing uniform policy through legislation, the president prides himself on making deals — the more deals the better — with individual companies and nations. The tariff negotiations with different rates for various countries are a prime example of that.

The president has sought to broker individual deals with pharmaceutical companies to bring down the prices of drugs for Americans. Among the medications that could be sold direct-to-consumer at lower costs are GLP-1 weight loss drugs Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound.

The president has also unveiled deals to invest in U.S. manufacturing and infrastructure with tech giants like Apple, Meta and OpenAI as well as trading partners like South Korea and Japan — though some of the corporate investments predated Mr. Trump.

The administration sought to broker a deal for TikTok's China-based parent company to sell its American operations to U.S. investors, avoiding a legally mandated nationwide ban on the social network. It's not yet clear if the deal will be approved by Chinese officials.

Mr. Trump let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, but with a ""golden share"" that allows the president to review some major corporate decisions.

Putting his stamp on the White House and Washington, D.C.

The president has moved to make his imprint on the White House itself and Washington, D.C., as a whole, forging ahead with plans to build a large ballroom on the grounds of the executive mansion and construct a new triumphal arch to match other major monuments.

Mr. Trump demolished the East Wing of the White House in October with little warning, paving the way for his ballroom project. Architects working on the ballroom presented plans to a board that oversees construction on federal land earlier this month. The president has said the cost of the project, which has ballooned to roughly $400 million, will be covered by private donations. Some of those donations have come from firms and individuals with extensive business before the federal government.

Mr. Trump has renovated other parts of the White House, including by building a patio in the Rose Garden, installing massive new flagpoles on the grounds, redecorating the Oval Office with gold-colored furnishings and installing a ""Presidential Walk of Fame"" with photos of his predecessors — except former President Joe Biden, who is represented by an image of an autopen.

Mr. Trump has also touted plans for the construction of a triumphal arch across the Potomac River in Virginia. Mockups of the arch the president showcased in October bore the title ""Independence Arch.""

The president has also worked to affix his name to institutions around the capital. Mr. Trump's handpicked board of the Kennedy Center, Washington's premier arts venue, voted to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center, a change that would require Congress to become official.

The administration also added Mr. Trump's name to the U.S. Institute of Peace in December. The State Department said the change was meant to ""reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation's history.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/19/68da839b-011c-4506-8f0b-d4d737921bad/thumbnail/1200x630/0255f385cde8db0f2e3a9132d7381bc4/ap26016654582380.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:45.573183

Then last week the Senate cleared a package funding the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the EPA, water programs and federal science initiatives.","After the fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minneapolis this month, congressional Democrats have demanded that any new DHS funding come with conditions to crack down on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics, even as many Democratic voters call for defunding the agency.

The final compromise would keep ICE funded at $10 billion for the fiscal year that ends in September, while reducing the agency’s budget for enforcement and removal efforts. It would mandate that DHS use $20 million to outfit immigration enforcement agents with body cameras, direct the department to give officers more training on diffusing conflict while interacting with the public and provide $20 million for independent oversight of DHS detention facilities.

Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the House’s top Democratic appropriator, acknowledged that the legislation does not include some of the “broader reforms Democrats proposed,” such as preventing DHS from detaining and deporting U.S. citizens or blocking the department from using other agencies’ personnel for immigration enforcement.

“I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,” DeLauro said in a statement, adding that House Republicans have committed to holding a separate vote on DHS funding in the package. “I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency.”

Democrats note that federal cash would stop flowing to other agencies, including TSA and FEMA, if Congress allows DHS funding to lapse, while the Trump administration could continue funding ICE with the pot of $75 billion Republicans enacted for immigration enforcement through the party-line tax and spending package they enacted last summer. The other alternative — running DHS on a stopgap funding patch — would maintain the status quo for money and policy while giving the Trump administration more discretion in how to use DHS cash.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have wanted to limit the Trump administration’s ability to shift DHS funding between accounts. To accomplish that, the bill reduces the amount of money the department can transfer and suspends DHS power to shift money if the department doesn’t comply with transparency requirements.

The legislation rejects many of the funding cuts the Trump administration sought but does not substantially increase the budgets of major domestic agencies besides the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The bill includes $84.3 billion for HUD, a $7.2 billion boost that amounts to about 9 percent over the department’s current budget.

Under the package, the Education Department would receive $79 billion, a slight increase of $217 million above current funding. The Department of Health and Human Services would be funded at nearly $117 billion, a $210 million increase, while the Department of Labor would get $13.7 billion, a $65 million hike.

A cut is in store for the Department of Transportation, which would be funded at $25.1 billion, a $111 million reduction.

Tacked on to the funding package is bipartisan health care legislation that includes a crackdown on drug intermediaries known as pharmacy benefit managers, renewals of several public health programs and $4.6 billion in fiscal 2026 funding for community health centers.

The deal does not address the Obamacare subsidies that lapsed on Jan. 1, nor does it address most of the proposals in a White House health framework released last week. Most parts of the deal had a shot at becoming law in December 2024 but were torpedoed by Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

Congress has 10 days to clear the package for Trump’s signature before federal funding is set to lapse for the programs it covers, which account for more than 70 percent of the cash lawmakers approve each year to keep federal agencies running.

Because the Senate is in recess this week, the chamber will need to pass the legislation when senators return the last week of January if Congress is going to head off another funding lapse.

Within the stopgap funding patch enacted in November, lawmakers approved a full year of funding for the departments of Agriculture and Veterans Affairs, as well as the operations of Congress and the FDA. Then last week the Senate cleared a package funding the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the EPA, water programs and federal science initiatives.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F5a%2Fc2%2F1ab7a3074a46b263b0fbfd2c0be7%2Fu-s-congress-28265.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:49.418115

An Open Letter to Tech Companies

To the executives and board members of United States tech companies,

We have seen how the current administration is pressuring tech companies to limit efforts to fight the spread of mis- and disinformation, to forgo critical AI safeguards in favor of moving quickly, and to ignore the potential negative impacts your products, tools and services may have on the civil rights of your users. On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 240 organizations dedicated to protecting the rights of all people in the United States, and our Center for Civil Rights and Technology we implore you: do not capitulate to this pressure, and stay true to the values that your customers and users count on.

People are looking to you for leadership. We call on you to take this opportunity to be on the right side of history and to do what is best for not only your users, but also for the business interests that drive innovation and result in products and services that we all can trust.

Our recommendations:

As leaders shaping the future of technology, you are facing a defining moment: the rise of AI is an opportunity for the industry to flex its muscle and build new, innovative products that work for everyone. Proactively promoting principles around equity, fairness, and efficiency will help guarantee success:

Prioritize user experience: Engage in content moderation. Content moderation allows you to improve user experiences and retain advertisers. If your technology enables violence, threats, harassment, defamation, doxxing, and toxicity, your users can and will seek out alternatives to your product, and advertiser spending will follow. Likewise, if your technology empowers disinformation, deepfakes, voter suppression, and other anti-democratic and unpatriotic efforts, your users will cease to trust you and your product.

In order to be trustworthy, content moderation needs to be transparent: moderated content should always be coupled with a specific rationale. It needs to be responsive to reality, which requires an understanding of context beyond the current capabilities of AI. In order to be trustworthy, it must be done with human oversight. These humans should be employees, not contractors, and should be granted all of the respect and protections awarded to any other employee. Outsourcing content moderation to your users through crowdsourced models like Community Notes is not enough. As private companies, you have a legal right and a responsibility to your users to decide what is published on your platforms.

Prioritize user safety: Implement AI with care. Developing and deploying AI should be done thoughtfully, safely, transparently, and equitably. Adhering to these principles means monitoring AI for bias, making AI tools accessible to researchers, disclosing training data, and other reasonable efforts to minimize the black box effect. Our recently published Innovation Framework: A Civil Rights Approach to AI offers a step-by-step guide for implementing these values throughout the AI development and deployment lifecycle.

There are already countless instances of AI causing harm: biased AI systems in essential sectors – like banking, healthcare, housing, education, and justice – have resulted in people being denied mortgages, being pushed out of housing, being passed over for educational opportunities, and being wrongfully arrested. You have the power to say “no more.”

Prioritize user civil rights: Show us with actions, not words.

It may feel expedient to cooperate with the current administration to avoid retribution, but our communities have long memories, and we will remember what you do right now. Your employees will remember. Consumers will remember. Making the right decisions today will build lasting trust with your users.

Show us you’re with us with your actions, not only your words. One clear action you can take is this: Do not give this administration, or any future administration, technology or consumer data that can be weaponized against our communities. Nowhere is this clearer than with immigration enforcement, where the administration is relying on surveillance technology and consolidation of our most personal data to target and disappear our family members, friends, and neighbors. This is only possible with the proactive collaboration of companies like yours.

We also urge you to be true partners in supporting comprehensive data privacy measures that protect consumers from unwarranted intrusion and harms from companies and government alike. These actions are not only the right things to do; they are the best long-term business decisions.

Civil rights are not a constraint; they are a catalyst for sustainable growth, innovation, and widespread beneficial impact. As leaders of major tech companies, you have the power – and the opportunity – to make products that change the world for the better.

Our rationale:

The Trump administration’s push to centralize authority under the banner of “efficiency” raises serious questions about its long term intentions. With significant influence now exerted over regulatory bodies, including previously independent agencies, Congress, and the judiciary, it is not surprising that it has now turned its attention to the private sector – particularly the tech industry, which holds immense sway over public discourse, innovation, and our daily activities.

The administration’s attempts to exert authority over the tech industry is a significant development, especially since it is leveraging federal agencies like the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission to attempt to shape industry behavior in ways that harm people.

However, regulatory pressure appears to be only part of the strategy. Another dynamic is emerging, one in which companies are encouraged to seek approval or favor from the administration to avoid potential consequences and obtain federal contracts. This creates a climate of uncertainty, where alignment with political interests is becoming a prerequisite for stability. Some companies have capitulated to this pressure – not necessarily out of agreement, but out of caution. This dynamic has not been lost on the public.

It is vital that companies recognize this pattern and consider its implications in both the short and long terms. Your choices today about how your products adhere to civil rights will affect not only your users’ trust in technology, but the long-term viability of your businesses and the technology industry as a whole. You must consider the consequences, not just for your business and your autonomy, but for the broader health of the societal norms that allow your business to thrive.

For these reasons, civil rights must be a strategic priority:

Trust is the foundation of user engagement. Technology is facing heightened scrutiny as users want more transparency, fairness, and respect. The Leadership Conference’s Civil Rights Monitor and a recent Pew survey found that people are increasingly worried about AI. Safeguards around privacy, speech, and equity show users that your company is taking their concerns seriously, which builds loyalty, reduces churn, and strengthens brand reputation across diverse US communities.

Innovation depends on inclusion. Practices like minimizing risks, making equitable platforms, considering AI’s impact on marginalized communities, building representative workforces, and ensuring the technology works for all do not hinder innovation; they unlock it. Inclusion and diversity foster creative and safe environments, help to identify and mitigate harmful risks, and simply put, enable companies to build better products.

Proactive leadership drives business success. Building products that respect the rights of individuals, families, and society is not only the right thing – it is the smart thing. By embedding safeguards now, your companies will stay ahead of governments around the world that are shifting compliance standards to protect their citizens. You will avoid costly litigation and position yourselves and the United States as global leaders who set standards for others to follow. By making careful decisions on who you do business with now – and who you prioritize in divisive times – you will show your users where you stand and foster long-term success.

Let us ensure that your technologies and the way we use them reflect the values we all stand for. A better world is possible, and it is your responsibility to help humanity get there. We would welcome further discussion: please email techcenter@civilrights.org.

Monica Hopkins, Executive Director of the ACLU of the District of Columbia, said:

“The people of D.C. have faced historic onslaughts on our civil rights and liberties under the second Trump administration. Our neighborhoods have been flooded with military troops and federal agents. Exemplary federal employees have lost their jobs in a political purge. And our local democracy has been undermined by the power-grabbing president and his allies in Congress.

But We the People of D.C. will not be intimidated into silence and inaction. Since day one, people and organizations across the District have answered the call to defend democracy in our nation’s capital. Because despite the Trump administration’s attempts at fear and intimidation, every one of us in the District has rights, regardless of who we are, where we come from, or what we believe.

In this first year, the ACLU-D.C. along with our partners and brave clients, filed twelve lawsuits to defend our rights and liberties from the Trump administration. We’ve sued to stop unlawful immigration arrests because no one should live in fear of being targeted and abducted every time they walk their kids to school, head to work, or go see a doctor. We've filed lawsuits to stop other egregious abuses of power against immigrants’ rights as well. We sued to stop the administration from detaining people in inhumane conditions at the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison and deporting people without a fair process – and even with no process, as was the case for hundreds of people shipped off to a Salvadoran torture prison. We've also sued to protect the right to free speech, the right to vote, and the right to be free from discrimination.

And we are just getting started. We’re meeting year two of this administration with the full force of our organization’s 65 years of experience defending fundamental rights and liberties in our nation’s capital.

We will continue educating our communities and mounting this resistance because it’s up to all of us to defend simple and foundational principles of our democracy.”",https://www.acludc.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Press-Releases.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:54.248345

We don’t want to create warfare in the street.” A blackout by workers can send a message, Knutson said.

Organizers are urging Minnesotans not to work, shop or go to school. The Trump administration has dispatched some 3,000 federal agents to the state, in what it claims amounts to its largest enforcement operation thus far, amid a broader crackdown on immigration.

More than 2,400 people in Minnesota have been arrested in recent weeks. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot Good, 37, in Minneapolis earlier this month.

“There is an unprecedented and outrageous attack being waged against the people of Minnesota. I have never seen anything like it in my life,” said Kieran Knutson, the president of Communications Workers of America (CWA) Local 7250 in Minneapolis. “This is just an outrageous acceleration and escalation of violence toward working-class people.”

The CWA, which represents workers in the state at companies including AT&T, Activision and DirecTV, is one of several local unions organizing and supporting the planned economic blackout.

Others include Unite Here Local 17, Saint Paul Federation of Educators and Minneapolis Federation of Educators Local 59.

Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, said: “Working people, our schools and our communities are under attack. Union members are being detained commuting to and from work, tearing apart families. Parents are being forced to stay home, students held out of school, fearing for their lives, all while the employer class remains silent.”

“I think what generated the idea for this action comes out of the need to figure out what we can meaningfully do to stop it,” said Knutson. “The government in the state of Minnesota has not offered any path towards stopping these attacks, this violence.”

Knutson expressed hope that “the CEOs of all these corporations that are based in Minnesota take notice”.

Large US corporations headquartered in Minnesota include Target, Best Buy, United Healthcare and General Mills. None immediately returned requests for comment.

As the administration continues to send ICE agents to the Minnesota region, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has complained in recent days that the city’s police are outmanned and outgunned.

“Can our cops arrest them? From a legal perspective, yes,” he said during an interview on the Bulwark podcast. “From a practical perspective, to state the reality, it does get kind of hard when they drastically outnumber us, and they have bigger guns than we do. We don’t want to create warfare in the street.”

A blackout by workers can send a message, Knutson said. “Those of us in the trade union movement understand the leverage and power that our labor has, and we are going to try and use that, because really there’s nothing else left,” he told the Guardian. “The idea is that we use our collective power to show those that rule this country and those that profit off of our labor that there’s a cost to attacking our communities this way.”

Organizers held a press conference last Tuesday, outside of the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, to announce that the event, which will also include a march and rally in the city’s downtown at 2pm local time.

“On Friday, January 23, we are calling for a day of truth and freedom,” said JaNaé Bates Imari, a minister and co-executive director of the multi-faith non-profit Isaiah. “It is a day where every single Minnesotan who loves this state and this notion of truth and freedom will refuse to work, to shop, and to go to school. What we have experienced and are experiencing in the state of Minnesota is not normal.”

The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the planned economic blackout.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said: “The fact that those groups want to shut down Minnesota’s economy, which provides law-abiding American citizens an honest living, to fight for illegal alien murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, drug dealers, and terrorists says everything you need to know.”

The spokesperson reiterated the administration’s claim that Good “weaponized” her car before the shooting. This account of the incident has been disputed by local and state leaders in Minnesota, as well as by eyewitnesses. Video footage of the shooting appears to show Good’s vehicle turning away from the officer as he opened fire.

The DHS spokesperson added that “if these community and faith leaders wanted to take a stand for the vulnerable”, they would stand with federal law enforcement officers, whom the spokesperson claimed have faced a sharp increase in assaults and vehicle attacks. They did not provide evidence for this allegation.

“These men and women are moms and dads who risk their lives on a daily basis to protect innocent, law-abiding Americans from the dangerous criminal illegal aliens in their communities,” the spokesperson added.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0a5229a0c721430b47dc7f4031d75e65e30aabd/244_0_5200_4160/master/5200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=945ba541da6da6c21d4b97d27780a047",N,,2026-01-20 12:00:01.274990

We mobilized our lawyers, advocates, organizers, storytellers, and supporters to delay unconstitutional policies before they took effect, dilute their reach when full blockage wasn’t immediately possible, and defeat them through courts, public pressure, and sustained organizing.

The strategy paid off. We’re not just challenging the Trump administration’s policies — at the national and local level we're successfully thwarting their plans.

On day one, when Trump issued an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, we filed a case within two hours.

When the government began arresting non-citizen students and scholars for their speech, we moved quickly to challenge their detention and secure their release.

As Congress made multiple attempts to block access to critical health care for trans people, we worked relentlessly on the Hill to block these provisions from becoming law.

When the administration bullied ABC into suspending Jimmy Kimmel, we mobilized nearly 500 artists and entertainers and 53,000 Americans to protect free speech. Kimmel was back on air within hours of our letter becoming public.

Here at NorCal, our efforts to interrupt the incessant abuse of power by the administration have also paid off. Here are just two examples.

We filed a class action lawsuit challenging Trump policy that allowed ICE to arrest immigrants when they show up for mandatory court hearings. A federal district court in San Francisco has blocked these arrests while our lawsuit proceeds. With this ruling, people can pursue their asylum and immigration cases without fear of detention.

We filed a lawsuit against Meta (a.k.a. Facebook) to prevent turning over personal information of our client who documented ICE raids in Los Angeles. We argued that the government's subpoena violated First Amendment protections for anonymous political speech. The Department of Homeland security backed down and withdrew their subpoena.

But we know Trump and his allies will control the White House for the next three years. We can expect hundreds of executive actions as the administration doubles down on their anti-civil rights and civil liberties agenda and set the stage for the mid-terms in 2026.

Also in 2026, the Supreme Court will decide several ACLU cases — rulings that will shape the future of birthright citizenship, voting rights, and the rights of trans youth.

A YEAR OF ATTACKS AND RESILIENCE

(New York, NY) – Today marks one year since the second inauguration of President Trump, a year defined by the dramatic escalation of abusive attacks on immigrants and the rule of law. Civil society organizations like the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) have been at the forefront of the pushback to protect immigrant communities in the United States, recognizing that attacks on immigrants are attacks on all of us and indeed on democracy itself.

This year, IRAP has challenged in court the unlawful suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), the transfer to and detention of immigrants at Guantánamo Bay, the total abandonment of Afghan allies, and the attempted termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Syria and Burma. IRAP’s advocacy prevented thousands of TPS holders from being stripped of their ability to live and work legally in the United States, and secured the entry and resettlement of many already-approved refugees left in limbo by the suspension of USRAP.

The following is a statement from Sharif Aly, President of IRAP:

“A year ago today, President Trump signed an Executive Order indefinitely suspending the United States refugee program. While we have been in court ever since fighting to restore this critical lifeline for refugees fleeing violence and persecution, the government has only intensified its brutal assault on immigrants and those who support them.

The Trump administration is now subjecting refugees and immigrants living in the United States and their communities to the same kind of abuses many refugees once fled. Guided by xenophobia and racism, the Trump administration is targeting all immigrants, regardless of their legal status, deep community connections, or criminal record. This is not just an attack on immigrants; it is an attack on American communities and ideals that makes everyone less safe.

In just the last two weeks, we have been horrified to see armed ICE agents arrest and detain refugees with absolutely no claim that they have broken any law. These are dangerous times full of immense challenges, but we will not back down. IRAP will continue to fight every day for the right of every person to live in peace, safety, and dignity. Increasingly, our democracy depends on it.”

A church in Westbrook, Maine, cancelled an MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances”, according to the parish website.
At Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, where Dr King preached, there were calls on Monday to unite against injustice.","Martin Luther King Jr Day was marked with parades and services across the US on Monday. But the celebration for the achievements of the slain 60s civil rights leader was tempered by contemporary anxieties over racial and social equality and Trump administration’s crackdown in Minneapolis.

At a rally in Harlem, the Rev Al Sharpton referred to Renee Good, the 37-year-old mother of three who was killed by an immigration officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.

“If she cursed them out does that give them the right to shoot her?” he asked. “Now they’re talking about sending in the national guards, sending in more ICE agents. We are in a state that Dr King would have been fighting against this country going this far.”

Sharpton called for a broad sense of unity, saying that “if people are on our side, we can disagree without being disagreeable because we have folks that are adversarial to the interests of our community.

“We need to make a pledge on King Day that we gonna fight and make what should happen to preserve the dream of Dr King,” he added.

Zohran Mamdani, the newly installed New York City mayor, framed inequality as an economic issue at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s annual MLK Day celebration.

“While the city is wealthy beyond measure, it is also deeply unequal,” he said. “Some New Yorkers sleep in penthouses. Others sleep on the sidewalk below.

“We cannot only speak of Dr King’s legacy as if it is a legacy of rights that can be given to people,” he said. “It must also be a legacy of rights that those people can exercise themselves.”

In Washington, hundreds of people marched along Martin Luther King Jr Avenue to honor the civil rights leader.

“We got to continue to do this because not just of Dr King, but of what he stood for,” said Sam Ford, a retired broadcaster and member of the Martin Luther King Jr Day Parade Committee. “The struggle continues.”

Parade participant Harold Hunter echoed that sentiment. “It’s not just a white thing or Black thing. This is a people thing,” he said.

Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy, said elevated fears within racially diverse and immigrant communities meant that King Day observances were forced to take a more urgent tone. “We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” he said.

The Movement for Black Lives said it had planned events in Atlanta, Chicago, Oakland and other cities under the banner “Reclaim MLK Day of Action”.

“This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK’s radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement.

At the National Civil Rights museum in Memphis, Tennessee, located on the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on 4 April 1968, was opened and offering free admission, an annual tradition.

“This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” the museum president, Russell Wigginton, told the Associated Press.

But some typical MLK Day events were cancelled, including a dinner at Indiana University in Indianapolis. In a social media post, the school’s Black Student Union said the event was officially cancelled because of “budget constraints”, but the group expressed concern that the cancellation was “connected to broader political pressures”.

A church in Westbrook, Maine, cancelled an MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances”, according to the parish website. A member of the congregation’s “social justice and peace committee” told the local news site NewsCenterMaine.com that the service was cancelled because agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were in the area.

This year’s Dr King celebration comes a year since Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term.

Trump’s inauguration ushered in an administration opposed to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, whether in government agencies, schools, universities or cultural institutions.

The justice department’s civil rights division, which under previous administrations has been charged with rooting out discrimination against minority groups, has shifted focus.

In comments to the New York Times this month, Trump said civil rights protections and affirmative action programs had hurt white people. “White people were very badly treated, where they did extremely well and they were not invited to go into a university or a college,” he said.

Meanwhile, the administration has launched aggressive anti-immigration operations in several Democratic-led cities.

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, told the Associated Press that the Trump administration’s priorities made clear it is actively trying to erase the movement for social justice.

Citing healthcare access, affordable housing, good-paying jobs and union representation, Wiley said, “things Dr King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture”.

Last month, the National Park Service said it would no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but would instead offer free admission on Flag Day – 14 June. That day is also Trump’s birthday.

At Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, where Dr King preached, there were calls on Monday to unite against injustice. Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Ebenezer’s senior pastor, said the administration was “trying to weaponize despair and convince us that we are at war with one another”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8b3c03f813d72e3416f8b7c33bd615ad0ca7fd8/0_0_4167_3335/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=72ef2ffbcef3243e228749ea953b3a28",N,,2026-01-20 11:59:09.291631

GREENLAND

In a late-night flurry of posts to his Truth Social account, President Donald Trump doubled down on his threats to take Greenland and said he would meet with European leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland to talk about the spiraling crisis. He is expected to arrive at the Forum on Wednesday. In one of his posts, he said he’d told NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, “Greenland is imperative for National and World security. There can be no going back.” Trump also posted at 12:58 a.m. an AI-generated image of himself in the Oval Office with European leaders and displaying a map where the United States, Canada, and Greenland are covered in the American flag. The Financial Times reports; Michel Rose and Stine Jacobsen report for Reuters.

During his social media spree, Trump also posted screenshots of private messages he’d received from world leaders over Greenland, including one from French President Emmanuel Macron that read, “I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.” CNN reports.

Trump also criticized the United Kingdom’s decision to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a deal his administration previously supported, calling it an act of “great stupidity.” He said it was another reason the United States needed to acquire Greenland. Haley Ott for ABC News.

Over the weekend, Trump continued to push for American control of Greenland, risking damaging relations with Europe beyond the point of repair. Following Trump’s threats of economic coercion and military invasion of a NATO ally, “Veteran observers of European politics said the alliance between Europe and the United States that formed in the aftermath of World War II had already been fundamentally altered,” Michael D. Shear reports for the New York Times.

On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that if the United States did not get a deal to buy Greenland, he would first impose a 10 percent tariff “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America,” from a certain group of European countries in February. He threatened to raise the rate to 25 percent in June. The threats upended months of trade negotiations between the United States and Europe. Adam Gabbatt, Robert Mackey, and Callum Jones for The Guardian.

In response, European capitals are considering hitting the United States with €93 billion in tariffs. “The retaliation measures are being drawn up to give European leaders leverage in pivotal meetings with the US president at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, officials involved in the preparations said.” Henry Foy and Mercedes Ruehl report for the Financial Times.

In a text message to Norway’s prime minister Trump said that because he was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace,” and therefore was pursuing the “Complete and Total Control of Greenland” in the interests of the United States. The text was forwarded by the White House to multiple European ambassadors in Washington. Geir Moulson and Jill Lawless report for the Associated Press.

Following a weekend of escalating U.S. threats, Denmark deployed additional troops to Greenland on Monday. Richard Milne, Henry Foy, Barbara Moens, and George Parker report for the Financial Times.

Over the weekend, thousands of people marched in Copenhagen to protest Trump’s escalating threats. “The crowd, waving Greenlandic flags, chanted ‘Greenland is not for sale.’ Many demonstrators wore red hats in Trump’s own ‘Make America great again’ fashion that read, ‘Make America go away.’” Barbara Sprunt for NPR.

A small European troop deployment to Greenland last week for an Arctic security exercise was viewed by some European officials as having been misread in Washington and as helping spur Trump’s retaliatory rhetoric and tariff threats, the Financial Times reported, citing officials and diplomats. The move was framed as a show of solidarity with Denmark and an “Arctic security” signal, but some diplomats said the messaging was too subtle or too easily misconstrued, while others doubted any reframing would have changed Trump’s response. Charles Clover, Richard Milne, and Amy Kazmin report.

TRUMP’S “BOARD OF PEACE”

When it brokered a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, the Trump administration announced that a “Board of Peace” would oversee the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip, but it became clear over the weekend that Trump intends it to have a more ambitious mandate, “potentially rivaling the United Nations in what would be a major upheaval to the post-World War II international order,” reports Matthew Lee for the Associated Press.

The Times of Israel published the full text of the board’s charter, which it says “was attached to the invitations sent out to dozens of world leaders who were asked to join Trump on the panel tasked with overseeing the postwar management of Gaza.”

Trump has named himself chair of the international organization and given himself veto power. He has invited world leaders to join the board, telling them if they pay $1 billion, they can secure a permanent seat while those countries that do not pay will have a three-year membership. “On Friday, Trump announced seven members on a founding executive board, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and former British prime minister Tony Blair. Three others include World Bank President Ajay Banga, deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel and billionaire private equity chief Marc Rowan.” Lauren Kaori Gurley and Michael Birnbaum report for the Washington Post.

France rejected Trump’s offer to join the “Board of Peace” and Trump responded on Monday by threatening a 200 percent tariff on French wine. The statement from the office of French President Emmanuel Macron said the board’s charter “goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.” Clea Caulcutt for POLITICO.

Trump invited Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping to join the Board of Peace. “Later on Monday, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said President Alexander Lukashenko also received an invitation to join the board.” Ivana Kottasová and Anna Chernova for CNN; Bloomberg reports.

Israel has also been invited, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters, though it was not immediately clear whether Israel has accepted. Reuters reports.

Trump wants to hold a signing ceremony for the Board of Peace this week at Davos, which, along with the crisis over Greenland, is “transforming this week’s annual gathering of the global elite into an emergency diplomatic summit.” Cat Zakrzewski and Emily Davies report for the Washington Post.

MINNESOTA

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz mobilized the state’s National Guard on Saturday to support local law enforcement and emergency agencies as protests continue in Minneapolis over federal immigration enforcement, though troops have not been deployed to city streets and remain “staged and ready to respond.” Guard units have been pictured preparing equipment and are expected to assist with public safety and protection of peaceful assembly should conditions deteriorate. Holly Yan, Hanna Park, Sydney Bishop, Zoe Sottile report for CNN.

Up to 1,500 active-duty U.S. soldiers, primarily from two infantry battalions of the Alaska-based 11th Airborne Division, have been placed on prepare-to-deploy orders for a possible mission to Minnesota, the Pentagon confirmed to reporters, though no decision has been made on whether the troops will actually be sent. Konstantin Toropin reports for the Associated Press.

The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over whether their public statements unlawfully impeded federal immigration enforcement, with grand jury subpoenas issued as part of the probe but not yet received by either office, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials said the investigation is proceeding under a rarely used Civil War–era obstruction statute, based on a theory that state and local leaders conspired to interfere with federal agents. NBC News reported the statute was highlighted in a recent memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi that outlined legal tools prosecutors could use to pursue cases against individuals the administration has described as domestic extremists. Ryan J. Reilly and Peter Alexander report for NBC News.

On Friday, a federal judge in Minneapolis ordered ICE agents and other immigration officials to stop using excessive force against protesters while conducting their operations in the city. The judge’s order included detailed accounts of how ICE agents are treating people in the city: “A protester detained, her bra removed and wedding ring cut off, and some of her clothes never returned. The ‘gratuitous deployment’ of pepper spray. A couple’s car surrounded by agents, who pointed semiautomatic weapons at them at close range.” Stephanie Saul reports for the New York Times.

On Monday, the Trump administration said it was appealing the judge’s preliminary injunction. Mitch Smith for the New York Times.

The Justice Department is also asking the court to allow its surge of ICE agents in Minnesota to continue after a lawsuit was filed last week by state and local officials claiming that the deployment was unconstitutional. Minnesota had pushed for the federal judge to immediately block the deployment of 3,000 federal agents but she made no rulings last week. Mitch Smith reports for the New York Times.

Multiple attorneys say people being detained during ICE operations in Minnesota are being denied the constitutional right to see an attorney by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “Four attorneys told ABC News they have been denied access to their clients at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, where they are being held,” Matt Rivers, Janice McDonald, and Armando Garcia report.

The FBI determined shortly after Renée Good’s killing that “sufficient grounds existed to open a civil rights probe into the actions of Jonathan Ross, the officer who shot Good.” The Justice Department says no such investigation exists. Perry Stein reports for the Washington Post.

Protesters interrupted a church service in St. Paul, MN, on Sunday. Protesters chanted outside a church where one of its pastors appears to also be the acting director of ICE’s field office for enforcement and removal operations in St. Paul, Lauren McCarthy, Maia Coleman, and Emily Cochrane report for the New York Times.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will investigate Sunday’s church protest, officials said. Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon cited violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Andy Rose and Elise Hammond report for CNN.

IRAN

Iran’s judiciary signaled Sunday that some people involved in the recent unrest could still face execution, despite Trump’s suggestion otherwise. Judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said certain protest-linked conduct is being treated as “moharebeh,” or “waging war against God,” an offense that can carry the death penalty, and warned the cases would be “quickly prosecuted and punished.” He also said anyone who “collaborates with the enemy” during unrest would be punished under “clear” legal provisions. Billy Stockwell reports for CNN.

Iranian protester Erfan Soltani remains alive and in good physical health after fears he would be executed on Wednesday, a relative and a human rights group said. CNN.

A senior Iranian official confirmed the death toll from last week’s protests has topped 5,000, including about 500 members of the security forces, with some of the deadliest unrest in Iran’s Kurdish northwest. Reuters reports.

SYRIA

After several days of clashes, Syria’s government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) reached a ceasefire agreement on Sunday, with President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi agreeing that the SDF would pull back from key Arab-majority areas including Raqqa and Deir al-Zor. The deal also contemplates the SDF’s integration into Syria’s armed forces and the handover to Damascus of oil and gas sites, border crossings, and detention facilities holding Islamic State suspects. The Associated Press reports.

Turkish officials said Monday that the agreement’s terms to cede territory to Damascus could clear Ankara’s main impediment to restarting Turkey’s stalled peace process with the PKK, the Kurdish separatist group. Reuters.

An unknown number of Islamic State (IS) detainees escaped from Shaddadi prison in Syria’s Hasaka region amid renewed fighting around the detention facilities in the northeast and a security breakdown that left control of the site contested, with Damascus and the SDF trading blame over how control was lost. The SDF said the prison—one of three the SDF controls in the Hasakah region—came under repeated assault by “Damascus factions” and that its forces repelled the attackers several times before temporarily losing control, adding that several of its fighters were killed and more than a dozen others wounded. Ghaith Alsayed for the Associated Press.

Syrian authorities said around 120 IS detainees escaped from Shaddadi prison, adding that government forces moved into the area after the breakout and had recaptured 81 during sweep operations, with searches ongoing. Kurdish outlet Rudaw, citing an SDF spokesperson, put the number far higher—around 1,500 escapees. Reuters.

The SDF said it made repeated appeals to a nearby U.S.-led coalition base for assistance during the assault on Shaddadi prison by “Damascus factions,” but that the coalition did not intervene. The SDF added that dozens of its fighters were killed or wounded while defending the facility. Reuters.

U.S. Central Command said a U.S. strike in northwest Syria on Friday killed an Al Qaeda affiliate leader, Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, whom it described as “an experienced terrorist leader.” CENTCOM said al-Jasim helped plan attacks and was directly linked to the ISIS gunman who carried out the Dec. 13 ambush near Palmyra that killed two U.S. service members and an American interpreter and wounded other U.S. and Syrian personnel. ​​Marlene Lenthang reports for NBC News.

TARIFFS AND OTHER U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

If the Supreme Court rejects the legal foundation for Trump’s tariff program, the administration would move “the next day” to reimpose similar levies under other authorities, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said. In a Jan. 15 interview, Greer said the White House has “a lot of different options.” Ana Swanson for the New York Times.

U.S. consumers and importers paid about 96 per cent of the cost of last year’s U.S. tariff increases, with foreign exporters absorbing only about 4 per cent through lower prices, new research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy found—cutting against Trump’s repeated claim that foreigners are footing the bill. Using roughly $4 trillion in shipment data from between Jan. 2024 and Nov. 2025, the researchers also found that after surprise tariff hikes on Brazil and India in August 2025, exporters largely did not cut unit prices to offset the tariffs, instead shipping less to the United States, pointing to higher U.S. prices over time and reduced export volumes rather than “foreign-paid” tariffs. Tom Fairless reports for the Wall Street Journal.

The National Guard will remain deployed in Washington, D.C., through 2026. About 2,400 troops are currently stationed in the city and they are mostly from Republican-controlled states. Steven Beynon reports for ABC News.

The three highest-ranking U.S. Catholic archbishops said Monday that recent U.S. actions on Venezuela, Ukraine, and Greenland raise “basic questions about the use of military force” and have put America’s moral role “under examination.” Michelle Boorstein and Anthony Faiola report for the Washington Post.

Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley emailed immigration judges instructing them that they are not bound by federal court rulings requiring bond-hearing eligibility for many detainees, according to documents the ACLU of Massachusetts filed with a Boston federal court Friday. The ACLU said the directive shows a deliberate effort to disregard those rulings, with a hearing scheduled for today. Reuters reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A D.C. federal judge declined to pause the administration’s new seven-day notice requirement for congressional visits to ICE detention facilities, explaining in a Monday order that the policy constitutes a new agency action not covered by her prior ruling and that the lawmakers raised the challenge through the wrong procedural mechanism. Michael Kunzelman reports for the Associated Press.

According to an international coalition of lawyers’ groups, it is now dangerous to be a lawyer in the United States. “The Day of the Endangered Lawyer, an annual event to raise awareness of risks to members of the profession, has in recent years picked Belarus, Iran and Afghanistan as its subject. For 2026, it has chosen the US.” Kaye Wiggins for the Financial Times.
