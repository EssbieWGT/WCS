Last week, the Department of Homeland Security issued one of its most sweeping restrictions on immigration to date, ordering a pause of all immigration applications from nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and 16 other so-called “high risk” countries.

The new directive to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — issued in the wake of the fatal shooting in Washington, D.C., of two National Guardsmen, allegedly by an Afghan man — affects everything from green card applications to citizenship ceremonies for individuals from the 19 countries. The policy also paused all pending asylum claims, regardless of the applicant’s country of origin.

In the statement, Salazar — one of only a few Cuban Americans in Congress — said the new policy amounted to “collective punishment” of “the innocent for the sins of the guilty.”

“Freezing asylum, green card, and citizenship processes is not the answer. It punishes hardworking, law-abiding immigrants who followed every step of the legal process,” said Salazar, who has advocated for compassionate immigration policies as Trump pursues his mass-deportation agenda. “That is unfair, un-American, and it goes against everything this country stands for. Background checks already exist to stop terrorists and they should.”

Salazar’s strongly worded statement — which also mentioned how thousands of immigrants in South Florida who applied legally and “waited their turn” would be affected — was more critical of the Trump administration than a joint statement released Wednesday by Miami’s two other Republican members of congress, U.S. Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Carlos Gimenez.

In their statement, the Cuban-American lawmakers blamed former President Joe Biden for the change in immigration policy, describing it as the aftermath of his administration’s “reckless abandonment of border security and its systematic failure to properly vet nearly 10 million people...”

“For four years, our urgent warnings ... about the consequences of the Biden Administration’s grotesquely irresponsible open-border policies and non-existent vetting were ignored,” the joint statement said. “Today, we are unfortunately dealing with the consequences.”

Diaz-Balart and Gimenez called Trump’s immigration efforts part of “protecting national security by restoring order, enforcing the rule of law, and strengthening vetting.”

Rising concern in Miami

The new DHS policy has created anxiety in South Florida, home to many immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean who are already coping with years-long backlogs for asylum interviews, green cards and naturalization ceremonies, immigration attorneys told the Herald.

Over a million people from Cuba, Venezuela and Haiti lost legal protections when Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole established under the Biden administration were ended earlier this year. Many have sought to remain in the U.S. by applying for asylum, or in the case of Cubans, adjusting their status under the Cuban Adjustment Act, which allows them to become a permanent U.S. resident after being in the country for a year and one day.

South Floridians from Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela expecting to become U.S. citizens this week learned instead that their naturalization ceremonies had been canceled after the announcement, according to multiple immigration attorneys.

With the recent announcement, all now find themselves once more in legal limbo.

The 176-page report from Humans for Rights Network, includes contributions from 17 refugee and human rights organisations operating in northern France and six in the UK.
The report calls for a statutory inquiry into the increase in deaths and violence, along with the establishment of safe routes.
In 2024, there were a record 89 deaths recorded of people trying to cross the Channel.
Lily MacTaggart from Humans for Rights Network said: “The violence at the UK-France border is endemic, causing acute emotional distress and significant damage to people’s health.","The UK’s policy to stop asylum seekers from crossing the Channel in small boats has led to an increase in violence, deaths and smuggler control, but has not deterred arrivals, according to a report by human rights organisations.

The 176-page report from Humans for Rights Network, includes contributions from 17 refugee and human rights organisations operating in northern France and six in the UK.

It details the use of rubber bullets and teargas by French police, who have been given hundreds of millions of pounds by the UK to secure the UK border, along with testimonies from asylum seekers and professionals including doctors who treat those trying to reach UK.

The report was shared with the Home Office, which did not comment on the content, instead describing the number of small boat crossings as “shameful”.

It follows a report from the Mixed Migration Centre of the Danish Refugee Council, which has found that hardline migration policies are fuelling people smuggling.

Despite the money spent by the UK government to prevent crossings, they remain at a high level.

So far this year, more than 39,000 people have crossed the Channel in dinghies, which is an increase on last year’s total of about 37,000 but not as high as the 2022 record of 46,000.

The report calls for a statutory inquiry into the increase in deaths and violence, along with the establishment of safe routes.

“This investigation should seek to establish how UK funding contributed to the increase in violence including the rise in the power of smugglers in response to heightened security and lack of safe routes,” the report states.

It adds: “Reinforced securitisation does not operate as a deterrent but instead makes it increasingly dangerous for people to cross the border.”

According to the report in 2024, the organisation Human Rights Observers documented 28 violent police operations targeting transport networks used by asylum seekers in northern France resulting in at least 44 arrests.

The organisation observed more than 800 evictions of living sites affecting at least 16,365 people.

The French association Utopia 56 found that between March and September 2025, 680 people were affected by police violence in northern France at times when they were not attempting to cross the Channel. In 2024, there were a record 89 deaths recorded of people trying to cross the Channel.

An increase in violence by the people smugglers, who routinely carry guns, is documented in the report, with at least four people shot dead in and around a camp in Dunkirk so far in 2025. One 16-year-old autistic boy had a gun held to his head by smugglers.

“By allowing smuggling networks to decide who is and isn’t allowed to cross, the UK and French governments have handed over the fundamental right of access to asylum to these organised criminal networks,” the report states.

The charity Médecins du Monde said that 88% of the medical treatment it provided was for conditions linked to people’s poor living conditions.

One doctor from a clinic in Calais which treats people waiting to cross the Channel said that fuel burns from dinghy engines were not uncommon, particularly to lower legs and feet, resulting in some people’s feet being “macerated” inside their shoes, particularly when they had to walk long distances after a failed crossing attempt.

Lily MacTaggart from Humans for Rights Network said: “The violence at the UK-France border is endemic, causing acute emotional distress and significant damage to people’s health.

“The UK and France are both responsible for funding this violence, implementing policies which abuse human rights and in some cases have caused death.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The number of small boat crossings is shameful and the British people deserve better.

“France remains a critical partner in securing our borders, and our joint work has already prevented over 21,000 crossing attempts so far this year. Thanks to our landmark deal, people crossing in small boats can now also be detained and removed.”

France’s interior ministry was approached for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc1f1328ad1f3a8de266d36727c46183715f0e0/720_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1678352c7ad2297b4959be00da594b80",N,,2025-12-07 19:57:15.162136

He and his father, Fei Zheng, were detained at what they believed was a routine check-in on Nov. 26.
Mr. Zheng told federal agents that he had come to America because he was afraid of being tortured in his native China.
Mr. Zheng does not have a criminal history, according to government records.
ICE tried to get Mr. Zheng on a China-bound plane again in October, but again he refused, documents show.","Hundreds of people gathered at a Queens playground on Sunday to protest the federal government’s forced separation of a 6-year-old migrant boy from his father after the two were arrested last month amid President Trump’s deportation crackdown.

The boy, Yuanxin Zheng, is among the youngest migrants to be stripped from a parent by federal immigration authorities in New York City since the crackdown began. He and his father, Fei Zheng, were detained at what they believed was a routine check-in on Nov. 26.

Yuanxin was enrolled at Public School 166 in Astoria at the time, and some of those who came out in the chilly sunshine to join the rally, at the playground on 35th Avenue, had a connection to the school.

Camille Hlavka, who helped organize the event, has a 6-year-old son who attends the school.

“Taking children from their families is not normal,” Ms. Hlavka told the crowd. “It is cruelty. It doesn’t matter if it’s one child, it doesn’t matter if it’s a child you know. This is a human being, and he is being traumatized.”

Addressing the demonstrators, Sam Rasiotis, whose 6-year-old son also attends P.S. 166, condemned the Trump administration’s actions as antithetical to the ideals of a country shaped by waves of immigrants.

“Many of us can trace back our roots several generations, and some of those generations were persecuted and mistreated when they came to this country, to the city,” Mr. Rasiotis, a union organizer, said. “But here we are again. I never thought my son’s generation would face such barbarism.”

Government records show that after Mr. Zheng failed to comply with an order to leave the country, he and his son were separated, in line with a Trump administration tactic meant to pressure undocumented immigrants to follow such orders.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency arrested at least 140 children in the New York City area since Mr. Trump’s second term began in January through mid-October, according to federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California, Berkeley. More than 2,600 were arrested nationwide in that time.

Mr. Zheng and Yuanxin were initially taken into custody in April after they entered the United States illegally via Mexico and were discovered by a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Dulzura, Calif., according to federal documents. Mr. Zheng told federal agents that he had come to America because he was afraid of being tortured in his native China.

Immigration officials ruled that his fear was not credible, and an immigration judge affirmed the determination. Mr. Zheng does not have a criminal history, according to government records.

He and his son had been in and out of detention at least twice before being taken into custody last month at ICE’s New York City offices at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, according to government records and Mr. Zheng’s lawyer.

The lawyer, Mike Gao, said his client had refused to board an ICE flight to China in September because he feared government retribution there. ICE tried to get Mr. Zheng on a China-bound plane again in October, but again he refused, documents show.

Federal officials want to deport Mr. Zheng and his son together later this month, according to records that indicate the government plans to reunite them for a flight to China.

In a statement last week, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman emphasized that migrant parents had the option of leaving the country with their children and that Mr. Zheng had been “given a lawful order of removal as a family unit.”

As of last week, Mr. Zheng was at an adult detention center in Orange County, N.Y., and Yuanxin was being transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which holds unaccompanied immigrant children, according to federal documents.

“We understand that Yuanxin is safe, but he is being held somewhere where nobody who knows him or cares about him can see him or give him a hug and make him feel safe,” Devora Fein, a leader of the western Queens chapter of Indivisible, the anti-Trump group that organized the rally, told the crowd. “He is not the only one.”

Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, who is facing trial on a federal misdemeanor charge after a standoff with immigration agents at 26 Federal Plaza, discussed his own case and how it tied into Yuanxin’s.

“We’re not going to let ICE or Donald Trump or anyone else separate us or divide us from each other,” Mr. Lander, a Democrat, said.

Among those in the crowd was William McKernan, a 17-year-old high school student who lives in Astoria and attended P.S. 166.

“Kids shouldn’t be kidnapped,” he said. “I used to go to 166 and want to show up because I hate seeing this happen in my neighborhood, in my school and in my country.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/07/multimedia/07met-child-rally-gkbp/07met-child-rally-gkbp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 20:57:03.433045

None of the five sheriffs’ offices named in the lawsuit immediately responded to requests for comment.
“We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement.” Related","The Wisconsin Supreme Court has agreed to hear a lawsuit challenging five Wisconsin sheriffs’ practices of holding detainees in their jail for handoffs to ICE.

The ACLU filed the lawsuit in September on behalf of the Milwaukee-based immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera. It names sheriff’s offices in Brown, Kenosha, Marathon, Sauk and Walworth counties as respondents.

All five sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers — nonbinding requests that a law enforcement agency assist ICE in taking custody of a person suspected of being in the country illegally by holding an inmate in a jail up to 48 hours past the person’s scheduled release. The local law enforcement agency can then pass the detainee directly to ICE officers.

The lawsuit argues that the detainers qualify as an arrest and that state statutes prohibit law enforcement agencies from making arrests based on ICE’s administrative warrants.

While most Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers, the lawsuit claims that five named offices received roughly a quarter of all detainers issued to Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices between January and July of this year.

The sheriff’s offices have differing relationships with ICE. Brown and Sauk counties, for instance, also contract with ICE to hold immigrant detainees in their jails, meaning a person could remain in the same jail after entering ICE custody. Kenosha County has no such contract, but it does participate in a federal grant program that partially reimburses local law enforcement agencies for incarceration costs in exchange for data on undocumented inmates.

ICE records list more than 130 arrests at county jails in Wisconsin between January and July of this year. Nearly 40% of those arrested were awaiting a ruling in their first criminal case. Only one of those arrests took place in the Milwaukee County House of Corrections. ICE agents have arrested at least four people at the Milwaukee County Courthouse since April.

In its initial petition, Voces de la Frontera urged the Supreme Court to immediately take up the case as a statewide concern. The court’s order, published on Wednesday afternoon, allows the plaintiffs to skip the lower courts entirely.

Liberal justices have a 4-3 majority on the court. At least four unnamed justices voted to immediately accept the case. Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley, both conservatives, dissented. Justice Brian Hagedorn, who often votes with conservatives, discussed the process in an opinion that did not specify his vote.

“When this court grants review in a case, we almost always let our grant order proceed without comment or dissent,” he wrote, later adding: “Even if some of my colleagues publicly record their dissent, as in this case, that does not necessarily reveal which justices voted for or against the petition in closed conference.”

Voces de la Frontera has 30 days to file a brief in the case. The court has not yet scheduled oral arguments in the case.

None of the five sheriffs’ offices named in the lawsuit immediately responded to requests for comment.

“We are reviewing the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s order and evaluating our next steps in this litigation,” Milwaukee attorney Sam Hall, who is representing all five sheriffs, wrote in an email Wednesday evening. “We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement.”

In November, the commission filed a suit in Kennebec County Superior Court against five school districts — MSAD 70 in Hodgdon, RSU 24 in Sullivan, RSU 73 in Livermore Falls, the Baileyville School Department, and the Richmond School Department. The commission argued their newly adopted policies prevent transgender students from using restrooms or participating in sports teams aligned with their gender identity — a violation of the Maine Human Rights Act.

The complaint notes that Richmond approved a policy in October requiring students to use facilities and participate in sports based on ""biological sex.""

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) condemned the Trump administration as she alleged Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers released an ""attack dog"" on one of her constituents.

Wilmer Toledo-Martinez was lured out of his home in Vancouver on Nov. 14, Murray said, before he was ""violently attacked and dragged away.""

The senator said Toledo-Martinez was attacked despite not resisting arrest or attempting to flee. His wife and two young children, ages two and three, witnessed the attack.

A good friend of Toledo-Martinez watched the situation unfold outside of their apartment complex.

""They sicced the dog on him; had him on the ground, hitting him,"" John Williams Sr. said.

KATU News reached out to the man's attorney and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), awaiting response.

Sen. Murray criticized the broader deportation policies under former President Donald Trump, stating, ""Trump is not going after violent criminals or the worst of the worst—he is terrorizing everyone, including U.S. citizens and their loved ones.""

She continued, ""I do not want to live in an America where federal agents can sic attack dogs on peaceful residents with impunity and face no consequences.""

Neighbors of Toledo-Martinez said his detainment has rocked the community.

""Me and my wife the other night, we were sitting on the couch, and we were shocked and awed, almost in tears just seeing, you know, a neighbor of ours being attacked, you know? Just lured outside against his own will,"" Pierce Stevens said.

Murray emphasized for Toledo-Martinez to be released from the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, citing a lack of criminal convictions and urgent medical needs.

According to Toledo-Martinez's attorney, ICE agents lured him out of his home under false pretenses, leading to the attack. His attorney discussed the case with Don Lemon on his YouTube channel on Dec. 5.

""[ICE agents] lied to him, lured him outside, and then sicced a dog on him for no reason,"" Stevens said.

He went on to say, ""It's just not right; sickening, honestly. At the end of the day, these guys should be trained properly. You shouldn't have to lie or manipulate.""

'Or he's gonna get bit again'

A video taken by Toledo-Martinez's wife, shared via Sen. Murray, showed a man wearing a construction high-visibility vest while arresting Toledo-Martinez.

Another man wearing a badge around his neck is seen holding back a large dog. Someone is heard saying ""you need to back up...or he's gonna get bit again.""

The man in the vest is also heard saying, ""we are federal agents from Homeland Security,"" and that they will take Toledo-Martinez to be seen ""for medical attention"" at the ICE facility in Portland, after his wife asked if they will take him to a hospital.

Toledo-Martinez's attorney stated that the officers involved in his arrest did not wear body cameras.

After being mauled, Toledo-Martinez was denied medical care for hours, Murray and his attorney said, eventually receiving stitches and medication at a hospital. However, he reported difficulties in obtaining adequate medical care during his detention.

Toledo-Martinez, who is undocumented, was brought to the U.S. at age 15 and is married to a U.S. citizen with three U.S.-born children.

Williams Sr. told KATU News he's been driving Toledo-Martinez's family back and forth from Vancouver to the ICE facility in Tacoma, continuing to fight for his release.

""It's hard on the kids to watch them break down,"" Williams Sr. said. ""When I go see him there with the kids, I have to sit right outside to get out of there, because I can't stand to see his kids breaking down like that. They're strong.""

""A lot of people don't know the full story of what's going on right now, and there's a lot of innocent people being taken advantage of and not given their rights,"" Stevens said.

Referring to Trump’s “Make America great again” slogan, Greene told the 60 Minutes correspondent that those Republicans at that point “decided to put on a Maga hat for the first time”.

Greene was once a staunch Trump ally who has split with the president and is leaving Congress in January. Trump has called her a “traitor” and attacked her online, prompting what she says is a wave of threats against her.

In posts on Sunday on X, Greene said she has reported hundreds of threats to the US Capitol police. She added that first those threats came from those who opposed Trump on the US’s political left. But then, she said, threats were aimed at her and her son when she opposed Trump on his handling of files pertaining to the prosecution of the president’s former friend Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and disgraced financier.

Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor and died by suicide while jailed on federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019, during Trump’s first presidency.

“All of the death threats came from the ‘left’ until I stood with the Epstein Survivors, woman who were raped as teenagers, abused, and trafficked by rich powerful men – and that’s when President Trump turned on me and called me a ‘traitor’ and then new death threats and harassments came from the ‘right’ or somewhere,” Greene wrote on X. “I sent these assassination threats on my son to President Trump in which he responded with harsh accusatory replies and zero sympathy.”

In her 60 Minutes interview, Greene said Republicans don’t criticize Trump in public because they fear being targeted by him.

“I think they’re terrified to step out of line and get a nasty Truth Social post on them,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/079dd632eba2b2cb0069fe120fb00721572b955b/153_0_2999_2400/master/2999.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=36386e4c2da7c6c66bfd3786e6f1dd17",N,,2025-12-07 16:57:22.867962

The Trump administration rescinded the ICE directive after his second presidency began in January.
Members of Congress have been requesting further information from the Trump administration about its targeting of non-citizen veterans for deportation.
A 2022 report from the Migration Policy Institute said about 16 million US military veterans were born in another country.","The fiancee of a Jamaican-born, decorated US army veteran who is now facing deportation under the Trump administration says she hopes his story might inspire legislative action to restore immigration protections for former military members.

“If you served this country, you deserve a chance to stay in this country,” said April Watkins, who is engaged to Godfrey Wade, one of tens of thousands who have been put in immigration detention under Donald Trump’s second presidency. “That is the hope for not only him but for any veteran who sits in a detention center. Look at their service that they gave this country and take that into consideration.”

Wade, a grandfather and US army veteran, was arrested for driving without a license in September and was then taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency tasked with carrying out Trump’s “mass deportation” program, local outlet KENS5 reported. He has been in ICE detention since.

Wade’s case is emblematic of a rising number of non-US citizen military veterans swept up by ICE under Trump’s immigration policies. The Biden administration had previously issued an ICE directive that helped protect non-citizen veterans and also issued an executive order that later created an initiative to help return deported veterans and their families.

The Trump administration rescinded the ICE directive after his second presidency began in January.

Non-citizens are eligible to join the US military. Wade, 65, came to the US from Jamaica at 15 years old, eventually joined the army and earned commendations for wartime service as well as good conduct, as KENS5 reported.

He later received multiple college degrees and worked multiple jobs throughout his time in the US. He was working at a cafe when he was detained by ICE, KENS5 reports.

Wade was being held inside the Stewart detention center, an immigration jail in Lumpkin, Georgia. The facility, one of the largest in the country, is run by the private prison company CoreCivic.

For years, Stewart has faced grave accusations of rights abuses, including allegations of medical neglect. There have also been a series of deaths at the facility.

One of the most recent deaths was a suicide in June. That was the third suicide at Stewart in recent years.

Wade’s six children told KENS5 they have not been able to visit their father as often as they would like.

“Just the process of being able to see my dad is very traumatic,” one of Wade’s daughters told the outlet. “He doesn’t deserve this, what he’s experiencing right now.”

Wade’s family has been seeking assistance with their legal fight against his deportation on the GoFundMe platform.

“We are looking to minimize financial catastrophe during his absence,” the family’s GoFundMe says.

Members of Congress have been requesting further information from the Trump administration about its targeting of non-citizen veterans for deportation. In September, multiple House representatives launched a congressional investigation into the detention and deportation of non-citizen veterans.

Those members of Congress wrote a letter to top Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials, demanding more information on the number of veterans swept up by immigration agents.

A congressional letter from June estimated that 10,000 veterans or more have been deported. A 2022 report from the Migration Policy Institute said about 16 million US military veterans were born in another country.

The Guardian recently revealed that a number of US veterans may be swept up further by immigration officials, as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seeks to hand over to the Trump administration internal data of its non-citizen workforce. More than a quarter of the VA’s workforce is made up of veterans.

An internal memo shows the VA is urgently working on an internal report of non-citizens who are “employed or affiliated” with the department, potentially sweeping up thousands of people. Some details of the report will then be shared with other government agencies, including ICE.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fefb317917193303edd71518ccb0fee09c66b4b9/182_4_702_561/master/702.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=071e023a502dcd7239dbed504137e9da",N,,2025-12-07 15:57:08.100766

Sarah Towle has created more than reportage; she’s built a monument to the often thankless, frequently invisible work of women who refuse to let cruelty be normalized.","BOOK REVIEW — In Crossing the Line: Finding America in the Borderlands, Sarah Towle accomplishes something rare in immigration journalism: she transforms policy abstractions into human truth while elevating the voices of those fighting daily battles for dignity at the US-Mexico border.

This second edition, updated to reflect the darkening reality of a second Trump administration, is both historical document and moral reckoning—a book that doesn’t just inform but demands we reconsider what American values actually mean in practice.

What distinguishes Towle’s work is her deliberate centering of women as the moral backbone of border resistance. The Angry Tías & Abuelas of the Rio Grande Valley emerge as the book’s beating heart—aunties and grandmothers who transformed familial care into radical political action.

Susan Law, Cindy Candia, Elizabeth “Lizee” Cavazos, Madeleine Sandefur, Joyce the archivist—these women become Towle’s guides through the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in their communities. They are not passive observers but active agents of welcome, their work simultaneously ordinary and heroic.

Towle’s genius lies in recognizing that these women’s stories have been systematically excluded from mainstream immigration discourse. While politicians thunder about “border security” and cable news fixates on chaos narratives, the Tías quietly do the unglamorous work: crossing into Matamoros to serve asylum seekers living in tents, documenting abuses inside detention centers, tracking down children stolen from their mothers.

They operate within what Towle calls the “100-mile law enforcement zone”—a constitutional gray area encircling the entire United States where rights supposedly guaranteed to all simply evaporate.

The author introduces us to Jodi, an attorney who witnesses seven mothers testify about children torn from their arms, then discovers 280 more women detained at Port Isabel, all separated from their children.

We meet Jennifer Harbury, who connects contemporary border violence to decades of US intervention in Central America. Through Towle’s empathetic reporting, these women’s labor—intellectual, emotional, physical—becomes visible in ways policy debates never allow.

Towle herself, a white woman educator and writer, navigates her own privilege thoughtfully. She positions herself as witness and amplifier rather than savior, acknowledging the ease with which her blue passport allows border crossings while asylum seekers face detention, deportation, and death. Her journey from Brownsville to Tijuana becomes a geography lesson in American hypocrisy, mapping the “Border Industrial Complex” that profits from human suffering.

The book doesn’t shy from institutional critique. Towle meticulously documents how “prevention through deterrence”—a forty-year-old strategy that has never stopped migration but has killed thousands—remains the bedrock of US policy. She traces the detention-to-deportation pipeline from Reagan-era Haitian asylum denials through Obama-era detention expansion to Trump’s family separation spectacle. Yet amid this systemic cruelty, the women activists refuse despair. They create what Towle calls “a handbook for a more humane world.”

Crossing the Line is also a devastating exposé of gendered violence. Mothers who fled rape and persecution only to have their children seized by US officials. Women detained in brutal conditions, denied due process, then deported back to danger. Towle gives particular attention to Cameroonian asylum seekers—teachers, lawyers, entrepreneurs fleeing civil war—who endured seventeen-month average detentions before ICE deported them in defiance of international law. Their testimonies, recorded in the scorching summer of 2022, chronicle abuses so routine that investigators struggle to keep pace.

The prose is urgent without being preachy, informed without being academic. Towle writes with a journalist’s precision and a humanist’s heart, rendering complex immigration policy comprehensible while never losing sight of individual human cost. Her metaphor of walls as a “second equator” cleaving rich from poor, white from Brown, safety from violence, crystallizes how border enforcement has become global apartheid.

If the book has a weakness, it’s that Towle’s earnestness occasionally overwhelms her narrative—the reader wants to spend more time with the Tías themselves, to hear their voices unmediated. But this minor critique hardly diminishes the work’s power.

Crossing the Line stands as essential reading for anyone seeking to understand how ordinary people maintain moral clarity when their government abandons it. Sarah Towle has created more than reportage; she’s built a monument to the often thankless, frequently invisible work of women who refuse to let cruelty be normalized. In documenting their resistance, she offers us a choice: Will we fly the tattered flag of American ideals alongside them, or let it fall entirely?","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qvK!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e0b884-d8c2-4aeb-8f58-30dbc4987345_1600x1200.webp",N,,2025-12-07 15:57:24.042554

Conclusion Medina‑Sarango v. Bondi does not break new legal ground in asylum, withholding, or CAT jurisprudence.","1. Introduction

The Second Circuit’s summary order in Medina‑Sarango v. Bondi, No. 24‑1441 (2d Cir. Dec. 5, 2025), though expressly non‑precedential, offers an important illustration of two recurring themes in immigration litigation:

The decisive consequences of abandoning dispositive issues on appeal, particularly in asylum and CAT cases; and

The court’s growing willingness to call out, and potentially discipline, immigration counsel for misstatements of the record and governing law.

The case involves an Ecuadorian mother and her minor daughter seeking asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Their claims rested on alleged past abuse by a former co‑worker and, secondarily, on their status as indigenous persons from Ecuador. An Immigration Judge (IJ) rejected their claims on credibility and “pattern or practice” grounds; the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, finding that key issues had been waived. At the Second Circuit, petitioners again failed to challenge these dispositive findings and presented a brief that, in the panel’s view, mischaracterized both the record and the CAT standard.

The court denied the petition for review, found the abandoned issues dispositive of all forms of relief, and, notably, referred counsel to the court’s Grievance Panel. While the order does not create new binding precedent, it sharply reinforces existing doctrine on appellate abandonment and underscores the professional obligations of attorneys practicing before federal courts in immigration matters.

2. Factual and Procedural Background

2.1 Parties and Claims

Petitioners, Nusta Rocio Medina‑Sarango and her minor daughter, are natives and citizens of Ecuador. The record, as summarized by the panel, indicates that:

Their protection claims were grounded primarily in Medina‑Sarango’s allegations of past abuse by a former co‑worker in Ecuador.

They also relied on their indigenous identity but did not demonstrate individualized targeting based on that identity or a broader pattern or practice of persecution against indigenous people in Ecuador.

They sought three forms of relief:

Asylum, based on a fear of persecution on account of a protected ground;

Withholding of removal, which imposes a higher standard of proof than asylum; and

Protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), which requires a showing of likely torture with government involvement or acquiescence, but no nexus to a protected ground.

2.2 Proceedings Before the Immigration Judge

The IJ (Judge Reid) denied all relief by decision dated September 28, 2022. Two points of the IJ’s decision—critical to the Second Circuit’s ultimate ruling—stood out:

Adverse credibility finding. The IJ found that Medina‑Sarango’s allegations of past abuse by a co‑worker were not credible. Given that the daughter’s claims were derivative of the mother’s and rested on the same factual narrative, this credibility determination effectively undermined the factual predicate for all claims.

No proof of individual or group targeting as indigenous persons. Although the IJ accepted that petitioners are indigenous, he held that:

They did not credibly establish that they, personally, would be singled out for harm on that basis; and

The evidence failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution against indigenous people in Ecuador that would independently support a well‑founded fear claim.

The IJ also:

Found that petitioners did not meet the standard for asylum; and under well‑settled law, failure to meet the asylum standard necessarily meant they did not meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.

Denied CAT relief, both because the underlying factual narrative was not credible and because the legal standard for government involvement/acquiescence was not satisfied.

Contrary to petitioners’ later appellate assertions, the IJ did not find that they had abandoned any of their claims for failure to timely submit evidence. The IJ accepted all proffered evidence, including untimely submissions.

2.3 BIA Appeal

On April 29, 2024, the BIA:

Affirmed the IJ’s decision, adopting the IJ’s reasoning with respect to:

The adverse credibility determination;

The failure to establish individualized targeting or a pattern or practice of persecution based on indigenous identity; and

The denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection.

Found waiver: The BIA specifically held that petitioners’ brief to the Board had waived review of:

The IJ’s adverse credibility finding; and

The IJ’s conclusion that this adverse credibility determination was dispositive of all requested relief.

Thus, by the time the case reached the Second Circuit, there were at least two layers of unchallenged or waived findings: the IJ’s adverse credibility judgment and the BIA’s determination that it had been waived on administrative appeal.

2.4 Petition for Review to the Second Circuit

Petitioners, represented by attorney Michael Borja, then sought review in the Second Circuit. Their brief, however:

Did not address or contest:

The adverse credibility determination;

The IJ’s “no pattern or practice” finding; or

The BIA’s ruling that challenges to the adverse credibility finding had been waived.

Mischaracterized the IJ’s decision, asserting—incorrectly—that the IJ denied withholding of removal because the petitioners allegedly abandoned their asylum application by not timely providing evidence.

Advanced an incorrect view of the CAT standard, arguing that petitioners did not need to show that the Ecuadorian government condoned or acquiesced in the harm by a private actor, notwithstanding the contrary language of 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).

The panel explicitly notes that these same misstatements of law and record had appeared in other briefs filed by the same counsel, a fact that becomes significant for the disciplinary referral.

3. Summary of the Court’s Order

The Second Circuit (Judges Newman, Sullivan, and Nathan) denied the petition for review. The key holdings can be summarized as follows:

Scope of review. The court reviewed the IJ’s decision “as supplemented by the BIA.” This means it considered the IJ’s reasoning together with the BIA’s additional findings, a standard practice in cases where the BIA adopts and supplements an IJ decision.

Standards re‑stated but not substantively applied. The panel recited the usual legal standards for:

Asylum and “well‑founded fear” (including past persecution and pattern or practice routes);

Withholding of removal and its higher “clear probability” burden; and

CAT relief and its distinct torture and state‑action requirements.

However, the court did not engage deeply with these standards in relation to the facts, because the petition was resolved on procedural grounds—abandonment of issues.

Abandonment of dispositive issues. The court found that petitioners had abandoned, on appeal, all dispositive grounds for denial:

They did not challenge the IJ’s adverse credibility finding.

They did not challenge the IJ’s rejection of their pattern or practice claim regarding indigenous people in Ecuador.

They did not challenge the BIA’s determination that the adverse credibility issue was waived.

Citing Debique v. Garland, the court held that claims not adequately raised in an appellant’s brief are deemed abandoned. Because the unchallenged findings were dispositive of asylum, withholding, and CAT, the abandonment was determinative.

Knock‑on effect for withholding and CAT. Relying on Lecaj v. Holder, the court reiterated that a failure to establish a well‑founded fear of persecution for asylum purposes necessarily precludes meeting the more demanding standards for withholding of removal and CAT. Accordingly, once asylum fell, the others followed.

Criticism of counsel and referral to Grievance Panel.

The court identified “defects in the briefing” by petitioners’ counsel:

Misstatement that the IJ denied withholding because petitioners allegedly abandoned asylum by late evidence submission—contradicted by the record.

Misdescription of the CAT standard, asserting that government condonation or acquiescence was not required, contrary to the regulation.

Failure to acknowledge the adverse credibility finding when arguing CAT relief.

The order explicitly notes that such misstatements have been made in “other briefs filed by Mr. Borja,” and directs that a copy of the order be forwarded to the court’s Grievance Panel.

The petition was therefore denied, all pending motions and applications were denied, and any stays of removal were vacated.

4. Detailed Analysis

4.1 Standards of Review and Substantive Legal Framework

4.1.1 Standard of Review

The court begins with standard appellate review principles in immigration cases:

Factual findings (including adverse credibility findings) are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B), factual findings “are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.” This is a highly deferential standard toward the agency.

Questions of law and the application of law to fact are reviewed de novo, see Hong Fei Gao v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 67, 76 (2d Cir. 2018).

The panel reviews the IJ’s decision “as supplemented by the BIA,” per Yan Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). This means that if the BIA adopts the IJ’s reasoning but adds its own analysis, both are considered part of the agency’s decision under review.

4.1.2 Substantive Standards for Asylum and Withholding

The order rehearses familiar principles:

Asylum requires a showing that the applicant is unable or unwilling to return to her home country because of “persecution or a well‑founded fear of future persecution” on account of a protected ground: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); Pinel‑Gomez v. Garland, 52 F.4th 523, 528 (2d Cir. 2022).

A well‑founded fear has:

a subjective component (the applicant actually fears harm), and

an objective component (the fear is reasonable in light of the evidence).

See Liang v. Garland, 10 F.4th 106, 112 (2d Cir. 2021).

Past persecution triggers a presumption of a well‑founded fear of future persecution, shifting the burden to the government to rebut that presumption. Liang, 10 F.4th at 112.

Persecution must be inflicted either by the government or by private actors whom the government is unable or unwilling to control. See Pan v. Holder, 777 F.3d 540, 543 (2d Cir. 2015).

An applicant can meet the future‑persecution requirement either by:

Showing she will be singled out individually for persecution, or

Proving a pattern or practice of persecution against a group of persons similarly situated to her. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(iii); § 1208.16(b)(2); Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324, 332 (2d Cir. 2013).

For withholding of removal, the applicant must show a “clear probability of persecution,” meaning it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted if removed. See Pinel‑Gomez, 52 F.4th at 528. Because this standard is more stringent than the well‑founded fear standard for asylum, an applicant who fails to qualify for asylum on the merits necessarily cannot qualify for statutory withholding. Wei Sun v. Sessions, 883 F.3d 23, 28 (2d Cir. 2018).

4.1.3 CAT Protection

Protection under the Convention Against Torture is distinct from asylum and withholding in two main respects:

There is no requirement of a nexus to a protected ground (race, religion, etc.). See Hong Fei Gao, 891 F.3d at 76.

The applicant must show it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed, and that the torture would be:

“by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official acting in an official capacity.”

8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).

Thus, for CAT relief, the central issues are (1) whether the harm rises to the level of “torture” and (2) whether there is sufficient governmental involvement (or deliberate inaction) to meet the state‑action requirement.

4.2 Precedents Cited and Their Role

The panel’s order is heavily grounded in prior Second Circuit immigration and appellate practice decisions:

Yan Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268 (2d Cir. 2005).

This case establishes the standard that the Court of Appeals will review the IJ’s decision as supplemented by the BIA’s reasoning when the BIA adopts but supplements the IJ’s analysis. In Medina‑Sarango, the court explicitly follows this structure, clarifying that both tiers of agency reasoning are in play.

Hong Fei Gao v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 67 (2d Cir. 2018).

This decision is cited for the bifurcated standard of review (substantial evidence for facts, de novo for law), and for the principle that CAT relief does not require a nexus to a protected ground, a point the panel reiterates.

Pinel‑Gomez v. Garland, 52 F.4th 523 (2d Cir. 2022).

Used to restate the statutory definition of a refugee and the “clear probability” standard for withholding.

Liang v. Garland, 10 F.4th 106 (2d Cir. 2021).

Cited for the subjective–objective articulation of the well‑founded fear standard and the presumption triggered by past persecution.

Pan v. Holder, 777 F.3d 540 (2d Cir. 2015).

Supports the requirement that persecution either be by government actors or by private actors whom the government is unable or unwilling to control, reinforcing that private disputes without such a failure of state protection generally do not suffice.

Wei Sun v. Sessions, 883 F.3d 23 (2d Cir. 2018).

Confirms the hierarchy of burdens: failure to meet the asylum standard necessarily implies failure to meet the more demanding withholding standard. The panel in Medina‑Sarango uses this as part of the chain that disposes of withholding once asylum has fallen.

Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324 (2d Cir. 2013).

Invoked for the “pattern or practice” methodology and the related deference to agency factual findings about country conditions.

Debique v. Garland, 58 F.4th 676 (2d Cir. 2023).

This is the key authority on abandonment of arguments. It holds that:

“We consider abandoned any claims not adequately presented in the appellant’s brief, and an appellant’s failure to make legal or factual arguments constitutes abandonment.”

In Medina‑Sarango, the panel uses Debique to deem petitioners’ challenges to the adverse credibility finding, the pattern/practice finding, and the BIA’s waiver determination abandoned.

Lecaj v. Holder, 616 F.3d 111 (2d Cir. 2010).

This case provides the doctrinal link for the “all or nothing” effect once asylum fails:

an applicant who fails to establish a well‑founded fear of harm rising to the level of persecution for asylum “necessarily” fails to meet the higher burdens for withholding of removal and CAT relief.

The Medina‑Sarango court cites this to explain why the abandonment of dispositive asylum issues is equally fatal to withholding and CAT.

None of these precedents are novel; rather, the order applies them in a straightforward manner. What is distinctive about this case is not the legal standard but the procedural route to affirmance and the court’s explicit disciplinary concerns.

4.3 The Court’s Legal Reasoning in Medina‑Sarango

4.3.1 Adverse Credibility and Pattern/Practice Findings as Dispositive

The IJ’s core determinations were:

Petitioners’ story of abuse by a former co‑worker was not credible.

They did not show either:

a likelihood of individualized harm on account of their indigenous identity, or

a pattern or practice of persecution of indigenous persons in Ecuador sufficient to substitute for individualized proof.

These determinations are critical because:

Without credible testimony, the factual foundation of all claims is gravely weakened. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii), the applicant’s testimony can be sufficient but only if it is “credible, persuasive, and refers to specific facts.” Here, it was found not credible.

The alternative “pattern or practice” route, which can sometimes mitigate weak individualized evidence, was explicitly rejected by the IJ. Petitioners therefore lacked both prongs: no credible individualized persecution and no group‑level persecution.

The BIA accepted these findings and further found that the adverse credibility issue was waived because petitioners did not properly raise it in their appeal to the Board.

4.3.2 Abandonment Before the Second Circuit

The petitioners’ brief to the Second Circuit did not:

Challenge or even mention the IJ’s adverse credibility finding;

Address the IJ’s conclusion that there was no pattern or practice of persecution against indigenous persons in Ecuador; or

Challenge the BIA’s finding that petitioners had waived any challenge to the adverse credibility determination.

Under Debique v. Garland, these omissions are fatal. Courts of appeals treat issues that are not adequately briefed as abandoned. It is not enough to gesture generally toward a claim; the appellant must make substantive legal or factual arguments addressing the disputed rulings.

The panel thus concludes that:

“These issues have thus been abandoned. … And that abandonment is dispositive of all relief.”

In other words:

Because the adverse credibility finding and the “no pattern/practice” finding were both dispositive at the agency level, failing to challenge them on petition for review leaves nothing for the court to overturn.

Even if petitioners had correctly stated the legal standards for asylum or CAT, the unchallenged factual findings would still require denial.

4.3.3 Collateral Consequences for Withholding and CAT

Having found that asylum fails due to abandonment of vital issues, the court relies on Lecaj and Wei Sun to dispose of withholding and CAT:

Withholding of removal demands a higher standard (“more likely than not”) than asylum (“well‑founded fear”). If petitioners cannot meet the lighter standard, they cannot meet the heavier one.

CAT relief, though conceptually distinct, also requires a “more likely than not” finding of torture and is often decided under a comparable or higher factual threshold. Moreover, where the alleged persecution is disbelieved, courts generally reject CAT claims unless there is strong independent corroborative evidence—which petitioners here did not show, and which they did not argue around the adverse credibility finding.

The panel succinctly invokes Lecaj to state that a failure to show a well‑founded fear “necessarily” implies a failure to satisfy the higher burdens for withholding and CAT. Strictly speaking, CAT analysis is sometimes treated as analytically distinct; but in practice, where the underlying narrative is rejected and there is no serious independent showing of likely torture by or with government acquiescence, the result is the same.

4.4 Treatment of Counsel’s Briefing and Referral to the Grievance Panel

4.4.1 Misstatement of the Record

The panel devotes a separate paragraph to identifying defects in the petitioners’ brief authored by attorney Michael Borja. First, it calls out a misstatement of the record:

The brief claimed that the IJ denied withholding of removal because he found that petitioners had “abandoned their asylum application by not timely providing all evidence.”

The court corrects this, noting that:

The IJ “accepted all proffered evidence (including evidence that was untimely), and did not find that any of Petitioners’ claims were abandoned.”

The court cites to the Certified Administrative Record (CAR at 82–84) to confirm this.

Mischaracterizing what the IJ did—especially when the record clearly contradicts counsel’s assertions—implicates the duty of candor to the tribunal.

4.4.2 Misstatement of CAT Law

Second, the panel addresses misstatements concerning CAT:

The brief argued that petitioners met their burden for CAT by showing that the Ecuadorian government “exacerbated” their problems, without acknowledging that the IJ had found their account of past events not credible.

More importantly, the brief contended that petitioners were not required to show that the Ecuadorian government “condoned or acquiesced” to their harm by a private actor.

The court flatly rejects this assertion as contrary to the CAT regulation’s explicit language requiring that torture occur “by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official acting in an official capacity.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).

Presenting such a statement—ignoring directly applicable regulatory text already quoted in countless CAT decisions—raises serious concerns about competence and candor.

4.4.3 Pattern of Misconduct and Referral

Perhaps most striking is the panel’s observation:

“We note that the same misstatements of the record and the law have been advanced in other briefs filed by Mr. Borja.”

This signal—that the court has seen this behavior repeatedly—justifies escalation. The order concludes with:

“A copy of this order will be forwarded to the Grievance Panel.”

In the Second Circuit, the Grievance Panel deals with potential attorney misconduct, encompassing:

Misrepresentations to the court;

Repeatedly deficient or frivolous filings; and

Violation of professional responsibility obligations.

While the order does not specify what sanctions or remedial measures might follow, the referral itself underscores that:

The court is tracking patterns of misrepresentation or incompetence among immigration practitioners.

Repeated, documented misstatements of law and record can trigger disciplinary proceedings, including possible censure, suspension from practice before the court, or other sanctions.

5. Clarifying Key Legal and Procedural Concepts

5.1 Adverse Credibility Determination

An adverse credibility determination occurs when an immigration judge finds that the applicant’s testimony cannot be relied upon, often due to:

Internal inconsistencies;

Inconsistencies with other evidence;

Plausibility concerns; or

Non‑responsive or evasive answers.

Because asylum and CAT cases frequently turn on the applicant’s testimony, an adverse credibility finding usually has profound effects:

It means the applicant’s story of persecution or torture is not accepted as fact.

To succeed, the applicant would then need strong independent corroborating evidence sufficient to carry the burden without relying on the discredited testimony—rare in practice.

On judicial review, such findings are highly deferentially reviewed under the “any reasonable adjudicator” standard. In Medina‑Sarango, the petitioners did not even attempt to challenge the adverse credibility finding at the Second Circuit stage, rendering it unassailable.

5.2 Pattern or Practice of Persecution

A pattern or practice claim allows an applicant to obtain asylum or withholding not because she is personally singled out, but because:

She belongs to a particular group (e.g., a specific ethnic, religious, or political group), and

There is systematic, pervasive persecution of that group in her home country.

To succeed, the applicant must generally provide:

Country‑conditions evidence (e.g., U.S. State Department reports, NGO reports, news articles);

Expert testimony where available; and

A showing that the harm rises to the level of persecution and is widespread or systemic.

In Medina‑Sarango, the IJ found that:

While petitioners are indigenous, the evidence did not show that indigenous persons in Ecuador face persecution rather than mere discrimination or hardship; and

Therefore, there was no “pattern or practice” of persecution sufficient to satisfy the regulation.

Petitioners’ failure to challenge this finding on appeal rendered the pattern/practice avenue closed.

5.3 Abandonment of Issues on Appeal

In appellate practice, abandonment (sometimes termed “waiver” or “forfeiture” in specific contexts) refers to the principle that:

Issues not adequately raised and argued in an appellant’s opening brief are treated as abandoned and will not be considered.

“Adequately raised” means providing at least a basic legal and factual argument, with citation to authority and the record—mere conclusory assertions or passing references are usually insufficient.

Debique v. Garland crystallizes this for immigration cases in the Second Circuit. In Medina‑Sarango, abandonment occurred at both:

The BIA level (failure to challenge the IJ’s adverse credibility finding, resulting in “waiver” before the Board); and

The Circuit level (failure to challenge the adverse credibility finding, the pattern/practice finding, or the BIA’s waiver ruling).

Once issues have been abandoned in this way, the court generally will not rescue the appellant by raising them sua sponte.

5.4 Grievance Panel Referral

Most federal courts of appeals, including the Second Circuit, maintain a Grievance Panel or similar body to oversee attorney conduct. Referral to such a panel typically occurs when:

An attorney repeatedly files deficient briefs;

There are concerns about unprofessional conduct or incompetence; or

The attorney is suspected of violating duties of candor, honesty, or other ethical norms.

Consequences can range from:

Private admonitions;

Requirements to complete continuing legal education or mentoring;

Public reprimands; or

Suspension or disbarment from practice before the court.

In immigration practice, where vulnerable noncitizens often depend entirely on their attorneys to articulate complex claims, disciplinary oversight is especially significant.

6. Likely Impact and Practical Implications

6.1 No Formal Precedential Effect, but Strong Persuasive Signaling

The order is explicitly labeled a “Summary Order” with no precedential effect under Second Circuit Local Rule 32.1.1. It may be cited in accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1, but it does not create binding circuit law. Nonetheless, it is:

A clear application of existing precedent (Debique, Lecaj, etc.) to a typical asylum/CAT scenario; and

A strong signal of the court’s intolerance for:

Inadequate briefing that omits dispositive issues; and

Systematic misstatements of law and record in immigration appeals.

6.2 Guidance for Immigration Practitioners

The order sends several practical messages to immigration counsel:

Always directly address adverse credibility findings.

If an IJ has found the client not credible, the BIA appeal and any petition for review must grapple with that finding: explain why it is erroneous under the substantial‑evidence standard, point to record inconsistencies in the IJ’s analysis, and marshal corroborating evidence. Ignoring it is effectively conceding the case.

Do not ignore “pattern or practice” and other alternative grounds.

When an IJ denies relief on multiple independent grounds (e.g., credibility and lack of pattern/practice), each ground generally must be challenged on appeal; failure to do so leaves that ground as an independent basis for denial.

Be scrupulously accurate about the record.

Claims that the IJ found abandonment or refused evidence must be firmly grounded in the transcript or written decision. The court will not tolerate misrepresentations that are contradicted by straightforward citations to the Certified Administrative Record.

Know and apply the correct CAT standard.

CAT requires government involvement—whether through direct perpetration, instigation, consent, or acquiescence. Arguing the opposite invites correction and undermines counsel’s credibility.

Understand that repeated errors can lead to discipline.

When the court notes that similar misstatements have been made “in other briefs filed by” the same attorney and refers the matter to a Grievance Panel, it signals that patterns of poor practice in immigration appeals are under active scrutiny.

6.3 Consequences for Noncitizens

From the perspective of noncitizen litigants:

The case illustrates how procedural missteps by counsel—especially failure to brief critical issues—can foreclose substantive review of their claims.

Even potentially meritorious arguments (for example, if the credibility finding were arguably flawed) cannot be resurrected if they are not properly raised at each administrative and judicial stage.

It highlights the importance of:

Retaining competent, specialized immigration appellate counsel; and

Understanding that appeal success often hinges as much on procedural rigor as on underlying facts.

7. Conclusion

Medina‑Sarango v. Bondi does not break new legal ground in asylum, withholding, or CAT jurisprudence. Instead, it reinforces established doctrine in two crucial respects:

Abandonment of dispositive issues. Under Debique and related cases, petitioners who fail to challenge key adverse findings—here, credibility and lack of pattern/practice—effectively concede defeat. The court will not reach the merits of underlying claims when no argument is made addressing the actual reasons the agency denied relief.

Counsel’s duty of candor and competence. The court’s explicit identification of misstatements in the brief, combined with the referral of counsel to the Grievance Panel for similar recurring errors, sends a clear message: immigration counsel must accurately represent both the record and the governing law, and must present fully developed arguments on all dispositive points.

In a system where the stakes for noncitizens are extraordinarily high—potential detention, removal, and return to possible harm—the quality of advocacy can decisively shape outcomes. Medina‑Sarango stands as a cautionary illustration: even where substantive law and standards are well settled, failures in briefing and professional responsibility can, by themselves, terminate a case and trigger disciplinary scrutiny.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 16:57:30.418991

Photos show the extent of his injuries — gashes on his arm and side.

The video was taken by his wife, a U.S. citizen and mother to their three young children.

Neighbor John Williams Sr. recalled the incident.

“His wife was screaming; the kids in the car were screaming,” Williams said. “I’m glad his 7-year-old daughter wasn’t here. The 2- and 3-year-olds were here. We were trying to ask, 'What’s going on?' and they are telling her to ‘Get back, get back, or we’re gonna sic the dog on you.’”

Toledo-Martinez himself is undocumented after being brought to the U.S. when he was 15.

According to his attorney, a federal agent lured Toledo-Martinez out of his home under false pretenses, posing as a construction worker who claimed to have hit Wilmer’s car and needed him to step outside to verify.

“He backed in his car because this is my garage, and the truck just pulled up right here and scraped the front right here.” Williams said.

Williams said Toledo-Martinez is loved in the community and a real asset.

“It’s just sad,” Williams said. “This young man works, he takes care of his family, he’s very great in the community. He tries to help any and everybody.”

He said he was in disbelief at what he was seeing.

“I’ve never seen anything like this in my life close up with no one, and it hurts. It really hurts, especially happening to a young man like that — a good, honest, young man.” Williams said.

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington is calling for Toledo-Martinez’s immediate release from the Tacoma U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, writing:

“For years, the Biden Administration weaponized the Justice System against their Political Opponents, and anyone who disagreed with them,” Trump said when announcing he had pardoned Cuellar on Wednesday.

I want to thank President Trump for this…Now we clear the air.
The 69-year-old Texas lawmaker filed for reelection on Wednesday, telling reporters he had no intention of retiring or switching parties.","President Donald Trump has scolded a Texas lawmaker's ""lack of LOYALTY"" for announcing he will seek election again as a Democrat only days after the president issued a “full and unconditional” pardon in his favor.

“Only a short time after signing the Pardon, Congressman Henry Cuellar announced that he will be ‘running’ for Congress again, in the Great State of Texas…as a Democrat, continuing to work with the same Radical Left Scum that just weeks before wanted him and his wife to spend the rest of their lives in Prison—And probably still do,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday morning.

Trump added: “Oh well, next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!”

Why It Matters

The pardoning of Cuellar and his wife was Trump’s third act of clemency this week, after commuting the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was facing a seven-year prison sentence for fraud, and scrapping a 45-year-old sentence for former President of Honduras Juan Orlando Hernandez, who had been convicted of flooding the U.S. with cocaine.

But Cuellar’s pardon particularly played into Trump’s rhetoric of a “weaponized” justice system under Joe Biden's administration, with the president calling the Cuellars’ indictment a ""witch hunt”—the same term he had used for the cases against himself.

Trump was convicted by an unanimous jury in New York last year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of an alleged hush money scheme to influence the 2016 election. But in January, a judge sentenced him to an “unconditional discharge”—which means that he won’t face any jail time, fines or probation for it. The conviction, however, stands.

What To Know

Cuellar and his wife Imelda were indicted last year in a federal bribery and conspiracy case for allegedly accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijani government-owned oil company and an unnamed Mexican bank.

According to Trump, however, Cuellar—a moderate Democrat representing an area on the Texas-Mexico border—was unfairly targeted by then-president Biden for the congressman’s criticism of his administration’s immigration policies.

“For years, the Biden Administration weaponized the Justice System against their Political Opponents, and anyone who disagreed with them,” Trump said when announcing he had pardoned Cuellar on Wednesday.

“One of the clearest examples of this was when Crooked Joe used the FBI and DOJ to ‘take out’ a member of his own Party after Highly Respected Congressman Henry Cuellar bravely spoke out against Open Borders, and the Biden Border ‘Catastrophe,'” he added.

Cuellar has always said he and his wife as innocent to the federal charges.

Trump said on Sunday that he has never met Cuellar or his wife in person, but decided to pardon the couple after receiving a “beautiful letter” from their daughters.

The letter, dated November 12, 2025, and posted on Truth Social on Sunday, shows that the Cuellars’ daughters did appeal to Trump to show “mercy and compassion to our parents,” they wrote, “either by dismissing this case or granting a full and unconditional pardon.”

In the document, Catherine Ann and Christina Alexandra Cuellar described their parents as “two of the kindest, most selfless people we know,” and said that their father’s “independence and honesty may have contributed to how this case began”

The pair said that their father had “never been afraid to speak his mind, especially when it comes to protecting the people of South Texas and securing the border from the policies of the previous administration.”

In an appeal that would have resonated with the president, they talked of the Trump family's “own challenges” with the justice system, which they compared to theirs. They then speak of meeting Trump at a White House picnic—despite his later saying he has never spoken to them—and being told “personally” that he thought Cuellar was “a good man.”

In an interview with CNN, Cuellar said he thanked the president for the pardon and trusted his judgment on it. He also said there was a “weaponization” of the justice system in his case, adding that while he was indicted, he was not, in fact, convicted.

What People Are Saying

Henry Cuellar told reporters after the pardon, as reported by Politico: “It came as a surprise. I want to thank President Trump for this…Now we clear the air. Nothing has changed, and we’re going to be ready to win reelection again.”

President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday: “I signed the papers, and said to people in the Oval Office that I just did a very good, perhaps life saving, thing. God was very happy with me that day! THEN IT HAPPENED!!!…Such a lack of LOYALTY, something that Texas Voters, and Henry’s daughters, will not like. Oh’ well, next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!”

What Happens Next

Cuellar served in the Texas House of Representatives for 14 years, from 1987 to 2001, and then as the Texas Secretary of State in 2001—always as a Democrat.

The 69-year-old Texas lawmaker filed for reelection on Wednesday, telling reporters he had no intention of retiring or switching parties.

Lair,,,,,https://idahofreedom.org/sanctuary-schools-illegal-immigrations-toll-on-public-education/,"According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), there are over 21,000 children of illegal aliens in Idaho’s public school system costing the state roughly $245.1 million a year.
Foreign exchange students who are legally permitted to attend a public high school must pay the full, unsubsidized cost of education.
Under Plyler, illegal aliens have a right to enroll in charter schools since they are publicly funded.
It is unclear whether these programs, which are publicly funded and available to all resident students, must also be made accessible to illegal aliens under equal protection.
It is high time we reaffirm that the Constitution was not established for the benefit of illegal aliens, but “to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”","In October 2025, a law enforcement operation at a horse track in Wilder, Idaho, turned into the state’s largest immigration raid, resulting in the arrest of 105 suspected adult illegal aliens. Subsequently, the day following the raid, nearly 20% of students in the Wilder School District were reported absent. This incident reveals how mass immigration is transforming Idaho’s rural communities and simultaneously raises another interesting question: why are the citizens of Idaho subsidizing the education of foreign nationals, let alone illegal aliens?

In 1982, the United States Supreme Court, in Plyler v. Doe, struck down a Texas statute that withheld state funds for the education of children who were not ""legally admitted"" into the United States and authorized local school districts to deny enrollment to illegal aliens. It also struck down an independent school district’s policy that charged illegal aliens an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each student to compensate for lost state funding. The Court determined that the denial of a free public education to illegal aliens “is utterly incompatible with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”

The majority's opinion in Plyler holds that states lack any “compelling government interest” to deny enrollment to illegal aliens or charge them tuition for attending public school, but the numbers tell a different story. According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), there are over 21,000 children of illegal aliens in Idaho’s public school system costing the state roughly $245.1 million a year.

Mind you, the Office of Performance Evaluations released a report in March 2025 estimating there is a $82.2 million funding gap in special education. All the while, Idaho’s school choice program is drastically underfunded and currently only covers a fraction of the existing private school population. If Idaho weren’t compelled to spend hundreds of millions on educating foreigners, we would have more resources to adequately fund educational programs for our children.

Beyond this financial burden, there is an even more compelling reason to oppose the Plyler decision on principle. Our nation’s tradition of self-government is predicated on the understanding of society as a social compact, whereby, in the words of John Adams, “the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good.” This underlying philosophy is evidenced in the preamble of our own Idaho Constitution, which states that “We, the people of the State of Idaho, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, to secure its blessings and promote our common welfare do establish this Constitution.” The functions of government are legitimate because we have consented to this mutual association to promote our joint happiness. Our system of public, free common schools was established only for the people of Idaho’s “common welfare” — the legitimate benefactors of the social compact and no one else.

In other words, access to a free education is a privilege of citizenship. By eviscerating the distinction between citizen and alien, Plyler v. Doe undermines the very foundation of our republican government. It is one thing to compel a man to pay for the education of his neighbor with whom, as countrymen, he shares a common destiny and on whose wisdom and virtue the security of his liberties depends; it is another to compel the people of Idaho to pay for the education of foreigners whom we have never consented to live among us. The former derives from our duties as citizens; the latter is nothing short of theft.

Our forefathers recognized that the people are only obligated to submit to controversial judicial decisions on matters that are “fully settled.” In response to the infamous Dred Scott decision, Abraham Lincoln laid out a framework for distinguishing settled from unsettled legal precedents. Among the criteria he lists are whether the decision was unanimous, without any apparent partisan bias, in accordance with legal public expectation, or repeatedly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court as good precedent.

By this standard, Plyler is ripe for a legal challenge. The decision was narrowly decided on a 5-4 split of the justices. In his dissent, Chief Justice Burger took the majority to task for employing an “unabashedly result-oriented approach” based on its own “standards of desirable social policy.” Moreover, he observed that the majority's “unique confluence of theories and rationales” was so contrary to any known theory of “principled constitutional adjudication” that he expected it to establish “little beyond the results in these particular cases.” In short, the Chief Justice concluded that the Court’s decision was so egregiously political and contrary to legal public expectation that it did not warrant any meaningful consideration for future cases on questions pertaining to the proper application of equal protection.

Plyler represents a stark deviation from our nation’s legal tradition on the rights and privileges of immigrants. In 1923, the Supreme Court in Terrace v. Thompson upheld a Washington state law prohibiting aliens who were ineligible to become citizens from owning or leasing land, affirming that the Equal Protection Clause did not supercede a state’s “wide discretion in determining its own public policy and what measures are necessary for its own protection and properly to promote the safety, peace, and good order of its people.” Certainly, if a state may interfere in the private business contracts of resident aliens to lease farm land, it can require illegal aliens to reimburse the state for educating their unlawfully present children.

Plyler is also inconsistent with the rest of our immigration law. Foreign exchange students who are legally permitted to attend a public high school must pay the full, unsubsidized cost of education. However, that same student would be entitled to a free education were he to enter the United States illegally. Even more ridiculous is that while it is unlawful to charge tuition to an illegal alien, Idaho would be entirely within its rights to charge tuition to an American citizen from Pullman, WA, for attending a public school in Moscow.

Beyond these considerations, the landscape of K-12 education has changed drastically in the four decades since Plyler was decided in 1982. Among the most significant developments is the growth of charter schools, which now account for nearly 8% of the nation’s K-12 student population. Under Plyler, illegal aliens have a right to enroll in charter schools since they are publicly funded. However, unlike traditional common schools, charters are only theoretically open to every student. Many charter schools use a lottery system to determine eligibility for a finite number of seats. Given that enrollment in these schools is zero-sum, it is justifiable that enrollment should be reserved for American citizens.

Moreover, many states have begun implementing universal school choice programs. It is unclear whether these programs, which are publicly funded and available to all resident students, must also be made accessible to illegal aliens under equal protection. Even if the Court is unwilling to reconsider its major holding, it should at least clarify how its precedent applies to these new sets of facts.

Recently, several states — including Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Texas — have sought to challenge the precedent of Plyler. Unfortunately, none of these efforts has yet survived the legislative process. This upcoming legislative session, however, Idaho has the opportunity to lead out in restoring the integrity of our social compact.

In 2025, Rep. Dale Hawkins and Rep. Steve Tanner introduced House Bill 382 (H382), which would have required school districts to collect and report the immigration status and nationality of every enrolled student in Idaho's public education system. A 2026 version of H382 deserves to be reintroduced and will be essential to gaining a full and accurate picture of the burden illegal immigration imposes on our public institutions. The Legislature should also consider taking bolder action and directly challenging the main holding of Plyler.

Idaho not only has an interest but an obligation to press this issue. Just as the federal government is endowed with the authority to defend the rights of American citizens against abusive state power, so too do the states have the right to defend their reserved sovereign authority against an unjust encroachment by the federal government. As expressed by James Madison, the architect of our Constitution, whenever the federal government engages in a “deliberate, palpable and dangerous” exercise of powers beyond the scope of the Constitution, the states “have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.”

For too long, the people of Idaho have been burdened without their consent with the expense of supporting an alien population by order of judicial fiat. It is high time we reaffirm that the Constitution was not established for the benefit of illegal aliens, but “to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”",https://idahofreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Article-Headers-2025-12-06T163229.040.png,N,,2025-12-07 14:56:34.601082

The data, which includes ICE arrests from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15, shows that nearly 75,000 people with no criminal records have been swept up in immigration operations that the president and his top officials have said would target murderers, rapists and gang members.

“It contradicts what the administration has been saying about people who are convicted criminals and that they are going after the worst of the worst,” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.

The figures provide the most revealing look to date into the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. They were shared by the University of California, Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project, which obtained them through a lawsuit brought against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The data is compiled by an internal ICE office that handles arrest, detention and deportation data. The administration stopped regularly posting detailed information on ICE arrests in January.

For arrestees with criminal histories, the data doesn’t distinguish between those with a history of minor offenses and those who have committed more serious crimes, like rape and murder, whom the administration has said it is targeting.

And the figures do not include arrests made by Border Patrol, which has launched aggressive immigration operations in several cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina. Border Patrol sweeps are currently underway in New Orleans.

Border Patrol and ICE are both under the Department of Homeland Security but they are two different agencies with two different missions. Border Patrol agents typically operate along the southern and northern borders, but recently hundreds have been sent into the interior of the United States to track down undocumented immigrants.

“That is the black box that we know nothing about,” Ruiz Soto said. “How many arrests is Border Patrol doing? How many of those are leading to removals and under what conditions?”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

ICE field offices have been under intense pressure to ramp up arrests.

In mid-May, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller threatened to fire senior ICE officials if they did not begin arresting at least 3,000 migrants per day, NBC News previously reported.

But the new data shows that ICE is still falling well short of those targets.

ICE agents have made an average daily total of 824 arrests since Jan. 20, according to the data. Those figures are still more than double the average daily arrest total under the Biden administration in 2024, when ICE arrested 312 people per day.

The data also reveals that about 90% of the people ICE arrested through mid-October were male. Mexican nationals accounted for the largest share of the overall arrests, with about 85,000, followed by nationals of Guatemala at 31,000 and Honduras at 24,000.

More than 60% of those who were arrested were between the ages of 25 and 45.

“Now we’re really feeling that pain in the workforce,” said George Carrillo, chief executive officer of the Hispanic Construction Council.

Carrillo praised the Trump administration for its efforts to secure the border but said the ongoing enforcement operations are having a significant impact on companies that employ migrant workers.

“Now even the most conservative Republicans are feeling it and understanding that, hey, something different has to be done because now it is affecting their businesses,” he said. “And they’re worried about this strategy.”

It’s not clear from the data how many of those who were arrested were deported, but 22,959 are listed under the category of “voluntary departure,” meaning they left the United States of their own accord.

""That is the hope for not only him but for any veteran who sits in a detention center.","A Georgia grandfather and U.S. Army veteran has spent the last three months in immigration detention after what began as a simple traffic stop.

His case is unfolding as federal protections for non-citizen veterans have quietly been scaled back.

A traffic stop that changed everything

Godfrey Wade, a longtime Covington resident who came to the United States from Jamaica at 15, was pulled over in Conyers in September for failing to use a turn signal. Police discovered he was driving without a license and arrested him. ICE took Wade into custody shortly after.

His fiancée, April Watkins, recorded on her phone the moment he was taken away in handcuffs.

""He wasn't born in this country, and still, he loves this country enough that he signed up to serve it,"" Watkins said. ""Fifty years later, when he needs this country, this country is turning its back on him.""

A veteran with deep ties to Georgia

Shortly after he arrived in the United States, Wade enlisted in the United States Army, 7th Infantry Division, beginning in Aschaffenburg, Germany. He earned commendations for good conduct and wartime service.

After his honorable discharge, he built a wide-ranging career and earned multiple college degrees. He's worked as a master tailor, fashion designer, tennis coach, and chef. He was working at the Georgia Capitol Café before he was detained.

He and Watkins say they were in the process of securing his citizenship.

""We had an attorney, but it's a very expensive endeavor; the cost is astronomical,"" she said. ""Still, he did make the effort. We did a lot of things to make sure this day would not come, and yet here we are.""

Calling from Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Wade admitted he didn't expect this day to come.

""For 52 years I've lived in this country and raised my children, worked hard, paid my taxes,"" he said. ""A lot of the processes of immigration I didn't know about. I'm learning more while I'm in here.""

Suffering at Stewart Detention Center

65-year-old Wade said he spent his first 12 days at Stewart Detention Center sleeping on a makeshift bed on the ground, a result of overcrowding.

""We don't have any bunk space,"" he said. ""We're given what we call boats, and those are placed on the floor with a two-inch mat.""

He also said there are only two working urinals for his entire pod of 80 people.

""There's sewage water flowing on the ground,"" he said.

Records obtained by 11Alive show the Office of Detention Oversight (ODO) found 12 deficiencies at the center during its last inspection. Those deficiencies related to health and safety, food service, phone access, use of force, and more.

The agency also noted violations of the required 12-to-1 detainee-to-toilet ratio.

Over a series of weeks, 11Alive News Investigates repeatedly reached out to CoreCivic, the contractor that runs Stewart Detention Center, for comment. As of this publication, it has still not responded.

Protections rolled back

For years, non-citizen veterans had legal safeguards against deportation.

In 2022, the Biden administration directed ICE officers to consider U.S. military service when deciding whether to pursue removal, allowing exemptions for veterans without serious criminal histories.

But an internal ICE memo obtained by 11Alive Investigates shows that directive was rescinded in April of this year.

The memo preserves certain protections for active-duty service members, but leaves others vulnerable. In fact, the new directive explicitly states, ""an honorable discharge does not prevent an alien from being subject to immigration enforcement.""

Georgia lawmakers raised the alarm

Earlier this year, Georgia U.S. Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, along with Rep. Hank Johnson, joined more than 60 Democratic members of Congress demanding the federal government produce a list of veterans who have been detained or deported so far in 2025.

That list was due Sept. 16.

Documents provided to 11Alive News by Rep. Johnson's office show the Department of Defense said it wouldn't meet that deadline, but expected to give a response by Oct. 17.

It never came.

""Senator [Elizabeth] Warren's office has been following up every two weeks with no response,"" said a spokesperson for Rep. Johnson.

""He doesn't deserve this""

Wade's six children say they've only been granted sporadic access to see their father.

""Just the process of being able to see my dad is very traumatic,"" said Wade's daughter, Christian, a teacher. ""He doesn't deserve this, what he's experiencing right now.""

Christian is the mother of two of Wade's grandchildren, 4 and 6.

""It's been hard trying to communicate why granddad is not available,"" she said. ""We typically see him every weekend. He doesn't want them to see him behind that plexiglass. He doesn't want them to see what he looks like.""

Wade's youngest child, Emmanuela, 28, said she's struggling with the thought of her father, who has never had more than a traffic violation, being perceived as a criminal.

""For my first talent show, I was doing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and he created a kimono for me,"" she said. ""There were stars all alongside the sleeves. He was always supportive of our aspirations and our dreams.""

30-year-old Zoe said his father also instilled a love of country in the family.

""He would have us standing at attention and then tell us, 'At ease!'"" He laughed. ""We'd sing cadences, different army songs. He really instilled some great foundations for us and was very patriotic.""

""We're here because of him,"" Christian added. ""We have these rights because he came here. His grandchildren are experiencing their rights because of his bravery. And through all of this, he is still choosing the United States, his faith in and patriotism for this country.""

Wade's children and three grandchildren cherish the limited phone calls they get from Stewart Detention Center.

Agreeing to have his words published, Wade insisted on making it clear he holds no animosity for the country he's served.

""If I didn't believe this country is still great, I wouldn't want to stay here,"" he said. ""I shed my blood for this country. I can live with myself if I just have a day in court so somebody can hear my story.""

Wade says he wasn't assigned a case agent for 55 days and still hasn't appeared before a judge.

""I was told through my attorney that they're waiting for a deportation,"" He said. ""I haven't gone to see a judge. They're saying that my situation is final.""

Watkins says his confusion about being denied a hearing was only recently addressed.

""They're saying they mailed me a notice of appearance to a judge back in 2014,"" he said. ""But it went to the wrong address.""

Asked whether she's prepared herself for the possibility of her fiancé's deportation, Watkins held back tears.

""I have not,"" she said. ""Will we even get to say goodbye, or is it just gonna be a phone call and then the next thing you know, he's in Jamaica?""

Watkins said she hopes sharing her fiancé's story might inspire legislative action to restore deportation protections for non-citizen veterans.

""If you served this country, you deserve a chance to stay in this country,"" she said. ""That is the hope for not only him but for any veteran who sits in a detention center. Look at their service that they gave this country and take that into consideration.""",https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/c1495a75-aaaa-4dbc-99ee-ed20814c41bc/20251204T180306/c1495a75-aaaa-4dbc-99ee-ed20814c41bc_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 15:57:59.831734

Illegal immigration has been reduced toward zero, and the political stars seem in alignment, at least theoretically, for reductions in legal immigration as well.

But that seems unlikely. And not just because of timidity of lawmakers but because the two writers take too mechanical a view of mass immigration. For people don’t uproot themselves and head for unfamiliar lands for just marginal economic gain.

In my 2013 book, “Shaping Our Nation: How Surges of Migration Transformed America and Its Politics,” I argued that the unusual phenomenon of mass migration only occurs when large numbers of people are pursuing dreams or escaping nightmares.

Cowen, a market-friendly economist, sees it differently. Looking back, he thinks that America had “a fine policy” before 2016, “keep(ing) borders nominally restricted … but allow(ing) immigration, both legal and illegal, to become increasingly attractive to people around the world.” Mordantly, he adds, “I call this ‘asymptotically approaching open borders.'”

To which voters, as he points out, react negatively as they do to mention of an explicit open-borders policy. They’re fearful that some large proportion of the 95% of human beings who don’t live in the U.S. would like to come here.

That’s probably unrealistic. Mexico has been at peace with the U.S. since 1848, and the U.S. has always had higher wage levels. But for more than a century, only a negligible number of Mexicans crossed the border. For most Mexicans, America was so geographically distant and culturally different that they never dreamed of coming.

The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act imposed limits, for the first time, on immigration from Latin America, and few Mexicans arrived in the stagflationary 1970s. But mass chain migration to Ronald Reagan’s sunny California began in the 1980s and crested in the 2000s as banks, incentivized to loan to Hispanics, issued $300,000 mortgages to borrowers with no money down, no W-2s, no assets.

That led to the 2007 housing market collapse, which turned immigrants’ dreams of unloading their houses for $600,000 into bankruptcy nightmares. Net migration from Mexico turned negative for a decade, and the Biden-era surge of illegal immigrants came not so much from Mexicans but from Central Americans and assorted others, crossing Mexico to be welcomed across the Rio Grande. The Trump administration’s success in border and internal enforcement will, for a time, disincentivize illegal migration by turning would-be migrants’ dreams into nightmares.

While Cowen thinks that’s cruel, Caldwell hails it as a step toward “America’s third great slamming of the Golden Door.” The first, he dates from 1775 to 1815. But those were mostly wartime years — the American Revolution up through 1783, the world war between revolutionary and Napoleonic France and parliamentary and commercial Britain for all but one year from 1793 to 1815.

The second started with passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, which virtually eliminated immigration from eastern and southern Europe, dominant in the Ellis Island era (1892-1914, 1919-24). But the law’s effect was limited. It blocked several million migrants in the prosperous 1920s but very few (though, tragically, some refugees) in the depression 1930s, when there was little migration, internal or international. And world war, in 1939-45, as it had in 1914-18, cut immigration to essentially zero.

The 1924 law remained in effect till 1965 and limited postwar immigration from Italy and Greece, but many prewar immigrants from those countries returned home, and many southern Europeans postwar headed to newly prosperous northern Europe. And of course, there was no substantial postwar immigration from Eastern Europe, behind the Iron Curtain.

Caldwell credits the “pause” in immigration following 1924 for encouraging assimilation into an American mainstream. But that was furthered more by the sudden appearance of mass media — radio, movies, television — and by World War II, which put 16 million men in a nation of 131 million into the military, putting literally in uniform Americans of all origins.

They partook of a common popular culture transmitted by universal media and established a national consensus that dismantled the separate segregation system established and maintained in the South for 75 years. That, perhaps as much as changes in the 1965 law, may have made the dream of life in the United States seem achievable to millions in Latin America and Asia during the great immigration surge in the quarter-century from 1982 to 2007. If the forces of assimilation were not as strong in those years as they were in the 1940s military or the New York City public schools a century ago, that’s something to work on now.

In the meantime, it’s an exaggeration to say that America is closing its doors when it swears in about 800,000 new American citizens every year. There are arguments for changing our legal immigration system to prioritize high-skill migrants, as well as to reduce or (as I would prefer) increase the total flow of immigrants. But there are limits on what the law can do when, despite economic incentives, people only take the unusual step of uprooting themselves to pursue dreams or escape nightmares.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been one of the most vociferous defenders of President Donald Trump’s expansive use of executive authority, withholding billions of dollars in federal funding to states and dismissing protests of the White House’s boundary-pushing behavior as the gripings of “disenfranchised Democrats.”

But court documents reviewed by ProPublica show that a decade ago, as a House member, Duffy took a drastically different position on presidential power, articulating a full-throated defense of Congress’ role as a check on the president — one that resembled the very arguments made by speakers at recent anti-Trump “No Kings” rallies around the country.

In an assertive, thoroughly researched 2015 legal brief, Duffy, then a Republican representative from Wisconsin, detailed the history of America’s creation in reaction to the absolute power of the English crown, invoking the Magna Carta and the Founding Fathers as he made the case for the separation of powers.

“Just as Congress may not bestow upon the President Congress’s own exclusive power to make, or to repeal, federal law,” Duffy argued, citing a 1998 court decision, “it may not bestow upon the Executive its own exclusive power of the purse.”

The brief went on to cite James Madison’s account of the Constitutional Convention, where there was “unanimous agreement that Congress, not the President, should control the purse.”

At the time, Duffy filed the friend-of-the-court brief in support of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau gets funded. Duffy, who chaired the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, maintained that the agency’s unique funding system — its dollars come directly from the Federal Reserve System rather than by a congressional appropriation — improperly bypassed lawmakers’ authority.

The 39-page brief was filed under Duffy’s name along with a nonprofit group aligned with the Republican legal activist Leonard Leo and submitted by a preeminent conservative lawyer. Today, it stands in stark contrast to Duffy’s own actions as transportation secretary in the first year of Trump’s second stint in the White House. Indeed, his attempts to restrict congressionally appropriated transportation funding across all 50 states this year have been condemned by a congressional watchdog and federal judges, resulting in stinging public rebukes from the other branches of government that echo his own 2015 position.

Peter Levine, a civics expert at Tufts University, said that while it could be that Duffy’s views on presidential power have evolved over time, his apparent flip-flopping on something as fundamental as the meaning of the Constitution raises the prospect that Duffy may “just be playing a game for power.”

“The Constitution is a promise to continue to apply the same rules and norms over time to everybody,” he added. “When political actors completely ignore that, and just go after their own thing, I don’t think the Constitution can actually function.”

In response to questions, a Department of Transportation spokesperson asked for a copy of Duffy’s brief. But after ProPublica provided it, the spokesperson stopped responding. A message sent to a number listed for Duffy hasn’t been returned.

The expansion of executive power has been a hallmark of Trump’s second administration. The president issued a whopping 214 executive orders between Jan. 20 and Nov. 20, according to the The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In both “number and ambition,” the orders and resulting actions are “exceeded on these dimensions in the last century only by Franklin D. Roosevelt,” one Harvard Law School professor recently noted.

Duffy has cited some of those directives as he has withheld congressionally approved transportation funds. And administration officials have defended doing so, claiming that a post-Watergate law asserting Congress’ power over spending improperly restrains the president’s authority.

But a congressional watchdog and the courts have taken issue with that expansive interpretation of federal authority.

For Duffy, the first instance came in May, when the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, concluded that the DOT had violated the law when it halted payments in February from a $5 billion fund for electric car charging stations that Congress approved under former President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law.

“The Constitution specifically vests Congress with the power of the purse,” the congressional watchdog wrote, arguing that the payments should resume. “The Constitution grants the President no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation.”

A White House spokesperson called the GAO’s opinion “incorrect” when it was issued and argued that the DOT was “appropriately using” its authority.

In June, a federal judge in Washington ordered transportation officials to lift the pause after a handful of states sued Duffy and the DOT, writing that when the executive branch “treads upon the will of the Legislative Branch,” it’s up to the court “to remediate the situation and restore the balance of power.”

The government has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, writing that it had revamped the grant application process for the charging station money and also that the states’ constitutional concerns were unfounded, since another part of the Constitution “vests the President with broad, discretionary authority to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” The suit is ongoing.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1502157/story_image/AP25279796254436.jpg?1764101525,N,,2025-12-07 12:57:34.356679

They are not organized to engage in military-like operations, are not armed to do so, and have conducted no armed operations against U.S. forces.
Finally, we discuss below the insurmountable problems in any attempt to consider the drugs or boats targetable as “war-sustaining” objects.","The Sept. 2 attack on a boat allegedly carrying drugs has sparked widespread discussion regarding the targetability of the 11 people aboard, including two who survived the first strike, and of the drugs themselves. Given the administration’s lack of transparency, especially from the Department of Defense, there is widespread speculation about what really happened in this first, highly controversial Operation Southern Spear attack.

Initially, reports were that the two survivors were merely clinging to the wreckage of the boat when they were killed in a follow-on strike. This led to widespread accusations of war crimes on the basis that those individuals were hors de combat. Next, a narrative emerged that the survivors were on board the boat and communicating with other cartel boats in the vicinity. This led the Washington Post to suggest that, “[t]he version of events [Admiral] Bradley is expected to deliver would rebut claims by legal experts that the killing of the two survivors could have constituted a war crime.” In yet another turn, some members of Congress who viewed the video of the strikes have suggested the two survivors were in fact perched, shirtless, on capsized wreckage of a portion of the boat (the rest having burned or separated), unarmed, and with no radio or other communication equipment available, and having waved their arms before they were killed – in other words, utterly defenseless and posing no threat.

Flawed legal analysis has plagued discussions of the operations. In fact, there have been no war crimes because there is no “war.” And even if the United States were engaged in an armed conflict with Tren de Aragua or drug cartels, much of the discussion about the operations generally, and the Sept. 2 strike in particular, misses or misconstrues fundamental points of law that should be driving scrutiny of the campaign broadly and of individual attacks.

In this article, we attempt to clear some of the fog of law by zeroing in on whether individuals aboard the boats or the drugs they were transporting were legally targetable in the first place. We start with the law that actually applies to the strikes. Our analysis then turns to the law of armed conflict (LOAC). That law does not apply, but because it is nevertheless occupying (inappropriately) so much of the discussion, we will delve into those aspects of it that deal with targeting.

The bottom line: there is no legal basis for targeting the drugs, the boats carrying them, or the people on board. That is true under the law that applies (international human rights law) and under the law that does not apply (the law of armed conflict).

The Applicable Law: What Makes a “Non-International Armed Conflict”?

The administration has claimed that the operations against the drug cartels are occurring in the context of a non-international armed conflict (NIAC) that triggers the applicability of LOAC. This assertion is unambiguously incorrect as a matter of law, a point illustrated by the near universal rejection of it among LOAC experts.

Non-international armed conflict must be distinguished from international armed conflict (IAC), which is a conflict between States. In a NIAC, armed hostilities exist between a State and a non-State entity that qualifies under LOAC as an “organized armed group” (OAG).

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was the first body to address the nature of non-international armed conflict in any depth. In its first case, Tadić, the ICTY explained that a NIAC is characterized by “protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State” (Jurisdiction, ¶ 70).

Many subsequent decisions of international courts have unpacked this characterization. For instance, in Limaj, the ICTY, citing Tadić, observed, “The two determinative elements of an armed conflict, intensity of the conflict and level of organisation of the parties, are used ‘solely for the purpose, as a minimum, of distinguishing an armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections, or terrorist activities, which are not subject to international humanitarian law’” (Judgment, ¶ 89). In other words, pure criminality, even if violent, does not qualify. The DoD Law of War has embraced such organization and intensity criteria for NIAC (§ 17.1.1).

Importantly, to reach the threshold for a NIAC, the conflict situation in question must be military in character. As noted by the ICTY in Haradinaj, “an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means” (Judgement, ¶ 60). It explained that the indicia of qualification as an OAG include

the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms within the group; the existence of a headquarters; the fact that the group controls a certain territory; the ability of the group to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, including troop movements and logistics; its ability to define a unified military strategy and use military tactics; and its ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords (¶ 60; see also DoD Law of War Manual, p. 85).

And that tribunal addressed the requisite intensity for a NIAC in its Boskoski Trial Chamber judgment (¶ 177).

Various indicative factors have been taken into account by Trial Chambers to assess the ‘intensity’ of the conflict. These include the seriousness of attacks and whether there has been an increase in armed clashes, the spread of clashes over territory and over a period of time, any increase in the number of government forces and mobilisation and the distribution of weapons among both parties to the conflict, as well as whether the conflict has attracted the attention of the United Nations Security Council, and whether any resolutions on the matter have been passed. Trial Chambers have also taken into account in this respect the number of civilians forced to flee from the combat zones; the type of weapons used, in particular the use of heavy weapons, and other military equipment, such as tanks and other heavy vehicles; the blocking or besieging of towns and the heavy shelling of these towns; the extent of destruction and the number of casualties caused by shelling or fighting; the quantity of troops and units deployed; existence and change of front lines between the parties; the occupation of territory, and towns and villages; the deployment of government forces to the crisis area; the closure of roads; cease fire orders and agreements, and the attempt of representatives from international organisations to broker and enforce cease fire agreements.

It is clear that the hostilities between the United States and Tren de Aragua, or any other cartel, did not on Sept. 2, and almost certainly do not now, comprise a NIAC. Indeed, hostile action using military means has been engaged in only by the United States, not by any cartel or criminal gang against us. The gangs and cartels are involved in criminality when they are trafficking drugs, to be sure, but they are not organized militarily to engage in military operations.

There is the possible exception of a few groups that have been in conflicts within the States in which they are based, but not with the United States, such as the ELN in Colombia (this surely does not extend to the vast majority of the reportedly 24 groups the president has directed the U.S. military to target with lethal force, and the administration has not disclosed which groups are the 24 listed). Yet, even groups like the ELN that might be organized militarily or have a military wing are not and have not in the past been directing hostilities at the United States, and certainly not by virtue of smuggling drugs, which is not a hostile act or an attack.

In short, this is not, even by the most liberal interpretation of the term, a non-international armed conflict. We find it difficult to imagine how any executive branch lawyer could have reached a different conclusion.

The Applicable Law on Targeting in These Operations

As we and others have repeatedly noted (see e.g., here, here, here), in the absence of an armed conflict, whether international or non-international, the applicable international law governing the targeting of boats with people aboard is international human rights law (IHRL). Under IHRL, life may not be taken by a State “arbitrarily,” a right recognized by the United States to apply extraterritorially (U.S. Army’s Operational Law Handbook, pages 98-99; see also Ryan’s explanation). As noted by the UN Human Rights Committee in General Comment 36, the right to life extends to persons “located outside any territory effectively controlled by the State whose right to life is nonetheless affected by its military or other activities in a direct and reasonably foreseeable manner” (¶ 63).

There are clear IHRL standards for determining when lethal actions are arbitrary. The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, for example, explains that “intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life,” and only in the case of an “imminent threat of death or serious injury.” And even in such cases, lethal force is arbitrary if “less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives” (¶ 9; see also Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, art. 3, commentary). Although framed in the context of law enforcement, the principles reflect the IHRL standard of arbitrariness binding on State organs that use lethal force, including the armed forces (which are sometimes used to support law enforcement activity, such as in maritime drug interdiction operations). Case law applies these principles of customary international law (i.e., that no more force “than is absolutely necessary in defence of persons from unlawful violence”) even to situations in which people killed by the State were in fact terrorists (e.g., McCann), which is not the case with the boat strikes in Operation Southern Spear.

It is noteworthy that there is both international law and extensive State practice regarding the interdiction of drug trafficking at sea. For instance, Article 108 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea obligates States to cooperate in the suppression of illicit drug trafficking at sea, whereas Article 110 allows for the boarding of ships that are “without nationality,” as is likely to have been the case in these operations. Although the United States is not a Party to the Convention, it has often cooperated with other States in maritime drug interdiction and recognizes Article 110 as reflecting customary law. Moreover, Article 17 of the Narcotics Suppression Convention, to which the United States is Party, provides well-established procedures for the interdiction of suspected drug smuggling. Nevertheless, it cautions that “the Parties concerned shall take due account of the need not to endanger the safety of life at sea.” The point is that there is a robust international law framework for interdicting drugs at sea in place, and it does not include the use of lethal force. The United States has long been a key player in conducting these operations, often in cooperation with partners.

The U.S. Navy/Marine Corps/Coast Guard Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations provides detailed guidance on how force may be used when conducting maritime counterdrug operations. For example, it sets out when the use of warning shots and disabling fire is appropriate. However, the guidance is clear that the sole basis for employing force against individuals or vessels at the lethal level is the “commander’s inherent authority and obligation to use all necessary means available and take all appropriate action in self-defense of the commander’s unit and other U.S. forces in the vicinity” (ch. 3).

In this regard, the Commander’s Handbook emphasizes(§ 4.4.1.2) that in maritime law enforcement (MLE) operations, which exclude operations during armed conflict, the Standing Rules on the Use of Force (SRUF) apply. According to the SRUF,

Normally, force is to be used only as a last resort, and the force used should be the minimum necessary. The use of force must be reasonable in intensity, duration and magnitude based on the totality of circumstances to counter the threat. If force is required, non-deadly force is authorized and may be used to control a situation and accomplish the mission, or to provide self-defense of DOD forces, defense of non-DoD persons in the vicinity if directly related to the assigned mission, or in defense of the protected property, when doing so is reasonable under the circumstances.

As the discussion illustrates, the applicable law is simple. Because there is no armed conflict, international human rights law governs the U.S. operations. The law does not allow for the use of deadly force except in situations where it is employed to safeguard life. Moreover, as counterdrug operations, there is no legal basis for using deadly force during them except in situations of defense of self or others. On the contrary, there are international agreements governing how such operations must be conducted, as well as clear guidance to U.S. forces on the use of force during them. These strikes conducted to date are clear violations of U.S. obligations under international human rights law (and may also amount to crimes, including murder, by some of those involved under the domestic law of States having jurisdiction over the offenses).

The Inapplicable Law on Targeting in These Operations: the Law of Armed Conflict

As explained above, the United States is not mounting these operations during an armed conflict, yet the administration continues to claim involvement in a NIAC. It would be difficult to accept that the government lawyers providing advice on these operations simply do not understand the law that applies, since the legal criteria for triggering a NIAC are uncontroversial, relatively straightforward, long settled in the executive branch (including DoD), and clearly not satisfied in these circumstances.

It is more likely that the United States is seeking to take advantage of the fact that targeting during an armed conflict is more permissive, and have for that reason attempted to create a legal theory that would purport to justify the targeting program that began on Sept. 2. Notably, targeting based solely on an individual’s status is sometimes permissible in a NIAC, whereas outside armed conflict, lethal force may be employed, as explained above, only against an individual based on that person’s conduct, specifically conduct posing a threat to life. Since it is self-evident that no one aboard any of the boats being struck presents an imminent threat to anyone, the administration is likely trying to get around that fact by asserting a right to engage in NIAC status-based targeting. But that attempt does not work: neither the people aboard the boats nor the boats themselves would be lawful targets even if there were an armed conflict, which we emphasize, there is not.

During a NIAC, there are three categories of people that a State’s armed forces may attack, including by lethal means. Not only may these individuals be killed, but harm to them does not factor into the LOAC proportionality analysis or the requirement to take precautions in attack to minimize any harm to civilians. The sole exception is when they are hors de combat due to capture, wounds, or being shipwrecked. The last category may seem relevant based on accounts of the Sept. 2 re-attack that killed two survivors, but that issue would only come into play if they were targetable in the first place. They were not.

Members of dissident armed forces: The first category of targetable persons during a NIAC consists of “dissident armed forces,” that is, units of the armed forces that have turned their guns on the government. This category is obviously irrelevant in the current circumstances.

Members of an organized armed group: The second category consists of members of an organized armed group. As noted in the DoD Law of War Manual, “members of hostile, non-State armed groups may be made the object of attack unless they are placed hors de combat” (§ 5.8.2.1). Yet, as explained in detail above, almost none of the cartels against which the United States is using force qualify as an OAG in the LOAC sense. They are not organized to engage in military-like operations, are not armed to do so, and have conducted no armed operations against U.S. forces. On the contrary, their organization and activities are those of a purely criminal organization, which at times engages in violence, but not to fight against the United States in any systemic way. This being so, its members are not subject to status-based targeting based on OAG membership. The few cartels or criminal groups that do arguably qualify as OAGs based on the intensity and nature of the hostilities they engage in against the State concerned, such as ELN in Colombia or Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación and the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. But they are not mounting armed operations against the United States.

We note that at times there are groups that have sub-components that are organized to engage in systemic violence against a State. The paradigmatic example is Hamas, which performed governmental functions in Gaza, but also has an armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, dedicated to conducting military operations against Israel. In that case, Hamas did not qualify as an OAG, but the al-Qassam Brigades did, and its members were subject to being targeted by Israel. However, none of the groups targeted by the United States has an armed wing, the mission of which is to conduct hostilities against the United States, whatever the reason for doing so.

Accordingly, no one aboard the boats is targetable as an OAG member.

Directly participating in hostilities: This leaves the final category, individuals who are directly participating in the hostilities. Under treaty law applicable in both international and non-international armed conflict, such individuals may be attacked in certain circumstances (AP I, art. 51(3); AP II, art. 13(3)). Although the United States is not a Party to the relevant treaties, it recognizes that their provisions on direct participation generally reflect customary law. Extracts from the DoD Law of War Manual are instructive in understanding the U.S. view of direct participation.

At a minimum, taking a direct part in hostilities includes actions that are, by their nature and purpose, intended to cause actual harm to the enemy. Taking a direct part in hostilities extends beyond merely engaging in combat and also includes certain acts that are an integral part of combat operations or that effectively and substantially contribute to an adversary’s ability to conduct or sustain combat operations § 5.8.3).

The emphasis is on a direct nexus to “combat” operations. This is clear from the examples the Manual provides of acts qualifying as direct participation. Of direct relevance in this case is the example the Manual provides on “delivering ammunition to the front lines” (5.8.3.1). This example served as the basis for extensive discussion during an ICRC expert project that led to the publication of its Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities (prior to issuance of the Law of War Manual). One of us was a member of the international group and can attest that the following analysis was unanimously acceptable to the members.

The delivery by a civilian truck driver of ammunition to an active firing position at the front line would almost certainly have to be regarded as an integral part of ongoing combat operations and, therefore, as direct participation in hostilities. Transporting ammunition from a factory to a port for further shipping to a storehouse in a conflict zone, on the other hand, is too remote from the use of that ammunition in specific military operations to cause the ensuing harm directly. Although the ammunition truck remains a legitimate military objective, the driving of the truck would not amount to direct participation in hostilities and would not deprive a civilian driver of protection against direct attack. Therefore, any direct attack against the truck would have to take the probable death of the civilian driver into account in the proportionality assessment.

The basis for the conclusion was that the causal connection between the act (transporting ammunition) and the harm caused (use of the ammunition against the enemy) was too attenuated to amount to direct participation, except in cases of delivery to the front. The experts agreed that transportation other than to those who would use the ammunition was “indirect” rather than “direct,” pointing in particular to the lack of temporal or geographic proximity. It was this analysis that led to the “to the front lines” caveat in the Manual.

Putting aside the self-evident fact that delivering drugs to be sold cannot be characterized as “hostilities,” the transportation of drugs to be distributed to unknown buyers at some point in the future is even more attenuated than the transportation of the ammunition to ports to be carried to known units near the front.

Applying the DoD standard (which, we emphasize, does not apply outside of armed conflict), individuals transporting drugs aboard a boat to be sold at an onward destination are not “directly participating in hostilities.” That means they are not targetable on that basis either.

Finally, we discuss below the insurmountable problems in any attempt to consider the drugs or boats targetable as “war-sustaining” objects. But assuming, even in the best case scenario for the administration, that they are targetable war-sustaining objects (again a truly insurmountable “if”), that would mean there is even greater reason civilians involved in transporting such objects can never be considered direct participants in hostilities. If a civilian driving an ammunition truck away from the frontlines of a real war cannot be considered a direct participant in hostilities (consensus view discussed above), a civilian operating a vehicle (here a boat) involved in war-sustaining (revenue generating) activities surely cannot be. Indeed, the Department of Defense, despite external political pressure, concluded that the truck drivers bringing the Islamic State’s oil to market were civilians (see Department of Defense General Counsel Remarks 2016).

Drug boats as military objectives? This leaves open only the possibility that the people on the boats may lawfully be harmed in an attack if the drug boats constitute military objectives subject to attack under the law of armed conflict (which we remind readers does not apply in any event). As accurately explained in the DoD Law of War Manual, reciting well-accepted treaty and customary law, military objectives “include any object which by its nature, location, purpose or use makes an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage” (§ 5.6.3). Whether the boats qualify as military objectives depends, therefore, on whether their use at the time of the strike contributed to the gang or cartel’s “military action” and whether destroying the boats would result in a “definite military advantage” for the United States.

By the prevailing view, drug-related facilities, equipment, and assets do not qualify as military objectives. Indeed, precisely this issue became contentious among NATO forces during International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) operations in Afghanistan. The American NATO Supreme Allied Commander and Secretary of Defense argued that drug producers/traffickers and narcotics-related assets generating funds for the insurgency could be attacked. The German Commander of Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum and the ISAF Commander, an American, countered that this position violated international law. The latter position prevailed within NATO, and an accommodation was reached in 2008 whereby the drug assets related to the insurgency could be destroyed in support of Afghanistan’s counter-drug law enforcement effort.

Since no gangs or cartels are involved in military action against the United States, and the United States gets no military advantage from destroying them, boats used to transport drugs, by the plain text of the rule, cannot qualify as military objectives subject to attack. This leaves only the possibility of the drugs themselves. In other words, if the law of armed conflict applied, which it does not, could the boats be lawfully attacked, subject to other targeting rules like proportionality and precautions in attack, because there were targetable drugs on board?

Drugs as “war-sustaining” objects? The only conceivable basis for the argument that the drugs were targetable was that they were so-called “war-sustaining” objects. Although it is not the prevailing view among States, the United States has long asserted that war-sustaining entities are legitimate military objectives, a position with which one of us agrees (DoD Law of War Manual, § 5.6.8). A war-sustaining entity “indirectly, but effectively supports and sustains the belligerents’ warfighting capability,” such as “imports of raw materials used for the production of armaments and exports of products the proceeds of which are used by the belligerent to purchase arms and armaments” (Commander’s Handbook, § 7.4).

This position is reported to be relied on in the OLC memo purporting to justify the boat strikes, so we will unpack why the “war-sustaining” objects theory fails in this context.

Even accepting the U.S. position that war-sustaining objects are targetable, the boats and their drugs would not qualify, because there is no war to sustain. Unlike the drugs in the Afghanistan case, or the export products in the Commander’s Handbook example, the proceeds of the sale of cartel or criminal gang-supplied drugs are not being used to sustain hostilities against the United States (or anyone else, with the limited exception explained below). They are not being used, for instance, to purchase arms that will be used against U.S. forces or pay the salaries of an armed wing that is conducting hostilities against them.

Assuming war-sustaining objects can be lawfully targeted, the argument that drugs are such objects might work in the case of cartels that qualify as OAGs engaged in hostilities against the State in which they operate, if drug sales do in fact fund their military operations. But taking the Sept. 2 strike against Tren de Aragua, for example, there is no gang or cartel “war effort” to sustain in the first place. This would be the case for nearly all of the cartels and criminal groups reportedly being targeted in the U.S. campaign. (We should note that even for those few cartels that do qualify as OAGs, and that are involved in conflict against a State in which they operate, the United States would not have a legal basis to enter that conflict absent a request from that State to do so. This is plainly not the case here – the relevant States in the region have strenuously objected to the U.S. campaign, several publicly calling for it to be stopped, or calling the killings “murder.”)

Simply put, absent actual military operations against the United States on the part of the group concerned, the “war-sustaining” justification for striking boats transporting drugs falls apart, even under the inapplicable law of armed conflict that the administration purports to operate under.

Concluding Thoughts

Despite the fervent debates about whether the operations as a whole, or individual strikes, violated the law of armed conflict, and may even have been war crimes by those involved, the correct legal regime governing them is international human rights law. That law imposes a stringent necessity standard according to which lethal force is lawful only in the face of an imminent threat to life, and then only in the absence of other means of responding to that threat in the circumstances. None of those aboard the boats that have been struck posed an imminent deadly threat to anyone.

But even if the law of armed conflict applied, and it decidedly does not, neither those on the boats nor the drugs and the boats in which they were transported qualified as lawful military objectives under that body of law. The gangs or cartels do not qualify as organized armed groups; thus, their members are not subject to status-based targeting. Those aboard the boats are not targetable as direct participants in the hostilities, because they are merely transporting the drugs, and not in temporal or geographical proximity to any location where they might somehow contribute to the cartel’s or gang’s purported “combat.” And finally, the drugs do not qualify as military objectives by even the controversial war-sustaining approach because there are no hostilities against the United States by the gangs or cartels involved to sustain.

It is the second such deportation flight after a rare agreement between Washington and Tehran, which do not have diplomatic relations, amid the Trump administration’s extreme push to expel undocumented immigrants.

There are serious concerns from human rights and advocacy organizations about the Iranians who fled to the US and may now be forced to return. The State Department’s latest human rights report, issued under the Trump administration, said there are “significant human rights issues” in Iran.

One person who said they are expected to be on the deportation flight Sunday said their life will be at risk if they return.

The person, who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation, said he fled Iran because of his sexuality. Homosexuality is punishable by death in Iran.

“I suffered a lot in country for what I am,” he said, telling CNN he was tortured and raped in Iran.

He said he came to the US “just to have a normal life like everyone else.” He was detained after crossing the border in the waning days of the Biden administration, after traveling months and being robbed and beaten en route to the US. He said he has suffered abuse and discrimination while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention.

CNN cannot independently confirm the man’s account. The person said he had filed for asylum, but the status of his application is unclear.

“Definitely my life is at risk if I return to my country,” he said.

The National Iranian American Council, a nonprofit organization, called on the administration to halt the flight.

“Iranians like the ones on this imminent deportation flight come here to escape government repression. It is disturbing that, instead of honoring their asylum claims and offering them safety, our own government may be violating their human rights and compounding the harm done to them with abuses in detention,” the group’s president, Jamal Abdi, said in a statement.

According to the source familiar with Sunday’s deportation flight, it is expected to stop in Kuwait en route to Iran. The first deportation flight was in September.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Iranian Mission to the UN for comment.

ICE declined to confirm reporting by BBC Persian about the deportations, without denying the planned operation, citing “the safety of the flight and its passengers.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/251208614ead376f51622ad51eb6a000,N,,2025-12-07 14:56:38.314625

Trump has spent much of his term criticizing former President Biden’s use of the pardon power, at times suggesting Biden’s pardons are “null and void” because of allegations Biden used an autopen to sign them.

At the same time, Trump has leaned into his own use of the pardon power to benefit Republicans and his allies. And Trump has frequently appeared motivated by anger over his own indictments during the Biden administration, insisting those he has pardoned were similarly victimized.

Trump began his second term by granting clemency to nearly all defendants connected to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

Since then, he has granted clemency to multiple Republicans who had been convicted of crimes and pardoned the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which has business ties to the Trump family.

Most recently, Trump has attracted criticism from Democrats and Republicans over his decision to pardon Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras who had been convicted of narcotics crimes last year in a case first started during Trump’s first term. Even some in the GOP have questioned Trump’s decision given his administration’s very public campaign to target drug-carrying vessels with military strikes.

“The pardons Trump is handing out are a huge, growing scandal that not enough people are talking about,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said this week. “This is a money making operation – for Trump, his family, his crypto pals, and the Trump-affiliated lobbyists and grifters who the pardon seekers pay.”

Trump has been defiant in the face of criticism and questions about his decisions on whom to pardon. The president and White House officials have frequently defended Trump’s pardon decisions by arguing that they are a counter to what they view as a weaponized Justice Department during the Biden administration.

“President Trump has exercised his constitutional authority to issue pardons and commutations for a variety of individuals. And the only pardons anyone should be critical of are from President Autopen, who pardoned and commuted sentences of violent criminals including child killers and mass murderers– and that’s not to mention the proactive pardons he ‘signed’ for his family members like Hunter on his way out the door,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.

Trump’s pardons reentered the spotlight this week when he pardoned Hernández, who was convicted in June 2024 of conspiring to distribute more than 400 tons of cocaine and accepting millions of dollars in bribes from traffickers to facilitate the shipment of those drugs.

“He was the president, and they had some drugs being sold in their country, and because he was the president they went after him. That was a Biden horrible witch hunt,” Trump said of his decision.

The pardon drew rebukes from both sides of the aisle, including from lawmakers who questioned whether it sent contradictory messages given the Trump administration’s military campaign targeting alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean.

“I hate it. It’s a horrible message,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told reporters this week. “It’s confusing to say on the one hand we should potentially even consider invading Venezuela for drug traffick[ing], and on the other hand let somebody go.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued Trump’s pardon was not at odds with his broader agenda.

“I think that President Trump has been quite clear in his defense of the United States homeland to stop these illegal narcotics from coming to our borders, whether that’s by land or by sea,” Leavitt told reporters. “And he’s also made it quite clear that he wants to correct the wrongs of the weaponized Justice Department under the previous administration.”

It was the latest instance of the White House going on defense over Trump’s use of his pardon power in recent weeks.

Trump drew scrutiny for his pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and later attempted to downplay the move by suggesting he did not know who Zhao was when he issued the pardon.

As was the case with the Hernández pardon, the White House at the time argued that Trump was correcting a case of over-prosecution during the Biden administration.

The White House made the same argument this week when asked about Trump’s decision to commute the sentence of David Gentile, a former private equity executive who had been convicted of fraud in 2024.

“At trial, the government was unable to tie any supposedly fraudulent representations to Mr. Gentile,” Leavitt said at a press briefing. “This is another example that has been brought to the president’s attention of the weaponization of justice from the previous administration, and therefore, he signed this commutation.”

Trump again pointed to allegations that the Biden administration acted unfairly when he announced this week that he was pardoning Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) and his wife, Imelda, who last year were indicted on charges related to allegedly accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes and laundering the funds.

While some pundits questioned whether the pardon could help the Texas Democrat keep his seat in a tough election next year, Trump made clear his motivation was undoing what he saw as a politically motivated indictment brought by the Biden administration

“Sleepy Joe went after the Congressman, and even the Congressman’s wonderful wife, Imelda, simply for speaking the TRUTH,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Cuellar became the latest lawmaker who had faced charges related to bribery, fraud or corruption to receive a pardon.

The president earlier this year commuted the sentence of George Santos, the former Republican representative who was expelled from the House and who had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He also pardoned former Republican Rep. Michael Grimm (N.Y.), who had been convicted of felony tax fraud. And Trump pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat who has become an outspoken Trump supporter after serving time in prison on corruption charges.

A White House official pointed to comments Leavitt made last month, when she told reporters the administration treats pardons “with the utmost seriousness.”

“He’s the ultimate, final decision maker,” Leavitt said of Trump. “And he was very clear when he came into office that he was most interested in looking at pardoning individuals who were abused and used by the Biden Department of Justice, and were over prosecuted by a weaponized DOJ.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/trumpdonald_111325gn17_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-07 12:57:40.561937

The United States and Iran do not have direct diplomatic relations, and most interactions are conducted through intermediary parties. However, the transfer of deportees involved an unusual amount of coordination between Washington and Tehran.

Accusations Against Iran

Washington and its Western allies have slapped severe financial sanctions on Tehran, accusing it of attempting to develop a nuclear weapon and of supporting extremist violence in the Middle East. Iran denies the allegations.

Human rights advocates have consistently urged the United States not to expel individuals to countries with poor rights records. Iran’s record, they say, is among the worst.

The Islamic republic continues widespread persecution of political dissidents, activists, religious minorities, and LGBTQ individuals.

In recent years, significant numbers of Iranians have joined larger migrant flows through Central America into the United States, citing those same risks as reasons for seeking asylum.

US authorities in September said the government had identified some 400 Iranians to be deported.

Following the first deportations, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson was quoted by AP as saying: “The Trump Administration is committed to fulfilling President Trump’s promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation of illegal aliens in history, using all the tools at our disposal.”

The United States in early December paused all pending immigration application for nationals from 19 countries, including Iran, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.

The move followed the attack on two US National Guard members three blocks from the White House by a suspect authorities say entered the United States from Afghanistan in 2021.

The man was charged with murder after one of the National Guard members died. The other victim remains hospitalized.

Will the administration actually meet Trump's deadline of Dec. 18 for implementing the gold card?","By Victor Reklaitis

'This program is not going to be as easy as the administration initially claimed,' says one expert in immigration law

The Trump administration's ""gold card"" immigration program is due to be implemented by Dec. 18, according to an executive order issued in September.

President Donald Trump proposed a new ""gold card"" visa program in February, then in September ordered his administration to ""take all necessary and appropriate steps"" by Dec. 18 to implement the program, which aims to attract well-off immigrants who would pay $1 million each to the U.S. government for immigration status.

With Trump's deadline approaching, is the U.S. now close to seeing a big influx of gold-card holders - wealthy masses yearning to breathe free, so to speak?

Not exactly, as uptake may take time, according to immigration experts.

""I think there will be relatively few applicants at the beginning, but maybe in a year or two, we'll start to see an uptick in applications,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an expert in immigration law who retired last year after decades as a professor of immigration practice at Cornell Law School.

Another immigration program, known as the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, launched in 1990 and only started to take off a couple of years later after Congress made changes to it, he noted.

It's a ""good first step"" that the administration has released a draft form for the gold card, but the form reveals details that indicate ""that this program is not going to be as easy as the administration initially claimed,"" Yale-Loehr said.

Those details include a $15,000 application fee; a required gift of $1 million per person, rather than just $1 million per family; a vetting process that looks at whether applicants got their $1 million in a valid way; and the program's reliance on existing green-card categories known as EB-1 and EB-2, ""each of which have backlogs for certain countries,"" according to Yale-Loehr. That reliance on existing categories likely means Congress won't need to pass a new law, but the gold card is going to have to be codified in new regulations eventually, he added.

David J. Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said he has doubts that the Trump administration has the authority to do what it's doing without action by Congress, and he also has concerns about the gold card's high price. Those issues could lead to low demand for the new program in the weeks and months ahead, according to Bier.

""People are not going to want to pay for something that might be suddenly deemed unlawful - and then what's the process to get your money back?"" he told MarketWatch. Bier said it's a good idea in theory to let people simply pay a fee to immigrate to the U.S., given how difficult it is to immigrate legally, but added that the gold card's price tag of $1 million is probably too high.

Price cut from $5 million

In February, the president called for a ""Trump gold card"" program that would provide foreign investors who put up at least $5 million with U.S. residency and a path to citizenship. Then, in his Sept. 19 executive order, the president cut the required amount for the gold-card holder's ""unrestricted gift"" to the U.S. Commerce Department to $1 million, or $2 million if a corporation or other entity is donating on behalf of an individual.

In June, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said around 70,000 people had signed up at that point on the administration's waitlist for gold cards.

So-called golden visa programs exist in many parts of the globe - in the Caribbean, the Middle East, throughout Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region, including in Australia and Hong Kong, as MarketWatch has reported. The programs often call for foreign investors to invest capital into a specific fund that a nation sets up to pay for some objective, and they're rewarded with legal residency and sometimes even citizenship in that country. One key downside is the programs tend to spark concerns that investors are helping to drive up home prices.

Yale-Loehr said there's likely to be criticism of Trump's gold card from either end of the political spectrum. ""Progressive will say people should not be allowed to buy their way into the United States; MAGA types will say we shouldn't be encouraging any type of legal immigration,"" he said.

Single individuals could be most likely to apply for the gold card rather than investors with families, since unlike the long-running EB-5 program, the new card doesn't require a plan to create at least 10 U.S. jobs, according to Yale-Loehr. ""But if I'm a family of four and I want to immigrate to the U.S., that's $4 million, so that gets a little pricey,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the EB-5 program offers visas for a family in exchange for an investment of at least $800,000. The administration has indicated it would like to get rid of EB-5 visas, but experts say that only Congress could do that.

Will the administration actually meet Trump's deadline of Dec. 18 for implementing the gold card?

""They can always put out a form and ask for money,"" Cato's Bier said. ""Putting out a form isn't hard, so if the president wants to get it done, I think it will happen.""

The White House didn't respond to MarketWatch's request for comment.

Trump's September executive order said the steps that must be completed by Dec. 18 include specifying the date on which individuals or sponsors can start giving their $1 million or $2 million gifts.

She told the Post she has been unable to speak with her son since her arrest.","The mother of Karoline Leavitt’s nephew has spoken out against how the administration has characterized her and her relationship to the White House press secretary, saying ""why they’re creating this narrative is beyond my wildest imagination.”

In an interview with The Washington Post, published Sunday, Bruna Ferreira called the White House’s depiction of her as an absentee mother “disgusting,” and said she ""made a mistake"" in trusting Leavitt to be her son's godmother.

Newsweek contacted the White House via email on Sunday for comment.

Why It Matters

Ferreira’s arrest drew national attention due to her association with Leavitt, a leading figure within the administration and among the most ardent champions of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration. Since that time, the White House has depicted the 33-year-old—her relationship with her son, the press secretary and the broader Leavitt family—in a way that sharply contrasts with her own account.

What To Know

Ferreira, who has a child with the White House press secretary's older brother, Michael Leavitt, was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on November 12. Ferreira is a Brazilian national who traveled to the U.S. legally at the age of 6 and previously held Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status.

The Post reported that she was detained for remaining in the U.S. unlawfully after overstaying her visa as a child.

In a recent interview with Newsweek, Ferreira’s attorney Todd Pomerleau said that his client has no criminal record and maintains close ties to the Leavitt family, contrary to the administration’s portrayal.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously told Newsweek that Ferreira had an arrest for battery on her record, and in a statement to CNN, the DHS called Ferreira a “criminal illegal alien from Brazil.”

White House press secretary Leavitt has said that anyone living in the country illegally will be considered a ""criminal,"" subjecting nonviolent migrants without legal status to the immigration raids that have swept the country since Trump returned to office.

Ferreira’s attorney told the Post that any reference to a criminal record could refer to a 2008 incident when she, then 16, was involved in a fight. However, Pomerleau said his that client was never arrested and that the case was dismissed.

Ferreira also rejected any claim that she does not have a close relationship with the White House press secretary herself.

“I asked Karoline to be godmother over my only sister,” she told the Post in a video interview from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, where she is currently being held. “I made a mistake there.”

What People Are Saying

Michael Leavitt told The Washington Post via text that he “had no involvement” in Ferreira’s arrest and added: “I want my son to have a relationship with his mother as I always have shown that.”

Ferreira’s attorney Todd Pomerleau told Newsweek in a recent interview: “She doesn't have any bad blood with any of the Leavitts. She wasn't in any battle with the Leavitts. This isn't a War of the Roses. She was engaged to one of them, and it didn't work out like countless other relationships in the world. They were two young people. They loved each other. They had a child together. They were engaged, and then their relationship just ended like so many others.""

The anti-ICE nativity scene was placed outside the St. Susanna Catholic church in Dedham, Mass., a suburb outside Boston.

The display also had a sign with the contact number for a group that monitors immigration operations.

The Archdiocese of Boston blasted the display as “divisive political messaging” and called for it to be removed, saying it violated Catholic doctrine.

“The display should be removed, and the manger restored to its proper sacred purpose,” the Archdiocese said in a statement.

“The people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging, the Church’s norms prohibit the use of sacred objects for any purpose other than the devotion of God’s people,” the spokesman said.

“The actions of the activist reverend, Stephen Josoma, are absolutely abhorrent and add to a dangerous narrative responsible for a more than 1,150% increase in assaults on ICE officers,” Lyons told Fox News Digital.

There have been over 250 attacks on ICE officers this year, along with an increase in doxxing, stalking and death threats.

Father Stephen Josoma, the pastor at St. Susanna’s, told Fox News Digital that the purpose of the nativity scene is to “try to see what would it be like if Christ was born into the context of the world today.”

Josoma defended the display as “religious art” and said it was intended to provoke “emotions in people.”

“It’s supposed to affect people deeply, it’s supposed to move people, it’s supposed to change people, so, if this evokes a strong reaction, it’s maybe good to take a look at that,” Josoma said.

This is not the first controversial nativity scene the pastor has erected in front of his church. In 2018, he placed Baby Jesus in a cage away from his parents to protest Trump’s immigration policies.

More than 5,400 children were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border during Trump’s first term.

The pastor has also erected nativity scenes that touched on gun control and climate change in years past.

“[Josoma] has become infamous for using his pulpit to advance his activist agenda and has now caught the attention of the Archdiocese of Boston, which has publicly condemned his most recent political stunt… I applaud the Catholic Church and the Archdiocese for taking a stand against such a dangerous and extremist narrative,” Lyons said.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/nativity-scene.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1765064017&w=1200,N,,2025-12-07 09:56:31.745432

Protesters at the scene say the standoff began shortly before 10 a.m. in the 1600 block of Maple Lane when someone being pursued by federal agents ran into a second-floor unit of an apartment complex and was pushed onto the balcony by residents inside.

Around 3 p.m., agents could be seen escorting the man from the second floor of the complex.

Elgin-born state Sen. Cristina Castro was among those present Saturday afternoon as agents detained the man.

“Some folks were throwing him blankets and food, and ICE had all this region surrounded [and] eventually broke in, grabbed him, and yanked him out,” Castro said.

Several dozen protesters were in the neighborhood providing supplies to the man as he stayed on the balcony, witnesses said.

Several canisters of tear gas were deployed by agents and some protesters threw snow and water bottles back at agents.

Mikey Calderon has lived in the area where the standoff occurred for five years and woke up to the sound of cars with their horns blaring down the street.

He said tear gas was deployed earlier in the day because of an altercation between a protester and an agent, but he chose to stick around to help support his community.

“It’s kind of amazing to see the community come together and try to minimize the situation and see what we could do to make a difference,” Calderon, 20, said.

“It’s heartbreaking,” Calderon added. “There’s other ways to go about it than to tear these families apart by force.”

Castro, the state lawmaker, urged onlookers to continue to record federal agents as they conducted raids.

“They are obviously facing their own challenges in courts, but they still want to antagonize people, antagonize my city,” Castro said.

“A lot of people who live in this city, live in this city because they want to live the American Dream,” Castro added.

She says that federal agents are “striking fear in this community, and it’s unacceptable.”

With the possibility of agents returning at greater strength in the spring, Castro recommends staying vigilant but to also check in on neighbors.

“If you know anyone that might be afraid right now, offer to bring their groceries [or] offer to take their kids to school,” Castro said. “It means a lot to them that there are a lot of good people in the community and in others that care.”",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=8555d6bc-e205-50d6-aaab-7856375f4912&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-12-07 10:57:45.311056

One of them, Sarah Beckstrom, has died. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who worked for the CIA before the Taliban took control of his country. He was admitted to the U.S. in 2021 and granted asylum in April 2025.

“The animal,” President Trump declared, “will pay a very steep price.”

He subsequently ordered the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Service and other relevant federal agencies to “re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden”; suspend all pending Green Card requests from Afghans; “permanently pause” migration from all Third World nations; and denaturalize immigrants currently living in the U.S. “who undermine domestic tranquility” or “don’t add benefit our country.” Trump also claimed that immigration posed “the single greatest national security threat to our nation”; and that “only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.”

To justify his policies, Trump is relying on a variant of an old fallacy. Instead of punishing individuals because they are members of certain organizations or nationalities, Trump’s version of guilt by association punishes an entire group of people because of the behavior of just one of its members.

Impervious to logic, evidence and the principles of individual rights and responsibilities enshrined in American law and morality, guilt by association is almost infinitely expandable. Trump is ramping up the template he used for the murder of University of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley in 2024, when he promised to end the “staggering increase in violent crime” committed by immigrants who are “poisoning the blood of our country.”

He is considering deporting Lakanwal’s wife and family. After telling reporters there were “a lot of problems with Afghans,” the president then declared that Somalis were taking over the state of Minnesota. Asked what this claim had to do with the shooting in D.C, he responded, “Ah, nothing, but Somalis have caused a lot of trouble.”

Meanwhile, Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a staunch Trump ally, endorsed “deportation of any Islamist.” And Kristi Noem, Trump’s secretary of Homeland Security, advocated “a total travel ban on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches and entitlement junkies.”

Numerous studies, however, have demonstrated that a migrant crime wave does not exist in the U.S. In 2017, for example, Afghan immigrants age 18-54 were less than one-tenth as likely to be incarcerated as native-born Americans. And Trump’s 2017 travel ban on refugees from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Syria had no effect on crime rates.

Between 2017 and 2022, when the immigrant population grew by 1.7 million, total crime nationwide dropped by 15.3 percent. Immigrants were less likely than native-born citizens to be arrested for felonies or incarcerated. Violent crime in cities where the immigrant population grew actually went down, and undocumented immigrants were half as likely to go to jail for violent and property crimes than individuals who were born in the United States.

Given Trump’s claim that immigrants have “wrecked the standard of living,” it’s worth noting that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that from 2024-2034, the surge in immigration during previous decades will increase Gross Domestic Product by $8.9 trillion, raise tax revenues by $1.2 trillion and reduce the deficit by $900 billion.

Afghan immigrants alluded to this evidence indirectly as they tried to stop the administration from imposing collective punishment on them. The Afghan Community Coalition of the United States expressed horror at the D.C. shootings and sympathy for the victims. One Afghan indicated that he and his fellow immigrants are “hardworking, tax paying members of society.” Another, also speaking anonymously, emphasized that the suspect acted “without any support, participation, and cooperation of others,” and “should not be counted for [against] the whole community.”

Recent polls indicate a substantial shift in public opinion about immigrants and immigration policies. Fifty-four percent of Americans still support Trump’s handling of border security, and a substantial majority agree that immigrants who are here illegally should be deported. But only 45 percent of Americans approve of the president’s handling of immigration. Substantial majorities oppose deporting children who enter the U.S. illegally and using the military to find and detain undocumented immigrants. A huge majority is against deporting immigrants who came here legally.

A majority of Americans believe that US. Immigration and Customs Enforcement wrongfully arrests, deports and uses unnecessary force against U.S. citizens and immigrants. More poll respondents approve than disapprove of organized protests against ICE.

Thirty years ago, only 31 percent of Americans indicated that immigration strengthens the country. Fifty-six percent now think it does, and 58 percent say legal immigration contributes to economic growth. More Americans favor increasing legal immigration than reducing it.

Since he became a candidate for president in 2015, immigration has been Trump’s signature issue. Today, it could become his Achilles’ heel.

If the talks had wrapped up sooner, he said, Mr. Trump might not have had the clout to torpedo the deal.","A New York Times examination of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s actions on immigration found that he and his closest advisers ignored early warnings about a border surge and rejected policies that might have eased a crisis that engulfed much of the Biden administration.

Their decisions created an opening for Donald J. Trump to win back the White House and adopt a more aggressive approach to immigration, The Times review found.

In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Biden blamed Republicans for blocking efforts to address the border crisis. “When it became clear Congress wouldn’t act, Biden took decisive action on his own,” the statement said.

Before Mr. Biden took office, advisers warned that his approach could lead to “chaos” at the border.

In August 2020, while Mr. Biden was still campaigning against President Trump in part by promising a more welcoming approach on immigration, his policy advisers wrote a memo warning that his proposals, coupled with pent-up migration demand under the Trump administration and economic hardship from the Covid pandemic, could lead to a huge increase in border crossings.

“A potential surge could create chaos and a humanitarian crisis, overwhelm processing capacities and imperil the agenda of the new administration,” the advisers wrote. They suggested a range of steps Mr. Biden could take as president to head off that surge, such as making it easier to quickly reject asylum claims. Mr. Biden and his inner circle ignored that advice.

The Biden team misread the politics of immigration.

As border encounters surged at the start of the Biden administration, policy advisers continued to push the White House to focus more on border enforcement and deterring migrants.

But top aides to Mr. Biden worried that doing so would alienate Latino and progressive voters, former administration officials said. And they believed that the crisis was not a significant concern for people outside of border states. Both assumptions proved to be wrong.

“They were a little too sensitive to criticisms from the left,” said Cecilia Muñoz, who helped shape immigration policy in the Obama administration and oversaw domestic and economic policy for the Biden transition team.

The White House rejected pleas to help Democratic cities cope with migrants.

Soon after Mr. Biden took office, as border crossings began to spike, policy advisers in his administration argued for the federal government to transport migrants to their final destinations, in coordination with local officials. Proponents said that such a plan would relieve pressure on border communities, as well as northern cities struggling to manage the flow of migrants.

The idea was similar to the busing campaign that Mr. Abbott started in 2022, but with the goal of helping, not straining, cities that were receiving migrants.

Mr. Biden’s top aides rejected the proposal, saying that it would make the problem worse by encouraging more migrants. Other aides argued that Congress had not authorized it. In hindsight, such an effort “would have made a profound difference,” according to Mike Johnston, the Democratic mayor of Denver.

Mr. Biden kept waiting for Congress to act — a strategy that failed.

Mr. Biden considered acting unilaterally to reduce border crossings as early as 2022, according to Ron Klain, his chief of staff at the time. But he held off because Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, at the time a Democrat, was in talks with Republicans about an immigration bill. Those discussions did not lead to an agreement.

In 2023, lawmakers restarted talks about a border bill. The deliberations again collapsed. Senator James Lankford, the lead Republican negotiator, blamed the Biden administration for dragging its feet. “We don’t want our fingerprints on these negotiations,” Mr. Lankford recalled the White House telling him.

That delayed the deal until after Mr. Trump had secured his party’s presidential nomination, Mr. Lankford said. If the talks had wrapped up sooner, he said, Mr. Trump might not have had the clout to torpedo the deal.

After the Senate talks failed, Mr. Biden used his authority to close the border without Congress. His efforts succeeded at reducing border crossings. But with just five months left before the election, his actions came too late to change voters’ minds about Democrats being the party of open borders.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/multimedia/00dc-biden-immig-takeaways-01-lbvt/00dc-biden-immig-takeaways-01-lbvt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 08:57:25.621004

How Biden Ignored Warnings and Lost Americans’ Faith in Immigration

The Democratic president and his top advisers rejected recommendations that could have eased the border crisis that helped return Donald Trump to the White House.

In the weeks after Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected president, advisers delivered a warning: His approach to immigration could prove disastrous.

Mr. Biden had pledged to treat unauthorized immigrants more humanely than President Donald J. Trump, who generated widespread backlash by separating migrant children from their parents.

But Mr. Biden was now president-elect, and his positions threatened to drastically increase border crossings, experts advising his transition team warned in a Zoom briefing in the final weeks of 2020, according to people with direct knowledge of that briefing. That jump, they said, could provoke a political crisis.

“Chaos” was the word the advisers had used in a memo during the campaign.

They offered a range of options to avert that crisis, by better deterring migrants. Mr. Biden seemed to grasp the risk. But he and his top aides failed to act on those recommendations.

The warnings came true, and then some. After Mr. Biden became president, migrant encounters at the southern border quickly doubled, then kept rising. New arrivals overwhelmed border stations, then border towns, and eventually major cities like New York and Denver.

Anger over illegal migration helped return Mr. Trump to the presidency, and he has enacted even more aggressive policies than those Mr. Biden first campaigned against. Mr. Trump has drawn outrage from Democrats by sending masked agents to target immigrants, often aided by National Guard soldiers.

But a New York Times examination of Mr. Biden’s record found that he and his closest advisers repeatedly rebuffed recommendations that could have addressed the border crisis faster, and eased what became a potent issue for Mr. Trump as he sought to return to the White House and justify the aggressive tactics roiling American cities today.

Former Biden administration officials told The Times that Mr. Biden and his circle of close confidants — including Ron Klain, who was chief of staff during the president’s first two years, Mike Donilon, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon and Anita Dunn — made two crucial errors.

First, they underestimated the scale of migration that was coming. Second, they failed to appreciate the political reaction to that migration — believing that stronger enforcement would alienate Latino and progressive voters, and also that a border surge would not be an important issue to most voters. Those calculations would later prove to be mistaken, with many voters, including Latinos, citing immigration as a reason for supporting Mr. Trump in 2024.

“Everybody was reacting to the excesses of the Trump administration,” said Cecilia Muñoz, who helped shape immigration policy in the Obama administration and oversaw domestic and economic policy for the Biden transition team.

Yet as public concern over border security grew, partly in response to Mr. Biden’s own actions, his administration proved catastrophically slow to change course, former aides said. The president and his closest aides treated immigration as a distraction from other issues, such as the coronavirus pandemic and the economy.

Aides stressed that the Biden administration faced a steep challenge addressing a border crisis while adhering to outdated immigration laws. But they lamented that Mr. Biden never articulated a clear vision or pushed his cabinet secretaries to coordinate their efforts on immigration in the way that Mr. Trump has.

Mr. Biden created new legal pathways for migration to ease pressure at the border, under which more than one million people were allowed into the United States, fueling public resistance. And he failed to convince Congress to change immigration laws, dragging his feet on a crucial Senate border deal, according to the lead Republican negotiator, who said the effort might have otherwise succeeded.

The shooting in Washington last month that killed one National Guard soldier and left another critically injured has renewed scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s immigration programs. The suspect arrived through Operation Allies Welcome, which offered entry to Afghans fleeing the Taliban in 2021.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Biden declined to make him available for an interview. She provided a statement that blamed Republicans for blocking additional funding for hiring more border agents, deploying more security technology and processing immigration cases more quickly. The statement also blamed Republicans for walking away from the proposed border bill “because Donald Trump told them to.”

“When it became clear Congress wouldn’t act, Biden took decisive action on his own,” the statement said.

Mr. Klain defended the administration’s actions on immigration as part of a broader set of priorities.

“We came in during an economic collapse and 3,000 Americans dying each day from Covid. We focused on those first and got both turned around quickly,” he said. “We ended the cruelty of Trump’s immigration policies but hit a wall on building a sensible asylum system when Republicans blocked action on needed legislation.”

But former advisers said the problem ran deeper than Republican obstruction.

The Biden White House “had no strategy, because they had no goal,” said Scott Shuchart, who joined the administration in 2022 as a senior adviser at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “All they had was wishing the problem would go away so that they could focus on the things they cared about.”

Year 1: Chaos, Then Paralysis

Mr. Biden’s policy advisers sounded the alarm before he even won the election.

In August of 2020, several aides wrote a memo cautioning Mr. Biden’s inner circle that his promises — coupled with pent-up demand from the Trump years and economic hardship from Covid — could provoke a spike in border crossings.

“A potential surge could create chaos and a humanitarian crisis, overwhelm processing capacities, and imperil the agenda of the new administration,” the advisers wrote, according to a copy of the memo viewed by The Times.

Mr. Biden was confronting challenges that had been years in the making. Migrants had increasingly turned to claiming asylum. By saying they were fleeing persecution, many had been permitted to live and work in the United States for years until their claims could be heard.

Asylum

The Refugee Act of 1980 gives people the right to request asylum in the United States because of persecution or a fear of persecution in their home country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The law gives people the ability to claim asylum when they arrive at the border or once they’re already in the country. President Trump and President Biden took steps to restrict that ability; those steps have been challenged in court.

President Trump had tried deterring asylum seekers. His administration separated children from their parents. He created the “Remain in Mexico” program, forcing asylum claimants to wait in Mexico until their cases were heard. During the pandemic, he invoked a public health rule, Title 42, to turn back migrants.

The memo from Mr. Biden’s advisers offered a range of options, including making it easier to quickly reject asylum claims; holding people in “reception centers” until their cases could be heard; transferring some migrants to other countries; and continuing to make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico, while ensuring they had access to shelter.

Title 42

Title 42 is a legal provision that lets the government block the entry of people who risk introducing a communicable disease into the country. The Trump administration began applying the rule to migrants in 2020, at the start of the Covid pandemic.

Once in office, Mr. Biden had to decide between the more permissive approach that Democrats demanded and the warnings from some policy advisers to tack to the center.

He wasted no time answering.

Soon after being sworn in, Mr. Biden issued a 100-day pause on deportations. He drastically narrowed the categories of unauthorized immigrants targeted for arrest. He directed his government to stop building the border wall, a centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s agenda. He suspended Remain in Mexico. He sent draft legislation to Congress to create a citizenship pathway for people in the country illegally. He kept Title 42 in place, but stopped using it to turn back children who crossed the border alone.

Remain in Mexico

At the beginning of 2019, the Trump administration started the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as “Remain in Mexico.” Under that program, people who arrived at the border seeking asylum were given a date to appear in immigration court then sent to wait in Mexico, often for six months or longer.

The speed of Mr. Biden’s actions masked deep disagreements on his team.

Some advisers warned that he was moving too quickly. Others worried that Latino voters would object if the new president softened support for migrants.

“The president and others made a decision that he wasn’t going to lose that community,” said Roberta Jacobson, the border czar for the first three months of the administration.

Mr. Biden’s policy changes, some of which were halted by the courts, were not the only causes of that early surge. The draw of the U.S. economy, which bounced back quickly from Covid, mattered too. But the changes signaled to migrants that the border was opening again, former aides said.

The crisis foretold by Mr. Biden’s border advisers quickly emerged.

Border Patrol encounters at the Southwest Border

In January, the month Mr. Biden took office, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 75,316 encounters with migrants along the southwest border. By March, that number passed 169,000 — far higher than at any point during the Trump administration. Many arrivals were children, jammed into border stations ill-equipped to hold them.

The perception of chaos began to erode the pro-immigrant sentiment that had shaped Mr. Biden’s campaign promises. In March, 40 percent of Americans said they worried about illegal immigration “a great deal” — the highest number Gallup had registered in a decade.

Two months into his term, Mr. Biden assigned Vice President Kamala Harris with reducing illegal migration, especially from Central America, by working on the “root causes” of that migration.

Republicans labeled Ms. Harris the president’s border czar. But none of the former officials who spoke to The Times described her as a central decision maker on border policy. A spokeswoman for Ms. Harris did not respond to requests for comment.

Many former aides complained about the administration’s reluctance to push foreign governments harder to slow the movement of migrants or accept more deportation flights, as Mr. Trump has done in his second term.

Aides described Mr. Biden as having no strong positions on immigration beyond two key areas. He resisted anything that looked like Mr. Trump’s Remain in Mexico policy. And he did not want to send children back across the border.

As border crossings jumped, advisers across the administration kept offering ideas to deter migrants. But political concerns remained.

“They were a little too sensitive to criticisms from the left,” Ms. Muñoz said.

The result was paralysis. Andrea Flores was director for transborder security at the National Security Council early in the administration. Her first assignment, she said, was to help prepare a memo for Mr. Klain offering additional ideas for deterring migrants.

Officials could not agree on what options to present, she said, “so the memo died.”

Some Biden aides believed that the less the president said about immigration, the better. In June, the White House planned for Mr. Biden to give a speech on the border. Officials circulated the president’s remarks, Ms. Flores said, only to change their minds at the last minute.

Angela Kelley, who was then a senior immigration adviser at the Department of Homeland Security, described a collision between Mr. Biden’s campaign promises and “reality on the ground.”

“We didn’t really have a grip on it,” Ms. Kelley said.

The problem was about to get worse.

Year 2: The Border Moves North

One April day in 2022, a bus pulled up near the U.S. Capitol. It was carrying 12 Venezuelans, four Colombians, four Cubans and four Nicaraguans — and the start of a new phase in the immigration debate.

The bus had been chartered by the Texas Division of Emergency Management. “By busing migrants to Washington, D.C., the Biden administration will be able to more immediately meet the needs of the people they are allowing to cross our border,” Greg Abbott, the state’s Republican governor, said in a statement at the time.

The busing campaign had been under consideration since the previous summer, when local officials met with Mr. Abbott in the small border town of Del Rio seeking help with the growing flow of migrants, according to two former senior Abbott officials who spoke on the condition that they not be identified.

Initially, the buses all went to Washington, “to take the border to the president,” the officials said. In August, Mr. Abbott began sending busloads of migrants to New York City. A few weeks later, buses began heading to Chicago, then Philadelphia.

By the end of 2022, Texas had sent more than 16,000 migrants to those cities, according to data obtained by The Times last year through a records request.

The Biden administration accused Mr. Abbott of a cruel stunt. But the campaign worked. Until then, the White House viewed the migration crisis mainly as a problem for border states, former aides said. When migrants began making headlines in places like New York, that view changed.

Many Biden officials came to view Mr. Abbott’s campaign as the point Democrats lost the debate.

“I don’t think we ever recovered,” said Deborah Fleischaker, then the assistant director for policy at ICE.

Mr. Abbott’s campaign echoed an idea that some Biden officials had been advocating for internally: using federal resources to help migrants reach their destinations, but in coordination with the cities receiving them.

Jason Houser, then the chief of staff at ICE, said he had pushed the idea partly to help make the movement of migrants more orderly. He said Mr. Biden’s senior advisers refused.

Some officials contended that the Department of Homeland Security lacked congressional authority to transport immigrants not in government custody. Others felt that providing free transportation would draw more migrants.

If the Biden administration had worked to coordinate migrants’ travel in the United States, “it would have made a profound difference,” Mike Johnston, the Democratic mayor of Denver, said in an interview.

As Mr. Abbott’s campaign ramped up, White House officials debated taking executive action on the border, Mr. Klain said in an interview. But Kyrsten Sinema, then a Democratic senator from Arizona, had begun talking to Republican lawmakers about border legislation, he said. Mr. Biden wanted to give that effort a chance.

“We were trying to cut a deal,” Mr. Klain said.

But Democrats were running out of time.

Year 3: Trial and Error

By the halfway mark of Mr. Biden’s term, the failure of his approach was impossible to ignore.

The Border Patrol reported 2.2 million apprehensions along the Mexican border the previous year, up from 400,000 the year Mr. Biden was elected. In 2023, the number of unauthorized migrants in the country who were not detained and were waiting for their cases to be resolved surpassed 6 million, almost doubling since 2020.

The White House began experimenting. In January, the Department of Homeland Security started admitting migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, provided they could find an American sponsor, pass a background check and pay for a plane ticket. By giving those migrants an official way to enter, the program — called C.H.N.V., after the names of the four countries — sought to reduce their incentive to cross the border illegally.

C.H.N.V.

A program introduced by the Biden administration at the start of 2023, awarding two-year residency permits to people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who had U.S.-based sponsors and passed background checks. More than half a million people entered through the program before President Trump canceled it.

C.H.N.V. was an evolution of more targeted migrant programs introduced earlier in the Biden administration, starting with Operation Allies Welcome, which allowed the suspect in last month’s attack on the National Guard troops into the United States. In 2022, the administration started a similar entry program for Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion of their country.

Republicans accused the administration of letting in unauthorized immigrants. And no one at the Department of Homeland Security was responsible for ensuring that people who entered through C.H.N.V. left the country when they were supposed to, according to a report this year by the agency’s inspector general.

Still, C.H.N.V. succeeded in reducing the number of people from those four countries approaching the border. But overall crossings remained high.

In May 2023, the administration replaced Title 42 with new restrictions. Asylum seekers were supposed to book an appointment through a mobile app, CBP One, which offered a limited number of openings.

CBP One

CBP One was a mobile phone app introduced by the Biden administration in 2023. People trying to file an asylum claim at the border were first directed to get an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app, which could sometimes take months. More than 900,000 people eventually booked appointments using the app; the Trump administration has ordered many of them to leave.

The administration also raised the threshold for asylum for people who did not use the app. But the new restrictions failed to stem the tide. Border encounters fell briefly, then rebounded.

Adding to the pressure, Mr. Abbott expanded his busing campaign. In May, Denver received its first busload from Texas.

Texas eventually sent more than 19,000 migrants to Denver. The city of about 720,000 wound up taking in 43,000 of them.

The influx became a crisis for Mr. Johnston, who was elected mayor three weeks after the first bus arrived. As the numbers grew, he repeatedly asked the Biden administration for money and policy changes to address what he called a “humanitarian crisis.”

The costs spread. The main safety-net hospital spent millions of dollars treating additional patients with no insurance. The school system made room for more than 5,000 additional students. Denver spent almost $100 million trying to manage the crisis.

The city was not alone. By September, Texas had sent tens of thousands of migrants to Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia and New York.

“This issue will destroy New York City,” Mayor Eric Adams told a town hall that month. “The city we knew, we’re about to lose.”

Year 4: The Reckoning

On a Sunday evening in February 2024, Senator Chris Murphy was in his Capitol Hill office, watching the collapse of the Biden administration’s last best chance to manage its immigration problem.

Mr. Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, had led his party’s negotiations over a bill to fix the border crisis by giving the government authority to restrict asylum claims. The bill had taken Mr. Murphy and his Republican counterpart, Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, months to agree upon.

Within hours, as Mr. Murphy watched Republicans attack the bill on social media, he knew it would fail. Early the next day, Mr. Trump delivered the death blow. “This Bill is a great gift to the Democrats,” he wrote on social media. “It takes the HORRIBLE JOB the Democrats have done on Immigration and the Border, absolves them, and puts it all squarely on the shoulders of Republicans. Don’t be STUPID!!!”

“We had our votes on Sunday afternoon,” Mr. Murphy said. “We didn’t have them on Monday morning.”

The bill could have provided what Mr. Biden needed as he ran for re-election: a drop in border crossings, blessed by both parties in Congress, with enough time before Election Day for voters to change their minds about Democrats supporting open borders.

Democrats blamed Mr. Trump for sinking the deal. But Mr. Lankford pointed to another culprit: the Biden administration’s own foot-dragging.

When negotiations had gained momentum the previous fall, the White House had refused to get involved, according to Mr. Murphy and Mr. Lankford. “We don’t want our fingerprints on these negotiations,” Mr. Lankford recalled the White House telling him. Only as border crossings continued to spike did the administration relent, he said.

Looking back, Mr. Lankford said he believed the delay was critical. If Mr. Biden had signed on sooner, he said, the talks could have produced an agreement before the end of 2023. At that point, Mr. Trump, who still faced opposition for the Republican presidential nomination, might not have had the clout to torpedo the deal.

Then Mr. Trump defeated Ron DeSantis in Iowa, and Nikki Haley in New Hampshire. By the time the border deal concluded in February 2024, “it was very clear that Mr. Trump was going to win” the nomination, Mr. Lankford said. And Mr. Trump was eager to score political points off Mr. Biden’s immigration record.

The deal’s failure left Mr. Biden in a bind. Border encounters were still higher than at any point in the Trump administration. The estimated number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States — 11 million when Mr. Biden took office — was approaching 14 million. And the election was nine months away.

Less than three weeks after the Senate deal collapsed, a 22-year-old nursing student, Laken Riley, was killed on the University of Georgia campus. When a Venezuelan man who had entered the country illegally was charged with the murder, her death became shorthand for Democrats’ failures. Mr. Trump met with Ms. Riley’s family and said that she would still be alive “if Joe Biden had not willfully and maliciously eviscerated the borders.”

By June, 55 percent of Americans said total immigration levels should fall, the highest share measured by Gallup since just after the Sept. 11 attacks.

On June 4, 2024, five months before Election Day, Mr. Biden reversed course. He issued an order all but closing the border to asylum applications, a move that was far tougher than the proposals that had been rejected during his first year in office. Border encounters quickly fell.

Why Mr. Biden waited so long to effectively seal the border has become one of the defining questions of his presidency.

Some aides feared that closing the border would be overturned by the courts. Others said that principles mattered. “It was truly believed — deeply, by many, including the president — that that was not in keeping with our values,” said Ms. Jacobson, the former border czar.

Three weeks after closing the border, the president faced off against Mr. Trump in a debate at CNN’s Atlanta studios. Asked why voters should trust him to solve the crisis, Mr. Biden flubbed it.

“What I’ve done — since I’ve changed the law, what’s happened?” said Mr. Biden, who had not changed the law. “I’ve changed it in a way that now you’re in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.”

Mr. Biden went on: “I’m going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the … the total initiative relative to what we’re going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers.”

“I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence,” Mr. Trump responded. “I don’t think he knows what he said either.”

Within a month, Mr. Biden left the race.

On Mr. Trump’s first day back in the White House, he effectively blocked asylum claims entirely. He also shut down Mr. Biden’s border entry app, ordered the military to the border and directed ICE to drastically expand its scope of arrests and deportations.

“The American people deserve a federal government that puts their interests first,” read Mr. Trump’s executive order.

The Biden experiment was over. A very different kind of experiment was just beginning.

ICE is currently holding 65,000 migrants in detention centers around the country, according to DHS data posted online.","More than a third of the roughly 220,000 people arrested by ICE officers in the first nine months of the Trump administration had no criminal histories, according to new data.

The data, which includes ICE arrests from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15, shows that nearly 75,000 people with no criminal records have been swept up in immigration operations that the president and his top officials have said would target murderers, rapists and gang members.

“It contradicts what the administration has been saying about people who are convicted criminals and that they are going after the worst of the worst,” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.

The figures provide the most revealing look to date into the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. They were shared by the University of California, Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project, which obtained them through a lawsuit brought against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The data is compiled by an internal ICE office that handles arrest, detention and deportation data. The administration stopped regularly posting detailed information on ICE arrests in January.

For arrestees with criminal histories, the data doesn’t distinguish between those with a history of minor offenses and those who have committed more serious crimes, like rape and murder, whom the administration has said it is targeting.

And the figures do not include arrests made by Border Patrol, which has launched aggressive immigration operations in several cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina. Border Patrol sweeps are currently underway in New Orleans.

Border Patrol and ICE are both under the Department of Homeland Security but they are two different agencies with two different missions. Border Patrol agents typically operate along the southern and northern borders, but recently hundreds have been sent into the interior of the United States to track down undocumented immigrants.

“That is the black box that we know nothing about,” Ruiz Soto said. “How many arrests is Border Patrol doing? How many of those are leading to removals and under what conditions?”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

ICE field offices have been under intense pressure to ramp up arrests.

In mid-May, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller threatened to fire senior ICE officials if they did not begin arresting at least 3,000 migrants per day, NBC News previously reported.

But the new data shows that ICE is still falling well short of those targets.

ICE agents have made an average daily total of 824 arrests since Jan. 20, according to the data. Those figures are still more than double the average daily arrest total under the Biden administration in 2024, when ICE arrested 312 people per day.

The data also reveals that about 90% of the people ICE arrested through mid-October were male. Mexican nationals accounted for the largest share of the overall arrests, with about 85,000, followed by nationals of Guatemala at 31,000 and Honduras at 24,000.

More than 60% of those who were arrested were between the ages of 25 and 45.

“Now we’re really feeling that pain in the workforce,” said George Carrillo, chief executive officer of the Hispanic Construction Council.

Carrillo praised the Trump administration for its efforts to secure the border but said the ongoing enforcement operations are having a significant impact on companies that employ migrant workers.

“Now even the most conservative Republicans are feeling it and understanding that, hey, something different has to be done because now it is affecting their businesses,” he said. “And they’re worried about this strategy.”

It’s not clear from the data how many of those who were arrested were deported, but 22,959 are listed under the category of “voluntary departure,” meaning they left the United States of their own accord.

The news, confirmed by the National Association of Immigration Judges, highlights a profound staffing crisis.

The judges worked at 26 Federal Plaza, a key location that also houses the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office and serves as a focal point for migrant arrests.

According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association, since Trump took office in January, more than 100 immigration judges out of approximately 700 have been fired or forced out. This drastic reduction is crippling the courts, which must manage a soaring caseload due to the administration’s policy of intensifying arrests and deportations.

Legal Basis and Further Developments

The legal basis for the firings is that immigration judges report to the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review and are not part of the federal judiciary. The administration asserts that the President and Attorney General Pam Bondi have the constitutional right to remove these judges as “inferior officers.”

The Justice Department has remained silent, refusing to comment on “personnel matters.” These firings are not isolated, but follow prior episodes. Just last month, the administration had fired five judges in San Francisco, one in New York City, and another in Boston.

The aggressive firing policy is generating lawsuits. On Monday, a former immigration judge in Ohio, who was fired in February, filed a lawsuit, alleging she was wrongly terminated because of her sex, national origin, and political affiliation.

These events fit into a broader pattern of conflict between the Executive and Judicial branches. Several recent reports point to continuous tension and the suspension of executive orders. Federal judges have recently blocked or suspended several key Trump administration initiatives, including attempts to revoke birthright citizenship and to cancel the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti.

The conflict over executive powers has often reached the Supreme Court, which has sometimes limited the power of lower federal judges to issue nationwide stay orders (universal injunctions). However, the Court has also given the administration “a free hand on firings” in some contexts, making the role of the judiciary the only real check on the expansion of presidential powers.

The situation paints a picture of ongoing tension and uncertainty within the U.S. immigration system, with the administration attempting to reshape the judicial apparatus in line with its political agenda.",https://www.focusonafrica.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_123628_Google.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 11:58:08.803088

Many said they support Mr. Trump’s stance on illegal immigration but also liked what they had before: A prison that didn’t feel like a prison.
We’ve been working so hard to make McCook a draw, and now this.” The former work camp featured classrooms and open areas for exercise.
The Work Ethic Camp housed fewer than 200 people at a time and cost the state around $10 million annually.
McCook did not receive any direct revenue from the work camp but many residents were employed there, and the inmates worked low-paying jobs around town.","The inmates housed at the minimum-security state prison in McCook, Neb., could often be seen around town, working on road paving, weeding cemeteries, taking down Christmas lights and mowing the high school football field before games. They took classes at the local community college, and an art gallery displayed work from 13 prisoners this summer.

For more than two decades, the prison, known as the Work Ethic Camp, was Nebraska’s only state prison geared solely toward rehabilitation. The facility held nonviolent felony offenders who were nearing the end of their sentences and prepared them, with counseling, schooling and job training, to return to the outside world.

That changed this fall, after state officials announced that the Work Ethic Camp would be replaced with a 300-bed, high security Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center to support President Trump’s national crackdown on illegal immigration.

And so a place that had been devoted to second chances now had a very different mission, and a new name to go with it: “The Cornhusker Clink.”

In McCook, a conservative town of about 7,500 that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, some residents have objected. Many said they support Mr. Trump’s stance on illegal immigration but also liked what they had before: A prison that didn’t feel like a prison. With its close ties to the community, it was a place that helped Nebraskans get back on their feet.

Other residents said they were in favor of the new ICE facility, viewing McCook as doing its part for the president’s agenda and potentially benefiting from 50 to 60 added jobs. But opponents said they were frustrated by the governor’s unilateral decision to change the facility and turn it into a place to detain immigrants. City officials are also worried about the potential strain on resources if hundreds of detainees are transported in and out through the town’s small airport, which has one full-time employee.

“Now when people think of McCook, this is all it is — it’s ICE detention,” said Nate Schneider, the city manager and a registered Republican who said he has voted for both parties over the years. “But for us, it’s a lot more than that. McCook is home. McCook is a place that I want my kids to think is a good place to live. We’ve been working so hard to make McCook a draw, and now this.”

The former work camp featured classrooms and open areas for exercise. A single fence surrounded only the back buildings where inmates slept.

McCook officials said they were given no advance notice of the state’s decision to repurpose the Work Ethic Camp, nor have they been told that the city can expect any revenue from the ICE agreement with the state, which Mr. Pillen has said will bring in about $14 million annually, after expenses to run the facility.

Thirteen McCook residents and aformer state legislator sued the governor, arguing that the facility was designated and funded by the Nebraska Legislature for the purposes of rehabilitating state inmates, and that Mr. Pillen did not have authority to change that. In October, a judge declined to grant the residents an injunction but also declined the governor’s request to dismiss the case, which is proceeding.

“I have no problem with prosecuting immigrants who commit crimes,” said Bruce McDowell, a retired telecommunications technician and a plaintiff in the suit. Mr. McDowell, a Democrat, said he viewed Governor Pillen’s decision to turn the facility over to federal authorities as a political calculation. “He’s trying to curry favor with Donald Trump, and that carries a lot more weight than a few of us down here,” he said.

Mr. Pillen’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but the governor has previously said that the facility would benefit the state, calling it “good for Nebraska’s taxpayers” and a way to ensure that Nebraska is “doing all that we can to keep criminal, illegal aliens off our streets.”

In 1997, the Nebraska Legislature approved the Work Ethic Camp, so named to reflect the facility’s stated philosophy that “positive work ethics can be learned and transferred to other areas of an individual’s life.” Its purpose was to prepare low-level offenders to return to the community and to reduce a perpetual overcrowding problem in Nebraska prisons. The state’s prison system regularly ranks among the nation’s most overcrowded.

The Work Ethic Camp housed fewer than 200 people at a time and cost the state around $10 million annually. Its programming included vocational and educational courses, as well as classes to contend with substance abuse and domestic violence. McCook did not receive any direct revenue from the work camp but many residents were employed there, and the inmates worked low-paying jobs around town.

Over 48 cent coffee at Arby’s, where a group of men gather most mornings, residents were divided over whether McCook should have had a say in the decision to convert the facility into an ICE detention center.

“Who are we to say, ‘No, you can’t bring them here, you’ve got to go somewhere else,’” asked Brad Gillen, who owns a carpet cleaning business in McCook and voted for President Trump. “If this is our part we have to do, that’s fine.”

But others took issue with Governor Pillen for choosing to partner with federal authorities without seeking input from the community most affected, McCook.

“He did it to us, not with us,” said Dale Dueland, a semiretired farmer and rancher, who is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Mr. Pillen and describes himself as nonpartisan.

“If you’d come before this all happened, most people here would say that what happens in Washington is so far away, it doesn’t affect us,” Mr. Dueland added. “All of a sudden it’s like a wake-up call that what happens in those faraway places can directly affect us here.”

From Washington to McCook

In mid-March, Mr. Pillen and his staff members traveled to the White House to attend one of President Trump’s executive order signing ceremonies. The following week, David Lopez, Mr. Pillen’s chief of staff, exchanged emails with D.H.S. officials, thanking them for meeting with him. He also inquired about how Nebraska might assist in immigration enforcement.

It is not clear exactly how Mr. Pillen and the corrections department landed on offering up the Work Ethic Camp, one of nine state correctional facilities, in the months that followed. But in August, in a joint statement with D.H.S., the governor announced the plan. That was the first time most people in McCook learned that the camp would be repurposed..",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/07nat-nebraska-ice-50929-cover/07nat-nebraska-ice-50929-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 08:57:48.616120

The woman, Viktoriia, is married to a U.S. citizen, had no criminal history and, CBS 8 is told, has complied with every requirement of the immigration system.

""She is my wife. She has kids. Everybody is stressed out,"" Victor Korol, Viktoriia's husband, said.

Korol is a citizen and has cancer. He depends on Viktoriia as his primary caretaker.

During their interview Thursday, Viktoriia was detained by ICE in front of him.

""They said that her TPS [Temporary Protected Status] status was not current. And they are detaining you. We tried to explain to them that they should not detain her,"" Korol said.

He said that she previously applied to renew her TPS and work authorization during the designated renewal period in January. Both of those cases are pending, according to Pathways to Citizenship, an organization based in Solana Beach that helps immigrants.

""This is widespread and a daily occurrence here in San Diego and throughout the nation that people's constitutional rights and legal protections have all but vanished,"" Caroline Matthews, a supervising attorney for Pathways to Citizenship, said.

Matthews is working with Korol to help him be reunited with Viktoriia.

""Unfortunately, I've had to file Habeas petitions in federal court, because what we've found is the immigration system right now is violating its own rules. It's acting unlawfully, despite knowing that those things are occurring, there's no recourse,"" Matthews said.

She told CBS 8 that in other cases that mirror Viktoriia's, many immigrants are spending, at minimum, 3 days in detainment.

""My client who was detained in a similar fashion on November 19, had to file a Habeas because she was still not located by that following Friday. And then we had a bond hearing eventually... And that bond hearing resulted in a decision that she would be out on bond. So, she's paying to get out of an unlawful arrest and detention, and then, despite our efforts and the agreement with the immigration judge that she would not be in alternatives to detention like an ankle monitor, she was put in one anyway,"" Matthews said.

In a ruling Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan denied the federal government’s motion to dismiss the case and has set a hearing for next week for the parties to discuss next steps in this case.

President Donald Trump in January announced his administration would use a detention center at Guantanamo to hold tens of thousands of the “worst criminal aliens,” as part of his wider immigration crackdown.

Between February and June, the federal government held around 500 immigrants at Guantanamo, according to Sooknanan, as authorities used the base as a way station for immigrants with final removal orders.

American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, who argued the case, said in a statement Saturday that he hopes the ruling “will put an end to the Trump administration’s unlawful policy of sending immigrants to military bases in the middle of nowhere solely for the theatric value.”

The ACLU and other advocacy groups have argued that transporting immigrants to Guantanamo is unlawful. The Trump administration has said it has broad authority to hold immigrants with final deportation orders at the facility.

In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, said, “We look forward to a higher court’s vindication of our use of this facility to keep criminals off American streets.”

The base, often referred to as “Gitmo,” is best known for the suspects brought there after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., said she was “pushed-side and pepper sprayed” by federal immigration agents while on scene at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at an Arizona restaurant on Friday.
Grijalva and two of her staff members still had remnants of what the agents sprayed on them after the raid ended, she said.
Grijalva said they arrived after ICE was already at Taco Giro, and that they were not the aggressors.
“After deploying chemical munitions federal agents requested emergency support from TPD to assist in exiting the area,” Tucson police said.
“Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated.”","Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., said she was “pushed-side and pepper sprayed” by federal immigration agents while on scene at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at an Arizona restaurant on Friday. Grijalva said in a video on X she was at Taco Giro in Tucson to ask for clarification, “which is my right as a member of Congress.”

“[I] was sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent, pushed around by others, when I literally was not being aggressive,” she said. “Once I introduced myself, I assumed that it would be a little calmer. But there was literally only one person that was trying to speak to me in any kind of civil tone, and everyone else was being rude and disrespectful. And I just can only imagine if they’re going to treat me like that, how they’re treating everybody else.”

Along with herself, Grijalva said she also witnessed members of the press and others being sprayed. Grijalva and two of her staff members still had remnants of what the agents sprayed on them after the raid ended, she said.

In another X post, Grijalva posted video footage of the incident.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, dismissed Grijalva’s account, claiming she was not pepper sprayed, but was in the “vicinity” of someone who was as “they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement.”

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel,” McLaughlin wrote, adding, “Presenting one’s self as a “Member of Congress” doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement.”

Two law enforcement officers were “seriously injured” during the raid, McLaughlin said.

During an interview with CNN anchor Laura Coates on Friday, Grijalva said “It’s convenient to them to make it seem as if I was doing anything other than inquiring about what was happening.”

Tucson Police were also at the site of the raid. Grijalva said they arrived after ICE was already at Taco Giro, and that they were not the aggressors.

An ICE spokesperson told local outlet WSAZ that multiple arrests were made, with an exact number to be released later.

Local response to ICE raid

The police department confirmed that Homeland Security Investigations served a federal search warrant at Taco Giro on Friday. No munitions or force were deployed by Tucson Police Department employees, the agency said.

“After deploying chemical munitions federal agents requested emergency support from TPD to assist in exiting the area,” Tucson police said. “TPD Rapid Response Team (RRT) personnel responded to the location to support a safe environment.”

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero and Vice Mayor Lane Santa Cruz put out a statement together stating that they share the fears in the community created by what they called “Trump’s immoral and inhumane immigration policies.”

“Under the Trump Administration unidentified federal agents often intentionally wear clothing with vague words like “police” to purposefully confuse the public,” the officials said. “Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25316824029346_AP_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 08:57:37.854719

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the expansion of the June travel ban, which barred 19 countries from partially or entirely sending their citizens to the US.

“If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” Noem asked Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Thursday.

DHS did not announce which countries will be included in the expanded ban and did not state when it will go into effect.

The June ban fully restricted travel from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

That ban also established partial restrictions on Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

The Trump administration’s US Citizenship and Immigration Services further directed a hold on green card and citizenship applications for people from those 19 countries.

The agency also announced a hold on “all pending asylum applications, regardless of the alien’s country of nationality.”

The ramped up restrictions come in the wake of the broad-daylight shooting of two West Virginia National Guard troops in Washington, DC, on Nov. 26. The attack was carried out by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who came to the US under the Biden administration’s Operation Allies Welcome.

National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in Lakanwal’s ambush, while Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically wounded.

Lakanwal has been charged with murder, possessing a firearm during a crime of violence, and assault with intent to kill while armed.

""We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.""
That measure codified the Citizenship Clause's language and also adopted what was by then the well-settled understanding that the 14th Amendment promised automatic birthright citizenship.
The birthright citizenship fight had landed at the Supreme Court already once this year.
The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality.","The US Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide the legality of US President Donald Trump's directive to restrict birthright citizenship in the country, a contentious part of his efforts to curb immigration and a step that would alter how a 19th century constitutional provision has long been understood.

The justices took up a Justice Department appeal of a lower court's ruling that blocked Trump's executive order telling US agencies not to recognize the citizenship of children born in the US if neither parent is an American citizen or legal permanent resident, also called a ""green card"" holder.

The lower court ruled that Trump's policy violated the US Constitution's 14th Amendment and a federal law codifying birthright citizenship rights in a class-action lawsuit by parents and children whose citizenship is threatened by the directive.

The justices are expected to hear arguments during their current term and issue a ruling by the end of June. They did not set a date for the arguments.

The Republican president signed the order his first day back in office on Jan. 20 as part of a suite of initiatives he has pursued during his second term as president to crack down on legal and illegal immigration. Trump's policies toward immigration have been among the most contentious aspects of both his terms as president, with critics accusing him of racial and religious discrimination in his approach.

The 14th Amendment has long been interpreted as guaranteeing citizenship for babies born in the US. But the Trump administration has argued that the provision does not grant citizenship to the babies of immigrants who are in the country illegally or whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas.

""This case will have enormous consequences for the security of all Americans, and the sanctity of American citizenship. The Trump administration looks forward to making its case on the issue of birthright citizenship on behalf of the American people,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.

""No president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship,"" said Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs. ""We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.""

The administration has said that granting citizenship to virtually anyone born on US soil has created incentives for illegal immigration and led to ""birth tourism,"" by which foreigners travel to the US to give birth and secure citizenship for their children.

The legal challenges appealed by the Justice Department concerned one lawsuit filed by the states of Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, and another filed in federal court in New Hampshire by plaintiffs who sued on behalf of a nationwide class of people affected by Trump's order.

In July, the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the states. Also in July, Concord, New Hampshire-based US District Judge Joseph Laplante let the plaintiffs in that case proceed as a class, allowing Trump's order to be blocked nationally. The Supreme Court on Friday decided to hear the class action case only, not the one brought by the states.

The Supreme Court took up the case before a Boston-based federal appeals court had a chance to review it, a signal of the gravity of the legal divide and the need for the Supreme Court to definitively settle the matter on a national basis.

The 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause states that all ""persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the US and of the state wherein they reside."" The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War of 1861-1865 that ended slavery in the US.

The administration has asserted that the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" means that being born in the United States is not enough for citizenship. Citizenship is granted only to the children of those whose ""primary allegiance"" is to the US, including citizens and permanent residents, it has argued.

Such allegiance is established only through ""lawful domicile,"" which government attorneys define as ""lawful, permanent residence within a nation, with intent to remain.""

The challengers said the Supreme Court already settled the question of birthright citizenship in an 1898 case called US v. Wong Kim Ark, which long has been interpreted as guaranteeing that children born in the US to non-citizen parents are entitled to American citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The challengers also point out that Trump's order violates a law Congress passed in 1940 that was subsequently included in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. That measure codified the Citizenship Clause's language and also adopted what was by then the well-settled understanding that the 14th Amendment promised automatic birthright citizenship.

The birthright citizenship fight had landed at the Supreme Court already once this year. After lower courts halted Trump's order, the administration took the matter to the Supreme Court to challenge the power of federal judges to issue so-called ""universal"" injunctions preventing presidential policies from applying against anyone, anywhere.

The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling powered by its conservative majority, issued a ruling in June blunting the power of federal judges but did not resolve the legality of Trump's directive.

The ruling left open the possibility for courts to grant broad relief to states or to individual plaintiffs through class action lawsuits.

The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality.

Among these policies were Trump's revocation of temporary legal protections on humanitarian grounds for hundreds of thousands of migrants, deportations of migrants to countries other than their own and domestic immigration enforcement raids.

Instead, ICE agents were waiting for him outside on Nov. 14.

Toledo-Martinez’s lawyer, Olia Catala, said once he went out to check on the damage and exchange insurance information, undercover agents released a dog that had been hiding out of sight with a handler. Immigration officials detained Toledo-Martinez, 28, of Vancouver, Wash.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is calling for the immediate release of the Clark County father of three, who was mauled by the dog despite not resisting arrest, his attorneys say.

“He heard the officer say, ‘He’s gonna run!’ or ‘He’s running!’ and he didn’t even realize what was happening,” Catala said in an interview Saturday. “And the next thing he knows is that the dog is on top of him, mauling him. He did not flee. He did not resist.”

Toledo-Martinez did not have weapons on him. He has no criminal convictions, though he had been arrested for investigation of a misdemeanor years ago in Oregon, Catala said. She suspects that’s why immigration officials had him on their radar. Court records suggest Toledo-Martinez has never been charged with a crime in Washington.

A video shows Toledo-Martinez being placed in handcuffs by an undercover officer wearing a construction vest, while a dog handler threatens his wife, who filmed the interaction.

“You need to back up,” the dog handler tells her. “Or he’s going to get bit again.”

Photos show Toledo-Martinez suffered deep cuts to his arm and back from the dog attack. He was denied medical care for several hours after his arrest, then given stitches and prescribed antibiotics, which were not immediately provided to him, Murray said.

“The photos documenting his injuries are horrific,” the longtime senator said. “This should shock the conscience of every one of us. I do not want to live in an America where federal agents can sic attack dogs on peaceful residents with impunity and face no consequences.”

As of Saturday, Toledo-Martinez was being held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma.

Murray said Toledo-Martinez’s detainment is an example of President Donald Trump’s “depraved” deportations, saying he’s going after all people, not just violent criminals.

“I am calling for Wilmer’s immediate release from NWIPC — he has no criminal convictions, he poses no threat to the community, and he urgently needs appropriate medical care since ICE is denying him the treatment he requires,” Murray said in a news release.

Toledo-Martinez’s lawyers told Murray their client is an undocumented immigrant and he was brought to the U.S. at age 15. He married a U.S. citizen and has three children, ages 2, 3 and 7.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.

In a statement, Toledo-Martinez’s wife said the family is in shock, and his children cry for him every night.

They further allege another agent and a dog were hiding nearby, then that agent released the dog on Toledo-Martinez when he stepped outside.

Toledo-Martinez is currently undocumented, but was brought to the US at age 15, his attorney added. He is married to a US citizen and is the father of three young children, all born in the US.

According to Sen. Murray, his wife and two of his children were “forced to watch helplessly as he was violently attacked and dragged away,” despite him not resisting or attempting to flee.

“This should shock the conscience of every one of us. I do not want to live in an America where federal agents can sic attack dogs on peaceful residents with impunity and face no consequences,” she added. “While Donald Trump’s entire mass deportation agenda has been nothing short of depraved, this is especially sickening. By now, everyone should realize, Trump is not going after violent criminals or the worst of the worst—he is terrorizing everyone, including U.S. citizens and their loved ones.”

Sen. Murray is now calling for Toledo-Martinez’s release from custody at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC), stressing his lack of a criminal record, as well as urgent need for medical care due to his injuries.

It is the second such deportation flight after a rare agreement between Washington and Tehran, which do not have diplomatic relations, amid the Trump administration’s extreme push to expel undocumented immigrants.

There are serious concerns from human rights and advocacy organizations about the Iranians who fled to the US and may now be forced to return. The State Department’s latest human rights report, issued under the Trump administration, said there are “significant human rights issues” in Iran.

One person who said they are expected to be on the deportation flight Sunday said their life will be at risk if they return.

The person, who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation, said he fled Iran because of his sexuality. Homosexuality is punishable by death in Iran.

“I suffered a lot in country for what I am,” he said, telling CNN he was tortured and raped in Iran.

He said he came to the US “just to have a normal life like everyone else.” He was detained after crossing the border in the waning days of the Biden administration, after traveling months and being robbed and beaten en route to the US. He said he has suffered abuse and discrimination while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention.

CNN cannot independently confirm the man’s account. The person said he had filed for asylum, but the status of his application is unclear.

“Definitely my life is at risk if I return to my country,” he said.

The National Iranian American Council, a nonprofit organization, called on the administration to halt the flight.

“Iranians like the ones on this imminent deportation flight come here to escape government repression. It is disturbing that, instead of honoring their asylum claims and offering them safety, our own government may be violating their human rights and compounding the harm done to them with abuses in detention,” the group’s president, Jamal Abdi, said in a statement.

According to the source familiar with Sunday’s deportation flight, it is expected to stop in Kuwait en route to Iran. The first deportation flight was in September.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Iranian Mission to the UN for comment.

ICE declined to confirm reporting by BBC Persian about the deportations, without denying the planned operation, citing “the safety of the flight and its passengers.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2193097479.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-06 22:56:17.654995

Voting Wrongs

Two months after Donald Trump’s second inauguration, the White House released the text of a sprawling executive order allegedly designed to ensure the integrity of U.S. elections. It demanded that states share their voter rolls with federal officials; mandated onerous proof-of-citizenship rules for people registering to vote (rules which didn’t include drivers’ licenses as valid forms of ID for this purpose); threatened local and state officials who didn’t cooperate with this power grab with legal sanctions; and ostensibly outlawed the counting of any mail-in ballots received after Election Day.

More recently, the White House announced it would soon be delivering another executive order going after mail-in voting more generally, and, in particular, that it would be targeting California’s voting system which, it alleged without evidence, was rife with fraud.

In the wake of lawsuits filed by Democratic-led states, the District of Columbia, and the League of United Latin American Citizens, courts have issued preliminary injunctions against the bulk of the provisions in Trump’s executive order from March. And when the administration pushes new restrictions on voting, California and other states have already made it clear they will head straight to court.

Yet even if many of Trump’s efforts to curtail voting end up stalled in the courts, the practical effect is one of intimidation: He is marshalling the full force of the U.S. government and all of the resources of the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) to craft a narrative that elections that don’t favor Republicans are inherently suspect.

In January 2021, Trump and his acolytes attempted to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, alleging that the election which he lost by millions of votes to Joe Biden was riddled with fraud. Between 2021 and 2024, many of the people involved in these schemes were successfully prosecuted, and many others — including Donald Trump himself — were investigated and charged with multiple felonies.

On day one of Trump’s second term in office, the MAGA leader issued mass pardons and clemencies for the January 6 insurrectionists and began a process of turning FBI and DOJ resources against those who had investigated and prosecuted them. That process has lasted all year, has resulted in wholesale purges, and, if Trump has his way, will lead to a slew of prosecutions against the officials who backed Jack Smith’s special investigation.

Many of the people who peddled outlandish election conspiracies five years ago are now in positions overseeing election integrity in the United States. These include Heather Honey, an outspoken 2020 election denier who is now the DHS point person on “election integrity,” charged with communicating to the states how the feds intend to protect elections from threats foreign and domestic to undermine the voting process. A New York Times investigative report found that Honey has, in private conversations with hard-right activists, proposed declaring a “national emergency” to allow federal official to bypass states and seize control over voting processes. The civil rights division of the Justice Department is now headed by another high-profile election denier, Harmeet Dhillon. And most of the senior personnel in the voting rights section of the Department of Justice have been dismissed, as have most active cases involving allegations against locales for creating racially discriminatory barriers to voting.

And it isn’t just a matter of a few bad actors being elevated to key roles and a few good actors being fired. Trump came into office determined to undermine the independence of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) — and promptly proceeded to fire board members who had been nominated by Democratic presidents. He has issued executive orders attempting to place independent executive branch agencies, including the FEC, under his direct control. And, with Trump having proceeded to fire key members of the FEC, the board no longer has the quorum to set in place meaningful election-protection policies, leaving it fundamentally hamstrung as the 2026 election season ramps up. In other words, there is now a systematic effort afoot to break down, or render impotent, key institutional players that could serve to limit Trump’s efforts to manipulate the outcome of the 2026 elections.

Making a bad situation worse, during the DOGE purges, the new administration slashed spending on cyber security and other security measures that warn states of threats to election systems, leaving elections officials largely floundering in the face of risks they no longer were receiving adequate briefings on. The administration also gutted the teams at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as in the FBI, that work to counteract foreign interference in U.S. elections. This is a historically unprecedented rollback of election security safeguards.

And at a state level, too, the rot is also accelerating. In key swing states such as Pennsylvania, the GOP has elevated election denying legislators to control the committees charged with setting election policy. Add into the mix Trump’s order to GOP state legislators in Texas and many other states to engage in mid-decade gerrymandering, so as to secure more than a dozen additional seats in the House of Representatives, as well as the likely Supreme Court ruling undermining Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and thus allowing southern states to legislate out of existence Black-majority districts, and the stage has been set for a massive onslaught on the concept of a level playing field for elections. Republicans could, in consequence, lose the popular vote by several percent and still end up in control of Congress.

None of this is to say that the Democrats won’t win control of the House next year — recent polls suggest Republicans are in deep electoral trouble. Thus, even with the GOP’s head start guaranteed by all of these shenanigans, it’s entirely possible Democratic candidates will overcome Republican advantages in dozens of districts around the country.

But Trump’s actions this past year do not give confidence that he will easily accept such an election defeat. He is maneuvering key agencies to be utilized to challenge results that don’t go his way, and his executive orders suggest a willingness to use federal muscle — even that of the military — to seize control both of election processes and of ballot boxes if things head too far south for the Republicans.

That’s a doomsday scenario that an increasing number of state and federal legislators are warning about. Officials worry about troops and DHS agents being deployed to polling stations to intimidate would-be voters, about cyberthreats being downplayed by the feds, about ballot boxes being seized. High-profile Democratic governors such as Illinois’s Jay Pritzker and California’s Gavin Newsom have warned that the deployment of National Guard troops into cities this year is likely a precursor for a concerted effort to send federal agents into Democratic cities and states during the 2026 elections. And U.S. senators such as Alex Padilla have announced they are prepared to introduce legislation to try to counter any presidential effort to declare a national emergency around the midterm elections.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2240387965-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 21:56:48.198943

He was arrested in Camden County, Missouri, best known for the Lake of the Ozarks, a scenic stretch of waterways surrounded by mountains.
Mike Kehoe signed an executive order entering into a 287(g) agreement for collaboration between the Missouri State Highway Patrol and ICE.
Phelps County jail, where Herrera-Cruz is reportedly being held, is 100 miles southwest of St. Louis.
He was taken to a holding facility in Chicago for two days, then transferred to the Greene County jail in Missouri.","For more than 200 days, Fernando Herrera-Cruz has been sitting in a county jail in central Missouri on immigration charges. The conditions in the jail are “very bad,” Herrera-Cruz told Truthout, with the help of a translator. “There are some guards who are very racist towards immigrants.”

Herrera-Cruz, who is 25 years old, left Mexico to come to the United States to work with his brother for a roofing business in St. Louis. He was travelling in rural Missouri for a job when the trailer on his truck got a flat tire. Herrera-Cruz says a passerby stopped, began harassing him, and called the police. When local sheriff’s deputies arrived, instead of helping with the flat tire, they arrested Herrera-Cruz.

According to a Department of Justice press release, Herrera-Cruz was picked up on March 18, 2025, and charged with illegal reentry. He had previously been deported in March 2022 and made his way back to the country. He was arrested in Camden County, Missouri, best known for the Lake of the Ozarks, a scenic stretch of waterways surrounded by mountains. The press release says that Herrera-Cruz was arrested for not having a driver’s license following a “single vehicle accident.” (In Missouri and 30 other states, undocumented residents can’t get a driver’s license.)

Central Missouri is a politically conservative territory in a deep red state. Missouri, which has a troubled history as a slave state before the Civil War, is the third state in the nation for executions, behind Texas and Oklahoma. In the 2024 election, Donald Trump won Missouri with 58 percent of the vote. The state governor and local officials have eagerly collaborated with federal immigration agents to carry out the new administration’s mass deportation plans.

Despite its deep-red reputation, Missouri is also home to a growing movement of local community members organizing to fight back against mass deportation.

The Show-Me-Your-Papers State

On his first day in office in January of this year, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe signed an executive order entering into a 287(g) agreement for collaboration between the Missouri State Highway Patrol and ICE. The 287(g) program authorizes state and local police to carry out immigration enforcement duties, with Trump going so far as to offer financial incentives for training officers. In Missouri, 287(g) agreements have been rapidly expanding among law enforcement agencies across the state.

In September 2025, the governor activated 15 members of the Missouri National Guard to provide “logistical support” to federal immigration agents.

Phelps County jail, where Herrera-Cruz is reportedly being held, is 100 miles southwest of St. Louis. In January 2025, the county completed a jail expansion project that doubled its capacity to 400 beds. As Trump has shifted the U.S. deportation machine into high gear, the Phelps County jail has served as a holding facility, keeping between 50 to 70 immigrants on any given day.

An expanding detention network is being built out across the Midwest. Since Illinois banned immigrant detention, ICE sends people to county jails in nearby states. In a red state like Missouri, many of the sheriffs are Republican and support Trump’s anti-immigrant policies.

Three counties in central Missouri have opened their jail doors to ICE for immigrants arrested in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and elsewhere across the Midwest. Along with Phelps County, jails in Greene County and Ste. Genevieve County are holding people for ICE. Together, these county jails are detaining hundreds of immigrants awaiting a short appearance before a judge and a likely deportation order.

Doing Something on the Ground

Jails exist in part to hide people away from society. Behind jail walls, suffering is often out of sight, out of mind for the rest of the community. But in central Missouri, a growing number of community organizations are sprouting up to make sure immigrants in local jails aren’t forgotten.

The Phelps County jail is located in Rolla, Missouri, a small college town with a population of around 20,000 that is home to the Missouri University of Science and Technology. A group of local residents calling themselves Abide in Love formed to provide support for immigrants in the jail. They began monitoring the jail population through the sheriff’s online database, and recruited and trained pen pals to communicate with immigrants in the jail through a text messaging system. They pay for phone calls so immigrants at the jail can talk to their families. They provide hygiene packages. They also help connect families with attorneys.

Despite being a university town, “Rolla, like most of Missouri, is pretty red,” said Lucy Behrendt, current president of Abide in Love.

“A lot of us followed the rhetoric of this administration during the campaign and knew this was what was going to happen,” Behrendt told Truthout. “So when this group formed, it’s like, okay, something that I can do, besides just post stuff on Facebook, go to protests or whatever, something I can actually do, on the ground.”

While members of Abide in Love may oppose immigrant detention, they must rely on the cooperation of Phelps County Sheriff Mike Kirn to get access to immigrants in the jail. The group’s name is inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr. and they use his philosophy to navigate the conservative political landscape.

“We use the six principles [of nonviolence] at every meeting. We read them and use the strategies to help bring about a beloved community,” Abide in Love’s founder Amy Beechner-McCarthy told St. Louis Public Radio. “That helps us focus on working within the system.”

Abide in Love is a “great help for everyone,” said Herrera-Cruz. “I’ve seen that they help many people with many things. Everyone in the organization is very kind, and they support us, whether with money or an encouraging text message. They even help people learn about their cases, because some people don’t know anything.”

A Form of Protest

Abide in Love chapters are spreading across Missouri to other county jails holding immigrants for ICE. An Abide in Love group was started an hour south of St. Louis in Ste. Genevieve County, along the Mississippi River bordering Illinois. After finding out about immigrants in their county jail and talking to the group in Rolla, community members launched Abide in Love Ste. Genevieve. Board member Susie Johnson told Truthout they filed for nonprofit status, trained volunteers, reached out to immigrants in the jail, and provided support.

“What Abide in Love Ste. Genevieve is doing by helping those detained and offering support,” Johnson said, “that’s a form of protest. And we know we are making a positive difference based on the thank you messages we receive almost daily.”

The city of Ste. Genevieve has a population of 5,000 people, but over the years the sheriff has expanded the jail to hold 500 people, an unusually large jail for a community this size. According to a contract with U.S. Marshals obtained through a Freedom of Information Act Request, 400 of the beds can be used for federal detainees at a per diem rate of $103 per person. As is often the case, a long-standing contract with the U.S. Marshals Service is used to hold ICE detainees. The Abide in Love chapter in Ste. Genevieve said there’s around 150 immigrants currently being held there.

Despite its remote location, the Ste. Genevieve jail has been in the headlines. In October, Abide in Love held a vigil for Leo Cruz-Silva, who died at the Ste. Genevieve jail. In November, the arrest by ICE of Ismael Ayuzo Sandoval, beloved owner of a Mexican restaurant in Staunton, Illinois, sparked community outrage. Sandoval is currently being held in the Ste. Genevieve jail. Abide in Love has been working to mobilize around these high-profile cases.

Truck Driver From Afghanistan Set Free

In Springfield, Missouri, the third largest city in the state, community organizers are developing solidarity networks and a chapter of Abide in Love is up and running. The Immigrant Justice Collaborative is advocating for legislative change, including the repeal of a ban on sanctuary cities in Missouri. Others have founded the Southern Missouri Immigration Alliance (SMIA) which is more vocal in pressuring Sheriff Jim Arnott to stop holding immigrants at the county jail in Greene County, located in Springfield.

By monitoring the sheriff’s online data, the Southern Missouri Immigration Alliance has been reporting statistics about detention on social media. According to SMIA, there have been more than 1,400 people held for ICE detention since May 14, 2025. In mid-November, daily population had grown to 295 people currently being held. Of those, 219 are listed as “Hispanic.” The contract with U.S. Marshals is for 375 federal detainees, at a per diem rate of $100 for each individual.

Asked to respond to whether he will keep the contract, Sheriff Arnott told Truthout, “Yes, we will,” but did not provide any reasoning.

In November, the Southern Missouri Immigration Alliance put a spotlight on the case of Mohammad Ali Dadfar, who was detained at the Greene County jail. They called on Sheriff Arnott and Greene County Commissioners to release Dadfar, an asylum seeker who served in the army in Afghanistan and was forced to flee the county with his family after the Taliban took over.

Dadfar is a long-haul truck driver who lives in Colorado, but was arrested driving through Indiana when he stopped at the Chesterton Weigh Station on Interstate 94. He was one more than 140 truck drivers rounded up in “Operation Midway Blitz” as part of a crackdown on immigrant drivers issued commercial driver’s licenses by sanctuary states in New York and elsewhere. (Dadfar obtained his commercial license in Colorado.)

After he was waved aside at the weigh station in Indiana, Dadfar was held for five hours before ICE showed up to arrest him. He was taken to a holding facility in Chicago for two days, then transferred to the Greene County jail in Missouri. There, SMIA members got in contact with Dadfar who asked that they reach out to Marissa Seuc-Hester, a friend through a local church in Boulder County, Colorado.

“We met Ali’s family when they arrived in Colorado,” Seuc-Hester told Truthout. “We were matched up with them to provide community connection and allyship as they built their new life here.” Her church ministry helps to resettle new immigrants by assisting with paperwork, building resumes, and registering children for school.

For a couple of days Dadfar’s family did not know of his whereabouts. With help from SMIA members, Seuc-Hester figured out the jail’s messaging app to communicate with Dadfar.

Public pressure recently helped to free Dadfar who was ordered released by a court order on December 1, 2025. U.S. District Judge M. Douglas Harpool, in the Western District of Missouri, ruled that his right to due process was violated. He had spent nearly two months in the Greene County jail.

“We are so relieved that Ali was released,” said Seuc-Hester, “and are grateful to everyone who followed and shared his story, and advocated for his release. We know so many others are still detained, and we hope the awareness we raised will lead to many more people being rightfully freed.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1596193818-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 21:56:52.712773

The notwithstanding clause, in its four decades of existence, has never been used as frequently by any government outside of Quebec.","It’s been hard to keep track of how many legal challenges and active court proceedings the United Conservative government has tried to quash or pre-emptively block in the last six weeks, but let’s try to tally:

The notwithstanding clause to thwart separate constitutional challenges by the Canadian Medical Association (1) and 2SLGBTQ+ advocacy groups (2) against Alberta’s ban on some transgender youth health care.

Notwithstanding clause against those advocacy groups’ challenge against the school pronouns law (3).

Notwithstanding clause against any potential challenges against the ban on transgender women in women’s sports (4).

Notwithstanding clause against teachers’ potential challenge to the strike-ending and imposed contract (5).

Bill 12’s provision to block public sector pensions from suing over the Alberta wealth management fund’s past trading losses (6).

And then the measure in this week’s Bill 14 designed to discontinue the court hearing about the constitutionality of a citizen’s initiative petition for Alberta separation from Canada (7).

One could argue there’s an eighth case the UCP government’s legislation would nullify if passed — one filed by the United Conservative Party itself. That would be the governing party’s lawsuit against two of its former MLAs who had applied with Elections Alberta to rebrand the Alberta Party as the Progressive Conservative Party.

Rather than his party trying to persuade a judge or jury that taking the old PC name was illegal under current laws, Justice Minister Mickey Amery drafted a new law to make it illegal to adopt that party name, or for any other party to use the word “conservative” in its moniker.

For all the talk of managing hearing backlogs in various jurisdictions, wielding legislation like this is technically one way to reduce court caseloads — it’s just unlikely that anybody has ever proposed this unorthodox means to that end.

But Premier Danielle Smith’s government has shown it’s willing to go farther and to use more tools to achieve its aims than others.

The notwithstanding clause, in its four decades of existence, has never been used as frequently by any government outside of Quebec.

There are some instances of government laws banning lawsuits — the Ontario government, for example, did so last year for cyclists injured on bike lanes the province removes. But that was to pre-empt wholly hypothetical cases; Alberta public sector pensions had already received a Court of King’s Bench ruling that the province and Alberta Investment Management Co. could be held liable for losses if ongoing arbitration failed.

Finance Minister Nate Horner justified that specific lawsuit ban in the name of protecting taxpayers from covering those losses. Safeguarding taxpayers from costs also emerged this week as a key rationale for imposing a four-year deal on Alberta teachers rather than risk higher pay increases through an arbitrated settlement.

The given reasons for the triple application of the notwithstanding clause in Alberta’s transgender laws was to protect children, athletes and parental rights — the Smith government’s same arguments for applying the laws in the first place, but with the added spectre of legal processes forestalling those protections.

In creating a list of words in party names that could not be copied by another party, Amery insisted “this is not a partisan issue.” Rather, it was because all parties “deserve to have their goodwill protected,” Amery said — even though this new ban is specifically backdated to early July, right before independent MLA Peter Guthrie spearheaded the Progressive Conservative rebrand application.

Guthrie didn’t see this as non-partisan, but a bid to “legislate away their competition,” he posted online.

“Alberta: Strong and Free — just not for anyone challenging the UCP,” he added, in a riff on the party’s slogan (and the new licence plate motto the Smith government adopted this fall).

Another denunciation of the Alberta government’s legal manoeuvres came this week from a higher office — Court of King’s Bench Justice Colin Feasby.

He did not take kindly to legislation to discontinue the hearing he was just wrapping up, into the constitutionality of the Alberta Prosperity Project’s petition to force a separatism referendum.

Feasby denounced “changing legislation to circumvent a valid legal process” as antithetical to “the stable, predictable and ordered society that the rule of law contemplates, and democracy demands.” Not only that, but it also showed “Alberta’s cavalier disregard for court resources,” given how much of the hearing had already occurred.

Besides, he added: “the Court cannot be silenced because the case has been decided.”

Before the hearing could be discontinued by legislative decree, Feasby ended it by ruling — that it would indeed be unconstitutional for citizens to initiate a referendum that replaces the Canadian Constitution altogether with an Alberta constitution.

The separatist movement had hailed Bill 14’s attempt to discard the constitutionality hearing.

It had erased a potential hurdle to their dream to get Alberta independence on the ballot, and ultimately win — and got the separatists happy with Smith’s UCP, days after jeering the premier at her own party convention for striking a pipeline and climate deal with Ottawa.

Was it worth it, trying to quash a court hearing to clear hurdles for UCP’s separatist faction, if in doing so it raised a judge’s warnings about dangers to democracy?

Was it worth it to use the notwithstanding clause to override the Charter rights of labour unions and trans youth if it met other various societal and economic aims, as well as politically satisfying the party base?

There’s a principle in political science that political actors will often refrain from using their legal powers to the fullest and most controversial extent to punish opponents or fulfil their own ambitions, because they’re aware that doing so risks creating permission for the other side to go to the same extremes when they’re in power.

It’s known as institutional forbearance, popularized in the 2018 book How Democracies Die by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt.

Jared Wesley, a University of Alberta political scientist, said this is the concept that has traditionally restrained one government from routinely using the notwithstanding clause — nicknamed the Constitution’s nuclear option — to advance its aims, lest a successor government or other jurisdiction use the same tool to thwart those aims.

For instance, the Alberta government champions gun rights, but what if the federal government or a future Alberta premier from a different party used the notwithstanding clause to blunt gun rights?

“Populist governments, the Smith government included, tend not to think as often about how different measures would be used against them,” Wesley said. “They’re just more focused on using them in the moment.”

Classic conservatives were more cautious, more preoccupied with norms and the downdraft effects of drastic measures, Wesley told CBC News in an interview.

While former premier Peter Lougheed was a co-architect of Canada’s notwithstanding clause, subsequent Progressive Conservative governments were reluctant to wield the tool. The “new generation” of conservatives, Wesley added, have vastly different perspectives.

“They care less about institutional forbearance and more about owning their opponents,” he said.

Not only are the United Conservatives different from the Progressive Conservatives of yore, they’ve also legislated against anyone ever picking up that mantle again. In name, at least.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/73920a50-2f71-4bf0-bfa1-8cb1b608af26,1736735658244/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C1920%2C1080%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-12-07 00:56:24.277656

While Newberg watched her street corner, Emily Phillips and Marie Purcell drove down the street, checking in on Roosevelt before moving on to other schools in the area. Purcell and Phillips don't know Newberg, but they share the same goal.

""We're hearing a lot both from parents and teachers that they want a lot more community presence,"" Purcell said.

On Thursday, St. Louis Park Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Carlondrea Hines sent a message to families acknowledging reported ICE sightings near one of the district's schools. While she said that there was no firm evidence that it happened, the district ""increased supervision at school sites to ensure each of our students made it home safely.""

""The only legal paperwork that would compel St. Louis Park Public Schools to act is a judicial order signed by a judge. Without that, we will NOT confirm the enrollment or attendance of any specific student or students,"" Dr. Hines said in her message. ""At no time will ICE or other related law enforcement agents be allowed access to the school beyond the main office area without specific court documents legally requiring us to provide this access.""

Ian McConnell, a parent in the St. Louis Park school district, said that there's been renewed fear among parents this week.

""My immediate feeling when I heard that ICE was present near Aquila [Elementary] was anger. Deep, righteous anger,"" McConnell said. ""When I look just a little deeper, it's deep sadness that my neighbors are experiencing, something that they shouldn't have to.""

Purcell had a whistle attached to her wrist on Friday at Roosevelt, ready to make noise if ICE were to show up. It's been a popular tactic for those looking to interrupt ICE operations in the Twin Cities and across the country.

Wilmer Toledo-Martinez was lured out of his home in Vancouver on Nov. 14, Murray said, before he was ""violently attacked and dragged away.""

The senator said Toledo-Martinez was attacked despite not resisting arrest or attempting to flee. His wife and two young children, ages two and three, witnessed the attack.

KATU News reached out to the man's attorney and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), awaiting response.

Murray criticized the broader deportation policies under former President Donald Trump, stating, ""Trump is not going after violent criminals or the worst of the worst—he is terrorizing everyone, including U.S. citizens and their loved ones.""

Toledo-Martinez's attorney stated that the officers involved in his arrest did not wear body cameras.

After being mauled, Toledo-Martinez was denied medical care for hours, Murray and his attorney said, eventually receiving stitches and medication at a hospital. However, he reported difficulties in obtaining adequate medical care during his detention.

Toledo-Martinez, who is undocumented, was brought to the U.S. at age 15 and is married to a U.S. citizen with three U.S.-born children.

Two agents were injured, federal officials said, and U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) posted on social media that she was sprayed in the face by a substance she could not identify. She accused immigration enforcement officers of operating without transparency or accountability.

“While I am fine, if that is the way they treat me, how are they treating other community members who do not have the same privileges and protections that I do?” she said in a statement.

It was less than a month ago that Grijalva was sworn in as the newest member of Congress. She won special election in September to fill the House seat last held by her late father, Rep. Raul Grijalva.

In a video posted to social media, Grijalva said she, two members of her staff and members of the media were harassed and sprayed by agents during what appeared to be a federal immigration raid. She said they interrupted because they “were afraid that they were taking people without due process, without any kind of notice.”

The video shows a staffer stepping in front of Grijalva, raising his arm and turning the congresswoman away as a federal agent sprays nearby protesters. Later in the video, as Grijalva continues walking in the street, a projectile is seen landing near her foot.

She said that she did not know what substance she was sprayed with but that it was “still affecting” her and causing her to cough.

Federal officials said Grijalva was not pepper-sprayed and that agents with Homeland Security Investigations were targeting multiple Tucson restaurants as part of a years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations. Several search warrants were served across southern Arizona on Friday as part of the operation.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement describing the group gathered in Tucson as a “mob.” She disputed Grijalva’s account and said that two agents were seriously injured in the clash.

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel. But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone who *was* pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement,” McLaughlin wrote. “Presenting one’s self as a ‘Member of Congress’ doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement.”

Authorities used yellow tape to cordon off the restaurant and its parking lot as agents removed boxes from the building early Friday. By midmorning, protesters had gathered outside with signs and whistles.

Video shows Grijalva approaching the agents and asking where they were taking people. She asked them to stop being aggressive.

Some in the group were hit with pepper spray as they tried to keep federal vehicles from leaving the area.

Tucson police said federal tactical agents responded to extract investigative special agents from the area where the protesters were gathered. After deploying chemical munitions, police said federal agents then requested emergency support from local authorities to help exit the area.

TRUMP'S REMITTANCE TAX AIMS TO SLOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BY TARGETING THE MONEY FLOW

The warning came after a lawsuit was filed Thursday against the federal government on behalf of 21,500 immigrants facing daily penalties of $998, reaching up to $1.8 million each for staying in the U.S. illegally.

Their lawyers argued they were attempting to comply with federal immigration laws.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in October that migrants paroled in the U.S. would also face a $1,000 fee ""to institute accountability and prevent rampant fraud of the parole system.""

DHS this week launched a ""holiday deal of a lifetime,"" offering illegal immigrants a ""Cyber Monday"" incentive to self-deport.

All illegal immigrants in the country could receive a free flight home and a $1,000 bonus for voluntarily leaving the country. The average cost to arrest, detain and deport someone is $17,000, according to DHS.

People in the U.S. illegally may also qualify for forgiveness of any civil fines or penalties incurred for failing to depart, DHS said, allowing the possibility for them to return legally.

TRUMP ADMIN ON PACE TO SHATTER DEPORTATION RECORD BY END OF FIRST YEAR: 'JUST THE BEGINNING'

The Trump administration previously announced it closed out fiscal year 2025 with 237,565 Border Patrol apprehensions, the fewest since 1970.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital in October that the administration was ""on pace to shatter historic records"" by tallying 600,000 deportations by the end of Trump’s first year back in office.

More than two million illegal immigrants have left the U.S. this year, she said, including 1.6 million who have self-deported, 515,000 deportations and another 485,000 who were arrested.

Several district court judges have issued universal preliminary injunctions to block Trump’s order.
In total, four federal courts and two appellate courts have blocked Trump’s order.
That the Supreme Court is actually entertaining Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship is the clearest example yet that the Roberts Court is broken beyond repair,” Edkins continued, referring to Chief Justice John Roberts.","The United States Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether US President Donald Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship — as guaranteed under the 14th Amendment for more than 150 years — is constitutional.

Next spring, the justices will hear oral arguments in Trump’s appeal of a lower court ruling that struck down parts of an executive order — titled Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship — signed on the first day of the president’s second term. Under the directive, which has not taken effect due to legal challenges, people born in the United States would not be automatically entitled to US citizenship if their parents are in the country temporarily or without legal authorization.

Enacted in 1868, the 14th Amendment affirms that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”

While the Trump administration argues that the 14th Amendment was adopted to grant US citizenship to freed slaves, not travelers or undocumented immigrants, two key Supreme Court cases have affirmed birthright citizenship under the Constitution — United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) and Afroyim v. Rusk(1967).

Several district court judges have issued universal preliminary injunctions to block Trump’s order. However, the Supreme Court’s right-wing supermajority found in June that “universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.”

In July, a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit unanimously ruled that executive order is an unconstitutional violation of the plain language of the 14th Amendment. In total, four federal courts and two appellate courts have blocked Trump’s order.

“No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” Cecillia Wang, national legal director at the ACLU — which is leading the nationwide class action challenge to Trump’s order — said in a statement Friday. “We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”

Brett Edkins, managing director of policy and political affairs at the advocacy group Stand Up America, was among those who suggested that the high court justices should have refused to hear the case given the long-settled precedent regarding the 14th Amendment.

“This case is a right-wing fantasy, full stop. That the Supreme Court is actually entertaining Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship is the clearest example yet that the Roberts Court is broken beyond repair,” Edkins continued, referring to Chief Justice John Roberts.

“Even if the court ultimately rules against Trump, in a laughable display of its supposed independence, the fact that fringe attacks on our most basic rights as citizens are being seriously considered is outrageous and alarming,” he added.

Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, said that “it’s deeply troubling that we must waste precious judicial resources relitigating what has been settled constitutional law for over a century,” adding that “every federal judge who has considered this executive order has found it unconstitutional.”

Tianna Mays, legal director for Democracy Defenders Fund, asserted, “The attack on the fundamental right of birthright citizenship is an attack on the 14th Amendment and our Constitution.”

“We are confident the court will affirm this basic right, which has stood for over a century,” Mays added. “Millions of families across the country deserve and require that clarity and stability.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2221594152-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 18:57:31.068724

A justice department memo issued on Tuesday said “effective immediately”, prisons and jails will no longer be held responsible for violations of standards meant to shield LGBTQ+ people from harassment, abuse and rape. It also directed inspectors to stop auditing facilities for compliance with those protections. The justice department is in the process of seeking formal updates to the rules, the memo said.

The directive relates to regulations under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (Prea), a longstanding federal law which says incarcerated people should be screened for their risk of facing sexual assault when officials place them in housing and that assessments must consider LGBTQ+ status.

Prea, passed unanimously by Congress in 2003, includes standards aimed at addressing the high levels of violence that transgender, gender-nonconforming and queer people face in jails and prisons across the US. Prea applies to all correctional facilities.

The memo from Tammie Gregg, principal deputy director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which is part of the justice department, said the policy shifts were designed to align with one of Donald Trump’s signature anti-trans executive orders. The “restoring biological truth” order, issued on Trump’s inauguration day, called for transgender women to be banned from women’s housing in correctional facilities and dictated that the federal Bureau of Prisons stop providing gender-affirming care to incarcerated trans people.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gregg’s memo was sent to Prea auditors, who review compliance with the law, directing the monitors to ignore LGBTQ+ protections in future audits. The justice department, Gregg said, was “currently updating” its Prea standards to align with the president’s order.

The affected regulations, the memo says, include policies mandating that trans, intersex and gender-nonconforming people be “screened for risk of victimization”. It also affects regulations designed to protect LGBTQ+ people from discriminatory pat searches by staff, including rules meant to ensure trans women can be searched by female officers and regulations to prevent invasive examinations of individuals’ genitals.

The memo further affects rules on how employees should respectfully communicate with LGBTQ+ people and requirements that sexual abuse investigations consider whether a perpetrator was motivated by a victim’s LGBTQ+ status.

“The proposed revisions to the Prea standards will lead to increased chaos and violence inside prisons and jails, placing staff and incarcerated people in greater danger,” said Linda McFarlane, executive director of Just Detention International, a human rights group, in a statement. “It will allow rapists to act with impunity. And it is already sowing confusion among prison leaders, who have worked for more than a decade to put in place commonsense rules to end prisoner rape … It’s sickening.”

McFarlane’s group has long trained correctional staff on Prea standards and has had certified auditors on staff. In an interview on Friday, she said the immediate impact was a loss of a critical oversight mechanism, and that she hoped institutions would continue to honor Prea.

Incarcerated trans people have long struggled with abuse, even with the standards in effect, she added: “They are already in grave danger. I’ve never met a trans person in detention who has not experienced sexual abuse or harassment while incarcerated.”

The memo comes even after Trump’s executive order has been blocked in court. Earlier this year, some trans women imprisoned by the Bureau of Prisons were moved from women’s facilities into men’s prisons, but the courts later ordered they be transferred back. The rulings have protected individual plaintiffs, but the majority of trans people in federal custody remain housed in facilities that do not match their gender identity.

Spokespeople for the White House and Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.

Kara Janssen, an attorney who has represented trans women in Bureau of Prisons custody in litigation this year, condemned the memo. “This is putting not only our clients in an incredibly dangerous situation, it’s putting all these facilities in an almost impossible position, with the federal government telling them not to comply with their own laws,” she said. “It’s saying you don’t have to be afraid to violate the law … and you can do these searches as disrespectfully as possible.”

Regardless of any changes to Prea, constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment remained in effect, Janssen added: “When people are assaulted as a result of these changes, there is liability for these facilities. That is not going away.”

Shana Knizhnik, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBTQ & HIV project, noted the memo would create challenges for Prea monitors, with at least one auditor warning in a statement to NPR the memo would make their work “more confusing and more difficult”.

Knizhnik emphasized that Prea remained the law and institutions were required to follow it, but she was concerned about “the signal this sends to officials in charge of maintaining folks’ safety in custody”. She added: “This gives more license to individuals to target trans, intersex and other LGBTQ+ folks in carceral settings and ignore their obligations under the law.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc7a6d3f2e7a1abc018719839979abec40073388/0_0_4592_3674/master/4592.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e4bc6535cf9b2602e6c8ec7c10079ff5",N,,2025-12-06 22:56:26.289659

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review President Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship, a significant legal challenge that questions the interpretation of the 14th Amendment. This directive, which aims to limit automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, could have far-reaching consequences for immigration policy and citizenship laws in the country. With lower courts blocking the order, the Supreme Court’s decision will determine whether this controversial move aligns with constitutional principles and the nation’s longstanding approach to birthright citizenship.

The Supreme Court has agreed to review President Donald Trump’s controversial directive to limit birthright citizenship, which challenges the interpretation of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This decision will have significant implications on the country’s immigration policy, potentially altering the long-standing understanding of birthright citizenship established by a 19th-century constitutional provision.

In a move to curb immigration, the Trump administration issued an executive order instructing U.S. agencies not to recognize the citizenship of children born in the U.S. to parents who are not U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. Lower courts swiftly blocked this order, ruling that it violated the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause, which grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. However, the Justice Department appealed, and the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, with arguments expected later in the current term.

This legal battle began when several states—Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon—along with individual plaintiffs filed lawsuits challenging the directive. The lower courts ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, arguing that the policy contradicted both the 14th Amendment and the federal law ensuring birthright citizenship. The U.S. District Court in New Hampshire even allowed a nationwide class-action lawsuit to proceed, effectively blocking the executive order on a national level.

The case has already been heard in lower courts, with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals siding with the states. In the face of these setbacks, the Trump administration sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to resolve the matter definitively. The Court’s decision to take up the case before a federal appeals court could review it further highlights the significance of the legal divide and the urgent need for a national resolution.

At the heart of the case is the interpretation of the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause, which states that all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction are U.S. citizens. Ratified in 1868, the clause has historically been understood to guarantee birthright citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. However, the Trump administration argues that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” should not be interpreted as simply being born in the U.S. Instead, they assert that only children born to parents who have primary allegiance to the United States—such as citizens and legal permanent residents—should automatically receive citizenship. This interpretation could potentially exclude children born to non-citizen immigrants who are in the U.S. temporarily, including those on student or work visas.

The Trump administration’s position aligns with a narrower reading of the 14th Amendment, suggesting that “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” requires a level of permanent, lawful residency. The administration argues that parents must have “lawful domicile,” meaning they are lawfully residing in the U.S. with the intent to remain. In contrast, critics point to a well-established precedent in U.S. law, citing the 1898 Supreme Court case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which upheld the principle of birthright citizenship. In that case, the Court ruled that children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents were entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The challengers in this case, including civil rights organizations like the ACLU, argue that Trump’s executive order contradicts this precedent and the statutory law passed by Congress in 1940, which was later incorporated into the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. This law codified the understanding that the 14th Amendment guarantees birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S., regardless of their parents’ immigration status.

The administration’s argument also hinges on the idea of “birth tourism,” a term used to describe the practice of foreigners traveling to the U.S. to give birth so their children can automatically receive U.S. citizenship. The Trump administration contends that birthright citizenship has created incentives for illegal immigration, exacerbating the strain on immigration systems and contributing to the phenomenon of birth tourism.

As the case moves to the Supreme Court, the stakes are high. A ruling in favor of the Trump administration could redefine the meaning of birthright citizenship and restrict the automatic grant of citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. Such a decision would overturn decades of legal precedent and could have far-reaching implications for immigration law in the U.S.

The Court’s decision will likely come by the end of June, and the justices will hear arguments on the matter during their current term. The case is expected to spark significant debate over the interpretation of the 14th Amendment and the future of immigration policy in the U.S. While the administration maintains that its actions are necessary for the security of the nation, its critics argue that such a move would undermine the core principles of American citizenship and the rights afforded to all individuals born in the country.

Regardless of the outcome, this case represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing national discussion about immigration and citizenship. The Supreme Court’s ruling could set a precedent that shapes the future of birthright citizenship and how the U.S. defines its relationship with non-citizens and immigrants.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/istockphoto-623595614-612x612-12-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 00:56:28.210455

The plane spotter named Nick Benson witnessed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trucks at the airport, with potentially 14 people being loaded onto a Global Crossing flight. Benson has observed similar activities multiple times since April.

The Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) clarified that they do not receive advance notification of government-related flights, including those by ICE.

What they're saying:

""This plane is going to fly to Omaha, Nebraska next. I assume it's going to pick up another group of deportees there,"" said Benson. He noted that Alexandria, Louisiana, is a major hub for ICE air operations.

Benson mentioned that Global Crossing planes have been coming to Minneapolis regularly, even during the previous administration, but it was more transparent back then.

A representative with DHS provided the following statement to FOX 9: ""ICE does not confirm or deny specific flights for operational security. However, under President Trump and Secretary Noem, ICE removal flights are occurring every day.""

During this time of year when we should be reflecting compassion and gratitude, far too many families in our community are instead living in fear. In my 25-plus years of working as a social worker with children and families, I have never witnessed the level of anxiety and trauma we are seeing today.

Friends and neighbors who have followed every legal step available to them are being arrested and detained without warning. Some are taken from their workplaces, while others are detained in front of their children’s schools. These actions are not only cruel but deeply destabilizing to families who have already endured unimaginable hardship.

Recently, a former colleague and close friend of mine was detained by ICE while simply doing his job. He is a devoted husband, father and friend and one of the most hardworking, compassionate, community-minded people I know.

Without notice, he was transported to a detention center out of state and held for weeks before finally being granted a bond hearing. His family spent every one of those days consumed with fear and uncertainty. After a few long weeks, he was released, but the trauma remains.

This is no way to treat human beings. Right here in Maine parents are being separated from their children, shackled during transfer and held in cold facilities without access to coats or warm clothing. These are not isolated incidents. This is happening across the country and violates people’s basic principles of dignity and due process.

The current administration is actively dismantling legal pathways and constitutional protections for people seeking safety. Many of those being detained are law-abiding individuals who fled instability, persecution and violence and have followed every legal requirement to pursue asylum or obtain green cards.

They have lived here for years. They work. They pay taxes. They contribute immeasurably to our workforce and our communities. And yet, because of a massive immigration backlog, some waiting a decade or more for their cases to be heard, families are left vulnerable to being arrested and detained.

We are punishing people not for breaking the rules, but for being stuck in a system that cannot process cases efficiently.

Detaining working, law-abiding community members without due process undermines both our legal system and our shared humanity. Maine families deserve better. We need solutions, not fear.

Here is where we must start:

1. Invest in immigration courts and case processing. The backlog of more than 3 million immigration cases nationwide is unacceptable. We need more judges (not fewer) and increased funding for the immigration courts and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Families should not wait a decade for clarity or safety.

2. End arbitrary arrests and ensure humane treatment. ICE officers should be required to identify themselves, follow transparent procedures and treat people with dignity. Fear-based enforcement erodes trust and re-traumatizes families who have already survived profound instability.

3. Guarantee due process and access to legal representation. Every person deserves a fair hearing and access to legal counsel. This is a constitutional right, not an optional courtesy, and the government cannot dismiss or adjudicate cases without providing due process.

Maine has always been a place where we take care of one another. In this moment, our values matter more than ever. We must raise our voices together and demand an immigration system that treats every person with safety, dignity and fairness.

We cannot remain silent while families live in fear, parents are torn from their children and hardworking members of our community are punished for bureaucratic failures. It is time to advocate for policies that prioritize human rights, strengthen our courts and provide real pathways to security and stability.

Maine can, and must, lead by example, showing that compassion, justice and accountability are not just ideals, but actionable commitments in how we treat every member of our community.",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Trump_Immigration_Boston_65764.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-12-06 19:57:22.243343

Since all asylum applications are currently on hold, war refugees and people facing political persecution from around the world will no longer find a safe haven in the US.","United States President Donald Trump announced drastic measures against immigration in late November. All asylum procedures were suspended indefinitely ""until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" Joseph Edlow, director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), posted on X.

Further restrictions have since been imposed on nationals from 19 countries. These include entry bans and the suspension of all immigration applications and naturalizations. The granting of permanent residence and work permits, known as green cards, has also been suspended for people of the nationalities in question. USCIS chief Edlow said the president had also directed him to conduct ""a full scale, rigorous re-examination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern,"" including holders of residence permits that have already been granted.

What sparked the immigration crackdown?

The background to these new policies is an attack on two National Guard soldiers in Washington on November 26. The two men were seriously injured by gunshots in the center of the US capital, and one of the victims later died. The suspected attacker, a 29-year-old Afghan, was arrested and charged with murder. According to media reports, he entered the US in 2021, the year of the chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, having previously worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other US government agencies in his home country.

But the Trump administration's recent response is in line with asylum and migrationpolicies that have become increasingly rigid in recent months. The US president used this incident to once again sharply criticize immigration under Joe Biden, claiming that, like many others, the alleged assassin had entered the country ""unchecked"" during his predecessor's term in office.

But a US government file revealed that the alleged gunman was actually granted asylum this year under Trump, Reuters reported.

Which countries are affected?

The immigration ban applies to citizens of countries on three continents. In Asia, this includes Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, and Laos. In Latin America, the ban applies to Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela. But most of the sanctioned countries are in Africa: Libya, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of Congo and Burundi.

These are all the same 19 countries for which the US government imposed entry bans in June 2025. And these restrictions have now been tightened once again. They are considered ""high-risk"" because US authorities say that they don't receive enough reliable information about their nationals to conduct security checks. Many of these countries are also accused of failing to cooperate in taking back people who have been required to leave the US.

How are immigrants impacted?

The new restrictions have far-reaching consequences for the individuals concerned: all green card applications, naturalizations, and asylum procedures have been put on hold for the time being. Those affected cannot pursue their applications, even if they were already being processed. Even green card holders could lose their permanent residency status after a new security check. In the worst case, they would then face deportation to their home countries.

Late this week, it was announced that the US government would also shorten the maximum validity period of work permits for refugees, asylum seekers, and other migrants — from five years to 18 months.

Since all asylum applications are currently on hold, war refugees and people facing political persecution from around the world will no longer find a safe haven in the US. The additional issue of reuniting affected families has now also been made extremely difficult or even impossible because family members will no longer be admitted to the country.

But the US economy is also facing negative consequences as a result of these policies. The freeze affects sectors that are heavily dependent on foreign workers, particularly in health, science, and technology. The refusal to issue visas, green cards, or work permits makes it difficult to import talent and skilled workers in these areas.

Who has criticized these policies?

While the US government considers the measures necessary steps to protect national security, Democratic lawmakers and human rights organizations have been critical. ""Nothing meaningfully links the 19 countries except the administration's opportunistic stigmatization and exclusion of people based on where they were born,"" Tanya Greene, US program director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""This sweeping change is not about safety. It is about scapegoating entire nationalities to justify discriminatory policies.""

To win, Democrats should unite behind popular policies that will repair the immense damage Trump has caused and build a better future for Americans.
In November elections, voters fed up with Trump elected Democrats with a broad range of views.
Trump imposed these tariffs on most nations without congressional approval, and they are making life in the U.S. less affordable.
With the right message and messengers, Democrats can show it is vitally important that they win majorities in the House and Senate next year to act as a check and balance on Trump’s destructive presidency.","Growing numbers of Americans are realizing President Trump is a raging bull in a china shop, recklessly destroying the effectiveness of federal agencies, making America less affordable, increasing unemployment, endangering our health and corrupting our justice system.

A November Associated Press poll found only 33 percent of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s management of government, down from 43 percent in March. While other polls show Trump with an approval ratings in the 40s, none show he gets the approval of most Americans.

Public support for Trump will likely fall lower as the affordability crisis worsens due to his tariffs and other harmful policies, and as more is revealed about his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This could enable Democrats to win control of the House and Senate in 2026 elections.

To win, Democrats should unite behind popular policies that will repair the immense damage Trump has caused and build a better future for Americans.

Trump was reelected because he promised to reduce unauthorized immigration, slow inflation, make health care more affordable and do much more to improve our lives. Other than arresting and deporting immigrants — often without due process of law — he has failed to deliver.

Instead, Trump has dedicated himself to investigating and prosecuting his enemies and to enriching his family. He has monetized the presidency to nearly double the net worth of his family to an estimated $10 billion since he was reelected, according to Forbes magazine.

In November elections, voters fed up with Trump elected Democrats with a broad range of views. New York City will get a democratic socialist mayor, but far more Democratic moderates were elected — including as governors and state legislators in New Jersey and Virginia, and as local officials in many places.

Although Democrats don’t agree on everything, we share many beliefs. Congressional candidates next year should embrace the following positions on domestic issues to take advantage of voter opposition to Trump’s failures and offer a better way forward.

For the sake of affordability, they should reach reciprocal tariff reductions with other nations to lower prices on imports and expand markets for U.S. exports, creating jobs. Trump imposed these tariffs on most nations without congressional approval, and they are making life in the U.S. less affordable.

Democrats should promise to reform the immigration system to allow more people to enter the U.S. legally and create a pathway to citizenship. Halt roundups of immigrants whose only crime is being in the U.S. without authorization. Mass deportations are creating worker shortages that are worsening the affordability crisis by raising prices for food, housing and other essentials.

They should restore more than $24 billion in funds Trump cut from clean energy projects, along with a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles and a 30 percent tax credit for homeowners who buy solar energy panels. This would make energy more affordable and create jobs, in addition to fighting climate change.

To address America’s shortage of an estimated 4 million to 7 million affordable apartments and houses, they should launch a partnership between federal, state and local governments and the housing construction industry to increase the supply of affordable housing.

To fulfill our responsibility to educate our children, they should reverse Trump’s dismantling of the Education Department and restore the billions of dollars and thousands of jobs he has eliminated from the department.

They should reform the tax system so that wealthy individuals and corporations pay their fair share. They should also rescind Internal Revenue Service budget cuts to enable the agency to crack down on wealthy tax cheats.

Democrats must end Trump’s war on diversity, equity and inclusion, which is spreading bigotry and blocking the advancement of people who are not straight white men. America benefits when all people can reach their full potential and when the achievements of all Americans are celebrated.

On health Care, Democrats should promise to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of this year, to prevent 22 million Americans from seeing their health insurance premiums more than double. They should also restore medical research funding that Trump has cut.

They should also promise to end Trump’s weaponization of the Justice Department and other federal agencies against the president’s enemies. They should restore about $500 million in budget cuts Trump has proposed for the FBI and restore the bureau’s role in preventing terrorism and fighting major crimes, rather than patrolling cities to roundup unauthorized immigrants.

Democrats should also halt Trump’s deployment of the military and National Guard troops in U.S. cities and increase funding for local police departments and community initiatives to prevent crime.

The above positions would benefit the Democratic Party’s candidates by attracting voters and more importantly would benefit America.

Taiwan’s significance boils down to semiconductors and shipping lanes. Washington’s “hectoring” of the wealthy Gulf monarchies needs to stop.

The world as seen from the White House is a place where America can use its vast powers to make money.

President Trump has shown all year that his second term would make it a priority to squeeze less powerful countries to benefit American companies. But late Thursday, his administration made that profit-driven approach a core element of its official foreign policy, publishing its long-anticipated update to U.S. national security aims around the world.

The document, known as the National Security Strategy, describes a world in which American interests are far narrower than how prior administrations — even in Mr. Trump’s first term — had portrayed them. Gone is the long-familiar picture of the United States as a global force for freedom, replaced by a country that is focused on reducing migration while avoiding passing judgment on authoritarians, instead seeing them as sources of cash.

“We seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations of the world,” it says, “without imposing on them democratic or other social change that differs widely from their traditions and histories.”

The National Security Strategy of Mr. Trump’s first term, by contrast, cast the world as a contest “between those who favor repressive systems and those who favor free societies.”

The National Security Strategy has no binding force, and some analysts cautioned against reading too much into it as a guide to future actions given Mr. Trump’s mercurial nature.

But the release of the strategy, which recent presidents have generally updated just once in every term, did carry significance as a snapshot in time. Amid the debates swirling among Republicans over American policy toward the Middle East, Russia, China and elsewhere, the document showed how the administration has appeared to coalesce around a commitment to avoid military entanglements and promote commerce.

In an interview, Dan Caldwell, a former senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who argues in favor of American military restraint, hailed the new strategy as a “true break from the failed bipartisan post-Cold War foreign policy consensus.”

“For too long, delusion undergirded our foreign policy — delusion about America’s role in the world, delusion about our interests and delusion about what we can achieve through military force,” Mr. Caldwell said. “This is a reality-based document in that regard.”

The document codifies Mr. Trump’s well-established aversion to Europe’s liberal governments and his readiness to overlook human rights abuses, as with his “things happen” remark last month about the murder and dismemberment of a Saudi Washington Post columnist in 2018. Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said it “discards decades of values-based U.S. leadership in favor of a craven, unprincipled worldview.”

The strategy depicts Europe as facing “civilizational erasure” at the hands of immigrants and its mainstream leaders. It says the United States will cultivate “resistance” to Europe’s mainstream leaders, and asserts that many of their governments “trample on basic principles of democracy to suppress opposition.”

That stance provoked an outcry from European politicians, echoing the shock when Vice President JD Vance castigated German officials in February for trying to blunt the rise of the country’s far-right party. Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, posted on social media that the National Security Strategy “places itself to the right of the extreme right in Europe.”

Outside Europe, departing from decades of precedent in U.S. foreign policy, the 33-page document does not characterize democracy as a value to be defended. Israel and Taiwan — two democracies whose security the United States has long sought to support — are described in the context of their regions’ economic significance, not their connection to American values.

The Middle East, it says, is “a source and destination of international investment.” The document calls for “dropping America’s misguided experiment with hectoring these nations — especially the Gulf monarchies — into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government.”

In Latin America, the document says, the United States will “reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American pre-eminence in the Western Hemisphere.” Along the way, American diplomats are to hunt for “major business opportunities in their country, especially major government contracts.”

“The terms of our agreements, especially with those countries that depend on us most and therefore over which we have the most leverage, must be sole-source contracts for our companies,” the document says.

The strategy offers little insight into the Trump administration’s deliberations about a possible attack on Venezuela. While it says the United States should have a “predisposition to non-interventionism,” it also says that American military force is to be redeployed to Latin America from elsewhere “to address urgent threats in our hemisphere.”

Mr. Caldwell, the former adviser to Mr. Hegseth, said that many in Mr. Trump’s “America First” movement “have concerns about a regime change war in Venezuela.”

“But that said, what happens in Venezuela and our own hemisphere deserves more focus than who controls the Donbas,” he added, referring to the region of eastern Ukraine that Russia is demanding in peace talks.

The National Security Strategy takes a far more restrained view of geopolitical competition than prior administrations did. Gone is any reference to the worldview laid out in Mr. Trump’s 2017 National Security Strategy: “China and Russia want to shape a world antithetical to U.S. values and interests.”

Without describing Russia as an adversary, the new document says that “an expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine” is a “core interest of the United States.” The goal of such a peace deal, it says, would be both to “re-establish strategic stability with Russia” and to enable Ukraine’s “survival as a viable state.”

China is cast as a competitor, but mainly in the familiar commercial terms often repeated by Mr. Trump. The document says a war over Taiwan needs to be deterred because of what would be its “major implications for the U.S. economy.” It calls for “a genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing,” echoing the conciliation of the trade truce that Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, announced in October.

Jonathan Czin, a director for China on the National Security Council under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said the new strategy carried “a happier message for Beijing” than the versions published under Mr. Biden or in Mr. Trump’s first term. Among other things, he said, the document’s focus on Latin America should be welcome news for China.

“I think it would be viewed with some relief,” said Mr. Czin, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.

This terrorizing and demonizing pretends to be in service of recreating a white America that never existed.
The US when white supremacists like Trump were young was whiter, but this was never a white country.
The persecution of huge numbers of brown people and even the mass deportations will not create the white country of far-right fantasy.
City after city has risen up to defend its own.","As Donald Trump deteriorates and his grasp on power fades, he has been lashing out furiously at female journalists and ethnic groups, most recently Somali Americans. His insults land because of their animosity and his power, not their accuracy. Likewise, his administration’s attacks on immigrants are sloppy and driven by lies. It’s strikingly clear that the target is not individuals with criminal records. It’s anyone and everyone guilty of being brown. Native Americans with tribal identification cards, US citizens, people doing crucial work from construction to nursing, military veterans, college students, people sleeping in their own beds, small children: all kinds of residents of this country are under attack.

“ICE raids are cruel, inhumane, and do nothing to serve public safety,” declares Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect. Masked thugs smashing car windows and dragging parents away from their babies, terrorizing whole swathes of the population, and interfering with the ability of schools and businesses to function does the opposite. The rounds of targeted hatred by Trump and his minions – for people from Haiti during the 2024 campaign, for people from Venezuela this spring and summer, and most recently for people from Somalia – rely on defamatory lies and insults, because the facts about these groups don’t support the hate.

This terrorizing and demonizing pretends to be in service of recreating a white America that never existed. The US when white supremacists like Trump were young was whiter, but this was never a white country. In 1776, the 13 colonies that became the United States included a significant percentage of Black and Indigenous people (some southern states were a third or more Black). When the US annexed Texas in 1844 and then in 1848 took Mexico’s whole northern half, a Spanish-speaking population was already settled across parts of what’s now the south-west and California. The first African Muslim in what is now the United States came in a Spanish expedition almost a century before the Mayflower brought its fanatical Puritans to the shores of Massachusetts in 1620.

The persecution of huge numbers of brown people and even the mass deportations will not create the white country of far-right fantasy. Los Angeles, for example is an almost 50% Latino city, and despite the ICE and border patrol outrages, arrests, imprisonments and deportations, it remains so. The city’s very name is Spanish, a reminder of who was here first. All the hatred, all the persecution, seems like the panic of racists pretending they can stop the future of this country no longer being majority white through sheer cruelty.

It’s coupled with an attack on reproductive rights that is sometimes openly intended to make white women have more babies (the US has a below-replacement rate birthrate, which is less impactful than in many other countries facing the same decline, because a young, hard-working immigrant workforce keeps things going). Of course, rather than offering the support that might make parenthood less grueling, they are attempting to realize their goals by punitive means. And it’s not working. Margaret Talbot of the New Yorker writes that JD Vance’s reproductive politics – and insults to childless women – amount to pronatalism, which “typically combines concerns about falling birth rates with anti-immigration and anti-feminist ideas”.

Likewise, CNN reports: “Reproductive rights groups and other advocacy organizations say these efforts to buttress the birth rate don’t make up for broader administration priorities aimed at cutting federal programs such as Medicaid, its related Children’s Health Insurance Program, and other initiatives that support women and children. The pro-family focus, they say, isn’t just about boosting procreation. Instead, they say, it’s being weaponized to push a conservative agenda that threatens women’s health, reproductive rights, and labor force participation.”

The anti-immigration and pronatalist policies add up to fantasies of redirecting the demographic future of this country. Both amount to, in the end, dim-witted bullying by haters inadvertently demonstrating that their claims to superiority have to be based on race and gender, because otherwise they’re incoherent idiots.

A lot of the Trump administration’s justifications don’t line up with realities and results. The attacks in the southern Caribbean target small boats not confirmed to be carrying drugs and not capable of reaching the US. Venezuela is not involved in any meaningful way in trafficking fentanyl and much less involved in cocaine trafficking than other South American countries.

“We reject the disastrous ‘climate change’ and ‘Net Zero’ ideologies,” says a new White House document. Trump and company are sentimentally committed to fossil fuel, especially coal, and are forcing various US locales to waste money on this outdated and toxic fuel while sabotaging cheaper, cleaner renewable energy. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, is sabotaging public health while promoting anti-scientific schemes to control Americans’ diet.

The premise of the attacks on immigrants is that people of color who were not born in the US are intruders and threats, but from Los Angeles to Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chicago to Portland to New York, it’s the Trump administration’s violent foot soldiers with ICE and the border patrol that locals perceive as unwelcome threats and violent invaders. There is no more dramatic sign of the rejection of Trumpism than the thousands upon thousands organizing, showing up, risking bodily safety, arrest and felony charges to defend their neighbors. City after city has risen up to defend its own. All of Trump’s insults cannot change that.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6d8a325b3f1277257e32fe202baec9cae5a4b60/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9f538748b1202e4c24f59ebc9be83a80",N,,2025-12-06 16:31:38.359900

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Earlier today, a three-judge panel appointed by former President Bill Clinton heard oral arguments in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as they consider whether to uphold a lower court decision from Hawaii placing a nationwide freeze on the Muslim ban. For the second time in the past week, President Trump’s inflammatory campaign statements targeting Muslims faced intense judicial scrutiny as the acting Solicitor General struggled to make the unreasonable sound reasonable.

The Fight Over Trump’s Muslim Ban Is A Fight Over America’s Identity

To be clear, this fight in court over Donald Trump’s Muslim ban is not an ordinary disagreement over immigration policy ― racism and discrimination are on trial, and concerned Americans are fighting back against efforts to make these the official policies of the United States. The intent behind the Muslim ban is becoming a central issue in ongoing lawsuits, precisely because a racist intent taints the law itself as racist ― and unconstitutional.

Iranian-Americans Continue Fight Against Second Muslim Ban

The judge in the Iranian-American lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s Muslim Ban indicated Friday that she was not yet ready to issue a new nationwide freeze on the ban. Instead, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan in the Washington, D.C. Circuit requested additional briefs from the Iranian-American plaintiffs and from the government side, in order for her to make a decision some time after May 5th.

Court Hears Live Testimony Ahead of Friday Hearing on Muslim Ban

Washington, DC – DC District Court Judge Tanya S. Chutkan heard live testimonials on Tuesday from members of the Iranian-American community in the joint lawsuit, Pars Equality Center, et al., v. Donald J. Trump, et al., brought on behalf of four Iranian-American organizations challenging the Administration’s Muslim Ban.

Q & A: Would Trump’s Muslim Ban 2.0 Keep Us Safer?

Trump’s revised Muslim ban is set to go into effect this Thursday, March 16th. Since it’s announcement last week, we at NIAC have received an avalanche of questions from across the United States. In an effort to keep you informed, we posed the five most common questions that we’ve received to NIAC’s Reza Marashi and Adam Weinstein. Their answers are as follows.

NIAC Panel on Capitol Hill Examines Trump’s Muslim Ban 2.0

“Some refer to it as the Muslim ban, some argue that it does not affect all Muslims so it is not a Muslim ban, that is up for debate. What is not up for debate is that it affects all Iranians. Iranians, of the six countries, make up 58% of the visas that are granted annually” said NIAC policy director, Jamal Abdi, in his opening remarks.

Muslim Ban 2.0 Undermines American Interests

On March 6, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States” barring entry into the U.S. for foreign nationals from six countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Still a Muslim Ban, Still Permanent

The Trump Administration is fulfilling its campaign promise to impose a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States…” Trump advisor Rudy Giuliani indicated that the President asked him how to implement a Muslim ban legally prior to the first Executive Order, and advisor Stephen Miller indicated that the new order will feature only minor technical changes and will result in the same fundamental policy.

Why Trump’s Travel Ban is Still a Muslim Ban

President Donald Trump’s new travel ban may reduce the chaos at airports caused by his previous executive order, but it will not enhance American security or make the intention behind the original order any less bigoted.

Indeed, in our opinion, the new travel ban is still very much a Muslim ban, even if it falls short of the Trump administration’s true ambitions.

A close look at what the administration has been doing since the now-infamous executive order was issued on January 27 — banning travelers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority nations — reveals a clear intent from Trump’s inner circle to depopulate the United States of Muslims.

FAQ: Trump’s New Travel Ban

What is the Executive Order?

1. On March 6, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law an Executive Order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.” Section 3(c) of the Order blocks entry into the U.S. of foreign nationals from six affected countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — who:

1. are outside the United States on the effective date of the Executive Order;

2. do not currently have a valid visa; and

3. did not have a valid visa on January 27, 2017.

This travel ban is alleged to last 90 days from the date of implementation. However, Section 3(e) suggests that — for countries unwilling or unable to provide satisfactory information regarding its nationals seeking entry into the United States — the travel ban will be indefinite. Because the United States and Iran lack diplomatic relations, it is highly unlikely that Iran would provide the information necessary to satisfy the standards of the Executive Order. As a result, it is expected that the Order’s travel ban will prove indefinite for Iranian persons.

Sessions May Have Committed Perjury on Muslim Ban As Well

Washington, DC – NIAC Action Executive Director Jamal Abdi issued the following statement:

“NIAC Action is concerned that Attorney General Jeff Sessions may have misled the Senate Judiciary Committee in his confirmation hearing with regard to his role in planning and drafting President Trump’s executive order banning individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. With new questions being raised regarding whether the Attorney General perjured himself in testimony before the U.S. Congress over contacts with the Russian ambassador, it is appropriate to revisit the record regarding his testimoney that he played no role in drafting or planning the so-called “Muslim ban”, in addition to other immigration-related Executive Orders.

Update: What’s Next in the Effort to Overturn Trump’s Muslim Ban – and What Will the New Executive Order Likely do?

Efforts to overturn the Trump administration’s Muslim ban are expected to take a new turn this week with the issuance of a new Executive Order this coming Wednesday.

Dozens more have retired or resigned. The diminishing headcount and mounting backlog of cases is fueling further disorder at immigration courts already roiled by masked federal agents detaining migrants and reduced pathways to legal status.

The courtroom culling process has become formulaic, ousted judges and their advocates told POLITICO: The judges receive an email stating Attorney General Pam Bondi has removed them from their posts, pursuant to Article II of the Constitution; their names are immediately struck from the Department of Justice’s website; and the news of the latest wave ricochets around chat groups formed among ousted colleagues.

Immigration judges are treated as at-will employees because the administrative courts they preside over fall under the purview of the Department of Justice and are not part of the judiciary branch. Rulings by judges in those immigration courts can ultimately be overturned by the attorney general. The oustings have renewed calls for the immigration courts to be independent of the executive branch — a push unlikely to gain traction in a Republican-controlled Congress.

A Department of Justice spokesperson blamed the current state of affairs on former President Joe Biden’s administration.

“After four years of the Biden Administration forcing Immigration Courts to implement a de facto amnesty for hundreds of thousands of aliens, this Department of Justice is restoring integrity to our immigration system and encourages talented legal professionals to join in our mission to protect national security and public safety,” the spokesperson said.

The Trump administration has sought to replace terminated immigration judges with military lawyers as a stopgap and recruit “deportation judges to ensure that only aliens with legally meritorious claims are allowed to remain.”

“We all felt like you can’t do more damage than you already have to the immigration courts and to justice and to due process. Yet it’s like, ‘Hold my beer, watch this,’” said Judge Jennifer Peyton, who told POLITICO she was fired in July in Chicago, where 14 judges remain. “New York is decimated. Chelmsford (Massachusetts) is decimated. The San Francisco court is decimated. Chicago is down half. There’s literally millions — millions with an ‘m’ — millions of cases that are pending.”

At New York City’s 26 Federal Plaza, an epicenter of clashes between immigrants, federal agents and protesters, seven judges were pushed out in one day this week. The wave of dismissals leaves 25 immigration judges in a courthouse that in January had 37, according to a comparison of Department of Justice staff lists now and then.

The most senior among the New Yorkers is former Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Amiena Khan, who is on the American Accountability Foundation’s “bureaucrat watch list.” Peyton of Chicago is also on the conservative opposition research group’s list. Of the nine judges targeted by it, only one remains on the bench: Claudia Cubas of Maryland.

Many of the judges are challenging their dismissals.

Cassin of New York has begun the process. Former Judge Tania Nemer of Ohio, who said she was fired in February, filed a lawsuit this week alleging the Department of Justice discriminated against her on the basis of sex, national origin and political affiliation. Nemer is a dual citizen of the United States and Lebanon and had sought local office as a Democrat.

Bondi referenced Nemer’s lawsuit at a Cabinet meeting, quipping, “Last I checked, I was a woman as well.”

The seven judges terminated in New York on Dec. 1 are all women: Khan, Lisa Ehrens, Maria Lurye, Alice Segal, Evalyn Douchy, Theodora Kouris and Lori Adams, five judges and court observers told POLITICO.

The expulsions have intensified the need for independent immigration courts, judges and Democratic lawmakers said.

“These unlawful and politicized firings are definitely just another reason why there’s a strong need for an independent judiciary under Article I or Article III of the Constitution,” said Anam Petit, a former Virginia immigration judge who said she was fired in September. “Judges should not be afraid for their jobs. They shouldn’t be nervous that they need to rule a certain way.”

Reps. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) plan to reintroduce legislation to move immigration courts out of the executive branch. The bill would establish an independent immigration court system.

“By firing immigration judges whose rulings he does not like, President Trump is installing himself as the judge and jury of his own decisions,” said Goldman, who has frequently sought to inspect areas in 26 Federal Plaza where migrants are being held. Goldman is part of a slate of House members suing the Trump administration for barring them from providing congressional oversight.

Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has launched a campaign seeking those willing to serve as “deportation” judges to fill the vacuum and is offering additional enticements. According to a job posting, the DOJ will provide a “25% of base pay recruitment incentive for first-time federal employees” placed in New York; Chelmsford, Massachusetts; San Francisco and other cities where a significant number of experienced immigration judges have been let go.

Jeremiah Johnson, an immigration judge who said he was fired in San Francisco late last month, called the recruitment effort a “false advertisement” that makes light of, and offers a bonus for, a position he and others consider a serious responsibility.

“During Trump One, when I was appointed, there was a policy that got some pushback called ‘No Dark Courtrooms.’ We were to hear cases every day, use all the space,” Johnson said in an interview. “Now, there’s vacant courtrooms that are not being utilized. And any attempts by the administration saying they’re replacing judges — the math just doesn’t work if you look at the numbers.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd4%2F48%2F97ccc0f14d25b11723eb2167c27a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2226350381,N,,2025-12-06 12:57:31.336507

Signed early in his second term, the order states that children born in the U.S. to parents who are undocumented or in the country temporarily are not citizens.

Lower courts have said the order is unconstitutional, including the 9th United States Circuit Court of Appeals, which said in July that it “contradicts the plain language of the 14th Amendment’s granting of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

They continued to rule this way, even after the Supreme Court said in June that three federal district judges overreached their authority when they issued nationwide injunctions against the order.

The case being heard by the Supreme Court comes out of New Hampshire, and will be argued in the spring, according to The Associated Press, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

“Our Constitution and the more than a century of court decisions on this topic are overwhelmingly clear: no politician can decide who among those born in this country is worthy of citizenship,” SangYeob Kim, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, said in a statement Friday. “We will continue fighting this cruel executive order to ensure that every child born in the United States has their right to citizenship protected instead of being relegated to a permanent, multigenerational subclass of people born in the U.S. but who are denied full rights.”

While Trump and other Cabinet officials alleged shortly after the shooting that the Biden administration did “zero vetting” of him, administration officials later said the vetting was insufficient.
Noem had said shortly after his arrest that Lakanwal was “radicalized” in the United States.
They argue that the Biden administration conducted meager screening of visa applicants.
“I am all about allowing those that assisted our military passage into the United States.","An administration official said to “expect a full overhaul of all adjudications,” adding: “We are at a critical moment of vetting foreign nationals, not just those from typical countries of concern.”

The official, like others, was granted anonymity to speak freely about the evolving plans within the U.S. government to respond to the shooting of two members of the West Virginia National Guard that killed one soldier and left another in critical condition.

“We need to screen and screen and screen some more because really and truly this is a tragedy beyond belief,” said West Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice. “If I were President Trump, I would say, ‘If you think there’s a better way, then fix it.’”

Since the shooting, the Trump administration has moved to freeze visa and asylum applications from Afghan nationals, and said it will audit green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries. Trump has also said the U.S. must “reexamine” all Afghans who came to the U.S. under Biden, and vowed to “permanently pause” immigration from all “third world countries.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears eager to go further. She posted on X on Monday that she has recommended the president expand travel bans “on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

“There were some plans already afoot to find ways to revisit some of these cases. It was kind of tinkering around the edges,” said one person close to the administration. “But now, it’s going to be much more systematic, and I suspect they’re going to have to devote more resources to it.”

“I would call it an inflection point,” the person added.

Some of the proposals add procedural barriers. Immigration hawks on Capitol Hill are arguing for U.S. officials to restore standards a government commission convened after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to root out potential security threats.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has pushed for legislation restoring those strict screening requirements, argued that chief among those steps would be the resumption in-person interviews for asylum applicants and more rigorous reviews to determine if an applicant has any ties to terrorist organizations.

“Does that take time? Of course it does, which is the point. I mean, the point is to zero in and make a judgment about each person you’re letting in because who knows how long they’ll be here,” Hawley said in an interview.

The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was an Afghan national who entered the country in 2021 on humanitarian parole. His application for asylum was approved in 2025 under the Trump administration. While Trump and other Cabinet officials alleged shortly after the shooting that the Biden administration did “zero vetting” of him, administration officials later said the vetting was insufficient.

It’s unclear what inspired Lakanwal, who worked with a CIA-backed paramilitary force in Afghanistan, to carry out the shooting but reports have documented mental health concerns. Noem had said shortly after his arrest that Lakanwal was “radicalized” in the United States.

Some of the plans under consideration would be unprecedented in scope. Two senior intelligence officials said that people who work in the National Counterterrorism Center are actively pushing the White House on a hardline plan to deport some 2 million people from mostly Muslim countries who entered the U.S. under Biden — and force them to reapply from abroad if they want to return.

The first intelligence official declined to explain how the NCTC arrived at the figure of 2 million.

Joe Kent, the head of the NCTC, has already floated the idea in public, advocating for retroactively vetting recent arrivals to the U.S. and deporting those “illegally admitted” under Biden on his social media account.

Olivia Coleman, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said NCTC “fully supports the mission to undo the damage caused by the previous administration’s lax vetting standards and get these monsters out of our country.”

Coleman also pledged that NCTC will “continue our efforts to identify individuals with terrorist ties, rigorously vet them, and equip DHS with the intelligence needed to remove these criminals from our country.”

The calls for more action are being amplified by long-time advocates for restricting legal pathways for migrants to enter the United States. They argue that the Biden administration conducted meager screening of visa applicants.

“Many of them were, at best, very, very superficially vetted. Many probably weren’t vetted at all, and we’ve been paying the price for it. Not just with this attack on the National Guard, but in terms of criminal gangs moving in,” said Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform think tank in Washington, which favors restrictions on legal pathways to emigrate to the United States.

Under multiple administrations, including under Biden, migrants and asylum seekers have been generally screened for ties to terrorist groups and potential threats they may pose to U.S. national security based on information available in federal databases. Afghan nationals who worked with the U.S. in Afghanistan — and therefore qualified to apply for a special visa — were typically initially vetted by military personnel at bases overseas. And not all Afghan refugees were offered humanitarian parole. Many still wait at U.S. military bases and refugee camps around the world for a small number of Special Immigrant Visas that would allow them to enter the United States.

Still, the Biden administration’s process was criticized in a 2022 Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report, which found that federal officials “did not always have critical data” to properly vet Afghan refugees.

In a letter Friday, all eight Republicans on the Senate Intelligence panel urged acting national security adviser Marco Rubio to fully implement the recommendations of the OIG report and to remove Afghan “evacuees” deemed a security risk.

Not all of the White House’s allies are pushing for immediate and dramatic action. Some Republicans are voicing caution, wanting to learn more about the shooter before pushing for major changes.

“Secretary Noem says that he was radicalized after he came to the United States, and that may be, but we just don’t have the facts yet,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who in the past has supported visa programs for Afghans who helped the U.S. in its two-decade war. “We don’t have the facts about the extent to which, if any, President Biden’s administration vetted the folks. We were told they would all be vetted, but we don’t know if that was the case or not.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is “working to implement the most rigorous screening and vetting protocols in agency history” as a way to correct damage from the Biden administration’s “reckless approach” to refugee settlement. McLaughlin added that the Trump administration is “reviewing all immigration benefits granted by the Biden administration to aliens from countries of concern.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump is “fulfilling his promise every day and any policy changes needed to more effectively achieve” his goal to “put America first and carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history.”

Much of what the administration has carried out in recent days has built on its gradual steps to increase scrutiny of applications and reduce pathways to legally enter the United States, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an immigration lawyer who works as an analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

“It’s an escalation, but it’s building on these already extraordinary measures that they had been taking or trying to take,” Bush-Joseph said.

Among the changes, Bush-Joseph said, could be the reintroduction of rules around asylum introduced during the first Trump presidency. Many of those rules were blocked in the courts during Trump’s first term, but the administration has already shown a willingness to revamp other immigration policies that were hampered by litigation back then, such as changes to the diversity visa lottery.

Ken Cuccinelli, who served as acting deputy DHS secretary during the first Trump administration and wrote the chapter of a 2024 Heritage Foundation report that previewed many of the immigration policy changes Trump has since made, said that the administration should pursue a three-pronged policy of blocking new applicants from countries where vetting is impossible, re-vetting all applicants in the U.S. from those nations and deporting anyone who cannot be properly screened.

How far the efforts will go to re-screen foreign nationals is unclear. The first senior intelligence official said that senior White House officials have been briefed on the plan to deport the 2 million migrants from counterterrorism officials.

The second senior intelligence official cautioned that “a lot of things are floating around right now” in response to the shooting, but confirmed this idea was one of them.

In the interim, the political pressure is bubbling to the surface, as even lawmakers who have historically backed programs that grant Afghans and others who supported the U.S. military entry to the United States are acknowledging a need for more vetting.

“I am all about allowing those that assisted our military passage into the United States. I am very firm on that,” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). “But they must be properly vetted and we know that this was not done.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F9f%2F08%2F24cf4bf949da88c89544b344c2e8%2Fwhite-house-29555.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 12:57:34.807407

The justices will hear Trump’s appeal of a lower-court ruling that struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the country. The case will be argued in the spring. A definitive ruling is expected by early summer. The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed Jan. 20, the first day of his second term, is part of his Republican administration’s broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act. The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings. But the Supreme Court allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location. The justices also are weighing the administration’s emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment. Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. His order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force. In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions. The Supreme Court, however, did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order was constitutional. Every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship. Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under longstanding rules. The case under review comes from New Hampshire. A federal judge in July blocked the citizenship order in a class action lawsuit including all children who would be affected. The American Civil Liberties Union is leading the legal team representing the children and their parents who challenged Trump’s order. “No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” Cecillia Wang, the ACLU’s national legal director, said in a statement, adding, “We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.” The administration had also asked the justices to review a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. That court, also in July, ruled that a group of Democratic-led states that sued over Trump’s order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others. The justices took no action in the 9th Circuit case. The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship. “The Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause was adopted to grant citizenship to newly freed slaves and their children — not … to the children of aliens illegally or temporarily in the United States,” top administration top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, wrote in urging the high court’s review. Twenty-four Republican-led states and 27 Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are backing the administration.

—

When attorney Andy Armstrong went to the Salt Lake City office of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Dec. 2, he expected a typical appointment.

His client was there with his wife, a U.S. citizen, for an interview to check his background and verify the authenticity of their marriage. That’s the last step for someone to get their green card, or legal permanent residency.

The client was nicely dressed and feeling good, said Armstrong, who works with the Murray-based firm Stowell Crayk.

“There was nothing about his background that gave me any pause at all to think we would have any problem,” Armstrong said.

But instead of being told his green card was on the way, the youth soccer coach was called into a room.

“There were two officers from ICE who said they were taking him into custody to initiate removal action, or deportation action, against him,” Armstrong said. “And they handcuffed him, and they took him away without being able to say goodbye to his wife.”

The client is now in ICE custody. Armstrong expects him to be transferred to a detention center outside Las Vegas.

In a statement, ICE told KUER the man was required to leave the United States in 2008.

“He was arrested for overstaying his visa and will remain in ICE custody pending the remaining removal proceedings,” a spokesperson wrote.

But that’s a relatively common situation for people at their Citizenship and Immigration Services interviews who are also in the process of obtaining legal status, Armstrong said. Plus, overstaying a tourist visa is not a disqualifying factor for a green card through marriage.

Ultimately, Armstrong expects his client will be released on bond in about two weeks and eventually end up back in the interview room after his time in detention.

“He's not a danger to society, and he's not a flight risk, and he's got an American citizen wife and an American citizen child,” he said.

A search of Utah court records found two debt collection cases under the client’s name, along with a petition for a child’s name change. A search of federal court records yielded no results.

It’s common for ICE to arrest immigrants who lack legal status but have no criminal record. What surprised Armstrong was that his client, who was clearly on the path to permanent residency, was arrested.

The client is scheduled to appear in immigration court in early January. He’ll make his case to the judge, and Armstrong expects him to be referred back to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to continue his case there.

“He ends up exactly back where he started — I mean, status-wise, but he, his wife, his family, his child, having suffered needlessly,” he said.

He sees the detention as a waste of ICE’s time and money.

This is the first arrest at the Salt Lake City office that Armstrong is aware of, but similar arrests have occurred recently in San Diego.

“This speaks to, and this is my own personal opinion, that part of the Trump administration's push to do immigration enforcement is to sow the seeds of fear in the immigrant community so that they either self-deport or that they don't try to become legalized,” he said.

That’s even affecting clients with straightforward immigration cases.

“You've got a lot of people here who are very afraid, including people who should not be afraid because they've done everything the right way,” he said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/16461e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4900x2573+0+309/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fd2%2Fc6137b90482296167a131b72765e%2F20251205-ml-img-1523.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 16:32:11.568857

The agency issued a news release saying that the arrestees had criminal records and blaming Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for local sanctuary policies. But some local immigration attorneys say law-abiding immigrants are being swept up in the arrests.

Immigrant advocacy groups told Sahan Journal that while they don’t have exact numbers, they believe, based on family and eyewitness accounts, that there have been more people arrested in Minnesota this week than the 12 reported by DHS.

“Every time ICE [the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] begins an operation and focuses their attention on a certain city, they plan to make as many arrests as possible,” said Erika Zurawski, a member of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee.

Immigration agents have been seen making arrests on the streets primarily in south Minneapolis and Richfield, Zurawski said. Agents typically arrive in two to three vehicles and are usually seen wearing face masks and vests that read “POLICE.”

Local law enforcement don’t wear face masks and their vehicles are marked with clear signage with their city or county’s name, she said.

‘They’ve done nothing wrong’

Local immigration attorneys tell Sahan Journal they’ve received a handful of new clients this week as a direct result of the ICE operation targeting Somali residents.

The clients fall into two categories:

They immigrated to the United States within the last few years and are not U.S. citizens, but filed official paperwork with the government to receive asylum, and are awaiting a final decision.

They’ve been in the country for a long time and are not U.S. citizens, but are here legally under other immigration status, such as green cards. However, they have a prior deportation order from several years ago for a number of reasons, including a criminal conviction.

David Wilson, a Minneapolis-based attorney, said he took on two new clients this week who already have to check in with ICE on periodic bases as part of their ongoing asylum cases. Both were detained during their check-ins this week, Wilson said.

“They were compliant,” Wilson said. “They were doing the check-ins. They don’t have any criminal history. They’ve both been going to court. They’ve both been submitting their documents. They were in the queue waiting for a trial date.”

On Thursday, the federal Department of Homeland Security wrote in a statement that the 12 people arrested in the Twin Cities this week represented “the worst of the worst,” including “child sex offenders, domestic abusers, and violent gang members.” Wilson, however, opined that the brunt of people experiencing fallout from the Twin Cities operation are pawns in a political dispute between Trump and Minnesota Democrats.

“These are real people living real lives,” Wilson said of many other ICE detainees. “They’ve done nothing wrong but being from the wrong country at a time when the president gets mad.”

Abdi Jabane, another Minneapolis immigration attorney, said he’s obtained one new client who was swept up in ICE activity this week. The client, who is a Somali man from Ethiopia, came to the United States within the last two years and has a pending asylum application. Jabane said he was still researching information about how and why this client was arrested, but added that the client was also attending regular check-ins with ICE.

Wilson and Jabane said they have other Somali clients who were questioned by ICE this week but weren’t arrested.

One of Jabane’s clients was afraid to attend his regular check-in with ICE this week.

“He was terrified,” Jabane said. “He went and was not detained.”

Jabane implored all asylum seekers to continue attending their check-ins with ICE.

“I know ICE now is everywhere,” he said. “Stay calm, go to work and go to school. If you are detained, you will still have the right to a hearing and to a lawyer to represent your case.”

He also told people to carry any of their necessary immigration papers on them at all times in case they are questioned by ICE without notice.

“Gather your documents and be ready,” he said. “Do not listen to fear, do not listen to rumors. Stay calm and stay strong.”

One of Wilson’s clients is a female Somali truck driver from the Twin Cities who was questioned by ICE over the weekend. She was arrested, detained and then released several weeks ago as she drove through a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint in Arizona.

Years ago, she was jailed and an immigration judge ordered her deportation. But her attorneys then successfully argued to prevent deportation to her home country because “she would be killed almost instantly if she returned to Somalia,” Wilson said.

Last month after she was arrested by ICE in Arizona, Wilson and his colleague successfully filed a habeas corpus motion, which argues that a person can’t be detained for long periods of time while the likelihood of deporting them remains uncertain. This led to her release from immigration detention.

Then, over the weekend, ICE agents visited the woman’s Twin Cities home and attempted to deport her, Wilson said. She called Wilson’s law office, and an attorney talked the ICE agents out of arresting her, Wilson said.

“It’s only because we had filed and already won [her habeas case] that they were willing to listen to the phone call from the attorney saying, ‘You really don’t want to do this again; we just did this 45 days ago,’” Wilson said. “No one had really actually screened whether she should have been taken into custody, because if they looked they would have seen that they had just lost this issue in federal court.”

Wilson said it’s likely that the ICE agents reportedly seen idling around Somali malls, homes and businesses this week are targeting immigrants with deportation and withholding orders from several years ago.

“If people have final orders [of removal], they might not have any check-ins anytime soon,” Wilson said. “So [ICE] goes out looking for them.”

Local immigration attorneys said such immigrants can be hard to deport because the federal government has already unsuccessfully tried to deport them, and the immigrants’ attorneys likely already successfully argued that their clients would immediately face danger if they were sent to their home countries.

“That doesn’t mean the government can’t send you somewhere else,” Wilson said, noting that east African countries like Uganda and Rwanda have agreed with the Trump administration to take detainees from other African countries.

Community, faith leaders show support

Community members and leaders, politicians and faith leaders have been mobilizing throughout the week to support the Somali community and call out the immigration enforcement.

More than a hundred people rallied Thursday outside the Target store on E. Lake Street in Minneapolis to demand that Target prohibit U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials from using their parking lots to mobilize.

Photos and videos recorded by immigrant advocacy watch patrols showed ICE agents using the Minneapolis Target parking lot and one in Richfield to congregate, said Luis Argueta, communications director at Unidos MN, a statewide immigrant advocacy group.

“We know history will teach Target and other companies that darkness does not prevail,” said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR-MN.

Target issued a written statement to Sahan Journal denying any cooperation with ICE.

“These claims are entirely baseless,” said the statement. “We have no cooperative agreements in place with ICE.”

Suleiman Adan, CAIR-MN’s deputy director, said his group recently organized a state-wide task force that handles reports of ICE enforcement against Somali residents. The number of task force members has reached more than 500, he said.

Task force members operate in cities with large Somali populations, including St. Cloud and Moorhead, and in neighborhoods like Cedar-Riverside in Minneapolis.

About 50 people, mostly Minneapolis residents, attended a training session Thursday evening at Brian Coyle Neighborhood Center to prepare for ICE activity in Cedar-Riverside.

“They’re just targeting a new group of people and we have to stand up against it as a community, because they have no right to say who doesn’t belong on stolen land,” said Nick Estes, one of the attendees.

Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the country, with 80,000 residents, according to Minnesota Compass. About 4,200 people in the community are not U.S. citizens, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, but many are green-card holders. Some are undocumented or have temporary protected status (TPS); President Donald Trump announced in late November that he plans to cancel TPS for Somali residents in the country.

A city-wide prayer was also hosted Thursday morning at the Brian Coyle Neighborhood Center in Cedar-Riverside to show support for the Somali community. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at the prayer that his department has seen a heightened sense of fear in the Somali community in the past few days, but reaffirmed his commitment to support them.

At a news conference hosted in the Umatul Islam Center mosque Thursday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Trump’s derogatory remarks on the Somali community are harmful. Faith leaders across different religions and Somali community leaders who were also in attendance denounced the federal ICE operation.

“The focus needs to be on who we are as a people and what we value as Americans,” Frey said.

He issued an executive order Wednesday to create signage for businesses and property owners that show support for immigrants, and that mark their properties as off-limits for federal immigration actions. He also prohibited federal, state and local agencies from using city-owned parking lots, garages, ramps and vacant lots for federal immigration actions.

“Every one of us needs to be standing up against this hateful rhetoric because, indeed, when you come for one of us, you come for all of us,” Frey said.",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICECommunityResponse2_12-4-3193.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:57:39.371844

In a statement posted on the social media website X, the agency said U.S. Border Patrol had been ""conducting a targeted immigration enforcement operation against a criminal illegal alien previously charged with felony theft and convicted of illegal possession of stolen property.""

The woman who Border Patrol agents were seen chasing, a 23-year-old mother who lives in Marrero, matched the description of the wanted subject, the agency said. They added that the agents had identified themselves.

""Agents immediately stopped upon reaching the property, determined the individual in question was not the target, and all agents departed the area,"" DHS said. ""No arrests were made.""

The agency’s social media post was in response to WWL-TV, after the local television station shared the footage, which drew more than half a million views in less than a day on the social media site.

But the mother of the Marrero woman who was chased by Border Patrol agents told The Times-Picayune on Friday that the statement from DHS did not make up for what happened.

“We've seen this and they're just trying to cover their asses because they did not identify themselves or ask her,” said Ramona Anglin, the woman’s mother.

In an interview Thursday with The Times-Picayune, the woman who was chased by Border Patrol asked only to be identified by her first name of Jacelynn, out of fear of retaliation. She said the masked agents ran after her after she walked out of a corner store and was heading back home.

The agents then stood outside the family’s home for five to 10 minutes, according to her father, Juan Carlos Anglin, who was watching his granddaughter inside at the time. He said he heard his daughter scream and thought she was being kidnapped. Juan Carlos Anglin confronted the agents, who told him they were looking for a woman and held up a photograph of her.

Juan Carlos Anglin said the woman in the photo appeared to be a decade older than his daughter.

U.S. Border Patrol launched “Catahoula Crunch” on Wednesday in New Orleans, bringing President Donald Trump’s federal immigration crackdown to the state. DHS has repeatedly declined to share specific numbers of how many people have been detained in their immigration sweeps so far in the area, but has said dozens have been arrested.

In recent Border Patrol sweeps in Chicago and North Carolina, a vast majority of detainees had no criminal backgrounds. And in New Orleans, allegations that federal agents have detained people with work permits and American citizenship have quickly mounted.

A similar encounter unfolded on Wednesday, when a Border Patrol agent detained a man at a Lowe’s store in New Orleans who insisted he was an American citizen, according to footage of the encounter obtained by the immigrants rights group Union Migrante. The group said he was one of three citizens questioned and then released after agents confirmed their citizenship.

Fox News Digital reached out to Jayapal, Smith and the Department of Homeland Security for additional comment on the pushback.","After more than 120 House Democrats signed onto a bill from a top progressive lawmaker to seek what they define as ""dignity"" for federal immigration detainees, critics sounded the alarm that the legislation could forever transform how illegal immigrants are treated in the U.S.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., is spearheading the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, along with fellow Evergreen State lawmaker Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. They say it would curb the ""shocking surge"" of allegedly wrongful detentions and inappropriate conditions, particularly at jails run by private companies under government contract.

Critics vociferously objected to that suggestion in exclusive comments to Fox News Digital Friday.

""This legislation isn’t aimed at improving conditions for migrants navigating the U.S. immigration system. It would instead end the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration law entirely,"" members of the Day 1 Alliance, the main trade association representing longtime federal and state contractors in the criminal justice and immigration spaces, warned.

Day 1 Alliance members said that, for more than three decades, both Republican and Democratic congresses and administrations have respected the ""limited yet valued"" role their members play in working toward a better immigration enforcement system.

The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act would lead to the repeal of mandatory detention for those captured by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to a summary posted by Jayapal, and create a presumption of release, imposing a higher burden of proof to detain primary caregivers and ""vulnerable populations.""

It also would phase out the use of private detention centers, like those Day 1 Alliance members may work in or with, by about 2029.

In apparent response to Democrats being iced out of ICE centers earlier in 2025, including a case in Newark, New Jersey, where Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., was accused of accosting officers, it also would mandate that the Department of Homeland Security admit members of Congress to detention facilities for unannounced inspections.

Another case in Baltimore involved that city’s congressman, Democratic Rep. Kweisi Mfume, joining others downtown to protest to the press about not being allowed full access to the Charm City’s Department of Homeland Security installation.

""Contractors operate under strict federal oversight and standards set by the U.S. Congress,"" Day 1 Alliance members told Fox News Digital of the implications about the proposed changes.

""They do not make arrests, do not decide the length of detention and play no role in determining the legal status of individuals in their care.""

The members said contractors work to provide humane housing, proper meals and quality medical care for all in their ward.

Jayapal said Thursday the Trump administration has caused a ""shocking surge in the detention of people who have committed no crimes.""

""As Trump has struck down legal pathways and made it nearly impossible to come to or stay in this country, even for those who have been here for decades, this will only continue to get worse,"" Jayapal said. ""We must pass this legislation to protect dignity and civil rights in America.""

Smith added that the U.S. is witnessing ""appalling conditions"" and a ""clear disregard for basic human rights"" of detainees.

""No one should be subjected to overcrowded cells, denied medical care or held in facilities that profit off of human suffering,"" he said, echoing his Seattle neighbor in saying the bill would provide proper oversight.

DHS SAYS FOUR HOUSE DEMOCRATS 'CHOSE TO STAND WITH CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS' AFTER VISITING ICE DETAINEE

Homeland Security officials torched the new bill later Friday.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital Jayapal's claims of overcrowding, mistreatment and wrongful detention are ""false.""

""ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens,"" she said.

""It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,"" she continued. ""This includes medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare many aliens have received in their entire lives. Meals are certified by"" dietitians.

McLaughlin added that ICE deaths in custody are at a rate of less than 1%, lower than any previous administration's record.

She praised House Speaker Mike Johnson's ""big, beautiful bill"" as the facilitator of ICE improving detention conditions since President Donald Trump took office.

""Ensuring the safety, security and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE,"" she said

A release from Jayapal’s office cited a figure of 66,000 people detained since Trump took office and claimed nearly three-quarters did not have any criminal convictions, an assertion immigration officials have rejected.

There were 123 listed Democratic co-sponsors, including several lawmakers representing areas ICE and USBP have pinpointed for mass enforcement activities.

“This is home for them, and that’s the sad part,” said Jessica Vigueras, who took cellphone video of the altercation that happened Thursday afternoon inside a bodega in Port Richmond.

She says she heard some commotion outside and ran up the block. That’s where she saw eight or nine ICE agents questioning immigrants.

“They didn’t come with warrants. They didn’t come with papers. They just came and said, ‘What’s your name? What’s your legal status?’ I find it completely not right. I understand if they want to get criminals out, but that’s not the way,” said Vigueras, who is the daughter of Mexican immigrants who own a bakery next to the bodega where the ICE arrests took place.

Vigueras, who was one of several bystanders who attempted to stop the arrest, says the entire community is scared to leave their homes now.

“Why should they have to run? Why? They’re not criminals. They’re just getting food to go home and cook for their families,” she said.

An agent can be seen taking out his taser, but Vigueras says that didn’t stop the crowd from going after the agents.

“We chased them until they got in their cars and we made them leave,” she said.

Vigueras’ mother, who has lived in the city for 33 years, says this recent uptick in ICE raids keeps her up at night.

“It makes me [cry] all the time, they make me scared, sometimes I can’t even sleep all night. I wake up at 2 o’clock in the morning,” Laura Gutiérrez said. “I can’t explain to you. I can’t. It’s very sad. Very, very sad.”

Vigueras says she is deeply concerned for her family and community, and she believes immigrants should not be targeted.

“At the end of the day, whether people like it or not, immigrants make this country. Immigrants are the ones who are making people’s food. Immigrants are the ones who are [at] the back. And it’s sad that we have to go through this because at the end of the day, we’re hardworking people. It’s not like we’re stealing anything or taking anything from anybody,” she said.

The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship.","The Supreme Court on Dec. 5, 2025, agreed to review the long-simmering controversy over birthright citizenship. It will likely hand down a ruling next summer.

In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order removing the recognition of citizenship for the U.S.-born children of both immigrants here illegally and visitors here only temporarily. The new rule is not retroactive. This change in long-standing U.S. policy sparked a wave of litigation culminating in Trump v. Washington, an appeal by Trump to remove the injunction put in place by federal courts.

When the justices weigh the arguments, they will focus on the meaning of the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, known as the citizenship clause: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

Both sides agree that to be granted birthright citizenship under the Constitution, a child must be born inside U.S. borders and the parents must be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. However, each side will give a very different interpretation of what the second requirement means. Who falls under “the jurisdiction” of the United States in this context?

As a close observer of the court, I anticipate a divided outcome grounded in strong arguments from each side.

Arguments for automatic citizenship

Simply put, the argument against the Trump administration is that the 14th Amendment’s expansion of citizenship after the eradication of slavery was meant to be broad rather than narrow, encompassing not only formerly enslaved Black people but all persons who arrived on U.S. soil under the protection of the Constitution.

The Civil War amendments – the 13th, 14th and 15th – established inherent equality as a constitutional value, which embraced all persons born in the nation without reference to race, ethnicity or origin.

One of the strongest arguments that automatic citizenship is the meaning of the Constitution is long-standing practice. Citizenship by birth regardless of parental status – with few exceptions – has been the effective rule since the time of America’s founding.

Advocates also point to precedent: the landmark case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898. When an American-born descendant of resident noncitizens sued after being refused re-entry to San Francisco under the Chinese Exclusion Act, the court recognized his natural-born citizenship.

If we read the Constitution in a living fashion – emphasizing the evolution of American beliefs and values over time – the constitutional commitment to broad citizenship grounded in equality, regardless of ethnicity or economic status, seems even more clear.

However, advocates must try to convince the court’s originalists – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – who read the Constitution based on its meaning when it was adopted.

The originalist argument in favor of birthright citizenship is that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to invoke only a small set of exceptions found in traditional British common law. In the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the court relied on this “customary law of England, brought to America by the colonists.”

One exception to birthright citizenship covered by this line of rulings is the child of a foreign diplomat, whose parents represent the interests of another country. Another exception is the children of invading foreign armies. A third exception discussed explicitly by the framers of the 14th Amendment was Native Americans, who at the time were understood to be under the jurisdiction of their tribal government as a separate sovereign. That category of exclusion faded away after Congress recognized the citizenship of Native Americans in 1924.

The advocates of automatic birthright citizenship conclude that whether the 14th Amendment is interpreted in a living or in an original way, its small set of exceptions do not override its broad message of citizenship grounded in human equality.

Opposition to birthright citizenship

The opposing argument begins with a simple intuition: In a society defined by self-government, as America is, there is no such thing as citizenship without consent. In the same way that an American citizen cannot declare himself a French citizen and vote in French elections without consent from the French government, a foreign national cannot declare himself a U.S. citizen without consent.

This argument emphasizes that citizenship in a democracy means holding equal political power over our collective decisions. That is something only existing citizens hold the right to offer to others, something which must be decided through elections and the lawmaking process.

The court’s ruling in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884 – just 16 years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment – endorses “the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation without its consent.” By making entry into the United States without approval a federal offense, Congress has effectively denied that consent.

Scholars who support this view argue that the 14th Amendment does not provide this consent. Instead it sets a limitation. To the authors of the 14th Amendment, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” conveyed a limit to natural citizenship grounded in mutual allegiance. That means if people are free to deny their old national allegiance, and an independent nation is free to decide its own membership, the recognition of a new national identity must be mutual.

Immigrants living in the United States illegally have not accepted the sovereignty of the nation’s laws. On the other side of the coin, the government has not officially accepted them as residents under its protection.

If mutual recognition of allegiance is the meaning of the 14th Amendment, the Trump administration has not violated it.

The opponents of birthright citizenship argue that the Wong Kim Ark ruling has been misrepresented. In that case, the court only considered permanent legal residents like Wong Kim Ark’s parents, but not residents here illegally or temporarily. The focus on British common law in that ruling is simply misguided because the findings of Calvin’s Case or any other precedents dealing with British subjects were voided by the American Revolution.

In this view, the Declaration of Independence replaced subjects with citizens. The power to determine national membership was taken away from kings and placed in the hands of democratic majorities.

For opponents of birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment does not take that power away from citizens but instead codifies the rule that mutual consent is the touchstone of admission. The requirement to be “subject to the jurisdiction” provides the mechanism of that consent.

Congress can determine who is accepted as a member of the national community under its jurisdiction. In this view, Congress – and the American people – have spoken: Current federal laws make entry into U.S. borders without permission a crime rather than a forced acceptance of political membership.

What might happen

The court will likely announce a ruling in summer 2026 before early July, just in time for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The court will ultimately decide whether the Constitution endorses the declaration’s invocation of essential equality or its creation of a sovereign people empowered to determine the boundaries of national membership.

The court’s three Democratic-appointed justices – Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – will surely side against the Trump administration. The six Republican-appointed justices seem likely to divide, a symptom of disagreements within the originalist camp.

The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship. This will likely be some combination of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

The Trump administration will prevail only if five out of the six conservatives reject the British common law foundations of the Wong Kim Ark ruling in favor of citizenship by consent alone.

Federal agents have yet to have a city-designated operation in San Francisco.","Mayors and local officials aren't just criticizing ICE raids in their cities: They're making life harder for federal law enforcement, while being careful not to go over the line.

Why it matters: The law forbids local leaders from impeding or interfering with federal officers. But cities are finding ways to push back on unwanted immigration enforcement by the Trump administration.

The big picture: Homeland Security officials started broadcasting a plan to target sanctuary jurisdictions from the start of President Trump's second term.

This has put local leaders — because of the law, past litigation and public sentiment — directly at odds with Trump's mass deportation campaign.

Driving the news: Homeland Security officials are getting a cold shoulder from local leaders as they decamp to New Orleans for ""Operation Catahoula Crunch.""

""To be in the country undocumented is civil issue. We will not enforce civil law,"" said New Orleans Police Department superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick at a recent press conference.

The local sheriff's office won't allow ICE into its jails to make arrests or use the space for detention, because of a consent decree from a case that started in 2011 and is still being litigated.

The city council, led by Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, launched a new portal for residents to document instances of potential abuse by federal agents. In an interview with NOLA.com, Moreno accused Border Patrol of ""targeting Brown people.""

Zoom in: In Minneapolis, bracing for an ICE operation targeting Somali immigrants over visa fraud, Mayor Jacob Frey signed an executive order this week that bans law enforcement agencies ""from using any City-owned parking lots, ramps, garages, or vacant lots to stage civil immigration enforcement operations.""

Frey's staff is also sharing a notice template that small businesses or homes can display to deter civil enforcement in private spaces.

The big picture: This is happening city by city.

In Chicago, where Border Patrol and other federal agents swarmed the city for months this fall, Mayor Brandon Johnson issued a similar ban on using city-owned space for any immigration enforcement operations, called ""ICE Free Zones.""

Earlier this year, Mayor Ras Baraka of Newark, New Jersey, worked to block the re-opening of an immigration detention facility, alleging that the building wasn't up to code. He and other demonstrators made a human barricade in front of the building in May.

Los Angeles County officials approved an emergency declaration that will cover living expenses for people who miss work because they fear immigration raids. It started accepting requests for aid in December.

Between the lines: Cities and states covered by sanctuary laws have learned to prepare for when — not if — ICE targets them. While community organizers are preparing to protest, city officials are also making plans.

Federal agents have yet to have a city-designated operation in San Francisco. But the local district attorney hatched a plan to charge ICE agents for violating state laws as they carried out arrests, such as violating the statewide ban on agents wearing masks and possible excessive force.

The other side: The Trump administration has swelled the number of deals between ICE and local law enforcement to more than 1,000 agreements across the country.

That's helped fuel immigration arrests and feed the pipeline for deportations. The Trump team is aiming for a million deportations a year.

The bottom line: New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said he told Trump in their recent meeting that the raids are ""cruel and inhumane.""

But Trump and administration officials aren't relenting.

The Department of Homeland Security posted on social media, days after starting the new operations in Minneapolis and New Orleans: ""To the violent rioters and sanctuary politicians: You will not stop us.

Amnesty released a report Friday covering what it calls a “a research trip to southern Florida in September 2025, to document the human rights impacts of federal and state migration and asylum policies on mass detention and deportation, access to due process, and detention conditions since President Trump took office on 20 January 2025.”

“The routine and prolonged use of shackles on individuals detained for immigration purposes, both at detention facilities and during transfer between facilities, constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and may amount to torture or other ill-treatment,” the report concludes.

While the state did not comment on the report, Amnesty alleges the state’s “decision to cut resources from essential social and emergency management programs while continuing to allocate resources for immigration detention represents a grave misallocation of state resources. This practice undermines the fulfillment of economic and social rights for Florida residents and reinforces a system of detention that facilitates human rights violations.”

Amnesty urges a series of policy changes that won’t happen, including the repeal of immigration legislation in Senate Bill 4-C, which proscribes penalties for illegal entry and illegal re-entry, mandates imprisonment for being in Florida without being a legal immigrant, and capital punishment for any such undocumented immigrant who commits capital crimes.

The group also recommends ending 287(g) agreements allowing locals to help with immigration enforcement, stopping practices like shackling and solitary confinement, and closing Alligator Alcatraz itself.",https://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/alligator-alcatraz-copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 08:56:24.967922

Citizenship is granted only to the children of those whose “primary allegiance” is to the United States, including citizens and permanent residents, it has argued.
That measure codified the Citizenship Clause’s language and also adopted what was by then the well-settled understanding that the 14th Amendment promised automatic birthright citizenship.
The birthright citizenship fight had landed at the Supreme Court already once this year.
The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality.","The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide the legality of President Donald Trump’s directive to restrict birthright citizenship in the United States, a contentious part of his efforts to curb immigration and a step that would alter how a 19th century constitutional provision has long been understood.

The justices took up a Justice Department appeal of a lower court’s ruling that blocked Trump’s executive order telling U.S. agencies not to recognize citizenship of children born in the U.S. if neither parent is an American citizen or legal permanent resident, also called a “green card” holder.

The lower court ruled that Trump’s policy violated the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment and a federal law codifying birthright citizenship rights in a class-action lawsuit by parents and children whose citizenship is threatened by the directive.

The Republican president signed the order his first day back in office on January 20 as part of a suite of initiatives he has pursued during his second term as president to crack down on legal and illegal immigration.

The 14th Amendment has long been interpreted as guaranteeing citizenship for babies born in the United States.

The amendment’s Citizenship Clause states that all “persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War of 1861-1865 that ended slavery in the United States.

The Trump administration has argued that the provision does not grant citizenship to the babies of immigrants who are in the country illegally or whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas.

It has asserted that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” means that being born in the United States is not enough for citizenship. Citizenship is granted only to the children of those whose “primary allegiance” is to the United States, including citizens and permanent residents, it has argued. Such allegiance is established only through “lawful domicile,” which government attorneys define as “lawful, permanent residence within a nation, with intent to remain.”

‘Birth Tourism’

The administration has said that granting citizenship to virtually anyone born on U.S. soil has created incentives for illegal immigration and led to “birth tourism,” by which foreigners travel to the United States to give birth and secure citizenship for their children.

The legal challenges appealed by the Justice Department concerned one lawsuit filed by the states of Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, and another filed in federal court in New Hampshire by plaintiffs who sued on behalf of a nationwide class of people affected by Trump’s order.

In July, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the states. Also in July, Concord, New Hampshire-based U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante let the plaintiffs in that case proceed as a class, allowing Trump’s order to be blocked nationally.

The challengers said the Supreme Court already settled the question of birthright citizenship in an 1898 case called United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which long has been interpreted as guaranteeing that children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents are entitled to American citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The challengers also point out that Trump’s order violates a law Congress passed in 1940 that was subsequently included in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. That measure codified the Citizenship Clause’s language and also adopted what was by then the well-settled understanding that the 14th Amendment promised automatic birthright citizenship.

The birthright citizenship fight had landed at the Supreme Court already once this year. After lower courts halted Trump’s order, the administration took the matter to the Supreme Court to challenge the power of federal judges to issue so-called “universal” injunctions preventing presidential policies from applying against anyone, anywhere.

The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling powered by its conservative majority, issued a ruling in June blunting the power of federal judges but did not resolve the legality of Trump’s directive. The ruling left open the possibility for courts to grant broad relief to states or to individual plaintiffs through class action lawsuits.

The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality. Among these policies were Trump’s revocation of temporary legal protections on humanitarian grounds for hundreds of thousands of migrants, deportations of migrants to countries other than their own and domestic immigration enforcement raids.

Maine’s Somali community: real people, real contributions The state I call home, Maine, is itself home to a growing Somali community, centered in cities like Portland and Lewiston, Maine.
In these cities, Somali immigrants and their families have worked tirelessly to build lives, businesses, and communities.
Because Maine’s Somali community — and communities like them across the country — deserve to be honored for their resilience, their contributions, and their humanity.","Over the last few days, President Trump launched a vicious, brazen, and hate-filled attack on Somali immigrants — and by extension, on a fundamental ideal of America itself. In a White House Cabinet meeting, he repeatedly referred to Somalis as “garbage” and demanded they be expelled.

“Ilhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage,” he said. “These are people who do nothing but complain…When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country. Let ’em go back to where they came from and fix it.”

Then: “Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country.”

He doubled down later: “We could go one way or the other — and we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.”

These aren’t misremembered paraphrases. These are disregarded human beings, stripped of dignity, reduced to “garbage” in front of the world.

Why this attack is not about policy — but about hate

Trump’s tirade is not a reasoned critique of immigration policy. It is a naked display of bigotry, racism, and dehumanization. By singling out an entire ethnic and religious group — immigrants from Somalia, including a U.S. citizen elected to Congress, Ilhan Omar — he broadcasts a dangerous message: that people of certain backgrounds are disposable, undeserving of the rights and dignity that define America.

It aligns with his broader ideological agenda — white-nativism, exclusion, and an effort to mobilize his political base through fear, hatred, and division. This isn’t about integration or assimilation; it’s about erecting walls — physical, social, and moral — around whiteness and Christian-majority America, while casting people of color, Muslims, and immigrants as threats to the nation’s identity.

It’s no coincidence that such contempt comes amid aggressive crackdowns: reports suggest his administration is preparing Immigration and Customs Enforcement “strike teams” for mass deportations targeting Somali communities in Minnesota.

By dehumanizing Somalis, Trump lays ideological and rhetorical groundwork for systematic repression, erasing the line between “immigration law enforcement” and ethnic cleansing of whole communities.

A cruel irony: Trump’s own family’s immigrant roots

It’s an ugly hypocrisy that the man leading this crusade against immigrants descends himself — through marriage, naturalization, and private business — from immigrants. His wives, too, were not part of some ancient American founding class. Yet here he stands, calling other immigrants “garbage.”

That bitter irony exposes the argument for what it really is: not about law or national security, but about ideology — white nativist ideology, which sees immigrants of color as inferior, unwelcome, un-American.

Maine’s Somali community: real people, real contributions

The state I call home, Maine, is itself home to a growing Somali community, centered in cities like Portland and Lewiston, Maine. According to the most recent census data, there are roughly 3,000 Somali-born residents in Maine, many of them living in Portland or Lewiston.

In these cities, Somali immigrants and their families have worked tirelessly to build lives, businesses, and communities. They established community centers, helped one another navigate social services, found jobs, paid taxes — and despite hateful myths and scapegoating, they have contributed concretely to the state’s social and economic life.

Take Safiya Khalid, who came to America as a seven-year-old refugee from Somalia, grew up in Lewiston, and in 2019 became the first Somali American elected to the Lewiston City Council — and the youngest ever.

Or consider Deqa Dhalac, born in Mogadishu, Somalia, she immigrated in the early 1990s, moved to Maine, worked as an interpreter and community organizer, and eventually became the first Somali-American mayor in U.S. history when she was elected mayor of South Portland in 2021. Today she serves in the Maine House of Representatives.

These are not political tokens. They are mothers, workers, organizers, people whose lives reflect the best of what America can be: a home for refugees, an opportunity for immigrants, a chance to rebuild, contribute, and belong.

Yet Trump’s words treat them like trash.

Why this scorched public rebuke matters

Because when a leader of a nation mocks entire communities as “garbage,” it emboldens racists, bigots, and xenophobes to act. His words are not benign, they are poisonous.

Because the president’s rhetoric attempts to strip Somali Americans, and all immigrants of color, of their identity, agency, and humanity, reducing them to stereotypes for political gain.

Because Maine’s Somali community — and communities like them across the country — deserve to be honored for their resilience, their contributions, and their humanity.

Because America was built on immigration. On hope. On the idea that people seeking refuge, safety, dignity should be welcomed, not vilified.

If Trump does not immediately retract his words, if the administration proceeds with raids, deportations, or policies targeting entire communities, it will be complicit in a moral atrocity.

We cannot stay silent. We cannot treat this as “just politics.” This is a moral crisis. And we — citizens, neighbors, voters — must speak out, demand accountability, and insist: immigrants are not garbage.

Federal agents sprayed some of the protesters from inside the field office parking lot.","Federal law enforcement officers pepper sprayed Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva, her staff and other community members protesting an immigration raid at a taco restaurant on Tucson’s west side in a historic Latino neighborhood.

Arizona Luminaria photographed the officers at Taco Giro dispersing a cloud-like substance at the crowd and captured video of Grijalva identifying herself and pushing back against agents dressed in combat gear and black masks partially covering their faces.

“I’m a sitting member of congress and I want to know where you’re taking him,” Grijalva asks as she wades through a crowd of protesters and masked officials. People cough around her.

“Don’t push me, don’t push me, don’t push me,” she says.

“I want to know where you’re taking him,” she says as she reaches a masked agent wearing a helmet and a uniform with “POLICE” on the front.

An agent is heard saying “assault on a federal officer” but the rest of the audio is unclear.

“What’s your fucking name, where’s your fucking badge?” a member of the public shouts.

Grijalva continues questioning where agents were taking people they’d arrested during the raid.

“Downtown to the federal jail is where you’re taking him?” Grijalva asks.

“Yes ma’am.”

“That’s all I needed to know.”

“She needs to stop being so aggressive,” Grijalva says about one of the masked agents. “Stop being so aggressive. Don’t push on me,” she says to the agent.

Grijalva is the first Latina to represent Arizona in the U.S. House and has already been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump. On her first day in Congress, after a Republican-led delay to swearing her into office, she was the deciding vote to release the Epstein files.

Grijalva describes Taco Giro as a “small mom-and-pop restaurant that has served our community for years.” The shop sits on Grande Avenue between St. Mary’s Road and Speedway Boulevard in the Barrio Hollywood neighborhood — lined with locally-owned restaurants, churches and a preschool and daycare.

Grijalva posted videos of the altercation at Taco Giro on her social media.

“You guys need to calm down and get out,” she tells federal officers using pepper spray as people scream, cough and car horns honk around her. A projectile nearly hits her in the leg as she moves through the crowd.

She then posted a statement condemning federal immigration agents’ actions.

“We just came up on a community that was protecting their people. We had, I would say, maybe 40 ICE agents, most of them masked, in several vehicles,” she says directly to the camera. “The community had stopped right here right in the middle of the street because they were afraid that they were taking people without due process. Without any notice.”

“I was here, this is the restaurant I come to literally once a week. And was sprayed in the face. By a very aggressive agent. Pushed around by others when I was literally not being aggressive — I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of congress,” she adds.

All but one agent, she says, was “rude and disrespectful” to her as she asked about the whereabouts of people arrested.

“I can only imagine, if they’re gonna treat me like that, how they’re treating everybody else,” she says.

“We saw people directly sprayed. Members of our press. Everybody that was with me, my staff member, myself. Two staff members. We have remnants of whatever they sprayed on us,” she says coughing.

Grijalva called Trump out directly in her message.

“One of the biggest problems we have in this community is that we have Trump, that has no regard for any kind of due process, the rule of law, the constitution,” she says. “They’re literally disappearing people from the streets. They arrested two people. We have no idea where they’re going.”

She thanked Tucson Police Department officers “for coming and taking care of the space. Making sure that everyone was safe once ICE left. ot the aggressors here, they arrived on the scene after ICE was already here and after there was a block in the street. I just want to make sure that that’s really clear.”

Grijalva says she went to the raid to protect the community she represents and ensure the public’s safety.

“I think it’s important for me to have eyes on what’s happening here and not just have it be stories through other people,” she says.

Photos and videos taken by Arizona Luminaria show some officers in combat gear with the words “ICE” or “Police HSI,” which stands for Homeland Security Investigations. The organization is a federal law enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security, as is ICE.

Shortly after the operation, Mayor Regina Romero and Vice Mayor Lane Santa Cruz released a statement condemning federal law enforcement actions and clarifying that Tucson Police Department officers were not involved.

“Today, federal officers conducted a raid in Tucson that rapidly escalated into violence against the public. We share the fears in our community created by President Trump’s immoral and inhumane immigration policies,” they wrote.

They added that it is common under the “Trump Administration, unidentified federal agents often intentionally wear clothing with vague words like “police” to purposefully confuse the public.”

“Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated,” Romero and Santa Cruz wrote.

Tucson Police Department officers were dispatched to the scene to close the street and “to keep our residents safe. They were not involved in the use of force against community members,” they wrote.

Romero and Santa Cruz encouraged people with photos or videos of federal officers’ actions to keep the documentation should there be an “investigation and follow-up” into the incident.

“We are committed to having a safe city where everyone’s rights are respected and legally enforced at all times,” they wrote.

Some community members gathered at the federal ICE field office on the south side of Tucson to continue protesting.

Tucson Police Captain Dominic Flores said about a dozen officers responded to the ICE office on Friday afternoon in response to the protest. By the time the officers arrived they encountered about 25 protesters, he added. But the group quickly dispersed after their arrival.

Moments before Tucson police arrived, protesters had been banging on the fence to the field office, located inside a strip mall complex.

Federal agents sprayed some of the protesters from inside the field office parking lot. But there were no major injuries.

In recent months, community members and journalists have documented officers from federal law enforcement agencies commonly using aggressive policing tactics during immigration sweeps and raids in cities across the nation.

The Trump administration has repeatedly defended its immigration operations and officers’ tactics. Following a DHS operation in New Orleans this week, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement that cities with sanctuary policies were being targeted.

“Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens and forcing DHS law enforcement to risk their lives to remove criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets,” McLaughlin said.

Local voters in 2019 rejected an effort to make Tucson a sanctuary city. However, amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts, the advocacy organization Stand Up, Fight Back Tucson launched a petition earlier this year calling on Romero and city council members “to pass a resolution for Tucson to become a sanctuary city, acting to protect the rights of our citizens even in the face of federal retaliation.”

DHS has not said whether Operation Metro Surge is still ongoing in the Twin Cities, and the agency also has not said whether ICE detained any additional people beyond the dozen shown in the press release.","MINNEAPOLIS — On Monday, Rhoda Christenson said she received a call from a neighbor that her husband, Abdulkadir Sharif Abdi, had been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""I'm driving on the road, and she goes, 'Hey Rhoda, ICE is in your apartment.' I was silent for a minute,"" Christenson said in a phone interview. ""I was really, really upset, because I hadn't said goodbye. We didn't have a plan.""

Abdi, 47, was one of at least 12 people detained this week during ICE's ""Operation Metro Surge,"" including five from Somalia, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Abdi's wife said he was initially processed at the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling but has since been transferred to a detention facility in Nebraska. The two have spoken on the phone every day this week and are actively searching for attorneys to represent him in immigration court, Christenson said.

In a press release, ICE described Abdi as a ""criminal illegal alien"" as well as a ""former member of the Gangster Disciples"" and a ""known current member of Vice Lord Nation,"" listing previous convictions of ""fraud, receiving stolen property, receiving a stolen vehicle, vehicle theft, and multiple probation violations."" However, Christenson pushed back against that characterization, saying that Abdi was not a current gang member and that he had turned his life around after getting sober 13 years ago.

Most recently, she said, he had been working for a small homeless shelter helping the Indigenous population in the Twin Cities. A former acquaintance also confirmed that Abdi worked at Park Avenue Center in Minneapolis for several years and played a key role in helping others find sobriety.

""He's devastated. He's just a simple guy that loves his home, and he works, and he really does help the community,"" Christenson said. ""We've been married 11 years. Has he ever been in trouble? No. Has he always checked in with ICE? Yes.""

Abdi's story has been documented extensively over the years in local media.

A Somali refugee who fled civil war in the 1990s, Abdi became involved in a gang after moving to Minnesota and committed several felonies. According to a Minnesota Star Tribune article written in 2019, those early convictions included car theft, receiving stolen property and drunk driving, leading to a deportation order in 2002. In 2018, during President Trump's first term, Abdi was again targeted for deportation, but a judge spared him that fate after the community rallied to save him.

Christenson said her husband was detained again this past Monday, the day before news broke of ICE's operations and the day before President Trump called Somali immigrants ""garbage"" in a cabinet meeting.

""My preference is that he stays here, one million percent, and that's his goal as well,"" Christenson said. ""Sometimes, when you're being detained, or detained several times, maybe you've given up or lost hope. But Abdi's goal is to stay here.""

Of the 12 people listed on the Homeland Security press release, five were from Somalia while the others were from Mexico and El Salvador. The agency indicated that all of them were in the country illegally, and listed offenses ranging from child sex abuse to domestic violence.

""We're going to enforce the laws of this country without apology,"" White House Border Czar Tom Homan said in an interview with Fox News, ""including in the Twin Cities.""

DHS has not said whether Operation Metro Surge is still ongoing in the Twin Cities, and the agency also has not said whether ICE detained any additional people beyond the dozen shown in the press release.

Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Minnesota, said the Somali American community remained on edge Friday.

""More people are looking out the windows. They're checking to see unmarked cars,"" Hussein said. ""It's obvious, the fear.""

Hussein said that many Somali youth have turned to humor during these tense days, given that the vast majority of the younger Somali-American population was born in the U.S. Hussein has also estimated that more than 90 percent of the 80,000 Somalis in Minnesota are either citizens or have a pathway to citizenship, putting the number of undocumented residents in the hundreds.

The big picture: Validating the president's executive order barring U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants from U.S. citizenship would overrule a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment and upheld by SCOTUS over a century ago.

The belief that U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants have no rights to citizenship was once a fringe idea, but Trump has brought the issue into the mainstream.

Catch up quick: Trump's executive order, which he signed on his first day in office, was quickly met with legal challenges, resulting in temporary blocks on the order nationwide.

A federal court in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction indefinitely blocking the order in July, with U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante ruling that it ""likely 'contradicts the text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the century-old untouched precedent that interprets it.'""

The Trump administration is asking that the Supreme Court overrule that injunction.

The other side: ""No president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship,"" Cecillia Wang, the national legal director of the ACLU, said in a news release.

""For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump's executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress.""

""We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.""

Here's what to know about birthright citizenship and Trump's bid to end it:

What birthright citizenship is

Context: In the U.S., birthright citizenship is automatically granted to people born on U.S. soil, according to the 14th Amendment.

That's regardless of their parents' citizenship status.

The Amendment overturned the Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision, which had found that Black people — free or enslaved — could never become U. S. citizens, and ""had no rights which the white man was bound to respect,"" according to Chief Justice Roger Taney.

The Amendment, which was ratified in 1868, nullified the decision by granting citizenship to all those born in the U.S., regardless of race.

There are two types in the U.S: jus sanguinis, ancestry-based citizenship, and jus soli, birthplace-based citizenship.

With jus sanguinis, children born outside of the U.S. to at least one parent who is an American citizen may be entitled to U.S. citizenship if they meet certain requirements.

Jus soli guarantees citizenship to almost everyone born in the U.S. However, there are some narrow exceptions, such as children born to diplomats or foreign heads of state.

The 1898 Supreme Court case that validated birthright citizenship

Zoom in: The Supreme Court's 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark ruled that the 14th Amendment guaranteed U.S. citizenship to any person born on U.S. soil.

It was a watershed moment for immigrants and descendants of immigrants in the U.S., namely Asian Americans.

The case concerned Wong Kim Ark, a man born in California to Chinese immigrants, who returned to the U.S. after visiting family in China and was refused re-entry.

John Wise, the collector of customs in San Francisco who controlled immigration, wanted a test case that would deny U.S. citizenship to ethnic Chinese residents and challenged that individuals born to immigrants were not citizens.

Zoom out: The court's decision led to a dramatic demographic transformation of the U.S.

It also gave protection to millions of Asian Americans and Latinos. Native Americans weren't granted citizenship through birth until 1924.

What the Trump administration is arguing

Birthright citizenship was added to the Constitution via the 14th Amendment following the Civil War, guaranteeing citizenship for newly freed enslaved people.

What they're saying: The Trump administration is arguing that birthright citizenship only applies to those people.

""The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to grant citizenship to newly freed slaves and their children—not to the children of temporary visitors or illegal aliens,"" the government argued in its petition for Writ of Certiorari before the court.

The White House, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Agriculture, Department of State and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.

How many people would be affected by Trump's order?

In 2018, there were 4.4 million U.S.-born children with at least one parent who is an ""unauthorized immigrant,"" according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis.

In 2022, Congress defined unauthorized immigrants as ""noncitizens who generally have entered the United States without inspection, overstayed a period of lawful admission, or violated the terms of their admission.""

The number of children born to immigrants

In 2021, 21% of U.S. births were attributed to immigrant parents, the same share as in 2000, according to child advocacy group Annie E. Casey Foundation.

The per­cent­age has fluctuated slightly over the years, rising to 25% in 2006, but has since dropped back down to its pre­vi­ous level.

The likelihood of eliminating birthright citizenship

Michael LeRoy, an immigration law expert and professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told Axios' Avery Lotz that a Supreme Court ruling in Trump's favor would have far-reaching legal repercussions.

LeRoy said he couldn't predict how the Supreme Court would rule, but striking down a ""clear provision in an amendment based on an executive order"" could have implications for other parts of the Constitution.

""The day might come when a president of a different political party issues an executive order to limit or repeal the Second Amendment,"" he said.",https://images.axios.com/6hY13Paiw62XIhKbsym1CehVQFQ=/0x800:7680x5120/1366x768/2025/12/05/1764966116043.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 06:56:21.747181

The expansion would build on a travel ban already announced in June by the Republican administration, which barred travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries and restricted access to the U.S. for people from seven others. In a social media post earlier this week, Noem had suggested more countries would be included.

Noem, who spoke late Thursday in an interview with Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham, would not provide further details, saying President Donald Trump was considering which countries would be included.

""If they don't have a stable government there, if they don't have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?"" Noem said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about when an updated travel ban might go into effect and which countries would be included in it.

Additions to the June travel ban are the latest in what has been a rapidly unfolding series of immigration actions since the shooting Thanksgiving week of two National Guard troops in Washington.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who emigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal, has been charged with first-degree murder after one of the two victims, West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, died of wounds sustained in the Nov. 26 shooting. The second victim, Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, was critically wounded. Lakanwal has pleaded not guilty.

The Trump administration has argued that more vetting is needed to make sure people entering or already in the U.S. aren't a threat. Critics say the administration is traumatizing people who've already gone through extensive vetting to get to the U.S. and say the new measures amount to collective punishment.

Over the course of a little more than a week, the administration has halted asylum decisions, paused processing of immigration-related benefits for people in the U.S. from the 19 travel ban countries and halted visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

On Thursday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it was reducing the time period that work permits are valid for certain applicants such as refugees and people with asylum so they have to reapply more often and go through vetting more frequently.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108158628-17497511572025-06-12t175848z_296456179_rc251faa617t_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump-migration-los-angeles-noem.jpeg?v=1749751213&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-12-06 07:56:18.193442

Because Maine’s Somali community — and communities like them across the country — deserve to be honored for their resilience, their contributions, and their humanity.","Over the last few days, President Trump launched a vicious, brazen, and hate-filled attack on Somali immigrants — and by extension, on a fundamental ideal of America itself. In a White House Cabinet meeting, he repeatedly referred to Somalis as “garbage” and demanded they be expelled.

“Ilhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage,” he said. “These are people who do nothing but complain…When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country. Let ’em go back to where they came from and fix it.”

Then: “Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country.”

He doubled down later: “We could go one way or the other — and we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.”

These aren’t misremembered paraphrases. These are disregarded human beings, stripped of dignity, reduced to “garbage” in front of the world.

Why this attack is not about policy — but about hate

Trump’s tirade is not a reasoned critique of immigration policy. It is a naked display of bigotry, racism, and dehumanization. By singling out an entire ethnic and religious group — immigrants from Somalia, including a U.S. citizen elected to Congress, Ilhan Omar — he broadcasts a dangerous message: that people of certain backgrounds are disposable, undeserving of the rights and dignity that define America.

It aligns with his broader ideological agenda — white-nativism, exclusion, and an effort to mobilize his political base through fear, hatred, and division. This isn’t about integration or assimilation; it’s about erecting walls — physical, social, and moral — around whiteness and Christian-majority America, while casting people of color, Muslims, and immigrants as threats to the nation’s identity.

It’s no coincidence that such contempt comes amid aggressive crackdowns: reports suggest his administration is preparing Immigration and Customs Enforcement “strike teams” for mass deportations targeting Somali communities in Minnesota.

By dehumanizing Somalis, Trump lays ideological and rhetorical groundwork for systematic repression, erasing the line between “immigration law enforcement” and ethnic cleansing of whole communities.

A cruel irony: Trump’s own family’s immigrant roots

It’s an ugly hypocrisy that the man leading this crusade against immigrants descends himself — through marriage, naturalization, and private business — from immigrants. His wives, too, were not part of some ancient American founding class. Yet here he stands, calling other immigrants “garbage.”

That bitter irony exposes the argument for what it really is: not about law or national security, but about ideology — white nativist ideology, which sees immigrants of color as inferior, unwelcome, un-American.

Maine’s Somali community: real people, real contributions

The state I call home, Maine, is itself home to a growing Somali community, centered in cities like Portland and Lewiston, Maine. According to the most recent census data, there are roughly 3,000 Somali-born residents in Maine, many of them living in Portland or Lewiston.

In these cities, Somali immigrants and their families have worked tirelessly to build lives, businesses, and communities. They established community centers, helped one another navigate social services, found jobs, paid taxes — and despite hateful myths and scapegoating, they have contributed concretely to the state’s social and economic life.

Take Safiya Khalid, who came to America as a seven-year-old refugee from Somalia, grew up in Lewiston, and in 2019 became the first Somali American elected to the Lewiston City Council — and the youngest ever.

Or consider Deqa Dhalac, born in Mogadishu, Somalia, she immigrated in the early 1990s, moved to Maine, worked as an interpreter and community organizer, and eventually became the first Somali-American mayor in U.S. history when she was elected mayor of South Portland in 2021. Today she serves in the Maine House of Representatives.

These are not political tokens. They are mothers, workers, organizers, people whose lives reflect the best of what America can be: a home for refugees, an opportunity for immigrants, a chance to rebuild, contribute, and belong.

Yet Trump’s words treat them like trash.

Why this scorched public rebuke matters

Because when a leader of a nation mocks entire communities as “garbage,” it emboldens racists, bigots, and xenophobes to act. His words are not benign, they are poisonous.

Because the president’s rhetoric attempts to strip Somali Americans, and all immigrants of color, of their identity, agency, and humanity, reducing them to stereotypes for political gain.

Because Maine’s Somali community — and communities like them across the country — deserve to be honored for their resilience, their contributions, and their humanity.

Because America was built on immigration. On hope. On the idea that people seeking refuge, safety, dignity should be welcomed, not vilified.

If Trump does not immediately retract his words, if the administration proceeds with raids, deportations, or policies targeting entire communities, it will be complicit in a moral atrocity.

We cannot stay silent. We cannot treat this as “just politics.” This is a moral crisis. And we — citizens, neighbors, voters — must speak out, demand accountability, and insist: immigrants are not garbage.

US Supreme Court (File photo)

The US Supreme Court has agreed to take up the White House’s appeal on President Trump’s January 20 executive order restricting birthright citizenship. The directive seeks to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the US if their mother is in a temporary lawful status (say H-4) or has no legal status, and if the father is not a US citizen or permanent resident. For now, the US government remains barred from enforcing the order under four separate lower-court injunctions. By approaching the Supreme Court, the Trump administration is aiming for a ruling that upholds its reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause and clears the way for the executive order to take effect. Oral arguments are expected in 2026 and according to immigration experts, a final ruling is likely in mid-2026.

‘What Sleepless Nights?’: Ramaphosa Slaps Back After Trump Shuts South Africa Out Of G20 | Watch

Immigrant-rights groups reacted sharply to this development, arguing that the Constitution is unambiguous on the question of citizenship. FWD.us president Todd Schulte, president at FWD.us, a bipartisan political organization, said ""The Trump administration’s continued, unlawful, and unconstitutional efforts to implement its executive order ending the 14th Amendment’s clear guarantee of birthright citizenship have continually been blocked by the courts. As the SC has decided to take up this case on the merits, the court should and must be as clear as the constitution: those born in the United States are citizens, and no president can overturn the constitution by executive order.” The litigation stems from the Trump administration’s sweeping reinterpretation of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the 14th Amendment, overturning more than a century of settled law. Earlier TOI reporting had detailed how the order would bar automatic citizenship for babies born after February 19, 2025, if neither biological parent holds US citizenship or a green card. Immigration attorneys note that this would particularly impact families stuck in the decades-long employment-based green card backlog, many of whom are from India. If the order were to take effect, a child born to an H-1B worker and an H-4 dependent would inherit only the mother’s temporary status, not US citizenship. In more extreme cases, if the mother lacked legal status, the newborn would immediately be deemed unlawfully present, making the child vulnerable to removal under immigration law. Although the Supreme Court’s June 27 ruling narrowed the authority of lower courts to issue universal injunctions, those that are already granted continue to shield affected families until a final order is issued.

While we look ahead to 2026 – the 250th Anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence – I’m also looking back at themes that emerged from conferences and gatherings this fall of 2025, including NCoC, the ListenFirst Coalition’s Bridging Summit, and ComNet (the Communications Network’s annual gathering), to name a few. There’s also overlap with Lumina’s day-long convening on the power of narrative, and I’ll share more on that valuable research separately.

That 26 themes emerged over a few months of gatherings leading into 2026 tells me these are lessons we need to be heeding right now. Where possible and appropriate, I cite sources and seek to give credit where it’s due. If I’ve misattributed anything, please tell me and I’ll fix it.

These themes apply to everyone who wants to help heal what ails us these days. I also include actionable tips for those in communications, storytelling for impact, and philanthropy.

1. KNOW YOUR OWN POWER: WE ARE THE ONES WE’VE BEEN WAITING FOR

In moments of uncertainty, it can be tempting to look outward for a savior – a brilliant leader, a rock-solid institution, or your favored political party. When it comes to the future of the United States, that’s a mistake.

Whether you call it a constitutional republic or a democracy, our real strength has never come from the top. It comes from ordinary people when we decide that our values, our voices, and our actions matter. However small those may seem, we have power.

After all, our form of government is not self-executing; it relies on millions of us choosing to stay informed, speak up, and act, even when it feels inconvenient or unpopular. (See #4.)

Many people don’t realize this but just over 100 years ago, the United States faced challenges like what we’re facing today. After the industrial revolution, millions were uprooted from farms and forced into factory towns and crowded cities, economic inequality widened, politics was openly corrupt, trust was deeply fractured, and racial terror intensified as Jim Crow laws codified segregation.

In short, the country was a mess. And you know what people did?

They rallied. They rebuilt. The early 1900s were when settlement houses began, offering job training, arts programs and political education. Service clubs like Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions began popping up all over the country, along with Elks, Moose, and Knights of Columbus, the NAACP and National Urban League, and League of Women Voters.*

We need to find that inside ourselves again today.

When we remember our own agency, our perspective shifts: we stop feeling like unbuckled passengers in a runaway political moment and start acting like the authors of our shared future that we are.

(*Give yourself the gift of reading David Eisner’s account of this era.)

2. IDENTITY SHIFT: WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A “CITIZEN”

The shift we need is more than just perspective; it’s our very identity. Alongside the myriad identities we hold – brother, niece, grandparent, trucker, nurse, artist, Coloradan, Minnesotan, Hispanic, Brazilian, Singaporean, Christian, Muslim, etc. – citizen should make our lists.

As Harry Boyte has warned, many have been lulled into seeing citizenship as a form of consumerism: citizens as passive recipients of services and benefits in the transactional marketplace of politics. Such impressions miss a world of opportunity, responsibility, and privilege.

If you hear “citizenship” as a legal status we hold, you’re not alone. It took me several months to broaden what I hear to include being a member of a nationwide community.

Today, I understand citizenship is a relationship - a reciprocal one - between each of us and the country we share.

Today, I hear “citizenship” as something we do.

Today, I hear “citizen” as an identity that can be a source of belonging, pride, and connection.

As former Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter once said of the United States, “The highest office is the office of citizen.” Many of us have forgotten that we hold this office - or were never taught in the first place. While some would prefer that we all forget, we citizens do still have power – or “civic muscle,” as we say in Braver Angels.

The more we practice civic engagement and the more we “flex our civic muscle,” the more our identity will shift and we’ll experience ourselves as contributors to a shared stewardship - not spectators.

3. BEING AN ENGAGED CITIZEN IS MORE THAN VOTING

As Valerie Lemmie from the Kettering Foundation reminded us at NCoC, many mistakenly think being a citizen is only two things: voting and obeying laws. Thinking of completing your ballot as the only expression of civic power is like exercising once a year and assuming you’re fit. Similarly, not breaking laws is a low bar - the civic health equivalent of not having ice cream every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Given this shrunken view of citizenship, it’s no surprise much of our civic muscle has atrophied (especially when realities like dark money and gerrymandering hamstring our voting power).

But here’s good news: no matter our age or circumstances, we can build that muscle back. Citizenship is exercised daily, not annually. It is lived through community relationships, shared stewardship, and the ongoing work of strengthening our neighborhoods, communities, and country. We’ll detail how in our November webinar the day after Thanksgiving – and you don’t even need to get off the couch to join.

In using that muscle, you’ll feel your own power. As Wilk Wilkerson of Braver Angels explains, our sense of agency expands with action.

It's the IKEA effect on a bigger scale: we value what we help build.

4. BEING AN ENGAGED CITIZEN TAKES COURAGE

Just like working other muscles, using your civic muscle isn’t always comfortable. In fact, being involved in your community or in public life can be incredibly uncomfortable. It’s easier not to find out what people in your community care about, not ask questions at a town meeting, not to learn more about local issues, not to correct a piece of misinformation in a group chat, and not to talk to people who disagree with you. And it’s certainly easier not to put together a citizens gathering when you know someone who has threatened violence is going to show up:

All those examples of civic engagement take courage. And when we use that word, let’s be clear about two things:

Courage isn’t about being fearless, never feeling nervous, and always being certain. It’s about feeling the fear, nerves, and uncertainty and showing up anyway.

Courage isn’t just for superheroes. Yes, these are challenging times, but there is space – and need – for everyday people across the country to find the way to contribute their talent, time, and treasure to our shared future. (See #15.)

5. BEING AN ENGAGED CITIZEN ALSO INVOLVES INVISIBLE LABOR

If there’s a common thread through examples of engaged citizenship I’ve seen across the country, it’s how much happens behind the scenes. For every step forward, there are countless meetings. For every public meeting, there are months of coordination. For every 5-minute video, there’s a thousand-fold in planning and editing. For every one-hour webinar, there’s twenty-fold in preparation and follow-up.

At NCoC, Jillian Youngblood from Civic Genuis shared the example of the considerable volunteer time that goes into keeping one Girl Scout troop together. Personally, I know how many hours I volunteer with Braver Angels, and deeply appreciate the time volunteers across the country freely give to support the organization.

In addition to time for coordination, there’s a vital need for emotional intelligence and social awareness. The Needham Resilience Network is a great example of this EQ in action. As Dr. Nichole Argo shared at the Bridging Summit, prior to any gatherings, the Network has 1:1 conversations to ensure people feel prepared, safe, and welcome to join.

This is particularly important when some voices have never been heard, where people with important things to share aren’t yet seen as “leaders,” or where some may not feel like they belong.* Beyond that, there are the logistics of ensuring transportation, compensating time away from work, securing childcare and other considerations.

This isn’t the work that shows up in headlines or news clips, but it is the work that brings and holds communities together.

(*For more on these concepts, check out Nina Simon's book The Art of Relevance.)

6. WE CAN’T SOLVE PROBLEMS WITHOUT CARING AND CONNECTION

What fuels all of this work – visibile and invisible? Vinay Orekondy of Better Together America clearly answered that question at NCoC: We can’t solve problems if we aren’t talking to each other – and if we don’t care about each other.

Knowing our own power isn’t enough; we need to be connected to other people and care what happens to them. That may seem simple as you read this post, but consider how divisions across the country look – and sound – in practice. Odds are you’ve seen or heard examples of the 4Ds in comments, social posts, conversations, or elsewhere: dissociate; devalue; dehumanize; destroy.

This 4D slope begins with “they are different than us,” moves to “their difference makes them less valuable than us,” which leads to a profound lack of empathy, and ends with the ability to destroy others because, after all, they aren’t really human anyway.

I heard another form of this disconnect at the Principles First conference earlier this year, when a speaker wisely noted that rather than recognize the real problems people are facing, some treat those people as if they are the problem to be solved. That, too, is demoralizing and dehumanizing.

Surrounded by messages of “us v. them,” it can be tempting to sever connection to “them,” but that’s the civic equivalent of cutting off one of your own hands. Can you count the number of tasks in your day that would drastically change if you lost your left or right hand? When it comes to the civic body* as a whole, severing connection to “them” is severing the possibility of real, lasting solutions.

(*If you aren’t familiar with that phrase, or even if you think you are, you’ll want to hear Dr. Allison Ralph’s talk on the topic.)

7. POLITICAL ACTIVITY ≠ CIVIC HEALTH

So, let’s say your community is politically active. You’re off the civic couch, knocking on doors, pushing yard signs into the ground, and cheering for “your team” to head to the polls. You might assume you’re civically healthy. Unfortunately, that’s not necessarily true.

Recall the state of Georgia’s recent elections, both the special session Senate election and gubernatorial races. Well, as we discussed at NCoC, despite the enormous energy around those races, the state still ranks 48th in child well-being. This mismatch underscores a crucial truth: more political activity does not automatically translate to stronger communities.

As being a citizen is about more than voting (#3), civic health is about more than political campaigns and elections. Civic health addresses what’s important in people’s daily lives, e.g., education, safety, belonging, and economic opportunity.

8. FEDERAL DYSFUNCTION MEANS WE MUST LOOK LOCAL

To address those priorities, many look to “Uncle Sam” by default. But federal officials just set a record for the number of days the U.S. government shut down. Too many of those officials operate as if “community” means “my party.” Looking to Washington, D.C. to save us is like expecting five minutes a day with a broken shake weight to build all the muscle you’ll ever need.

Yes, there are glimmers of hope from D.C., but if we wait for Congress or the White House to model healthier behavior, we’ll be skeletons gathering dust on the civic couch.

Daniel Stid of the American Enterprise Institute offered a less grim perspective at NCoC, explaining that while our national attention fixates on Washington, our actual lives are decentralized: we’re governed and resourced at the state and local levels.

In other words, civic opportunity lives close to home, not far away.

9. BUT DON’T JUST LOOK LOCAL, TAKE ACTION!

Looking local doesn’t mean transferring unrealistic expectations of federal officials to local officials instead. We need to collectively DIY – or DIO? DO IT OURSELVES.

We know citizen-led action is do-able because it’s already being done. People across the country know local problems are easier to see, local people are easier to reach, and local solutions… well, they aren’t always easy, but they are possible. And, like a capstan pulling in the anchor that’s been slowing us down, each turn gets easier as more people lean in and momentum grows. (Ditto for the Civic Action-Engine!)

At the same time, that local focus doesn’t mean we ignore the rest of the country. This is the American experiment, remember? And like the 20 or so centers around the world that each had dozens of teams involved in the Human Genome Project, we need to stay connected across communities and states, share ideas, and build on each other’s successes.

We’re not choosing local over national; we’re starting where we have the most influence while seeing the bigger picture.

10. POLITICAL POLARIZATION – AND THE INDUSTRIAL OUTRAGE COMPLEX – IS HARMING ALL OF US

Among the many reasons I appreciate Braver Angels’ approach is the reminder that political disagreement on its own isn’t a problem; as “Reds” in particular know, healthy democracies depend on healthy debate. What’s hurting us now is how:

We’ve become so outraged at “the other side” that we won’t even speak to “them;”

People have productized that outrage; and

So many of us regularly consume that toxic product.

In our ComNet panel about Politics, Proximity, & Purpose: The Impact of Your Organization's Communication in a Polarized Landscape, Sandra Brownrigg, co-chair of the Southern Front Range Alliance of Braver Angels, cautioned attendees not to fall prey to the Industrial Outrage Complex, i.e., media outlets, influencers, and algorithms that benefit from keeping angry and fearful so we keep clicking, sharing, and staying tuned in. These conflict entrepreneurs generate a constant stream of content designed to make us feel threatened by people who think differently.

This content chips away at trust, makes compromise look weak, and convinces us “others” aren’t human – i.e., it wants us to forget #6. As conflict entrepreneurs rake in the money, we pay the price in strained relationships with family, friends, and neighbors. Being constantly primed for battle takes a toll on us mentally and physically and leaves us less safe and less effective.

Recognizing how the outrage machine works is an important flexing of civic muscle. That recognition doesn’t magically fix polarization, but we know we’re being played, we can make more intentional choices about where we get our information and how we engage with each other.

11. COMMUNICATORS, FOCUS ON SHARED INTERESTS AND VALUES

A basic rule of communication is “know your audience.” Communications professionals may be tempted to interpret that as segmenting audiences based on age, geography, income, gender, or any other number of demographics. Further, many default to sharing messages that matter to their organization’s leadership or funders.

Instead, as Sofi Andorsky of Third Plateau clearly reminded attendees at our ComNet panel, to be effective communicators and bridge-builders, we must speak to people based on how they relate to the world, not based on our internal priorities or what funders expect. To reach people, we need to focus on what matters to them and find their shared interests and values. (Braver Angels does this in Braver Arts and Braver Faith, for example.)

As the “Let’s Talk” exhibit at the National Liberty Museum in Philadelphia explains, we often share more values than we realize, we just rank them in a different order. For example, a message that leads with the value of care sounds different than leading with security, which sounds different than leading with freedom, even if all three values are widely shared. This fact was a relief to one panel attendee who lives in a “deep red” state and appreciated the “reminder that working together doesn’t have to mean abandoning what I believe.”

Knowing how people relate to the world isn’t as easy as sorting by zip code, which is why I’m already looking forward to our May 2026 webinar with Democracy 2076. Referencing research the organization has done with Harmony Labs, Dr. Melody Mohebi shared what sounds like the best online quiz ever: name your four favorite TV shows and we can tell you what you value. Intrigued? Join us in May.

12. AUTHENTIC COMMUNICATION > METRICS

Another common mistake in this era of fragmented information consumption is assuming big numbers indicate meaningful impact. A survey Sofi’s organization undertook found that communications teams across the country spend a lot of time communicating only to members of Congress and elected officials. The survey also revealed that many teams spend more time promoting programs than building a broader audience.

Translation: many in the depolarization/pro-democracy field are failing to reach the general public.

Even harsher translation: we’re talking to ourselves.

While metrics like earned media and shares on social have their place, we need to prioritize connection. Connection is what actually makes a difference, and authenticity begets connection. That can look like letting go of some control and letting people carry your message in their own words.

For example, when PopPop called for more civic engagement while floating down the James River with Team Democracy, he used his own words to speak to his own growing audience.

13. BUILD A BIG TENT/DON’T GO IT ALONE

Big problems can require big coalitions, which is why I’ve written before about a “big tent.”

Two things are crucial in constructing that tent: 1) define it by what we’re for, not what (or whom) we’re against; and 2) don’t ask people to leave our differences at the door – er, flap – of the tent.

The goal of the big tent must be a positive vision for our shared future. When the tent is built around a shared vision rather than a shared enemy, more people can see themselves in it. And when more people can see themselves in it, we’re far better equipped to tackle the challenges ahead. The most inspiring thinking I’ve seen recently is this honest, inclusive, and forward-looking paper by the U.S. Baha'i Office of Public Affairs:

NoA Concept note 2025.04.25.pdfDownload PDF • 83KB

When it comes to resisting the urge to work in isolated circles of people who already think exactly like we do, I’m grateful to Heidi and Guy Burgess, longtime scholars of conflict transformation and Co-Directors of the Conflict Information Consortium. (You'll want to subscribe to their Substack, Beyond Intractability.)

They remind us that large-scale social challenges can only be addressed through “massively parallel” efforts, i.e., many groups, with different perspectives and different strengths, all working toward a shared horizon. (Or third horizon, as some theories posit.)

In their view, the point isn’t to iron out every disagreement or erase ideological diversity; it’s to create enough connection, trust, and coordination that people can move in the same general direction without needing perfect alignment. And I’m grateful to Walt Roberts for hosting IMIP, the InterMovement Impact Project, his co-creator Caleb Christen, and all who participate with the goal of building that connection, trust, and coordination.

Former immigration judge Tania Nemer is suing the Trump administration, arguing she was wrongfully terminated because she is a dual citizen of Lebanon, the child of immigrants and had previously run for local office as a Democrat.

Nemer’s lawsuit claims her firing violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

She also filed a complaint with the Justice Department’s Equal Opportunity Office, but it was dismissed.

Media Miss by the left: Trump signs bill tripling pensions for Medal of Honor recipients

Trump signed bipartisan legislation this week significantly expanding benefits for Medal of Honor recipients.

It requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to more than triple the special monthly pension for living Medal of Honor recipients, raising the current rate from $16,880.76 a year to $67,500.

Right now there are 61 living Medal of Honor recipients, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.

Troy Carter, Hispanic leaders and civil rights advocates, mayor-elect Helena Moreno expressed ""deep concern over recent actions"" by federal agents.

""Because now it doesn't matter you have papers, you speak English or you are a citizen, it's not enough.""","New Orleans' mayor-elect said Friday that a federal immigration crackdown launched this week is already causing harm as encounters between masked agents and residents, including some caught on video, has prompted public backlash.

Frustrated city officials pointed to the case of Jacelynn Guzman, a 23-year-old U.S. citizen who was walking back to her Louisiana home from a trip to the grocery store on Wednesday when a truck pulled up beside her and two masked federal agents approached her, according to security footage obtained by The Associated Press.

Guzman began running away as a second vehicle arrived and the agents pursued her down the sidewalk until she reached her family's home in Marrero, a neighbourhood across the Mississippi River from downtown New Orleans. Guzman's mother has lived there her entire life.

""We're legal, we are from here, born and raised,"" Guzman shouted back at the agents. ""Don't chase me, that is disgusting.""

Several hundred agents under Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino have converged on southeast Louisiana this week as part of an immigration enforcement operation seeking to arrest 5,000 people. The Department of Homeland Security has touted dozens of arrests with only limited details released. Many Hispanic residents have said they feel their community is at risk of being abused or detained by agents regardless of their legal status.

Alongside city council members, Democratic Rep. Troy Carter, Hispanic leaders and civil rights advocates, mayor-elect Helena Moreno expressed ""deep concern over recent actions"" by federal agents. She said the operation is causing harm — forcing businesses to shutter and workers to stay home out of fear of mass arrests.

While federal officials have repeatedly said the goal of the operation is to target dangerous criminals who entered the country illegally, Moreno argued ""that does not appear to be the case.""

Moreno said she is asking for regular public briefings from federal agencies, which she asks includes data on the stops, detentions, charges, warrants, outcomes and if any of the people detained have violent criminal histories.

""Without this full visibility into these enforcement actions, it is impossible to determine whether this particular operation is actually targeting the most dangerous offenders,"" Moreno said.

Guzman's stepfather, Juan Anglin, said he understood federal agents had a job to do but believed they were going about it in the wrong way.

Anglin heard his stepdaughter screaming outside and went out to confront the agents. He said she ran from the agents because she was a young woman surrounded by aggressive masked men.

""I thought she was going to be kidnapped, honestly,"" Anglin said. ""I thought somebody was going to hurt her.""

In response, the Department of Homeland Security said Border Patrol had been searching for a ""criminal illegal alien previously charged with felony theft and convicted of illegal possession of stolen property.""

DHS said the agents ""encountered a female matching the description of the target"" and that agents identified themselves and left when they realized Guzman was not who they were seeking.

Anglin disputes the government's narrative and says she was stopped solely because of her appearance.

""Just because you look brown, you look Hispanic, you're going to get stopped,"" he said. ""Because now it doesn't matter you have papers, you speak English or you are a citizen, it's not enough.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/5cc05804-2a33-4c76-9b5a-fdb23ea042e8,1764984081567/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C209%2C3936%2C2214%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-12-06 02:56:42.556078

ICE changes

What we know:

Right now, ICE leases a building in downtown Milwaukee at Broadway and Knapp. It is on the MSOE campus.

The federal government has leased the building since 1999. In 2023, MSOE bought it. School officials said before then, the federal government said it was going to leave within months, but ended up staying.

MSOE officials say federal law requires they allow the federal government to stay. But that upset some students.

Plenty of opinions

What they're saying:

""It's very important for MSOE to recognize: they inherited this lease, they chose to accept this building, where they knew ICE was conducting enforcement removal operations out of it,"" said Conor Mika, MSOE student.

""ICE is not welcome in Wisconsin,"" said Steve Szymanski, a protester.

ICE responded to Friday's protest with the following statement:

""ICE respects the rights of individuals involved in peaceful protest. We remind the public that every day, the brave men and women of ICE work in communities across the country to uphold public safety and national security by apprehending gang members, foreign fugitives, and other dangerous criminal aliens illegally present in the United States. In recent months, ICE officers’ jobs have become even more dangerous as assaults on officers continue to increase. ICE personnel have been targeted with protest activity at their homes, along with doxxing, which has resulted in their personal information being made public. These actions have led to a more than 1,150% increase in assaults and an 8,000% increase in death threats against ICE law enforcement.""

MSOE said no one was available for an interview, but issued the following statement:

""When MSOE acquired the building at 310 E. Knapp St. on March 1, 2023, the property included an existing federal lease administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) that had been in place since September 16, 1999. Prior to the acquisition, discussions with the GSA indicated that the agency intended to vacate the space within several months. Based on that understanding, MSOE’s long-term plan was to renovate the facility for academic use following the termination of GSA’s tenancy.

""However, after the acquisition, the GSA elected to continue its occupancy beyond the original lease term while federal agencies determine their next steps. Under the terms of the inherited lease and federal authority allowing the government to require continued occupancy, MSOE is obligated to accommodate the tenant during this period.

""We understand that some members of our community hoped the space would already be available for university use. That remains our long-term goal. In the meantime, MSOE is fulfilling its legal responsibilities as landlord to the federal government.""

What's next for ICE?

Dig deeper:

ICE is planning a move to Milwaukee's northwest side. FOX6 News obtained city records revealed the city approved an occupancy certificate for ICE. For months, construction crews have transformed what was empty office space.

In the application for occupancy for Suite 100, the contractor listed the proposed days and hours as ""Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m."" The application said it will not be serving or preparing food.

Other records FOX6 News obtained show the proposed security fence with black privacy slats. The fence application said it will be 8 feet fall and have an anti-climb mesh.

Other city documents FOX6 News first obtained in January show a plan have been in the works since at least spring 2023. Those documents said the federal government will use the space for ""processing of immigrants."" It said that is for non-detained people checking in, as well as for processing detainees heading to detention facilities. The plans showed building security entrances typically used for transporting people in custody.

Federal immigration officials have arrested a visiting Harvard Law School professor from Brazil, who recently resolved allegations that he illegally fired a pellet gun outside a Brookline synagogue.

Carlos Portugal Gouvêa, 47, had his visa revoked Oct. 16 following his initial arrest, the Department of Homeland Security said in a news release. On Wednesday, nearly two months later, agents from the Boston U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office arrested Gouvêa again, and he agreed to leave the country voluntarily rather than be deported, according to DHS.

Per his Oct. 1 arrest report, Gouvêa told Brookline police he was using the pellet rifle to hunt rats near Temple Beth Zion, where worshippers were marking the start of Yom Kippur.

He was charged with illegally discharging a BB gun or air rifle, disorderly conduct, vandalism, and disturbing the peace, though prosecutors dropped the latter three charges last month as part of a plea agreement. For the remaining count, Gouvêa agreed to serve six months of pretrial probation and pay $386.59 in restitution after one of his pellets broke a window on a nearby parked car.

Gouvêa pleaded not guilty, and a spokesperson for the Norfolk County District Attorney’s Office previously told Boston.com no change of plea is taken in a case that is disposed through pretrial probation.

However, the DHS press release makes reference to a “guilty plea” and describes the incident as an “anti-Semitic shooting,” contrary to statements from local authorities and Temple Beth Zion leadership. In fact, synagogue leaders specifically wrote in an open letter that they had “no reason to believe this was an antisemitic event.”

“From what we were initially told by police, the individual was unaware that he lived next to, and was shooting his BB gun next to, a synagogue or that it was a religious holiday,” the letter states. “It was potentially dangerous to use a BB gun in such a populated spot, but it does not appear to have been fuelled [sic] by antisemitism.”

An attorney who previously represented Gouvêa also said earlier that the incident was “a total misunderstanding” and that the professor “categorically denies” his actions were motivated by antisemitism. Further, a Harvard Chabad rabbi told attendees at an October event that Gouvêa’s wife and children are Jewish, The Harvard Crimson reported.

Still, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin doubled down on the antisemitism claims.

“There is no room in the United States for brazen, violent acts of anti-Semitism like this,” she said in a statement. “They are an affront to our core principals as a country and an unacceptable threat against law-abiding American citizens. We are under zero obligation to admit foreigners who commit these inexplicably reprehensible acts or to let them stay here.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and commit anti-American and anti-Semitic violence and terrorism should think again,” McLaughlin added. “You are not welcome here.”",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/https___arcmigration-prdweb.bostonglobe.com_r_Boston_2011-2020_2020_01_09_BostonGlobe.com_Metro_Images_Colleges_Slavery_Reparations_71541-6761825811db6-768x432.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 09:57:03.522726

In 2023, it set up a display showing Baby Jesus alone amid rubble as an homage to civilians trapped in the war in Gaza, according to the Chicago Tribune.","An Illinois church is facing criticism for displaying a Nativity scene that depicts baby Jesus with his hands zip-tied and guarded by figures styled as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

Lake Street Church of Evanston is displaying the scene outside on its grounds.

Baby Jesus is wrapped in a thin blanket resembling aluminum foil, which the church said is a reference to the emergency blankets used in detention facilities.

Masked centurions, officers in the ancient Roman army, are depicted in sunglasses and green vests labeled “ICE.”

It also shows Mother Mary wearing a respirator mask “to protect herself from tear gas,” according to the church. Joseph is also masked.

In a Facebook post last week, the church said the installation reimagines the Nativity as a scene of forced family separation, drawing parallels between the Holy Family’s refugee flight and modern immigration detention practices.

“This installation reimagines the nativity as a scene of forced family separation, drawing direct parallels between the Holy Family’s refugee experience and contemporary immigration detention practices,” the post reads.

“‘The Holy Family were refugees. This is not political interpretation, this is the reality described in the stories our tradition has told and retold for millenia,’” it continues. “‘By witnessing this familiar story through the reality faced by migrants today, we hope to restore its radical edge, and to ask what it means to celebrate the birth of a refugee child while turning away those who follow in that child’s footsteps.’”

The church, which also hangs Black Lives Matter banners and social justice banners, said the zip ties on the baby’s wrists directly reference children who were zip-tied by agents during a raid on a Chicago apartment building earlier this year.

The church claims most residents were US citizens in that incident. It called the display a stark reminder that “enforcement terror does not discriminate by documentation status.”

In recent days, it appears Mary’s gas mask has been removed, while the zip ties have been cut from the baby Jesus’ hands.

The Facebook post and display drew both criticism and praise from commenters.

“Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem because they had to return to Joseph’s ancestral home to be counted in the census,” one person wrote. “So Trump is just following that example and sending people HOME per a legal requirement. If they want to immigrate LEGALLY, they can fill out the paperwork before they leave and self–deport.”

“Blasphemy!!! Father forgive them, they know not what they do,” another wrote.

A different commenter argued the church had misinterpreted the Bible: “The Holy Family were refugees… do you guys read the Bible? Mary and Joseph travelled as required by Caesar’s census requirement, NOT refugees.”

Others supported the display, with one user calling it “very powerful art.”

“Out of all the tragedy affecting my community, I’m glad powerful art is being used to address the issues that trolls make fun of,” one person wrote. “Hoping more displays like this come out to trigger the masses in a positive way.”

Lake Street Church has staged politically themed Nativity scenes before.

CJ Doyle, head of the Catholic Action League, said he was furious about this year’s scene after receiving complaints from local residents.","Leaders at St. Susanna’s Parish said they will keep the “ICE was here” sign in a half-empty manger outside of the church despite condemnation from some catholic leaders and community members.

Statues of Jesus, Mary and Joseph are missing from the Dedham church’s annual nativity scene this year. In their place was the sign about ICE, implying that immigration agents had taken the religious icons.

Below it was a smaller sign that read “The Holy Family is safe in our Church ... If you see ICE please call LUCE at 617-370-5023.”

Father Stephen Josoma said he chose to focus the nativity on immigration after speaking with several of the refugee families the church has worked with in the past few years. Several of his congregants, who come from countries like Honduras, Guatemala and Afghanistan, expressed fear about what the stepped-up deportations could mean if they were sent back to the violence they fled.

“These are folks who carry a lot of scars with them. Some of them are physical scars, but most are emotional. They’ve seen their folks killed in front of them,” Josoma said.

He said the display is meant to show “the context Christmas is happening in this year,” adding that current immigration policies feel “brutal” and threaten the status of people who have already settled in the U.S.

The Archdiocese of Boston on Friday called the sign and missing figures a “politically divisive display” and said the parish should restore the créche to its “proper sacred purpose.”

“The people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging,” the statement read.

The Archdiocese also said St. Susanna did not request or receive permission for the display and said church norms “prohibit the use of sacred objects” for purposes other than worship.

A spokesperson for the Archdiocese, Terrence Donilon, pointed WBUR to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ long-standing statements on immigration, which call for more humane treatment of migrants — especially in detention — while also recognizing a country’s right to regulate its borders. The bishops oppose mass deportation and condemn dehumanizing rhetoric toward both immigrants and law enforcement.

This isn’t the first time St. Susanna’s has clashed with critics over its nativity messaging. For more than a decade, the parish has turned the display into a form of political art, tackling issues like gun control, climate change and other immigration policies.

In 2018, under Josoma’s leadership, the nativity featured a baby Jesus figure in a cage, protesting the Trump administration’s policy that separated immigrant families at the border.

CJ Doyle, head of the Catholic Action League, said he was furious about this year’s scene after receiving complaints from local residents. He accused the parish and Josoma of creating “sacrilegious” political theater.

“This is a case of a dissident priest who has a long history of these crackpot, publicity stunts,” Doyle said. “He’s politicizing Christmas, he’s exploiting the Holy Family, he’s trivializing it and he’s using his position as a pastor to promote his left-wing political ideology.”

Josoma rejected those criticisms, and said this is exactly the kind of moral witness churches should take up.

“I think the role of all churches is to speak out on issues, that’s what the Gospel is about,” he said. “How we treat the least among us is how we ultimately treat Christ.”

He said religious art is meant to provoke reflection, even discomfort, and that critics’ anger toward the display says more about people’s priorities than the installation itself.

“A lot of responses haven’t been anywhere near civil conversation,” he said. “If you ignore the facts, that’s fine, but you can’t have a real dialogue if you don’t accept the reality of what is there.”",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1205_nativity-scene-ice01-1920x1281.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 23:56:31.550481

On the morning of Thanksgiving, ICE agents detained a Vancouver father, Luis Ixchop, while he was out delivering food with his partner.","VANCOUVER, Wash. — A Vancouver family worries their loved one was run over by federal agents as they arrested him in the middle of a busy street on Thursday.

Cell phone video captured by a driver stuck in traffic behind the immigration officers partially captured the incident. It happened on East 4th Plain Boulevard and Z Street.

Carmen Paniagua and her husband, Ulysses, told KGW that the man seen being detained in the video is Ulysses' brother, 27-year-old Jose Paniagua Calderon. They were told Thursday that Jose's car had been found somewhere in town by a family friend.

""My husband came over here to double check that it was his car, and that's how we confirmed that it was him because he had a little work hat and everything,"" Carmen Paniagua said. ""So, he confirmed that it was, and then, I don't know where, we started seeing the videos that were circulating on the Internet.""

Paniagua said that Calderon had just gotten off of work when he was surrounded in traffic by federal agents. They broke his car window, dragged him to the ground, and one of the agents then got into the driver's seat of his car.

In a video circulating on social media and provided to KGW, multiple SUVs are stopped in the middle of a busy street. Several masked federal law enforcement officers can be seen standing around.

At first, Calderon can't be clearly seen, as he is seated on the pavement in between two vehicles. One of the officers can be seen to get in one of the vehicles and begin to drive it forward. Then, Calderon starts screaming.

Editor's note: The video embedded below is graphic and may be difficult for some viewers.

""You could see how the car goes like up and down on his leg, and then you just hear him screaming and in so much pain,"" said Paniagua. ""Like, when we heard his scream, that broke all of us — and I'm pretty sure that even the people that are not his family felt bad.""

Seconds later, officers pick Calderon up and put him in the back of the other vehicle. It's at this point that his face and body become visible.

""They didn't even give him the medical attention that he needed right there and then, because in the video you could clearly see how his leg is twisted,"" Paniagua said. ""So we honestly think it might have broke or something.""

Paniagua said Calderon was quickly taken to the ICE detention facility up in Tacoma, and they worry that he still has not received proper medical care.

""They're abusing their power, they're just being racist — they're treating us like animals,"" Paniagua said. ""We want this to be known because we want justice for him. We want them to be accountable for what they did to him, because no human should be treated worse than an animal.""

The Vancouver Police Department initially indicated that they'd heard about the incident, but no one had filed a report. Late Friday afternoon, VPD put out a statement saying they'd be taking a closer look.

""The Vancouver Police Department learned of this incident via a video that appeared to be taken with a cell phone of the ICE arrest that was subsequently circulated by community members. The video appears to show that the arrested person’s foot may have been struck by an ICE agent’s vehicle during the arrest.

""Based on the information regarding a vehicle that is alleged to have struck a person within the city limits of Vancouver, per our policy, the Vancouver Police Department will be conducting a traffic investigation to determine the facts.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not yet responded to a request for information.

On the morning of Thanksgiving, ICE agents detained a Vancouver father, Luis Ixchop, while he was out delivering food with his partner. Ixchop has high blood pressure, and his partner said that he'd been hospitalized after the arrest.

In a statement they released later regarding Ixchop's arrest, ICE said in part:

""It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody and provides each detainee with medical, dental, and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.""

The Paniaguas said that they didn't want to talk about the details of Calderon's legal status, but they said he'd been in Vancouver for about five years and worked to provide for his elderly parents in Mexico.

""He doesn't have a crime; he doesn't have bad habits. He's a guy who his hobby is going to church and playing guitar. He wasn't doing anything bad,"" said Paniagua.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/a90c9637-a214-4027-85f8-a6848efd15c9/20251206T011519/a90c9637-a214-4027-85f8-a6848efd15c9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 01:57:49.150915

In a video statement posted on X, Grijalva said it happened as local Tucsonans gathered to stop a group of roughly 40 ICE agents, many of them masked and in several vehicles, stationed in the middle of a street near a restaurant she frequents.

Grijalva said she was ""sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent, pushed around by others."" She added, ""I literally was not being aggressive, I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress.""

Department for Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin denied Grijalva's account, saying instead that the congresswoman was ""in the vicinity"" of another person who was pepper-sprayed as they obstructed and assaulted law enforcement.

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel. But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper-sprayed,"" McLaughlin said.

“Presenting one’s self as a 'member of Congress' doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement,"" she added.

McLaughlin also said that two law enforcement officers ""were seriously injured"" during the incident.

A spokesperson for Tucson Police Department, Ofc. Frank Magos, said that ICE had served a federal search warrant at Taco Giro, a local restaurant on Friday morning, and ""federal tactical resources responded to extract federal investigative special agents from the area where community had gathered.""

Federal agents deployed ""chemical munitions"" and called for emergency support from Tucson police to make their way out of the area, Magos said.

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero and Vice Mayor Lane Santa Cruz said in a joint statement Friday that federal special agents had conducted a raid in the city that ""rapidly escalated into violence against the public.""

""Under the Trump administration, unidentified federal agents often intentionally wear clothing with vague words like ‘police’ to purposefully confuse the public,"" the pair of city officials said.

""Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated,"" they added.

Grijalva said that she identified herself as a member of Congress, and saw ""people directly sprayed,"" including press and members of her staff.

""The biggest problem that we have in this community is that we have Trump that has no regard for any due process, the rule of law, the Constitution,"" Grijalva said. ""They're literally disappearing people from the streets.""

The first Trump administration stalled the process for revising the racial and ethnic data standards in time for the 2020 census.
Advocates of the changes, however, see the new categories and other revisions as long-needed updates to better reflect people's identities.","A Trump administration official on Friday signaled a potential rollback of the racial and ethnic categories approved for the 2030 census and other future federal government forms.

Supporters of those categories fear that any last-minute modifications to the U.S. government's standards for data about race and ethnicity could hurt the accuracy of census data and other future statistics used for redrawing voting districts, enforcing civil rights protections and guiding policymaking.

Those standards were last revised in 2024 during the Biden administration, after Census Bureau research and public discussion.

A White House agency at the time approved, among other changes, new checkboxes for ""Middle Eastern or North African"" and ""Hispanic or Latino"" under a reformatted question that asks survey participants: ""What is your race and/or ethnicity?"" The revisions also require the federal government to stop automatically categorizing people who identify with Middle Eastern or North African groups as white.

But at a Friday meeting of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics in Washington, D.C., the chief statistician within the White House's Office of Management and Budget revealed that the Trump administration has started a new review of those standards and how the 2024 revisions were approved.

""We're still at the very beginning of a review. And this, again, is not prejudging any particular outcome. I think we just wanted to be able to take a look at the process and decide where we wanted to end up on a number of these questions,"" said Mark Calabria. ""I've certainly heard a wide range of views within the administration. So it's just premature to say where we'll end up.""

OMB's press office did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.

Calabria's comments mark the first public confirmation that Trump officials are considering the possibility of not using the latest racial and ethnic category changes and other revisions. They come amid the administration's attack on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, a push to stop producing data that could protect the rights of transgender people and threats to the reliability of federal statistics.

In September, OMB said those Biden-era revisions ""continue to be in effect"" when it announced a six-month extension to the 2029 deadline for federal agencies to follow the new standards when collecting data on race and ethnicity.

Calabria said the delay gave agencies more time to implement the changes ""while we review.""

The first Trump administration stalled the process for revising the racial and ethnic data standards in time for the 2020 census.

The ""Project 2025"" policy agenda released by The Heritage Foundation, the conservative, D.C.-based think tank, called for a Republican administration to ""thoroughly review any changes"" to census race and ethnicity questions because of ""concerns among conservatives that the data under Biden Administration proposals could be skewed to bolster progressive political agendas.""

Advocates of the changes, however, see the new categories and other revisions as long-needed updates to better reflect people's identities.

""At stake is a more accurate and deeper understanding of the communities that comprise our country,"" says Meeta Anand, senior director of census and data equity at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. ""I am not concerned if it's reviewed in an honest attempt to understand what the process was. I am concerned if it's for a predetermined outcome that would be to ignore the entire process that was done in a very transparent manner.""

Grijalva, Arizona’s first Latina congresswoman, has been a fierce critic of immigration enforcement activity in her district.","Arizona’s U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva was involved in a clash with federal agents during a protest of immigration raids in west Tucson Friday, during which she claims she was hit with pepper spray.

According to a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency partnered with the Internal Revenue Service to carry out as many as 16 warrants in southern Arizona in a “years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations.” In videos posted to social media by community advocates, several masked federal agents in tactical gear can be seen near the westside location of popular Mexican seafood and grill restaurant Taco Giro.

The raids prompted a protest and federal agents deployed tear gas and pepper spray against the crowd. The Arizona Daily Star reported that multiple employees who live near the west Tucson restaurant were detained. At least one protester was among those taken into custody by federal agents. AZ Family reported that Taco Giro locations in north Tucson, Casa Grande and Vail were also targeted. ICE spokesman Fernando Burgos-Ortiz confirmed to the Arizona Mirror that multiple people were arrested, but didn’t clarify how many or confirm claims that agents had pepper-sprayed a sitting U.S. Congresswoman.

Tricia McLaughlin, the spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, dismissed Grijalva’s account. McLaughlin accused Grijalva of hindering the work of federal agents and appeared to question Grijalva’s claim that she was pepper-sprayed by highlighting her lack of visible physical reaction in the video.

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel,” McLaughlin wrote. “But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone who *was* pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement. In fact, 2 law enforcement officers were seriously injured by this mob that (Grijalva) joined. Presenting one’s self as a ‘Member of Congress’ doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement.”

Tucson Sentinel reporter Paul Ingram, who was on-the-ground covering the ICE raid and protest, reported that federal agents shot pepper spray into his face and eye, even though he was clearly identified as a member of the press.

A video from Univision reporter Óscar Gómez shows federal agents shooting pepper spray directly into the faces of protesters, with Grijalva in close proximity. An agent is then seen coming after Gómez directly, covering his camera with pepper spray, even as Gómez appeared to be backing away.

The large-scale raid of several Taco Giros in Southern Arizona is the second time this year a restaurant chain was the subject of an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations, a division within ICE, that ensnared multiple employees who lack legal immigration status.

In July, federal agents raided Colt Grill BBQ and Spirits locations in Northern Arizona. The operation was the culmination of a multi-year investigation into a money laundering and labor exploitation scheme. Along with the husband-and-wife owners of the Northern Arizona restaurants, and two undocumented immigrants who were involved in recruiting and exploiting other immigrant workers, several more undocumented employees were also arrested.

In a video posted to her X account, Grijalva described as many as 40 agents gathered at the westside location she visited with her staff for lunch, and said that she was treated with hostility even after identifying herself as a member of Congress.

“I was here, this is like the restaurant I come to literally once a week, and was sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent, pushed around by others when I literally was not being aggressive,” she said. “I was asking for clarification which is my right as a member of Congress.”

A video of the incident posted to Grijalva’s social media accounts shows a federal agent spraying several bursts of pepper spray directly at demonstrators in the street, close to where Grijalva is standing. Grijalva’s staffer jumps in front of her. Coughing can be heard offscreen. Later in the video, a pepper ball appears to explode inches from Grijalva’s feet as she walks away.

Grijalva, Arizona’s first Latina congresswoman, has been a fierce critic of immigration enforcement activity in her district. Earlier this week, she publicly condemned a Border Patrol raid of a humanitarian group’s migrant aid station in the desert on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, criticizing it as an example of President Donald Trump’s “cruel (and) unconstitutional” mass deportation agenda.

In a statement issued shortly after she said she was pepper-sprayed, Grijalva said her office was working to get more information on Friday’s immigration arrests.

“Our residents deserve to know whether these raids are targeting genuine public safety threats – or law-abiding neighbors who have called our communities home for decades,” she wrote. “ICE has become a lawless agency under this Administration – operating with no transparency, no accountability, and open disregard for basic due process.”

While Trump administration officials have time and again emphasized their intent to detain the “worst of the worst”, many of the immigrants that ICE has arrested during Trump’s second term have no criminal record. A June survey of people in immigration detainment facilities at the time found that nearly half, 47%, lacked any criminal history and fewer than 30% of them had been convicted of crimes.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, the state’s top legal officer, denounced the incident on social media. In a post on X, the Democrat, who has long criticized Trump’s immigration enforcement tactics, called the incident “unacceptable and outrageous.”

“Enforcing the rule of law does not mean pepper spraying a member of Congress for simply asking questions,” Mayes wrote. “Effective law enforcement requires restraint and accountability, not unchecked aggression.”

Grijalva voiced concern for how federal officials interact with people who don’t have her authority, in light of how she was mistreated on Friday.

“While I am fine, if that is the way they treat me, how are they treating other community members who do not have the same privileges and protections that I do?” she questioned, in her written statement.

Armstrong said this is the first case their firm has handled where someone gets detained at a USCIS interview, but they have feared this could happen more often.

Lexi Celis, a U.S. citizen, said her husband’s arrest has devastated their family.

“For all the people who think that they’re just getting criminals, I am an example of them tearing our family apart,” Lexi Celis said.

She never imagined anything like this would happen to her family.

“I just feel betrayed. I feel no U.S. citizen should have to go through this,” she said.

Jair Celis was at the final step of his immigration process when ICE detained him at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Salt Lake City on Tuesday.

“We’ve tried to do everything the right way, we have, and he’s not here,” Celis said.

Armstrong, representing the family, argued that Celis’ case contradicts the federal government’s stated focus on arresting only dangerous individuals.

“Jair’s case shows that the rhetoric that we’re going after the worst of the worst, that’s not true,” he said. “Lexi and JR have been married, lawfully married, and have filled out the proper paperwork to apply for residency for Jair. He entered when he was a young child on a visa, and so he had a legal entry into the country, which allows him to adjust status here in the United States.”

2 News reached out to both USCIS and ICE for comment and asked why Celis was detained. But the agencies did not respond in time for this report.

Armstrong said ICE has the authority to arrest anyone without lawful status, even inside a USCIS office.

2 News asked, under what circumstances can an applicant be detained at an interview?

Armstrong said, “Any applicant who's out of status, this is any person, whether they're applying at USCIS, or they're just out on the street. If they are not in a legal status to be here.”

Armstrong believes in the Jair Celis case, “It’s such a colossal waste of U.S. government taxpayer money, and the ICE agents’ time and effort to take into custody somebody who otherwise would have received a green card or been approved for a green card that exact day.”

Immigration attorneys said they believe arrest numbers may rise.

“We believe the presidential administration is putting heavy pressure on ICE in Utah,” said Armstrong.

“I believe it is to sow fear among the immigrant community,” he added.

However, there are some protections for certain immigrants depending on their status.

“If you have DACA or you have TPS, which is Temporary Protected Status, or you are awaiting a hearing on an asylum, and you have a work permit, you do have protections,” he explained.

As for Lexi Celis, she said she just wants her husband home.

“I want him to be home before Christmas.”

On Dec. 5, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to President Trump’s executive order limiting birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment

Birthright Citizenship Case

On December 5, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to President Trump’s Executive Order 14,160, which seeks to limit birthright citizenship. The order provides that children born in the U.S. to parents who are either unlawfully present or temporarily in the country would not be recognized as U.S. citizens.

The consolidated cases — including Trump v. Washington and Trump v. CASA, Inc. — ask the Court to determine whether this policy complies with the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment and 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a). Lower courts previously blocked the order, finding it inconsistent with longstanding interpretations of the Constitution.

Looking Ahead

Until the Court issues a ruling, current law remains unchanged: children born in the U.S. are citizens regardless of parental status.

Background Information

President Trump issued Executive Order 14,160 on January 20, 2025, seeking to restrict birthright citizenship by excluding children born in the U.S. to parents who are undocumented or temporarily present. Federal courts quickly blocked the order, extending injunctions throughout 2025 while litigation proceeded. In September 2025, the Supreme Court issued a separate ruling clarifying the limits of nationwide injunctions, which shaped how lower courts can block federal policies in immigration cases.

Instead, the judge rejected a government request to dismiss a class-action challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.
Judge Sooknanan found that the law did not give the administration the power to hold detainees designated for deportation at offshore military bases.
At a hearing in October, Judge Sooknanan pointedly asked a government lawyer whether it was the Trump administration’s position that it could house detainees designated for deportation at any overseas base.
Judge Sooknanan also faulted the structure at Guantánamo, which for a time held migrants profiled as “low threat” in a prison that formerly held suspected Qaeda members.","A federal judge ruled on Friday that the Trump administration exceeded its authority in holding migrants designated for deportation at the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

But Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., stopped short of ordering Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, to shut down the detention operation there.

Instead, the judge rejected a government request to dismiss a class-action challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. A lawyer for the A.C.L.U. said the legal group would soon seek a closure order.

Judge Sooknanan found that the law did not give the administration the power to hold detainees designated for deportation at offshore military bases.

While successive administrations have for decades housed migrants at Guantánamo who have been intercepted at sea trying to reach the United States, Judge Sooknanan found that never before had the U.S. government used the base to hold people being deported from the United States.

The White House began using Guantánamo as a way station for deportees in February after an order from President Trump to prepare the base to hold up to 30,000 migrants. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have held about 710 detainees there, all men, with support from hundreds of U.S. soldiers and Marines.

No migrants have been there since mid-October, when the department sent 18 men with final deportation orders from the base to El Salvador and Guatemala, then ceased operations before Hurricane Melissa.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a question on whether the administration would still be sending immigration detainees who are designated for deportation to the base. The Justice Department also did not respond to a request for a comment.

Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the A.C.L.U., said his group would now try to stop that for good.

“The court squarely rejected the Trump administration’s legal claim that Congress gave it the extraordinary power to detain immigrants in military bases overseas,” Mr. Gelernt said. “We will now move promptly to end the policy based on this legal ruling.”

The A.C.L.U. challenged the policy using the names of two men who were deported through the base, and framing it as a class-action lawsuit. They argued that detainees are held there in a form of limbo between deportation and detention on U.S. soil, where they have greater rights.

At a hearing in October, Judge Sooknanan pointedly asked a government lawyer whether it was the Trump administration’s position that it could house detainees designated for deportation at any overseas base.

“I don’t see why not,” replied August E. Flentje, a senior Justice Department lawyer.

Judge Sooknanan’s ruling found that “before the Guantánamo-detention policy at issue here, the United States had never run a detention facility outside of the United States for individuals subject to removal orders.” She added, “The unprecedented nature of this claim of authority is another clue that the reading of the statutory scheme is wrong.”

She ordered government and A.C.L.U. lawyers to discuss next steps at a status conference on Thursday.

Judge Sooknanan also faulted the structure at Guantánamo, which for a time held migrants profiled as “low threat” in a prison that formerly held suspected Qaeda members.

For the most part, the low-threat detainees were held in a more communal barracks facility. But some were consolidated into the prison earlier this year during a water outage in the area of the barracks.

The judge opened her decision by calling the military installation with more than 4,000 residents, including Navy families, “the site of one of our country’s most notorious detention facilities.”

“Over two decades ago, it was opened to hold suspected terrorists in the aftermath of the horrific terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,” she wrote. “Since then, Guantánamo has been synonymous with pervasive mistreatment and indefinite detention.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/07/multimedia/05dc-gitmo-migrants/dc-gitmo8-tvlq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 21:56:26.178972

Adelita Grijalva said Friday she was pepper-sprayed and pushed around during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in Tucson, Arizona, a claim that the Department of Homeland Security swiftly disputed.
“I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress,” she said.
But they’re not true.
She was in the vicinity of someone who *was* pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement,” McLaughlin said.
“In fact, 2 law enforcement officers were seriously injured by this mob that @Rep_Grijalva joined.","Rep. Adelita Grijalva said Friday she was pepper-sprayed and pushed around during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in Tucson, Arizona, a claim that the Department of Homeland Security swiftly disputed.

The Arizona Democrat said in a video on X the incident occurred near a restaurant she frequents and that she came upon a scene of “maybe 40 ICE agents, most of them masked, in several vehicles” who had been “stopped” in the street by people who she said “were afraid they were taking people without due process.”

Grijalva said she “was sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent” and “pushed around by others,” even though she said she had not been aggressive. “I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress,” she said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokeswoman, said on X in a response to the congresswoman’s video that the claims are “not true.”

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel. But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone who *was* pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement,” McLaughlin said.

“In fact, 2 law enforcement officers were seriously injured by this mob that @Rep_Grijalva joined. Presenting one’s self as a ‘Member of Congress’ doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement.”

Speaking to CNN’s Laura Coates later Friday evening, Grijalva dismissed McLaughlin’s account, saying, “It’s convenient to them to make it seem as if I was doing anything other than inquiring about what was happening.”

Earlier Friday, Grijalva posted a second video to X that shows uniformed officials spraying into a crowd of people, including what appear to be protesters, Grijalva and her staff. Grijalva can be seen saying, “You guys need to calm down and get out.”

The congresswoman said in the first video she posted that once she introduced herself as a member of Congress, she assumed it would have been calmer, “but there was literally only one person that was trying to speak to me in any kind of civil tone, and everyone else was being rude and disrespectful.”

“I just can only imagine if they’re going to treat me like that, how they’re treating everybody else,” she said.

Grijalva denounced the Trump administration’s handling of immigration enforcement.

“I think that this is one of the problems – the biggest problem that we have in this community is that we have Trump that has no regard for any due process, the rule of law, the Constitution,” Grijalva said in the video. “They’re literally disappearing people from the streets. They arrested two people. We have no idea where they’re going.”

By the time she arrived, she said, the protesters had “stopped” a squadron of dozens of mostly masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.
The protesters, Grijalva said, were “afraid that they were taking people without due process”.
“When I presented myself as a Member of Congress asking for more information, I was pushed aside and pepper sprayed,” she wrote.
In a statement, DHS said immigration agents’ actions were not aimed at the representative.","Adelita Grijalva, an Arizona congressperson, said she was “sprayed in the face” during a protest against a federal immigration raid at a Mexican restaurant in Tucson on Friday.

In a video filmed after the incident, Grijalva said she joined a group of protesters assembled outside Taco Giro, a “small mom-and-pop” restaurant in Tucson Grijalva said she visits weekly. By the time she arrived, she said, the protesters had “stopped” a squadron of dozens of mostly masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

The protesters, Grijalva said, were “afraid that they were taking people without due process”.

A second video shared by Grijalva’s official account on social media shows a chaotic standoff between federal agents in tactical gear and protesters carrying anti-ICE signs. In the footage, Grijalva, a progressive Democratic representative, who has been sharply critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policy, can be seen approaching the officers, as an agent sprays an orange chemical in the direction of the protesters alongside her. She then urges the officers to “calm down” and “get out” as she coughs. The agent holding a spray can orders the group to “get out of the way” as protestors yell.

In a video clip taken from another angle, a projectile lands behind Grijalva, producing a cloud at the her feet as she steps toward an officer.

“When I presented myself as a Member of Congress asking for more information, I was pushed aside and pepper sprayed,” she wrote.

In a statement, DHS said immigration agents’ actions were not aimed at the representative.

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel,” the DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said. “But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone who was pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement.”

McLaughlin said two law enforcement officers were “seriously injured” during the clash.

“Presenting one’s self as a ‘Member of Congress’ doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement,” she added, promising “more information forthcoming”.

In a statement, Fernando Burgos, an ICE spokesperson, said special agents as well as officers from the agency’s homeland security investigations were “executing 16 search warrants” across southern Arizona as part of a “years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations”. Multiple individuals were taken into custody during the operation, he said.

In a video filmed shortly after the incident, Grijalva, still coughing, says she arrived on the scene because she believed it was “important for me to have eyes on what’s happening here”.

“I literally was not being aggressive, I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress,” she said, adding: “I just can only imagine if they’re going to treat me like that, how they’re treating everybody else.”

Grijalva and other local officials praised the Tucson police department for helping to calm the situation.

In a joint statement, Regina Romero, the Tucson mayor and Lane Santa Cruz, the vice-mayor, both Democrats, said the enforcement operation in Tucson had “rapidly escalated into violence against the public”.

“Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated,” they wrote, encouraging bystanders to share video and photographs of the incident for “potential investigation and follow-up”.

Arizona Democrats rallied around Grijalva. The representative Greg Stanton denounced the incident as “outrageous” while the representative Yassamin Ansari called it “absolutely unacceptable”. Senator Ruben Gallego wrote: “Pepper-spraying a sitting member of Congress is disgraceful, unacceptable, and absolutely not what we voted for. Period.”

At a town hall in Tucson later that day, senator Mark Kelly called it “horrific”.

Grijalva was elected to Congress in September, winning a special election to fill the seat left vacant by the death of her father, the late representative Raúl Grijalva. However, she was not sworn in as a member of Congress until last month, after the House returned from a weeks-long recess during the federal government shutdown.

“If federal agents are brazen enough to fire pellets directly at a Member of Congress,” Grijalva wrote on Friday, “imagine how they behave when encountering defenseless members of our community.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7dd602269aed7c32c9ba1830daac6a49f601b6/667_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0607474e9d23902e6e526e11a7d12558",N,,2025-12-05 20:57:31.663962

Asked for a response, Bovino, who on Friday afternoon was walking with masked federal agents down Martinique Avenue in Kenner, didn't commit to any changes in his approach.
Earlier this week, Moreno and City Council members unveiled a portal for residents to report human rights violations by federal agents engaged in the operation.
Meanwhile, local Republican officials in Jefferson Parish and Kenner – where most of the first sweeps have occurred – have been silent or supportive of the operation.
“It is more than likely, on this particular issue in the Greater New Orleans area, that New Orleans will stand alone,” said City Council President JP Morrell.","New Orleans Mayor-elect Helena Moreno on Friday demanded that federal agents be more transparent about New Orleans-area immigration sweeps, amid reports that people across the region – including U.S. citizens and others with work permits – have been detained without cause and treated inhumanely.

Flanked by U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, National Urban League CEO and former Mayor Marc Morial and other local business and civic leaders, Moreno called on U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino to disclose basic information about the number of stops and arrests agents make, including the legal basis, criminal charges and warrants for each arrest.

She also demanded that agents remove masks and show clear identification when enforcing federal laws, show clear probable cause for their arrests, provide legal representation and medical care to detainees and allow detainees to notify their families.

“Our points are just very simple,” Moreno said at a Friday press conference. “They're centered around communication, transparency, accountability and upholding people's constitutional rights. I don't believe that we're asking for too much here.”

Moreno on Friday sent a letter to Bovino with her demands, which also included a request for safeguards against racial profiling.

Asked for a response, Bovino, who on Friday afternoon was walking with masked federal agents down Martinique Avenue in Kenner, didn't commit to any changes in his approach.

“I think this is about as transparent as it gets right here,” Bovino said.

The comments by Moreno and others represented the strongest local pushback to the sweeping federal immigration operation to date, though Moreno and other public officials conceded they have little authority to compel federal authorities to comply with their demands.

Earlier this week, Moreno and City Council members unveiled a portal for residents to report human rights violations by federal agents engaged in the operation. And the mayor-elect has criticized the effort publicly for days, saying New Orleans would be better served if the federal government sent resources so New Orleans can hire more federal prosecutors and social workers, create a police DNA lab, or help domestic violence victims.

Federal officials have said the intention is to target ""criminal illegal aliens"" who are public safety threats, but New Orleans officials on Friday said they don't buy it, since documents leaked to the Associated Press indicate the operation mission includes an arrest quota of 5,000 people.

“Citizens have already been profiled because of the color of their skin, chased, hunted and workers have even stared down the barrel of a rifle just trying to do their jobs,” said Sarah Whittington, advocacy director for ACLU Louisiana, who joined Moreno and others on Frday.

Moreno said her office fielded a call shortly before the briefing from the family of a detainee looking for help in locating their relative. Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy, which provides free legal assistance to immigrants, has been contacted by the loved ones of 15 detainees, including some whose locations aren’t known, said Homero Lopez, the group’s director.

Lopez said a majority of those clients either have legal status or are in the process of obtaining legal status in cooperation with immigration authorities.

“What we are hearing from our clients is exactly what we have seen happen in other cities. Folks are being arrested indiscriminately, targeted for the color of their skin, the language they speak, the location where they are working,” Lopez said.

The mayor-elect also warned that New Orleans will suffer economically so long as day laborers and service industry workers – whether they reside in or outside city limits – are afraid to go to work.

“This operation is actually causing harm for the city of New Orleans, and it's causing harm for people beyond those who are being targeted. We have businesses that are closing. We have workers afraid to show up. And ultimately, there is an economic impact,” Moreno said.

Morial, meanwhile, said the images of masked federal agents “remind me of the tactics of the Ku Klux Klan.”

“I do not suggest that (immigration agents) are the Ku Klux Klan, but in this country, there is zero precedent for sworn law enforcement officers to mask themselves to carry out public enforcement actions,” Morial said.

He pointed out that lacking documentation is, by itself, a civil violation and not a crime. He said “the civil rights community” will take legal action over constitutional violations.

Carter, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he plans to call for a committee hearing to be held in New Orleans, which he said would force Trump administration officials to “directly address these pressing issues in the light of day and in the presence of the people most affected.”

Moreno said she believes “the politics of all this is starting to turn.”

“Even very conservative folks within our city, within our region, are believing that this is a step too far, that this has gone well beyond what it ever needed to be. That is why it is also so important that we are on the record with our demands,” Moreno said.

Moreno did not identify who she was referring to.

Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill, both Republicans, have shown unwavering support for the immigration sweeps. Murrill on Friday issued a letter instructing New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick to “immediately” order NOPD cooperation with immigration agents, or else risk violating a 2024 state requiring local police to use “best efforts to support the enforcement of federal immigration law.

Meanwhile, local Republican officials in Jefferson Parish and Kenner – where most of the first sweeps have occurred – have been silent or supportive of the operation.

“It is more than likely, on this particular issue in the Greater New Orleans area, that New Orleans will stand alone,” said City Council President JP Morrell.

State Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, issued a statement claiming Evers’ veto means commission decisions “can never be questioned by anyone.”","Gov. Tony Evers vetoed a host of Republican bills Friday, including legislation barring undocumented immigrants from getting federal health care funding.

In his veto message, Evers accused GOP lawmakers of passing a bill to prevent “problems they admit do not exist, all for the sake of trying to push polarizing political rhetoric.”

The state Senate passed the bill in November. It would ban any public money from going toward health care coverage for people in the country illegally. Wisconsin law already prevents undocumented individuals from enrolling in BadgerCare, Wisconsin’s version of the federal Medicaid insurance program. But Republicans said they were concerned the state Department of Health Services may try to change that through what’s called an administrative rule change.

In his Friday veto message, Evers noted Republicans who passed the bill knew state law already prevents undocumented residents from enrolling in BadgerCare.

“These basic but important admissions by its own co-authors underscore that Republicans’ decision to pass this bill was more about being inflammatory, stoking fear, and sowing division than it was about accomplishing any significant policy outcome or being prudent stewards of taxpayer dollars,” said Evers.

In an interview with WPR, Rep. Alex Dallman, R-Markesan, the bill’s coauthor, said he was confused about why Evers’ veto message was “so strong” when the measure passed with votes from three Democrats in the state Senate. He claimed the “far left” is taking over the Democratic Party across the county, including Evers.

“It’s just unfortunate that Evers, who claims to be more middle-of-the-road as a governor, once again proves he’s looking out for the far left,” Dallman said. “And he’s going to veto a bill that could protect our hard-working taxpayer dollars.”

Dallman said Republicans are concerned about DHS trying to create rule allowing undocumented immigrants to enroll in BadgerCare due to a July Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that gave state agencies more power to enact rules without legislators blocking them.

Other vetoes include bills to ban guaranteed income programs, allow for more election lawsuits

In all, Evers vetoed nine bills passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature. They comprised a wide range of topics from building codes, higher education, election complaints and federal healthcare funding.

The governor vetoed legislation that would have made wide-ranging changes to unemployment benefits and prevented local governments from creating guaranteed income programs. Evers said he objected to lawmakers trying to restrict local control.

Evers also rejected a Republican bill aimed at making it easier for people to go to court if they have election complaints dismissed by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The legislation came after the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s liberal majority said a complainant appealing a WEC decision didn’t have legal standing. State Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, issued a statement claiming Evers’ veto means commission decisions “can never be questioned by anyone.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1344-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 19:56:36.575193

Texas can use a redrawn congressional map that adds as many as five Republican-friendly congressional districts, the supreme court ruled yesterday, handing Donald Trump a major win in his push to boost Republican seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

In an unsigned order, the 6-3 conservative-majority court granted a request by Texas to lift a lower court’s ruling that struck down the state’s new map in November. The supreme court’s three liberal justices dissented.

“The district court improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections,” the supreme court said in an order explaining its decision.

What did the lower court rule?

Pentagon announces it has killed four men in another boat strike in Pacific

The Pentagon announced yesterday that the US military had conducted another deadly strike on a boat suspected of carrying illegal narcotics, killing four men in the eastern Pacific, as questions mount over the legality of the attacks.

The US southern command, based in Florida, posted video of the new strike on social media with a statement saying that at the direction of Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, “Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel in international waters operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization”.

The footage showed a large explosion suddenly overtaking a small boat as it moved through the water, followed by an image of a vessel in flames and dark smoke streaming overhead.

Why was the boat targeted? “Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was carrying illicit narcotics and transiting along a known narco-trafficking route in the eastern Pacific. Four male narco-terrorists aboard the vessel were killed,” the statement said.

EU leaders race to save Ukraine funding deal as Kyiv’s cash runs low

Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, will meet the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, for emergency talks today as the EU tries to save its sorely needed financing plan for Ukraine.

With Russia’s attacks intensifying, Washington pushing for a peace deal that favours Moscow, Kyiv fast running out of money and Europe struggling for influence at US-led talks, the bloc must find a solution or suffer a major blow to its credibility.

What else is happening? Vladimir Putin is visiting Delhi for a summit with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. It comes as Washington seeks to increase pressure on India to cut back trade with Russia. It is the first time Putin has visited India since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and marks another step for him on the international stage since starting a war that has turned Russia into a global pariah.

end of list

Several lower courts have blocked as unconstitutional Trump’s attempt to put restrictions on the law that states that anyone born on US soil is automatically an American citizen.

Trump signed an executive order on January 20, his first day in office, decreeing that children born to parents in the US illegally or on temporary visas would not automatically become US citizens.

Lower courts have ruled the order to be a violation of the 14th Amendment, which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

Trump’s executive order was premised on the idea that anyone in the US illegally, or on a visa, was not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the country, and therefore excluded from this category.

The Supreme Court rejected such a narrow definition in a landmark 1898 case.

The Trump administration has also argued that the 14th Amendment, passed in the wake of the Civil War, addresses the rights of former slaves and not the children of undocumented migrants or temporary US visitors.

In a brief with the court, Trump’s solicitor general, John Sauer, argued that “the erroneous extension of birthright citizenship to the children of illegal aliens has caused substantial harm to the United States”.

“Most obviously, it has impaired the United States’ territorial integrity by creating a strong incentive for illegal immigration,” Sauer said.

Trump’s executive order had been due to come into effect on February 19, but it was halted after federal judges ruled against the administration in multiple lawsuits.

District Judge John Coughenour, who heard the case in Washington state, described the president’s executive order as “blatantly unconstitutional”.

Conservatives hold a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court, and three of the justices were appointed by Trump.

Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has spearheaded the legal challenges to the attempt to end birthright citizenship, said she is hopeful the top court will “strike down this harmful order once and for all”.

“Federal courts around the country have consistently rejected President Trump’s attempts to strip away this core constitutional protection,” Wang said.

“The president’s action goes against a core American right that has been a part of our Constitution for over 150 years.”

The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year, allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality.

Among these policies were Trump’s revocation of temporary legal protections on humanitarian grounds for hundreds of thousands of migrants, deportations of migrants to countries other than their own and domestic immigration enforcement raids.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25328704047319-1764974554.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-05 18:58:06.590083

I’m a US citizen.” “He did not care at all,” Guzman said to the station.
The Trump administration told WWL that it had deployed immigration agents across New Orleans-area communities including Marrero as part of an operation focused on violent offenders illegally residing in the US.
Guzman’s stepfather told WWL that he ordered the agents who had been pursuing her off their property.
Guzman said she couldn’t help but believe the agents who chased her might be “racially profiling all people of color”.","A US citizen who was seen on home security video being chased by masked federal agents outside New Orleans amid the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration crackdown says she surmises that she was pursued because “I’m brown”.

“I have no idea why they targeted me,” Jacelynn Guzman told the Guardian reporting partner WWL Louisiana on Thursday, a day after the video in question was taken and subsequently went viral online.

“That’s honestly all I can think of … It makes me scared for my family. It’s devastating.”

Asked for comment about Guzman’s remarks, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson issued a statement saying she matched the description of someone who was being sought by border patrol agents in connection with a deportation order.

The statement, provided on Friday, said agents ultimately determined Guzman “was not the target” and then departed the area without making arrests.

Guzman’s case nonetheless provided the public with a stark glimpse into the tactics being used by immigration agents who descended on Louisiana’s most populous city as well as the surrounding region with a goal of making 5,000 arrests in the coming weeks.

As the 22-year-old Guzman put it to WWL, she was walking back from a corner store near her home in Marrero, Louisiana, on Wednesday when an SUV pulled up next to her. More unmarked cars soon arrived, and men clad in masks and tactical gear poured out.

Guzman said she thought she was about to be kidnapped, and she sprinted toward her front door in plain view of a home security camera.

“Leave me alone!” she could be heard saying on the video, with at least one masked man running after her and two others trailing behind more slowly.

Guzman – whose family identifies as Hispanic – told WWL she had no idea why the men would approach her beside the fact that “I’m brown.” She said she had no criminal record and told one of the agents, “I was born and raised here. I’m a US citizen.”

“He did not care at all,” Guzman said to the station.

The Trump administration told WWL that it had deployed immigration agents across New Orleans-area communities including Marrero as part of an operation focused on violent offenders illegally residing in the US.

The DHS’s statement on Friday said the person for whom Guzman was mistaken had been previously charged with felony theft and convicted of illegal possession of stolen property. Neither are considered violent offenses under Louisiana law, though the statement – without naming the individual – referred to that person as a “public safety threat”.

The statement added that “agents identified themselves” during their encounter with Guzman. They ran toward Guzman’s home when she did, stopped “upon reaching the property”, and left when they realized she was not the person they were after, the DHS’s statement said.

Guzman’s stepfather told WWL that he ordered the agents who had been pursuing her off their property. The home security video at the center of Guzman’s case also captured him pointing at the agents and noting that at least one of them seemed Hispanic.

“Hispanic people against Hispanic people, bro!” he could be heard shouting.

Guzman said she couldn’t help but believe the agents who chased her might be “racially profiling all people of color”.

“It’s wrong,” she said to WWL.

By the time Guzman had spoken with the outlet, at least dozens of people had been arrested in the immigration sweep across the New Orleans area, plunging its immigrant communities into fear.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd0f28054645fd05ab4d56202420a6092b74ffe9/690_0_6895_5516/master/6895.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=92e4570302cdae7d1d6d65fa34e63e7a",N,,2025-12-05 17:58:36.259601

BYER",,,,,https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article313404644.html,"Noorzay urged Afghan community members to consult attorneys before attending any ICE appointments.
He said what federal officials are doing to Afghan residents is profiling, targeting people based on national origin and faith.
“This sends a wave of fear amongst this Afghan community and amongst every household,” Noorzay said.
On Thursday, Afghan residents in Arden Arcade reported immigration officials knocking on the doors of their homes, questioning them and promising to return.
The ICE officials instructed these Afghan residents to go to the downtown Sacramento field office for “same-day appointments,” but they were immediately detained.","Likely more than a dozen members of the Afghan community living in the Sacramento area have been detained by federal immigration agents as part of a nationwide crackdown on refugees from Afghanistan, according to community advocacy groups.

At least 12 immigrants from Afghanistan have been arrested since Monday during routine appointments at the downtown Sacramento field office for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly referred to as ICE. Many of the refugees live in the eastern suburbs of Sacramento, including Carmichael and Arden Arcade.

These arrests were reported by community groups, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Sacramento Valley/Central California said in a statement Wednesday. The community groups said they are worried the number of ICE arrests could be higher, because many families are afraid to tell others what happened to their loved ones.

“ICE is conducting a targeted, systematic campaign against our Afghan community using deceptive tactics,” Reshad Noorzay, executive director of CAIR-SV/CC, said in the news release “Community members are being called into ICE’s Sacramento office at 650 Capitol Mall for what they believe are routine appointments — and they’re being arrested the moment they walk through the door. This is entrapment. This is cruel. And this is happening right now in our community.”

Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Sacramento, organized a news conference Friday morning just outside the entrance of the John E. Moss federal building downtown, where immigration agents took Afghan residents into custody earlier this week. Matsui, joined by members of the CAIR and NorCal Resist community advocacy groups, called this week’s arrests “a serious escalation” by the Trump administration to target immigrant families.

“They have singled out entire communities with rhetoric that is reckless, dangerous and blatantly racist,” Matsui told reporters. “This is about people, human beings, our neighbors, families who came to this country seeking safety, many of whom were Afghan allies who stood with us at great personal risk and were promised safety in this country.”

The Sacramento Bee contacted ICE officials, who did not answer questions about the reported immigration arrests made in Sacramento this week or whether the federal agency is conducting other immigration enforcement of Afghan residents in the area.

Instead, ICE officials referred The Bee to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security news release issued Thursday that claimed the previous administration of President Joe Biden “created one of the worst and most complex national security crises in American history.”

“Under Secretary (Kristi) Noem, DHS has been going full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and criminal illegal aliens that came in through Biden’s fraudulent parole programs,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “When Joe Biden let 190,000 Afghan nationals in, they didn’t do criminal background checks or vet social media, someone just vouched for them and they took the words as truth.”

Former U.S. officials familiar with the Special Immigrant Visa process told The New York Times that the CIA had an intense vetting process for its partners during the war in Afghanistan, which included a requirement for Afghans to get current force members to vouch for them that put the reputation of their tribe or family on the line. The agency also kept extensive identifying biometric data, including retinal scans, on Afghans who served in its units.

Nationwide crackdown after shooting

CAIR said the ICE arrests in Sacramento were part of a nationwide immigration enforcement crackdown on immigrants from Afghanistan, a response from President Donald Trump after a shooting last week that killed one National Guard member and critically wounded another.

The New York Times obtained and reviewed internal documents that show the Trump administration is prioritizing the deportation of Afghan nationals, more than 1,800 of them throughout the country, previously ordered to leave the United States. The Times reported that the federal deportation efforts are part of a broader crackdown on refugees from Afghanistan after an Afghan national was accused of shooting the two National Guard troops in Washington.

“It has become vital to review the population of Afghanistan citizens,” an ICE official wrote to agency field offices in a Nov. 29 email.

Noorzay urged Afghan community members to consult attorneys before attending any ICE appointments. He advised residents not to attend ICE meetings without legal representation, and called on others in the Sacramento area to demand accountability from federal authorities.

“When ICE can detain 10 people in three days using deceptive tactics, and we don’t even know the real number — that creates a ripple effect of terror throughout our entire community,” Noorzay said in the news release. “Children are asking if their parents will come home. Families are afraid to answer the phone. People are too scared to go to their ICE check-ins, even when they’re required to do so by law.”

At Friday’s news conference, Noorzay said the issue at hand is not an abstract concept. He said the people targeted for removal are your neighbors, real families who work in the community who are now afraid to answer their phones

“They risked their lives working alongside U.S. forces, translators, interpreters, drivers, even journalists, and they fled under hardship, trusting that the United States would protect them,” Noorzay told reporters. “Today, that trust is being shattered.

He said what federal officials are doing to Afghan residents is profiling, targeting people based on national origin and faith. Noorzay said it echoes “some of the darkest chapters” in this country, such as the Japanese American internment camps during World War II and the painful history of targeting Latin American immigrants and refugees through raids and intimidation.

“This sends a wave of fear amongst this Afghan community and amongst every household,” Noorzay said.

Capital response and detentions

Members of the NorCal Resist community advocacy group have been taking calls to its hotline reporting federal immigration agents taking Afghan residents into custody. They’re urging residents to know their rights.

“The Afghan residents are a part of our community. We will be defending them,” Giselle Garcia of NorCal Resist told The Bee on Thursday.

Garcia told reporters on Friday that she escorted one Afghan family to the downtown federal building earlier this week after they received a call from ICE officials instructing them to appear for an impromptu appointment. She said the family who arrived in Sacramento earlier this year had fled Afghanistan to escape persecution from the Taliban, because the family had supported U.S. military.

“We knew what that meant,” Garcia said. “We had to prepare this family that he (the father and husband) would likely be detained, and that they would be separated.”

She said the father tried to be strong for his wife and children, while his wife held back tears as best as she could. Garcia said she can still hear the couple’s young daughter trying to console her mother, telling her mother it would be OK when her father comes back. As recent arrivals, the family and others is required to comply with immigration officials.

“I could not reconcile that our government was forcing this beautiful family to walk into a trap and that we were driving them to their demise,” Garcia told reporters.

On Thursday, Afghan residents in Arden Arcade reported immigration officials knocking on the doors of their homes, questioning them and promising to return. Garcia said these tactics are “terrorizing the community.”

The community groups have reported that ICE officials have been calling Afghan residents, many of whom are recent arrivals, some who are already under ICE supervision and others who are scheduled for expedited removal proceedings.

The ICE officials instructed these Afghan residents to go to the downtown Sacramento field office for “same-day appointments,” but they were immediately detained. CAIR officials said the majority of those arrested in Sacramento were being held at the California City Detention Facility, a former prison in Kern County converted to an ICE detention center.

The facility is facing a federal lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other civil rights groups, which alleges serious operational failures—including raw sewage leaks, insect infestations, insufficient medical care, and inadequate food and clothing for cold weather. One detainee reportedly went without heart medication for days, resulting in two hospitalizations.

The lawsuit claims ICE and its private contractor, CoreCivic, have failed to provide for the basic needs of those in custody, citing delayed surgeries and inhumane treatment.

ICE and CoreCivic have denied the allegations, and DHS officials have called the complaints “false.”

“ICE’s mass detention strategy is rooted in anti-Muslim bigotry and discriminatory profiling,” Layli Shirani, civil rights managing attorney for CAIR’s Sacramento chapter, said in the news release. “The federal government is criminalizing the very people who risked their lives to help America. Using fake appointments to lure people into detention is a deceptive, inhumane tactic that violates basic principles of due process.”

The Sacramento area is home to an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Afghan residents, the largest concentration in the United States. CAIR said many of them assisted U.S. military forces as translators, interpreters and CIA assets before fleeing Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in 2021.

The congresswoman said Trump and Noem have exploited the heartbreaking shooting of two National Guard members to justify going after immigrant families in Sacramento and throughout the country.

“Sacramento knows how to respond when fear is weaponized,” Matsui said at Friday’s news conference. “We don’t scatter. We lock arms, and we stand together.”

HIAS and our partners will continue to work to put out good information for refugees, asylum seekers, and community members in the days and weeks to come.","In the last two weeks, the Trump Administration has announced sweeping and unprecedented restrictions on refugees and asylum seekers, some of them following the tragic shooting of members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. on November 26.

Many of these announcements still lack detailed public guidance or clarity on how they will be implemented. Here is what you need to know now about the most recent changes impacting refugees, asylees, and immigrants to the United States:

Refugees Admitted Between January 2021 and January 2025

The Trump administration is planning to re-screen 200,000 refugees admitted into the United States during the Biden Administration, according to a leaked USCIS memo from November 21, 2025. The U.S. Refugee Admissions program (USRAP) already includes years of security screening by multiple federal agencies, making resettled refugees the single most vetted population admitted to the country.

Refugees admitted through the USRAP have already endured years or decades of trauma, instability, and loss. The prospect of being summoned back into an interview process—paired with the threat of losing access to permanent residency—disrupts the sense of safety and belonging that resettlement is intended to restore.

Despite the fact that the refugee resettlement program remains shuttered to almost all new arrivals (as of January 20, 2025), HIAS continues to provide ongoing integration and welcome services to thousands of clients who arrived during the past five years and is deeply concerned for their wellbeing in this moment.

People Seeking Asylum in the United States

The Trump Administration paused all asylum decisions on November 28, 2025, for asylum seekers from any country around the world. Asylum seekers have since reported widespread cancellations of interviews.

There is currently a backlog of 1.4 million asylum applications pending before USCIS, which means that people seeking protection after fleeing violence and persecution have even less stability, and risk being sent back to danger. Seeking asylum is a legal pathway, and a lifesaving option. President Trump has even stated he intends to pause the asylum system for “a long time”.

In addition to the halt on asylum processing, the Trump administration has also indicated that they will review all asylum decisions made during the Biden Administration, plunging people who spent years proving that they faced danger in their home countries, back into uncertainty.

HIAS works with asylum seekers through our direct legal representation in the New York and DC areas and provides legal support and resources through a large pro-bono network across the country.

People from the 19 Travel Ban Countries

Six months ago, the Trump Administration announced a new travel ban, blocking people from nineteen countries from entering the U.S. This is a fully discriminatory policy, echoing the Muslim ban from the first Trump administration, only even more sweeping.

Now the administration has blocked all immigration processing for people from those 19 countries, such as travel documents, obtaining green cards, adjustment of status, and naturalization. They also plan to re-review past approvals for individuals from those countries who entered the U.S. on or after January 20, 2021.

Additionally, the administration is reportedly considering expanding the travel ban list to thirty countries.

Afghans

The Trump Administration has announced that all visas for people from Afghanistan are halted. This includes Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) for people who assisted the U.S. mission during the recent wars. With the current shutdown of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, SIVs were some of the only individuals still being admitted in the United States. Afghans remain one of the largest groups of refugees around the world, fleeing violence and persecution from the Taliban regime.

HIAS works with Afghan refugees and SIVs across all our programs nationwide. We have resettled thousands of Afghan refugees, provided long-term integration support and resources, provided legal support, and engaged local communities in welcome and advocacy. We will continue to advocate for the rights and safety of the Afghan community.

Next Steps

HIAS is deeply saddened by the senseless act of violence targeting Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, and our thoughts are with their families. As a Jewish organization, we also know all too well what it means for an entire community to be targeted because of the actions of one person.

We will always stand in solidarity with people seeking the opportunity to rebuild their lives in safety, including those being targeted now by harmful policies and hateful rhetoric in the Afghan American and Somali American communities.

While this article summarizes some of the events of two tumultuous weeks, we recognize that this is an ongoing situation, with fast-moving developments. For most of the policy changes announced, there remains no clear guidance on how they will be implemented, leaving refugees and immigrants – and all of us who work with them – with questions, uncertainty, and fear. HIAS and our partners will continue to work to put out good information for refugees, asylum seekers, and community members in the days and weeks to come.",https://hias.org/wp-content/uploads/Getty_Minnesota_Immigration_Protest_Hero.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 21:56:34.196994

“I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries,” she said.
Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the US, according to an internal state department cable.
Immigration groups and lawmakers sharply criticized the escalation and plan to halt immigration applications from 19 countries that were already under US travel restrictions, a decision that comes amid reports that naturalization ceremonies for people on the travel ban list are also being canceled.","The US plans to expand the number of countries covered by its travel ban to more than 30, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Kristi Noem, has announced.

“I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries,” she said.

Donald Trump signed a proclamation in June banning the citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats.

The bans apply to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travelers.

Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list.

“If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” Noem said.

Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the US, according to an internal state department cable.

An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration has taken since the shooting of two National guard members in Washington DC last week.

Investigators say the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement program under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting.

Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from what he termed all “third world countries”, although he did not identify any by name or define that label.

Immigration groups and lawmakers sharply criticized the escalation and plan to halt immigration applications from 19 countries that were already under US travel restrictions, a decision that comes amid reports that naturalization ceremonies for people on the travel ban list are also being canceled.

Before that, officials from the DHS said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Joe Biden, and green cards issued to citizens of 19 countries.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf70d5ede73ae1d1b6c82ab178d5d230c5ef2007/537_0_5006_4005/master/5006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57b949d61991683864c64befa69f27e2",N,,2025-12-05 17:58:15.792943

The tension underscores how severely the relationship between Newsom and the White House has deteriorated since catastrophic blazes tore through Los Angeles in January. A year that began with Newsom extending an olive branch to his Oval Office nemesis drew toward a close with the likely 2028 presidential candidate championing a gerrymandering campaign framed as a rebuke to Trump, who has infuriated California Democrats with policies like sweeping immigration raids in LA.

Newsom’s visit comes at a critical time in the recovery process, nearing the one-year anniversary of the blazes that destroyed 13,000 homes across Los Angeles. Wildfire survivors have begun to return to their homes in recent weeks, but they’ve continued to struggle with a lack of high-level leadership and funding needed to manage the recovery.

Financing gaps are particularly pressing for low-income renters and longtime homeowners on fixed incomes, many of whom had no insurance or were underinsured. The governor’s revised request calls for $2 billion to build new affordable housing developments and $9.9 billion for long-term housing and infrastructure needs. Beyond housing, Newsom wants $11.8 billion in public assistance, including to repair damaged school facilities and for emergency staffing.

While a substantial amount of federal funding typically comes years after disasters, state and local governments rely on the money to reimburse them.

Newsom at first sought to coax more resources through a conciliatory approach, meeting with Trump even as the president and his allies threatened to attach preconditions to federal assistance. He worked to unite California’s delegation across party lines in a bid for more money that brought in Republicans including the state’s senior appropriator, Rep. Ken Calvert.

But that attempt at comity collapsed as Newsom vociferously opposed — and challenged in court — core Trump policies like tariffs and the president’s deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles and as Newsom’s staff mocks the president online. Trump during a visit in late January vowed to help with the recovery but has since cast doubt on whether he would aid the “incompetent” Newsom.

That sustained animus has hardened partisan lines as Newsom works to wring more dollars from a GOP-controlled Congress. Republicans have amplified criticisms from some Los Angeles residents that the Newsom administration did not adequately guard against the conflagrations and has dragged its feet on rebuilding.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fe5%2Fd6%2Fd0fc251740118bff1238e4a7ed98%2Ftrump-newsom-39409.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:58:20.627905

The EO would deny U.S. citizenship to children born in the United States to a mother in temporary lawful status or without status, if the child’s father is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. lawful permanent resident.

The federal government is currently enjoined from implementing the birthright citizenship EO pursuant to four separate lower court orders. The White House is seeking a Supreme Court ruling that the EO is constitutional in its reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment Citizenship clause, thereby overruling the lower court injunctions.

A final ruling on the EO’s constitutionality may not be issued until the end of the Supreme Court’s current term in June or July 2026.

On January 20, President Trump issued a birthright citizenship EO stating that the following classes of children born in the United States after February 19, 2025 would no longer be U.S. citizens at birth:

Children whose mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of the child’s birth; and

Children whose mother’s presence in the United States at the time of the child’s birth was lawful but temporary, and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of the child’s birth.

The EO defines mother as the “immediate female biological progenitor” and father as the “immediate male biological progenitor.” (Therefore, parents with legal but not biological parentage of a child could not serve as the basis for their child’s U.S. birthright citizenship claim.)

The basis of the EO is a significant reinterpretation of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the 14th Amendment Citizenship clause, which for more than 125 years has been interpreted to grant citizenship based on birth in the United States, subject to some very narrow exceptions.

Thus far, various nationwide injunctions have prevented implementation of the birthright citizenship EO, even after a June 27 Supreme Court decision seemed to limit the authority of federal courts to issue nationwide (or “universal,” in the court’s terminology) injunctions. Despite the various injunctions in effect, in late July 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued preliminary guidance on certain aspects of EO implementation, providing insight into how the agency would apply the new citizenship framework if all injunctions were to be lifted. If the Supreme Court were to deem the EO constitutional and the EO were to take effect, significant changes would be required in the policies and operations of both USCIS and the U.S. State Department.",https://www.fragomen.com/a/web/jw8CFvqZCBTzJTGK5te2fn/3gcYmk/alert-social-open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:58:47.352919

Homan spoke at an event hosted by Turning Point USA, where organizers say roughly 500 people filled the auditorium to hear his remarks. Inside, he delivered a sharp message on illegal immigration, calling for stricter enforcement and defending the administration’s approach along the southern border.

“At the University of Texas at El Paso, we are not sending the message to the whole world that it’s ok to enter illegally… when you cross the border illegally, you are a cheater and put yourself in front of the line of millions who are doing it the right way,” Homan said.

While Homan addressed the crowd indoors, dozens of protesters gathered outside the venue. Demonstrators, many of them students and local immigrants’ rights advocates, criticized his role in shaping federal immigration enforcement and the impact they believe his policies have had on families in the borderland.

“He is the one promoting this idea that it is okay to deport U.S. citizen children. We believe that message is not necessarily welcome in El Paso or in UTEP,” said Fernando García, Director of the Border Network for Human Rights.

Supporters inside the auditorium said they attended because they view Homan as a knowledgeable and credible voice on immigration law.

“He is very, very knowledgeable about all aspects of immigration law. I like to hear him talk because he comes from a very informed opinion,” said attendee Andy Bucker.

Some UTEP students voiced discomfort with the visit, noting that the university is majority Hispanic and in a community deeply connected to the immigrant experience.

“It is very troubling that Tom Homan has come here to speak because this is a majority-Hispanic university. Under Tom Homan’s leadership, most of our students here could be targeted by ICE regardless of their immigration status,” said UTEP student Naomi Reese.

The event concluded with both sides standing firm in their viewpoints. Supporters argued that open discussion is essential, while critics insisted that Homan’s presence sends a harmful message to immigrant communities on campus.

In the letter, the New Dems lay out eight commonsense and immediate steps the Administration could take to address the ongoing housing affordability crisis. The letter comes as the Secretary of the Treasury has indicated the Administration is planning to declare a “national housing emergency” to address rising costs, while refusing to take quick and decisive actions to actually bring down the cost of housing.

The letter reads in part:

“We agree with the Secretary’s comments that this is an ‘all hands on deck’ challenge and believe there are concrete steps the Administration and Congress should take to meet this ongoing crisis. However, details on actual policies that would expand affordable housing options have not been provided. In fact, recently announced policies at the Department of Housing and Urban Development would do the opposite, and reverse progress made in fighting homelessness and go against Congressional instruction.”

The recommendations include restoring funding for Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) homelessness programs, lowering tariffs on construction materials to decrease costs, improving data collection and transparency, and prioritizing reforms to planning, permitting, and zoning.

You can read the full letter here, and below:

Dear President Trump:

Access to affordable housing is critical for our nation’s long-term success. For too long, rising home prices and rents have kept home ownership out of reach for teachers, nurses, firefighters, and millions of other Americans, forcing families to choose between saving for their children’s education, affording needed healthcare, and keeping a roof over their heads.

These heartbreaking financial decisions have meant too many families have given up on the American dream, an America where any child can grow up to have a better future than their parents. That is why the New Democrat Coalition has for years called for policies to make owning a home more accessible for more Americans by building more affordable housing, improving availability of capital for homebuyers, and lowering overall housing costs. We write to urge your administration to take immediate action to increase affordable housing production and lower housing costs for Americans.

Past comments from the Secretary of the Treasury indicate that the administration is planning to declare a “national housing emergency” to address the rising costs of housing. We need more than declarations and hollow promises. We agree with the Secretary’s comments that this is an ""all hands on deck"" challenge and believe there are concrete steps the Administration and Congress should take to meet this ongoing crisis. However, details on actual policies that would expand affordable housing options have not been provided. In fact, recently announced policies at the Department of Housing and Urban Development would do the opposite, and reverse progress made in fighting homelessness and go against Congressional instruction.

There are numerous existing policy actions within your authority that you and your administration can act on today, to help build more housing and lower the cost of buying, renting, or selling a home. We urge your administration to take concrete steps to tackle the housing crisis by focusing on proven and practical solutions, including:

Reverse the proposed cuts and changes to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Continuum of Care Program announced on November 13, 2025, which puts 170,000 people at immediate risk of homelessness.

Develop best practices for zoning and land-use policies, including model codes at the HUD in consultation with agencies such as the Department of Transportation and Department of Commerce, which will help a teacher afford to live in the same community where she works, rather than commuting two hours each day.

Prioritize federal funds for projects that include planning, permitting, and zoning reforms to promote more streamlined development, including updating grant criteria to reward jurisdictions with simplified codes, which will help cut through the red tape that adds tens of thousands of dollars in costs to every new home.

Update Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage disclosures to include Department of Veteran Affairs’ (VA) Home Loans alongside FHA and conventional loan options to maximize transparency, which will show veterans that VA loans often offer better terms than conventional options—ensuring our service members aren't missing out on benefits they've earned.

Improve data collection efforts at the Census Bureau and HUD to better understand how and where housing is being lost and not replaced so Congress and the Administration can respond urgently when a community loses 100 affordable units and only builds back 20.

Exempt housing construction materials from tariffs to lower construction costs by thousands of dollars per home, savings that developers can pass directly to homebuyers.

Enhance data transparency by requiring the Federal Housing Finance Agency, HUD, VA, and Department of Agriculture to release public loan-level appraisal data that identifies lenders and appraisers, but protects homeowner privacy, ensuring that a family's zip code or last name doesn't determine whether they can get a fair mortgage.

Provide significant funding anti-discrimination programs at HUD to ensure that all Americans can buy, rent, or sell homes at fair prices, which safeguard all Americans, regardless of race, religion, gender, disability, or marriage status.

The housing crisis demands specific action with real impact. We strongly encourage your administration to work collaboratively with Congress to implement these measures and other forward-looking policies to address the nation’s housing challenges. By pursuing these practical reforms, we can deliver real results for American families while respecting constitutional limits and building the bipartisan consensus necessary for lasting solutions.

Carla Cunningham, the Democrat who faced a jeering hometown crowd this summer after delivering a controversial speech on the state House floor criticizing immigrants, is seeking an eighth term.

She’ll likely be in a crowded primary field in House District 106 in Charlotte.

The Rev. Rodney Sadler filed campaign paperwork on Monday.

At least two others say they plan to run. Morris McAdoo, a lawyer, has a campaign website. Vermanno Bowman, whom Cunningham defeated in last year’s primary, announced on social media he also plans to run again.

Cunningham worked for decades as a nurse and has been a prominent voice in the legislature on health and mental health matters.

She is the widow of longtime House member Pete Cunningham, who resigned his seat in 2007 and died in 2010. Carla Cunningham won her first term in 2012.

Cunningham has emerged as one of the Democrats who votes most often with the Republican majority. This year, she voted with Republicans more than any other Democrat. And Republican House leaders have recognized that by awarding her coveted positions in chamber leadership: she co-chairs the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, and is a vice-chair of the House Health Committee.

But, until now, she has not faced a concerted Democratic effort to oust her. She defeated Bowman in last year’s primary with more than 84% of the vote.

House District 106 is heavily Democratic, so the primary victor is likely to win the seat.

Cunningham delivered her controversial speech on immigration as she voted with the GOP to override Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of House Bill 318. The law puts more requirements on law enforcement to help U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement with deportations.

“All cultures are not equal,” Cunningham said in a speech explaining her vote to override Stein’s veto. Immigrants need to assimilate, she added.

At an August town hall filled with angry Democrats, Cunningham defended her vote and the speech, WFAE reported.

Last month, the U.S. Border Patrol began an operation in Charlotte that triggered a wave of fear that temporarily closed businesses and had parents afraid to send children to school.

Cunningham was initially dismissive of reports of the operation. She told NC Newsline, “I’m going to be keeping my eyes on my own safety for right now,” saying she had received threats over her July speech.

However, in an email Friday announcing her reelection bid, Cunningham said her vote was about serious criminal offenders.

It will likely hand down a ruling next summer.

In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order removing the recognition of citizenship for the U.S.-born children of both immigrants here illegally and visitors here only temporarily. The new rule is not retroactive. This change in long-standing U.S. policy sparked a wave of litigation culminating in Trump v. Washington, an appeal by Trump to remove the injunction put in place by federal courts.

When the justices weigh the arguments, they will focus on the meaning of the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, known as the citizenship clause: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

Both sides agree that to be granted birthright citizenship under the Constitution, a child must be born inside U.S. borders and the parents must be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. However, each side will give a very different interpretation of what the second requirement means. Who falls under “the jurisdiction” of the United States in this context?

As a close observer of the court, I anticipate a divided outcome grounded in strong arguments from each side.

Arguments for automatic citizenship

Simply put, the argument against the Trump administration is that the 14th Amendment’s expansion of citizenship after the eradication of slavery was meant to be broad rather than narrow, encompassing not only formerly enslaved Black people but all persons who arrived on U.S. soil under the protection of the Constitution.

The Civil War amendments – the 13th, 14th and 15th – established inherent equality as a constitutional value, which embraced all persons born in the nation without reference to race, ethnicity or origin.

One of the strongest arguments that automatic citizenship is the meaning of the Constitution is long-standing practice. Citizenship by birth regardless of parental status – with few exceptions – has been the effective rule since the time of America’s founding.

Advocates also point to precedent: the landmark case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898. When an American-born descendant of resident noncitizens sued after being refused re-entry to San Francisco under the Chinese Exclusion Act, the court recognized his natural-born citizenship.

If we read the Constitution in a living fashion – emphasizing the evolution of American beliefs and values over time – the constitutional commitment to broad citizenship grounded in equality, regardless of ethnicity or economic status, seems even more clear.

However, advocates must try to convince the court’s originalists – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – who read the Constitution based on its meaning when it was adopted.

The originalist argument in favor of birthright citizenship is that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to invoke only a small set of exceptions found in traditional British common law. In the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the court relied on this “customary law of England, brought to America by the colonists.”

One exception to birthright citizenship covered by this line of rulings is the child of a foreign diplomat, whose parents represent the interests of another country. Another exception is the children of invading foreign armies. A third exception discussed explicitly by the framers of the 14th Amendment was Native Americans, who at the time were understood to be under the jurisdiction of their tribal government as a separate sovereign. That category of exclusion faded away after Congress recognized the citizenship of Native Americans in 1924.

The advocates of automatic birthright citizenship conclude that whether the 14th Amendment is interpreted in a living or in an original way, its small set of exceptions do not override its broad message of citizenship grounded in human equality.

Opposition to birthright citizenship

The opposing argument begins with a simple intuition: In a society defined by self-government, as America is, there is no such thing as citizenship without consent. In the same way that an American citizen cannot declare himself a French citizen and vote in French elections without consent from the French government, a foreign national cannot declare himself a U.S. citizen without consent.

This argument emphasizes that citizenship in a democracy means holding equal political power over our collective decisions. That is something only existing citizens hold the right to offer to others, something which must be decided through elections and the lawmaking process.

The court’s ruling in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884 – just 16 years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment – endorses “the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation without its consent.” By making entry into the United States without approval a federal offense, Congress has effectively denied that consent.

Scholars who support this view argue that the 14th Amendment does not provide this consent. Instead it sets a limitation. To the authors of the 14th Amendment, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” conveyed a limit to natural citizenship grounded in mutual allegiance. That means if people are free to deny their old national allegiance, and an independent nation is free to decide its own membership, the recognition of a new national identity must be mutual.

Immigrants living in the United States illegally have not accepted the sovereignty of the nation’s laws. On the other side of the coin, the government has not officially accepted them as residents under its protection.

If mutual recognition of allegiance is the meaning of the 14th Amendment, the Trump administration has not violated it.

The opponents of birthright citizenship argue that the Wong Kim Ark ruling has been misrepresented. In that case, the court only considered permanent legal residents like Wong Kim Ark’s parents, but not residents here illegally or temporarily. The focus on British common law in that ruling is simply misguided because the findings of Calvin’s Case or any other precedents dealing with British subjects were voided by the American Revolution.

In this view, the Declaration of Independence replaced subjects with citizens. The power to determine national membership was taken away from kings and placed in the hands of democratic majorities.

For opponents of birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment does not take that power away from citizens but instead codifies the rule that mutual consent is the touchstone of admission. The requirement to be “subject to the jurisdiction” provides the mechanism of that consent.

Congress can determine who is accepted as a member of the national community under its jurisdiction. In this view, Congress – and the American people – have spoken: Current federal laws make entry into U.S. borders without permission a crime rather than a forced acceptance of political membership.

What might happen

The court will likely announce a ruling in summer 2026 before early July, just in time for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The court will ultimately decide whether the Constitution endorses the declaration’s invocation of essential equality or its creation of a sovereign people empowered to determine the boundaries of national membership.

The court’s three Democratic-appointed justices – Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – will surely side against the Trump administration. The six Republican-appointed justices seem likely to divide, a symptom of disagreements within the originalist camp.

The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship. This will likely be some combination of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

The Trump administration will prevail only if five out of the six conservatives reject the British common law foundations of the Wong Kim Ark ruling in favor of citizenship by consent alone.

He insisted that Somali migrants have turned the US state of Minnesota, where some 2 percent of the population is of Somali descent, into a “hellhole” and should be “out of here”. Then, directing his ire at his vocal critic, Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born Democratic representative from Minnesota, Trump said, “She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren’t people who work. These aren’t people who say, ‘Let’s go, come on, let’s make this place great. ’”

Of course, none of this is new or surprising. Hatred of migrants and asylum seekers has always been the glue that holds Trump’s MAGAverse together. Who can forget that, before his cordial meeting with Trump at the White House, several MAGA Republicans made serious efforts to revoke the US citizenship of New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Since Trump’s rise to power, hostility to migrants has become not just a mainstream component of contemporary politics in the United States but a governing principle.

But the rise in anti-migrant sentiment, and its validation and promotion by those in positions of power, is not exclusive to Trump’s increasingly insular America. Similar rhetoric and tactics are gaining ground elsewhere, revealing a global trend that extends far beyond the United States. Denmark is one such example.

Beneath its long-cultivated image as a progressive, humane and orderly society built on universal healthcare, Lego, highly liveable cities and minimalist designer aesthetics, Denmark has in recent years become one of Europe’s most restrictive states on immigration and asylum. During the recently concluded local elections, Islamophobic rhetoric was on full display, and in the lead-up to the 2026 national elections, the ruling Social Democrats have placed their commitment to tackling the so-called problem of immigration at the centre of their campaign.

Across the pond, in the United Kingdom, the supposedly progressive Labour government seems eager to follow the Danish example. Under pressure from the far right and Reform UK’s enduring rise in the polls, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is eager to convince people that he can be trusted to take back control of our borders and close the book on a squalid chapter of Britain’s immigration policy. He has warned that the UK risks becoming an island of strangers unless immigration is sharply reduced, and has promised that his government’s reforms will ensure that migration will fall. That is a promise. Most strikingly, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood recently sent officials to Denmark to study its immigration and asylum regime, a gesture that underscores how dramatically Labour’s stance has hardened.

Xenophobia is also on the rise outside the Western world. It is a staple of policy and practice from Libya to South Africa, a reminder that anti-migrant politics is now a global tool of governance.

Europe-bound migrants in Libya face horrific levels of violence and abuse. According to Amnesty International, they are subjected to prolonged arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture, rape, unlawful killings, extortion and forced labour. These abuses occur within a system effectively underwritten by European governments, which have funnelled funding, training and equipment to Libyan coastguard units tasked with intercepting migrants before they reach international waters. Keen to stem the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean, European Union states have outsourced border control to Libya despite knowing the consequences, supporting the authorities’ ability to continue with measures the United Nations says could very likely amount to crimes against humanity.

Further west, in Tunisia, Black African migrants have faced sporadic violence for years. In early 2023, President Kais Saied claimed there was a criminal plan to change Tunisia’s demographic makeup through irregular migration, turning it into a purely African country that has no affiliation to the Arab and Islamic nations. His remarks triggered a surge in mob attacks on Black migrants, students and asylum seekers. There was also an increase in arrests, and the police appeared to be targeting Black African foreigners based on their appearance. Those detained included undocumented migrants, registered refugees and asylum seekers, as well as migrants with valid credentials, a stark demonstration of how state practices can shift once xenophobia is given political sanction.

Similarly, xenophobia targeting migrants from other African countries has been a constant feature of life and politics in post-apartheid South Africa. According to Xenowatch, a project hosted by the University of the Witwatersrand that tracks xenophobic discrimination and violence, there have been 1,295 recorded incidents since 1994, including displacement, looting of migrant-owned businesses and killings. Deaths peaked in 2008 with 72 fatalities and 150 incidents. In 2025, while 16 people were killed, the overall number of xenophobic incidents again reached 2008 levels, underscoring the persistence of the crisis.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government systematically overlooked migrant communities, excluding many from relief programmes and framing protection of South Africans as the priority. The state also constructed a 40-kilometre fence along the border with Zimbabwe to block infected or undocumented persons, despite Zimbabwe having only 11 confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time compared with South Africa’s 1,845. Politicians reinforced existing myths about foreign-owned businesses posing health risks. When announcing that spaza shops could remain open, the then-Minister of Small Business Development, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, declared that only South African-owned, managed and run shops would remain open.

South Africa has also seen the rise of explicitly anti-immigrant mobilisation. The Put South Africans First movement, a coalition of civil society groups advocating the mass deportation of African migrants, organised a march to the Nigerian and Zimbabwean embassies on September 23, 2020, claiming that foreigners contribute to South Africa’s social ills such as drugs, human trafficking and child abductions.

The vigilante group Operation Dudula emerged from this movement in 2021, following the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma. Although it claims to address crime and drug use in Gauteng communities, its name, Dudula – meaning “force out” in isiZulu – captures its true focus. The group is better known for calling for mass deportations, blocking migrants from accessing hospitals and clinics, and raiding or shutting down foreign-owned businesses.

Of course, I could keep going, from increasing restrictions in countries like Colombia, Peru, Chile and Ecuador aimed at stemming the influx of Venezuelan migrants, to Indian authorities forcibly expelling ethnic Bengali Muslims to Bangladesh without due process, domestic guarantees and international human rights standards, claiming that they are undocumented. Xenophobia is not confined to any region or ideology; it is now woven into the political life of countries across the globe.

Why are we so keen to give in to xenophobic narratives and policies? In part because they are convenient. They allow governments and societies to externalise domestic failures, offering an easy explanation for problems that are far more complex and often rooted in political and economic mismanagement at home, in austerity, deepening inequality and precarious work rather than in the arrival of strangers.

In this logic, the migrant becomes a ready-made scapegoat, a figure onto whom we project all the ills we believe threaten who we are or what we stand for. It then becomes effortless to claim that migrants subscribe to dangerous ideologies, strain national resources, carry diseases or form part of some insidious plan to alter the country’s demographic or cultural fabric.

Perception becomes reality. Blaming those beyond our borders allows us to imagine the threat lies elsewhere, reassuring us that we are not the problem. The tragedy is that the dysfunctions and corruptions embedded in our own systems remain untouched. And scapegoating the supposed outsider does nothing to make our societies fairer, safer or more humane; it merely buys time for leaders unwilling to confront the crises they helped create.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ap_6932d1cfefa76-1764938192.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-05 18:58:02.469714

Federal judges across the country ruled that the policy is at odds with the Constitution and an 1898 Supreme Court ruling long seen as guaranteeing citizenship to virtually everyone born in the U.S.

Although the courts blocked Trump’s policy within days of its issuance, the Justice Department did not immediately ask the Supreme Court to revive it. Instead, in March, Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to use the birthright-related litigation to tell judges to stop the issuance of nationwide injunctions against the federal government.

Sauer’s move, which put off the high court battle over birthright citizenship for about a year, led to a Supreme Court ruling in June that reined in judges’ authority to issue nationwide injunctions but didn’t slam the door on them altogether.

The Trump administration returned to the high court in September, asking the justices to take up the substance of the birthright fight and rule that Trump’s policy is constitutional.

“The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to grant citizenship to freed slaves and their children, not to the children of illegal aliens, birth tourists, and temporary visitors,” Sauer wrote. “The plain text of the Clause requires more than birth on U.S. soil alone.”

Critics say Trump’s policy would upend more than a century of settled law and practice. They also question any president’s authority to declare who is and is not a citizen.

It’s also unclear how the order would be implemented. State and local governments issue birth certificates in the U.S. and they don’t always indicate the citizenship of parents.

“The Executive Order and Petitioners’ efforts to implement it threaten chaos and strike at our Nation’s most solemn promise — equality under the law and full citizenship for those born on American soil,” lawyers for Democrat-led states opposing Trump’s order told the court in October.

Those states did not oppose the high court taking up the case to resolve the issue, while immigrant rights advocates said the law is so clear that the justices should turn aside the administration’s bid for review.

Trump’s executive order did not directly seek to strip U.S. citizenship from people who already had it.

“Reopening questions of birthright citizenship would cause potentially catastrophic effects, rippling out far past the particular Order at issue here.”","The Supreme Court announced Friday it will decide the legality of President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for children born to migrant parents without legal status in the United States.

The case could have a seismic impact on the nature of citizenship in the United States, ending the automatic presumption children born within the country are U.S. citizens regardless of the immigration status of their parents, based on more than 125 years of legal precedent.

The executive order from Trump, signed on the first day of his second term as part of a tough-on-immigration approach, sought to deny citizenship to children born in the United States if their parents were not current citizens or permanent residents.

States and others challenging the executive order have said in court filings that it could strip citizenship from hundreds of thousands of children each year.

The Trump administration appealed a lower court decision that found the executive order violates the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case Friday in a one-page order and could decide the case by the conclusion of the term at the end of June.

The language in that amendment, which states “all persons born or naturalized” in the United States are citizens, has served as basis for that guarantee all people born in the country.

The court had decided one aspect of the birthright citizenship case last term, focusing on trial judges who had issued rulings on a nationwide basis prohibiting Trump from enforcing the order.

The high court ultimately decided nationwide injunctions as a general matter are unlawful. But that decision was about the authority of trial judges and didn’t address the underlying merits of limiting birthright citizenship.

Defenders of Trump’s move have pointed to conditional language in the amendment stating individuals born in the United States must be “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” to be eligible for citizenship.

That interpretation cuts against more than century of legal precedent that established that carve out applies to very limited categories of people, such as the children of foreign diplomats.

The Justice Department filed the petition seeking review before the court last month in two challenges, one in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against Trump and another pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, which has yet to render a decision.

The Trump administration petition states “the mistaken view that birth on U.S. territory confers citizenship on anyone subject to the regulatory reach of U.S. law became pervasive, with destructive consequences,” and that Trump issued the order to “restore the Clause’s original meaning.”

Early review is necessary before the 1st Circuit has rendered its decision, the Justice Department contended, because Trump’s directive “forms an integral part of the Administration’s broader effort to prevent illegal immigration.”

“Though these cases arise in a preliminary-injunction posture, further proceedings in the lower courts would have limited utility, given that the cases involve pure questions of law,” the petition states.

Civil rights groups that had brought litigation against Trump’s directive argued in a brief before the Supreme Court that review was unwarranted because the key question was already resolved, citing the decision in the 1898 Wong Kim Ark case.

“Wong Kim Ark is one of the most important decisions in our nation’s history, and it stands as a cornerstone of our modern society,” the brief says. “Reopening questions of birthright citizenship would cause potentially catastrophic effects, rippling out far past the particular Order at issue here.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/birthright_BC_150_051525-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:58:36.791680

The industries listed do not include the many year-round (or nearly year-round) jobs that can be found on crop farms, including equipment operators and supervisors.
A fall in the H-2A wage will increase demand for H-2A workers, since employers can save significantly on labor costs if they hire them.
As a result, it will become relatively more expensive to hire non-H-2A U.S. farmworkers.
However, if the rider to make H-2A year-round goes into effect, farmworkers in year-round jobs will see the biggest pay cuts.","This is Part 1 of a two-part series analyzing the impact of an amendment to the House Homeland appropriations bill on the H-2A and H-2B visa programs.

For well over a decade now—time and time and time and time again—Congress has been making policy changes to temporary work visa programs not through the normal process of debating and passing legislation, but through a backdoor process. This involves amendments to annual appropriations legislation (known as “riders”) that fund the U.S. government. Riders that make policy changes are much more likely to pass without much public notice, debate, or pushback relative to dedicated legislation, since they are smaller parts of larger, must-pass legislation to fund the whole U.S. government. The significant changes proposed or passed in riders over the past decade have all pushed temporary work visa programs in the same direction: expanding and deregulating the H-2A and H-2B visa programs, which benefits employers at the expense of U.S. workers and hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who will continue to see reduced wages and poorer working conditions. It’s already clear that low-wage work visa programs won’t be improved during the Trump administration; instead, they’ll be made much worse.

This fiscal year, there is a particular urgency around the riders to expand and deregulate the H-2A and H-2B visa programs, in light of the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort that is arresting and deporting workers at a breakneck pace, as well as canceling temporary immigration protections that provided work authorization to millions. The Trump administration got the ball rolling on this effort with a new proposed H-2A wage regulation issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) on October 2, 2025. This proposed regulation contains a stunning admission: The administration’s mass deportation effort is likely to raise food prices. DOL’s solution to this problem of the administration’s own creation is an irrational and anti-worker solution. Instead of pushing the administration from within to stop their campaign of mass deportation, DOL proposes to lower farmworker wages by $24 billion over the next 10 years.

Having seen this proposed rule, employers who are heavily reliant on migrant laborers—especially those in the hospitality, construction, and agricultural industries—can now be confident they have a friendly administration willing to dismantle labor standards and are lobbying furiously for more work visas that allow them to employ a vulnerable workforce. Employers are making the case that H-2 visas are “a workforce issue, not immigration,” as well as an essential service that must continue to function even during the recent government shutdown. A number of lawmakers and the Trump administration seem to agree.

The latest legislative vehicle that has a chance at furthering these goals is a rider that the Homeland Security subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee proposed and passed. It was originally known as Amendment #1 but was later dubbed the “Bipartisan Visa En Bloc” amendment. As Politico Pro reported, “House appropriators from both parties came together…to back big changes to visa policies that would boost the number of seasonal workers who can come to the United States.” The rider was cosponsored by three Republicans and one Democrat (but the Democrat was Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the recent recipient of a pardon from Trump for federal bribery charges). However, it’s worth noting that because rider passed by a voice vote, there is no on-the-record vote tally showing who voted for it.

The rider still has a long way to go before becoming law and will also depend on whether an omnibus government spending bill is ultimately passed for fiscal year 2026. As of the time of publication, the Senate has not yet released their version of a Homeland Security appropriations bill. To become law, the Senate would also have to adopt the same rider provision for it to become part of the broader omnibus appropriations legislation. Nevertheless, the rider is a statement of intent from legislators who are willing to go to bat for employers seeking new exploitable and underpaid migrant workers to replace their long-term immigrant workers who have been deported or lost status.

Below is a summary of the four major changes that the Bipartisan Visa En Bloc rider amendment would make to the H-2A and H-2B visa programs. Only the first major change is discussed in this explainer, but a follow-up to this blog post will discuss the other three changes. Under the rider:

Employers would be permitted to hire H-2A farmworkers to fill year-round jobs.

The H-2B visa program would be expanded by at least 100,000 workers relative to its size in 2024.

H-2B workers employed at carnivals, traveling fairs, and circuses would be moved to the P visa program, a program that has no wage rules or worker protections and over which DOL has no formal oversight role.

DHS would not be permitted to spend funds to implement the January 2024 regulation that incrementally improves rights and protections for H-2A and H-2B workers. This regulation allows them to be eligible for green cards through existing pathways and helps them more easily change employers, reducing the indentured nature of the visa programs, and requires additional scrutiny on employer applications if they’ve committed certain violations.

The H-2A program has expanded rapidly and is rife with abuse

Employers use the H-2A visa program to fill seasonal and temporary jobs in agriculture, after employers go through a (mostly pro forma) process to prove that they could not find an available U.S. worker to hire. There is no annual limit on the number of H-2A workers that can be hired, and H-2A has in recent years been the fastest-growing U.S. work visa program, tripling over the past decade. Figure A shows the three available data sets on H-2A job certifications, petitions, and visas, as well as an estimate of the total number of H-2A workers between 2015 and 2024, with 352,682 H-2A workers estimated to have been employed in the United States last year. The vast majority of H-2A workers are employed on crop farms, picking fruits and vegetables, and the average duration of an H-2A job is roughly six months.

There have been countless exposés from journalists and advocates that reveal how H-2A farmworkers are indentured to their employers, frequently robbed, exploited, victimized, and trafficked, and how the main source of wage and hour violations on farms comes from employers breaking H-2A rules.

The rider adopted in the House would allow H-2A workers to be employed in year-round jobs—which is currently prohibited—expanding the scope of the program and allowing H-2A workers to fill jobs on dairy, livestock, and poultry and egg farms, as well as in nurseries and greenhouses and other nonseasonal agricultural occupations. This would be a major change to H-2A, and it has long been a demand of agribusiness.

Making H-2A year-round raises three key questions:

How many permanent, year-round jobs might be impacted?

How will farmworker wages be impacted?

How much will the H-2A program expand?

There are 410,000 year-round jobs in agriculture

For an answer to the first question, see Table 1, which lists four of the major agricultural industries employing farmworkers year-round, the largest of which are greenhouse and dairy jobs. Together they total nearly 410,000 full-time equivalent jobs. The industries listed do not include the many year-round (or nearly year-round) jobs that can be found on crop farms, including equipment operators and supervisors. In total, it’s possible that up to one-third of the total 1.6 million full-time equivalent jobs in agriculture could be year-round.

DOL’s new Adverse Effect Wage Rate will result in a pay cut for H-2A workers and U.S. workers that will line the pockets of employers by billions

Next, let’s consider what would happen to the wages of farmworkers in year-round occupations if the H-2A visa program were expanded to include them.

The wages of nearly all H-2A farmworkers are set by the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR), unless the federal, state, or local hourly minimum wages are higher, or if there is an applicable local prevailing wage or collective bargaining agreement in place. The purpose of the AEWR is to ensure that H-2A workers are paid a wage that is consistent with U.S. wage standards and prevent adverse impacts of H-2A employment on the wages of farmworkers in the United States.

On October 2, 2025, DOL issued an interim final rule laying out a new AEWR methodology. A recent EPI post describes in detail how the new Trump AEWR will cut wage rates dramatically by using an inferior data set for agriculture and creating two artificial “skill levels,” which set H-2A wages at the 17th percentile of wages surveyed for farm occupations (skill level 1) and at the 50th percentile, which is the median of wages surveyed (skill level 2).

In the new AEWR, the Trump DOL also removes the previous H-2A program requirement that employers pay for 100% of housing costs for H-2A workers. In its stead, the new AEWR deducts a set amount out of every hour of an H-2A worker’s pay, to compensate the employer for H-2A housing costs. This shifts housing costs to H-2A workers who will have the added burden of paying for housing costs out of the already-low wages they earn. The housing deduction is subtracted from the AEWR—lowering a low wage even further—so low that in many states, the state minimum wage will be higher and become the de facto AEWR.

In total, DOL estimates that over $1.7 billion will be transferred from H-2A workers’ pockets back to farm employers under the new wage rule in 2026, amounting to $24 billion over the next 10 years as the program grows to over 500,000 jobs. EPI’s own estimates are that H-2A workers will see a wage cut of between $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion in 2026, depending on how state minimum wage laws are enforced. Reducing the AEWR for H-2A workers will also lower wages for U.S. farmworkers—one-third of whom are U.S.-born citizens, according to the latest DOL survey. A fall in the H-2A wage will increase demand for H-2A workers, since employers can save significantly on labor costs if they hire them. As a result, it will become relatively more expensive to hire non-H-2A U.S. farmworkers. Employers will therefore reduce demand for U.S. farmworkers, putting downward pressure on their wages, with U.S. farmworkers seeing wage reduction of $2.7 to $3.3 billion in annual pay.

This would represent a shocking upward redistribution of income away from some of the country’s most underpaid and essential workers for the food system.

Under the new AEWR, H-2A farmworkers in year-round jobs would be paid tens of thousands of dollars less annually compared with what U.S. farmworkers earn now

The wage cuts from the AEWR described above currently apply only to H-2A farmworkers, who can only be employed in seasonal jobs. However, if the rider to make H-2A year-round goes into effect, farmworkers in year-round jobs will see the biggest pay cuts.

Table 2 lists a sample of some of the main year-round agricultural industries in major agricultural states, along with average annual employment, which together accounts for about 15% of the total year-round full-time equivalent jobs in agriculture. Table 2 shows how much farmworkers earned annually, on average in 2024 in those industries and states, and compares the annual earnings of farmworkers in 2024 with what H-2A workers would earn in 2026 if they had worked in the same jobs and had been paid the corresponding 2026 AEWR at skill level 1 for the entire year (40 hours per week for 52 weeks), minus the annualized amount that will be deducted from hourly wages for housing according to the 2026 AEWR.

The final column in Table 2 shows a few examples that illustrate the difference between what year-round U.S. farmworkers in the selected industries earned in 2024 and what H-2A workers at skill level 1 would earn if they were paid the annualized AEWR in 2026. Table 2 shows that the reduction in wages for H-2A farmworkers in year-round jobs could range from an annual pay cut of nearly $21,000 for farmworkers on hog and pig farms in North Carolina to a pay cut of almost $44,000 for farmworkers on poultry and egg farms in Texas.

Outcomes such as these—in which farmworkers paid the 2026 AEWR would earn tens of thousands of dollars less than what U.S. farmworkers earned in major year-round jobs in 2024—are egregious and in violation of the spirit and letter of the AEWR and the H-2A statute, but will be the norm and allowed if the year-round H-2A provision in the rider becomes law. This would hurt some of the most vulnerable and lowest-paid workers in the U.S. labor market and create an almost unstoppable incentive for employers to replace their current farmworkers who now fill year-round jobs with H-2A workers who can’t easily switch employers or effectively complain when their wages are stolen and when they’re forced to work in unsafe conditions.

The year-round H-2A rider with the new AEWR rule could triple the current size of the H-2A program and cause wages to drop sharply for farmworkers

The ultimate result of the new H-2A wage rule combined with making the H-2A program year-round would be a likely tripling of the size of the H-2A program to about 900,000 workers, which includes the complete decimation of job quality for the 410,000 jobs in agriculture that can provide stable year-round employment and sometimes a living wage for U.S. farmworkers.

How would this occur? The Trump DOL’s new wage rule estimates that the lower pay for farmworkers it institutes will encourage farms to rapidly increase hiring through the H-2A program, estimating that 515,000 H-2A workers will be employed in 2034. If those low wages remain in effect and the year-round H-2A rider becomes law and is renewed yearly (as the H-2B riders have been every year), employers are likely to ramp up hiring for year-round jobs until nearly all are filled by H-2A workers who can be paid extremely low wages and, because of their precarious immigration status, have little bargaining power or the ability to complain in the face of employer lawbreaking.

For context, the 410,000 H-2A workers in year-round jobs plus the estimated 257,500 year-round equivalent jobs done by H-2A workers in seasonal jobs (i.e., 515,000 H-2A workers employed in 2034 for six months out of the year), would equal 667,500 full-time equivalent jobs in agriculture, or roughly 42% of all annual average employment in agriculture.

Instead of ballooning the H-2A program, policymakers should create a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers to ensure their rights on the job

Policymakers and the public must reject the harmful and unjustified proposals coming from Trump and Congress to pay less to farmworkers who already live on the margins of society, and to keep more of them indentured through the H-2A program. This rider is another example that reveals the truth about the Trump administration’s immigration agenda: They have no real interest in protecting jobs or pay for American or “native-born” workers, only in giving employers what they demand.

Using H-2A, a problematic temporary work visa program—in which workers are virtually indentured to their employers and that accounts for most of the wage and hour violations that take place on farms—to fill permanent, year-round jobs should give pause to all members of Congress. It makes no sense, unless the goal is to keep the workers employed in those jobs from having equal rights and fair pay. If migrant workers are filling true labor shortages in permanent, year-round jobs, then those workers should always get lawful permanent residence (i.e., green cards) that puts them on a path to citizenship.

If members of Congress want a reliable, healthy, and stable farm labor force that can continue to produce food domestically for Americans, they should pass legislation that legalizes undocumented farmworkers and reforms the H-2A program so that all migrant farmworkers have equal rights, fair wages, and a quick path to permanent residence and citizenship. That’s the only way to ensure that the workers who sustain the food supply chain will be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve and that honors their contributions to the U.S. economy.

The amounts have not been adjusted for inflation. The 2026 AEWR provides two “skill levels” for farmworkers—which are set at specific percentiles along the distribution of OEWS wages surveyed. Skill level 1 is the 17th percentile while skill level 2 is the median of wages surveyed, which is also the 50th percentile. For this calculation, I am only calculating the wage differentials for H-2A workers in year-round jobs who are classified by employers at skill level 1, which DOL estimates will account for 92% of all H-2A workers.",https://files.epi.org/uploads/shutterstock_2599517487-950x535.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:57:46.900409

Mr. Trump's executive order is a pillar of his immigration agenda, but it has yet to take effect.
The Supreme Court is taking up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit has weighed in.","Washington — The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide the legality of President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship, which automatically grants citizenship to anyone born in the U.S.

Issued at the start of his second term, the plan is the first from Mr. Trump's immigration agenda that the Supreme Court will evaluate on the legal merits. The justices have been asked to intervene in several challenges to Mr. Trump's immigration policies, but did so at early stages of the cases and through emergency requests for relief.

No lower court that has been confronted with legal challenges to the birthright citizenship order has embraced the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. Still, the Justice Department has argued that those decisions are wrong, claiming that the Constitution does not grant citizenship to the children of ""temporary visitors or illegal aliens.""

Section 1 of the 14th Amendment states: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""

Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, said, ""No president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.""

""For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump's executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress,"" Wang said in a statement. ""We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.""

Mr. Trump issued his executive order on birthright citizenship on his first day back in the White House. Under the plan, children born in the U.S. to parents who are either in the country illegally or on a temporary basis are not recognized as U.S. citizens.

The president's directive sought to reverse more than a century of understanding that the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces. The Supreme Court addressed the issue 127 years ago, ruling in 1898 that the Citizenship Clause ties U.S. citizenship to place of birth.

Mr. Trump's executive order is a pillar of his immigration agenda, but it has yet to take effect. The policy faced a slew of legal challenges soon after it was issued, and lower courts uniformly blocked its implementation. Then, the Supreme Court agreed to intervene during the early stages of three different cases, but did not consider the underlying legality of Mr. Trump's proposal.

Instead, the issue before the justices was the scope of relief granted by lower courts hearing the birthright citizenship cases, which had issued nationwide injunctions preventing the administration from enforcing the policy. The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, curtailed the ability of district court judges to issue those universal orders, but said plaintiffs could seek broad relief through class-action lawsuits. It also left open the possibility that states could secure nationwide relief.

On the heels of that ruling, two babies subject to Mr. Trump's order and their parents, as well as a pregnant woman, filed a lawsuit challenging the birthright citizenship order on behalf of a putative nationwide class. A federal district court in New Hampshire certified as a provisional class all babies who would be denied birthright citizenship by the president's plan and found that the order likely violates the Constitution.

The district court barred the Trump administration from enforcing the plan against all impacted by it.

The Supreme Court is taking up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit has weighed in.

It did not act on another appeal involving four states, Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, that had been before the high court in a preliminary posture. In July, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that Mr. Trump's executive order was invalid because it contradicts the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all born in the U.S.

The 9th Circuit split 2-1 to leave in place a nationwide injunction that had been issued by a district court in February, finding it was necessary to give the states complete relief.

The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to take up both cases and issue a final decision on whether Mr. Trump's executive order is constitutionally sound. Solicitor General D. John Sauer said it's a ""mistaken view"" that birth on U.S. soil confers citizenship, and said that understanding has had ""destructive consequences.""

But the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the New Hampshire case, argued that the Trump administration is effectively asking the Supreme Court to ""rewrite"" the Citizenship Clause and unwind more than a century of the nation's ""everyday practice.""

Arguments in the case are expected to take place next year, with a decision likely issued by the end of June or early July.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/24/28bfc2fa-282a-4146-8263-d5d979054654/thumbnail/1200x630g8/a8f0f74ea30bc2449d276fc4b3227733/gettyimages-2221594152.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 16:57:36.601062

On the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented parents or parents who have lawful, but temporary, residency status.

Several lower courts this year have determined that order violated the 14th Amendment, which automatically confers citizenship to those born in the U.S., as well as federal immigration law.

Responding to a request from the Trump administration, the Supreme Court Friday agreed to review a lower court ruling permanently barring the government from enforcing Trump’s order.

In asking the Supreme Court to review the case, the Trump administration claimed that birthright citizenship can only apply to children born to one parent who is a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident.

The lower court determined that argument contradicts the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause, which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship stems from his vast xenophobic crackdown on every form of immigration to the U.S.

Trump ran for a second term on promises to conduct “mass deportations.” Since taking office, he has presided over widespread, aggressive immigration raids and imposed a travel ban on citizens of 19 countries that he determines to be “high-risk.”

Friday’s move marks the second time the Supreme Court has intervened in a case challenging Trump’s birthright citizenship order.

In June, the court’s conservative majority struck down multiple bans to Trump’s order, claiming that individual judges did not have the authority to bar its enforcement nationwide. However, that decision did not address the underlying constitutionality and merits of the order.

These and other strategies are part of very organized preparations hatched to counter President Donald Trump’s hardline policy toward the nation’s immigrants.

The Immigrant Defense Network (IDN) — an umbrella group of about 100 immigrant, labor, legal, faith and community organizations — has trained about 2,500 Minnesotans to respond to actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including last month’s road on the Bro-Tex facility in St. Paul.

IDN-trained “constitutional observers” were also dispatched Nov. 25 to a home in St. Paul where an ICE operation turned into a melee and federal agents used tear gas and pepper spray against protesters.

These volunteers deploy observers to scenes of ICE activity and organize public demonstrations and other events in support of the state’s immigrants.

The observers, many of whom are multilingual, are trained and provided secure, toll-free phone and texting options, according to the IDN’s strategic plan.

Edwin Torres, the IDN’s network manager, said a rapid-response team was able to get to the Bro-Tex facility within 12 minutes, and the St. Paul home in 10 minutes.

But the new ICE operations are different, he said, and the “constitutional observers” are now arriving at a site after federal agents have quickly whisked the immigrant they were seeking away.

“We are not seeing large-scale operations this week,” Torres said.

Instead, there have been 20 ICE detentions of individuals — mostly of Latino men and a few Somalis, Torres said — and IDN can do little more than only offer help to tearful families of the immigrants who have been detained. Sometimes, there’s only a car with a broken window left at the scene.

Related: Do administrative warrants allow ICE to enter and search your house?

Undaunted, IDN members are patrolling the streets, sifting through tips to find those that are “credible or verified” and sending alerts when needed by text, email and phone calls to its constitutional observers.

Torres said IDN has a system that uses the boundaries of state House districts to determine which people to call to respond to an incident at a certain address.

Julia Decker, policy director of the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said the state’s immigrant advocates have had time to organize and train volunteers because “it’s taken a little bit longer for this type of surge to reach Minnesota.”

“So, we’ve seen, we had a chance to see some of the tactics that have been used by the federal government and other cities, and so there’s been a little bit more time to prepare and see what we are likely to face,” Decker said.

Trump has ordered immigration crackdowns on Los Angeles, Memphis, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Charlotte, N.C., and, this week, New Orleans and the Twin Cities. The president says the reason for the operations is to fight violent crime he attributes to immigrants.

In the wake of the shooting of two National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., last week, Trump said immigrant communities are “illegal and disruptive populations” that “hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for.”

Trump said his crackdown on the Twin Cities, which the Department of Homeland Security has dubbed “Operation Metro Surge,” was based on the involvement of Somalis in the Feeding our Future scandal, in which millions of dollars were siphoned off from a pandemic-era program aimed at feeding hungry children. Other scams included one involving reimbursements for assistance for nonexistent services for people at risk for homelessness.

But those involved in the fraud were a fraction of one percent of Minnesota’s 80,000-strong Somali community, most of whom are U.S. citizens or legal residents.

The day after he called Somalis “garbage” during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump doubled down on those comments and said Somalia “is considered by many to be the worst country on earth.” He also accused Somali immigrants of having “destroyed the country.”

Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that his agency is investigating allegations that tax dollars from Minnesota were diverted to the militant group Al-Shabaab in Somalia.

‘Living in a time where we have to be careful’

Torres said the idea for IDN was developed after Trump won the 2024 election.

The organization has a seven-member steering committee composed of a variety of both large and small immigrant advocates and human rights groups. They include ACLU-Minnesota, Ayala Leads, COPAL (Communities Organizing Latine Power and Action), the Minnesota Interfaith Coalition on Immigration (ICOM) and the Land Stewardship Project, a group that promotes sustainable agriculture and defends immigrant rights in Greater Minnesota.

Minnesota 8 — an organization that was formed to fight the deportation of eight Cambodian nationals in 2016 and is now an advocate for undocumented Asians in the state — and The Advocates for Human Rights are also members of the steering committee.

Dozens of other groups are affiliated with IDN, including CAIR-Minnesota, an organization that aims to protect the rights of the state’s Muslims.

But information about most of those allied with IDN is not public. And the organization pulled information, including a detailed strategic plan that lays out the group’s operational plans and political goals, from its website after Trump attacked Minnesota’s Somali community this week and his administration launched Operation Metro Surge on Monday.

“Right now, we are living in a time where we have to be careful,” Torres said. “At this moment we have to be more protective of what we have online.”

He said the group’s immediate goal is “to counter the hateful narrative” about immigrants that is coming from the White House with stories about how newcomers to the nation enrich American life.

“We can’t be OK with the rhetoric,” Torres said.

UnidosMN, which organizes Minnesota’s Latino community, is not under the IDN umbrella but also sends volunteers to try to disrupt ICE operations in Minnesota and western Wisconsin under its “Monarca” program.

“It doesn’t matter how many rapid-response teams groups are called for,” UnidosMN spokesman Luis Argueta said. “(IDN) may respond to one side of town and we to another.”

Argueta, however, said the current immigration sweep in Minnesota has prompted some collaboration and conversations between IDN and his organization.

He also said UnidosMN is receiving tips on ICE operations from both the public and elected officials.

A history of immigrant advocacy

Torres said the IDN also plans to lobby the state Legislature, seeking an end to agreements between ICE and local governments and sheriffs in Greater Minnesota, passing “affirmative resolutions” to aid immigrants in the state’s suburbs and advocating for public health and public school policies that are beneficial to immigrant communities.

According to the group’s strategic plan, IDN representatives also plan to spend at least five hours every week meeting with elected officials and “sector influencers” to lobby for immigrant rights.

Trump has characterized protests against ICE actions as unlawful and has characterized some protesters as “thugs” or “domestic terrorists.”

He has also blamed outside agitators and leftist groups for organizing the unrest.

The president’s supporters also share Trump’s views — that immigrants, especially those from Third World countries, are a danger to American society and the American way of life — and support the surge in deportations.

Yet Trump’s plans to crack down on Minnesota’s immigrants are running up against the state’s history and culture.

“Minnesota has a long history of immigration and refugee settlement, and this history has created a comparatively strong infrastructure of immigrant advocacy and support organizations,” said Llana Barber, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota.

Barber also said that Minnesota, particularly the Twin Cities, also has a “comparatively progressive political culture.”

“Many Minnesotans view the current federal enforcement efforts as grounded in racism and xenophobia and oppose them on those grounds,” Barber said. “They see current efforts to threaten and terrorize immigrants as part of an authoritarian expansion of state power, not a legitimate effort to enforce US law.”

In the 32 years she’s owned and operated her North Broad Street business “Ricard’s Inc.,” it’s taken plenty of sweat and toil to keep the lights on.

“I’ve survived hurricanes, the pandemic, the buyout of a partner, all of these things, and I’ve never been in a situation like this,” Krivjanick said.

But Krivjanick said she has recently started having trouble finding electricians, housekeepers, delivery drivers all essential to her work managing short-term rentals and selling restaurant, catering and janitorial products. People are not showing up or just outright quitting, she said, and she attributes this to workers being afraid that federal immigration agents will target people who have brown skin — even creole women, like her.

She’s not alone.

Broad Street traverses several of the city’s neighborhoods from Broadmoor to the 7th Ward. Long an epicenter of Black-owned businesses, Broad Street is now also a commercial hub for the city’s Latino community. The street and adjacent ones are peppered with a wide variety of businesses — hair salons, grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, auto repair shops, veterinarians and fast food stores. On the strip of Broad between Canal and Tulane, businesses such as Morenita Plus, Ideal Market and Botanica San Simon are frequented by Latino customers. On a normal weekday, music pulses from popular store fronts and people line up at Taqueria El Poblano for lunch.

But now, as the Department of Homeland Security launches Operation Catahoula Crunch, many in the Broad Street business community who spoke with Verite News, say they feel increasingly placed in a quandary: wanting to keep their businesses operating as usual but worried that customers and workers could feel at-risk of being swept up in the operation, which has a reported goal of arresting 5,000 people. They’re saying that the fear that’s gripped residents of New Orleans is negatively impacting business. Some business owners are taking small steps to help where they can.

Others expressed fear of speaking out and drawing the unwanted gaze of immigration agents. Many say that federal law enforcement using aggressive tactics to round up people they see as part of their community is not normal, desired or helpful for business.

“This is not America. This is not who we are,” Krivjanick said. “We don’t have masked men running up to us, grabbing us, throwing us into unidentified cars, you know or to beat us up on the street.”

DHS says the masks worn by many immigration agents protect them from people learning details about them and their families.

Krivjanick said the tactic makes people afraid of the government.

On top of the worker shortage, short-term renters are calling, Krivjanick said, and asking if the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement is still going to be roaming the streets around the New Year’s holiday or Mardi Gras. Those are times when Krivjanick typically expects her rentals to fill up. She doesn’t know what to say, because she doesn’t know herself.

In her experience, people come to New Orleans to enjoy themselves. Potential renters Krivjanick said, who’ve seen scenes from other Border Patrol operations across the country play out don’t think a confrontation with masked agents compliments the partying, drinking, dining and dancing people anticipate when planning a trip to New Orleans. Three potential tenants canceled on her earlier this week, citing ICE as a reason for cancelling, she said.

In response to Verite News questions about fears of people being targeted for their skin color, DHS denied that it engages in racial and ethnic profiling, calling allegations that it does so disgusting, reckless and false.

Allowing workers to stay home is one step some businesses said they’re taking to help alleviate the anxiety they’re hearing in light of stories of Border Patrol agents profiling and detaining people.

“I can’t ask anybody to come to work right now,” said Krivjanick, choking on some of her words, “I simply can’t, because I feel if I made pressure and said, ‘Hey, you know, if you come in, I’ll pay you a little extra,’ if I do that and something happens to the family, yeah, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.”

Tommy LeBlanc, co-owner of HEY Coffee Co., based off of North Broad Street, also said he didn’t want to encourage people to come out to an upcoming fundraiser if they didn’t feel safe. On Wednesday, he and his friend, José Chris Blanco, co-owner of Waska, a pop-up store that specializes in cooking arepas, were hosting an event at LeBlanc’s Broadmoor location.

A portion of the proceeds were set to go to a local nonprofit that serves some of the area’s Hispanic community, Puentes New Orleans. Blanco cooked food and said 70% of the profits from Waska would go to Puentes. LeBlanc said 20% of the day’s sales at his other coffee shop in Broadmoor would go to Puentes. LeBlanc’s shop also sells a coffee blend, café con sueños, that launched this summer and whose proceeds go to Puentes NOLA’s mission.

“We’re just trying to take the time to show our neighbors, our Latino neighbors, that they are cherished and welcome, as far as we’re concerned,” LeBlanc said.

Puentes New Orleans normally works to promote better outcomes in education, career development and cultural integration. But they’ve recently had to pivot into crisis mode, to address the fear and panic setting in among families as uncertainty around the immigration enforcement operation looms, according to the non-profit’s executive director, Angela Ramirez.

For Blanco, whose business is mobile and who has sometimes worked on Broad Street, spending a day cooking arepas so that 70% of the proceeds could go to Puentes New Orleans was a “no-brainer.”

“I love what they do, what they stand for,” Blanco said.

Blanco was born in Colombia, grew up in Miami, worked as a chef in Vermont, and started his pop-up around the end of 2022, he said. For the first time since coming to the country, Blanco is carrying around his green card with him, which he called “pretty wild.”

“I’ve never had to walk around with my residence card, and even that … doesn’t give me 100% protection against what ICE is doing,” he said.

As the Trump administration has deployed surges of immigration agents to cities around the country, they have been accused of detaining people based on the way they look, the language they speak or their place of work. American citizens have been detained in the operations, as well.

He also said he knows people who are not leaving their homes.

“Is this, like, Nazi Germany? Like, what’s going on?” Blanco asked. “People are hiding because they don’t want to go out because they’re afraid of being abducted.”

Blanco’s business partner, Marcella Garcia, said she sees the residents of New Orleans as a fearless people, and that she hopes that those who can will help protect the people who are the most vulnerable to immigration enforcement actions by raising awareness of what agents are doing.

Several Broad Street business owners would only speak anonymously for fear of being targeted by federal immigration agents.

One said he’s losing money in sales daily because some of his customers are afraid to come out to shop, and some of his employees are afraid to come to work. He said they’re scared to be targeted even driving around. In places right outside of the city, a routine traffic stop could lead to immigration detention and deportation.

Malaysia Walker, who’s a longtime seamstress and works as a general manager at Broadway Bound Costume Supplies, was sewing the base for a Mardi Gras Indian suit when she spoke with Verite News.

Walker said that as far as she can tell, her business has not been impacted by the operation, but she was personally not fond of the idea of expanded law enforcement in the streets.

“I do feel it’s an extreme way to handle the situation, and I think it’s going to bring more harm than good to the city,” Walker said.

On Tuesday afternoon at Coffee Science on South Broad Street, plastic whistles sat in a container near the sales register, as business was winding down for the day.

Co-owner Leah Vautrot said that the whistles are there for community members to use as a tool to draw attention to immigration agents to alert others of their presence and help prevent people from being isolated or quietly detained. She said that, as a community hub committed to social justice, the business felt a responsibility to stand up for its neighbors.

“Disappearing our neighbors off the street should never be normalized. That’s why we’re doing what we can, however small, to create resources that help our customers recognize when ICE is present, alert others, and draw a crowd,” said Vautrot.

Vautrot said that what she’s witnessing feels like something out of 1933 Germany, when Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and his Nazi party completed its takeover of the country’s government.

She also highlighted the important role that immigrants, foreign farms and global exchange play in the main product they sell — coffee — and she said she’s opposed to the idea of disrupting the livelihood of the families that enable their business “from origin to cup.”

“If we don’t stand up for dignity and due process, we’re complicit in a system that erases people,” Vautrot said. “And people are not disposable.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-85/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251202_czb_broadstreet_23-2048x1382-1-1024x6911764963310.jpg?h=37702503&itok=lDiP-qEz,N,,2025-12-05 16:57:30.425084

Under the order, which has never gone into effect, people born in the United States would not be automatically entitled to citizenship if their parents are in this country either illegally or temporarily. The challengers argue that the order conflicts with both the text of the Constitution and the court’s longstanding case law.

The announcement came in a brief list of orders from the justices’ private conference on Friday morning. The court will release another list of orders, including the cases from Friday’s conference in which it has denied review, on Monday at 9:30 a.m. EST.

The United States is one of roughly 30 countries, including Canada and Mexico, that offer automatic citizenship to nearly everyone born there. Birthright citizenship was added to the Constitution in 1868 when the 14th Amendment was adopted following the Civil War. The section of that amendment known as the citizenship clause provides that “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The amendment was intended to overrule one of the Supreme Court’s most notorious decisions, its 1857 ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford, holding that a Black person whose ancestors were brought to the United States and enslaved was not entitled to any protection from the federal courts because he was not a U.S. citizen.

In a related case in 1898, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Wong Kim Ark, who was born in California to parents of Chinese descent. By a vote of 6-2, the court rejected the government’s argument that Wong Kim Ark was not a U.S. citizen, with Justice Horace Gray explaining that the 14th Amendment – although enacted to establish the citizenship of Black people – “affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens.”

In his dissent, Chief Justice Melville Fuller argued that Wong Kim Ark was not a U.S. citizen because he could not be “completely subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States: as Chinese citizens, his parents had a duty to the emperor of China, and a federal law barred them from becoming U.S. citizens.

Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship spurred multiple lawsuits. In Seattle, one federal judge temporarily barred the Trump administration from enforcing the order, while a federal judge in Maryland separately blocked the Trump administration from enforcing the order while a challenge by immigrants’ rights groups and several individual pregnant women moved forward.

The Trump administration came to the Supreme Court in the spring. But U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer did not ask the justices to weigh in on the legality of the president’s order. Instead, the issue before the court was the propriety of so-called “universal” or “nationwide” injunctions – orders by federal district courts that bar the government from enforcing a law or policy anywhere in the country. After the Supreme Court issued its ruling in late June, holding that district court judges generally cannot issue such orders, challenges to Trump’s order continued in the lower courts – and lower courts once again ruled for the challengers.

In Barbara v. Trump, a federal district judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction that barred the Trump administration from enforcing the executive order against a class of babies born on or after Feb. 20, 2025, who are or would be denied U.S. citizenship by Trump’s order. And in Trump v. Washington, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that the executive order “is invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment’s grant of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

The Trump administration came to the Supreme Court at the end of September, asking justices to take up both cases. In its petition for review, it argued that the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause was “adopted to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens.” The challengers and the lower courts cannot rely on the court’s 1898 decision in Wong Kim Ark, it argues, because the parents in that case lived permanently in the United States even if they weren’t U.S. citizens.

Opposing review, the challengers countered that the Supreme Court has already decided, more than a century ago in Wong Kim Ark’s case, what the citizenship clause means. But in any event, they wrote, in 1940 (and again in 1952) Congress enacted a federal law that essentially codified the citizenship clause, and it did so with Wong Kim Ark in mind, so that Trump’s executive order also violates federal law.

On Friday afternoon, the court granted the Trump administration’s petition for review in the Barbara case. The justices apparently did not act on the administration’s petition for review in Trump v. Washington. If, as seems likely, the court does not take up that case, it will presumably remain on hold until the court issues its decision in the New Hampshire case.

The court also did not indicate that it intends to fast-track the Barbara case, which means that the justices will likely hear oral arguments in the spring, with a decision to follow by late June or early July.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1393695657.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:58:54.067863

And it says that the policy of the United States should be to help Europe “correct its current trajectory” over the course of the next several decades.

“The growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism,” the document says.
The United States’ latest criticism of Europe came on a day when trans-Atlantic tensions were already running hot.","The Trump administration said on Friday that Europe was facing the “stark prospect of civilizational erasure” and pledged that the United States would support like-minded “patriotic” parties across the continent to prevent a future in which “certain NATO members will become majority non-European.”

The grim assessment of Europe’s future was released overnight as part of an annual update to the United States’ national security strategy around the world.

Without naming them directly, the document says the United States should be “cultivating resistance” across Europe by supporting political parties that fight against migration and promote nationalism. That describes several right-wing populist parties like Reform U.K. in Britain and the Alternative for Germany, known as the AfD, which has been classified as an extremist party by German intelligence services.

“In everything we do, we are putting America First,” Mr. Trump wrote in a foreword to the document, which he called a “road map to ensure that America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history.”

In a section called “Promoting European Greatness,” the document offers a searing critique of America’s closest allies.

It warns that Europe is on a path to becoming “unrecognizable” because of migration policies that it claims are undermining the national identities of European countries. And it says that the policy of the United States should be to help Europe “correct its current trajectory” over the course of the next several decades.

“We want Europe to remain European, to regain its civilizational self-confidence and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation,” the 33-page document says.

Mr. Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the political leadership in Europe, and he has repeatedly pressured those leaders to bend to his will on funding for NATO, trade and tariffs. Vice President JD Vance issued a broad critique of Europe’s mainstream political parties in a speech in Munich in February and urged them to end the isolation of far-right parties across the continent.

The document accuses the European Union and other “transnational bodies” of undermining liberty and sovereignty, censoring free speech and trampling on basic principles of democracy to suppress political opposition.

“The growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism,” the document says. “Our goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory.”

Within hours of its release, the document was already provoking sharp retorts from across Europe.

Johann Wadephul, the foreign minister for Germany, responded on Friday by saying that Germany did not “believe that we need to get advice here from any country or party.”

He told journalists in Berlin that the United States was Germany’s most important ally in NATO but that “questions like freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and how we organize our liberal society here in the Federal Republic of Germany are not part of that.”

“It’s a frontal attack on the European Union,” said Brando Benifei, an Italian member of the European Parliament who chairs the delegation for relations with the United States. He called the document “totally unacceptable,” full of “extreme, shocking phrases,” and said some of its statements amounted to direct calls for election interference.

The United States’ latest criticism of Europe came on a day when trans-Atlantic tensions were already running hot. The European Union announced on Friday that it would fine X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, $140 million for breaching the bloc’s transparency rules, including through what it called the “deceptive design” of its blue check mark for verified accounts.

As rumors about the fine circulated on Thursday, Mr. Vance criticized the European Union for the expected move, writing on X that the bloc should be “supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage.”

The administration’s approach to Europe, as described in the strategy document, was in stark contrast to the way it said it would treat some countries in other parts of the world.

A section of the document titled “The Middle East: Shift Burdens, Build Peace” argues that while the United States should “continue to encourage” the countries in the region to combat radicalism, it should not overly meddle in their internal concerns.

It calls for “dropping America’s misguided experiment with hectoring these nations — especially the Gulf monarchies — into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government,” adding, “We should encourage and applaud reform when and where it emerges organically, without trying to impose it from without.”

The document adds that what is crucial to a successful Middle East policy is “accepting the region, its leaders and its nations as they are” and makes no mention of human rights issues like the treatment of women or the killing of a Washington Post columnist, which the C.I.A. believes was approved by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.

And it appears to echo Mr. Putin’s language by insisting that the United States should be “ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of NATO as a perpetually expanding alliance.”

Ian Lesser, who heads the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund, a research group, said that the document would reinforce Europe’s existing concerns about the state of the trans-Atlantic relationship and the U.S. position toward Russia, and that it might further embolden the far right in Europe.

“The piece treats Europe as a sort of other, one that is a model of what not to do,” he said, adding that it underscored that the United States was not isolationist, but rather “unilateralist.”

“It really reinforces existing concerns and puts a sharper edge on them,” he said.

Carlo Calenda, a center-left, pro-European senator in Italy, said on Friday that the document showed that Mr. Trump was an “enemy of Europe,” and “an enemy of democracy.” He said that efforts by European politicians to try to flatter Mr. Trump had not worked to promote their own interests.

“He’s a bully, and you cannot face a bully by being warm and kind,” he added. “It’s not the way in which you can manage him.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/multimedia/05trump-europe-ftvz/05trump-europe-ftvz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:58:07.416354

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court today agreed to hear an appeal in a case challenging President Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order that seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to many babies born in the United States.

The Supreme Court will hear oral argument in Trump v. Barbara. Courts have repeatedly blocked the administration from implementing the executive order, finding it violates the Constitution, over a century of Supreme Court precedent, and a longstanding federal statute.

The Barbara case is a nationwide class action, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of New Hampshire, ACLU of Maine, ACLU of Massachusetts, Legal Defense Fund, Asian Law Caucus, and Democracy Defenders Fund on behalf of babies who would be subject to the executive order.

This summer, the federal court in the Barbara case granted a preliminary injunction that protects birthright citizenship for all children born on U.S. soil.

Birthright citizenship is the legal principle, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, that every baby born in the United States is a U.S. citizen. The Trump administration’s order seeks to deny citizenship to children unless one of their parents is a U.S. citizen or has permanent immigration status, excluding children born to parents on temporary work, student, or other visas, or without immigration status at the time of birth.

This assault on birthright citizenship flouts the Constitution’s dictates, longstanding Supreme Court precedent, a statute passed by Congress, and fundamental American values.

“No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” said Cecillia Wang, ACLU national legal director. “For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump’s executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress. We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”

“Our Constitution and the more than a century of court decisions on this topic are overwhelmingly clear: no politician can decide who among those born in this country is worthy of citizenship. We will continue fighting this cruel executive order to ensure that every child born in the United States has their right to citizenship protected instead of being relegated to a permanent, multigenerational subclass of people born in the U.S. but who are denied full rights,” said SangYeob Kim, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the ACLU of New Hampshire.

“The Trump administration’s attempts to unilaterally rewrite the 14th Amendment — an essential Reconstruction-era measure that granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S., including formerly enslaved people — will not stand,” said Morenike Fajana, senior counsel at the Legal Defense Fund. “We look forward to going before the Supreme Court to uphold the constitutional promise of citizenship for all babies born in America.”

“It’s deeply troubling that we must waste precious judicial resources relitigating what has been settled constitutional law for over a century,” said Aarti Kohli, executive director of Asian Law Caucus. “Every federal judge who has considered this executive order has found it unconstitutional. If implemented, this policy would force all parents — including U.S. citizens — to prove their immigration status just to get a birth certificate or Social Security number for their baby, inevitably leading to racial profiling based on names, appearance, or accent.”

“The attack on the fundamental right of birthright citizenship is an attack on the 14th Amendment and our Constitution,” said Tianna Mays, legal director for Democracy Defenders Fund. “We are confident the court will affirm this basic right, which has stood for over a century. Millions of families across the country deserve and require that clarity and stability.”

‘The 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship as a bedrock principle on which Congress and the Supreme Court, together with generations of Americans, have worked to build a modern, democratic, and pluralistic society. By creating an unlawful regime where some American babies are treated as second-class citizens based on their parentage, the Trump administration is taking a sledgehammer to the foundations of that society. The ACLU will not let that happen. The court should use this opportunity to reaffirm its century-old precedents and confirm, once and for all, that birthright citizenship is here to stay,” said Carol Rose, executive director at the ACLU of Massachusetts.

Additionally, these same legal groups brought another birthright citizenship lawsuit, which is on behalf of three organizations with members whose babies born on U.S. soil would be denied citizenship under the order: New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, League of United Latin American Citizens, and Make the Road New York.",https://www.aclu-nh.org/app/themes/aclu-parent/img/press-release.png,N,,2025-12-05 15:57:50.615068

Wong Kim Ark.","WASHINGTON (CN) — After greenlighting its enforcement, the Supreme Court said Friday it will decide whether President Donald Trump’s policy limiting birthright citizenship is constitutional.

The appeal sets up a constitutional showdown over the meaning of the 14th Amendment that could result in new limits on American citizenship for immigrants.

In a day-one executive order, Trump declared the children of individuals who do not have legal status or who possess temporary legal status would be excluded from the “priceless and profound gift” of United States citizenship. The White House said the new limits were justified because immigrants without legal status and foreigners participating in “birth tourism” had degraded the meaning and value of American citizenship.

Immigrants, Democratic states and mothers quickly sued to block the order from going into effect. Several lower courts issued nationwide injunctions prohibiting the policy from being enforced.

Trump appealed to the Supreme Court, but he only asked that the justices weigh in on whether universal injunctions — that allow a singular federal judge to issue nationwide orders — were lawful. In a sharply divided 6-3 ruling, the conservative majority nixed universal injunctions, allowing Trump to enforce limits on birthright citizenship without deciding whether his order was constitutional.

The lower courts swiftly responded, finding a variety of ways to keep Trump’s order paused without violating the Supreme Court’s June ruling. A Maryland court certified children who would be subjected to the policy into a class — a legal process that assesses the commonality between a group of people within a class action. Another court blocked the order within the states that have challenged the policy as unlawful.

An appeals court then ruled that Trump’s executive order unconstitutionally stripped the children of some individuals without legal status of their citizenship rights.

Despite agreement from the lower courts, Trump urged the Supreme Court to intervene again, framing his order as a major policy of his administration.

“The order forms an integral part of the administration’s broader effort to prevent illegal immigration,” U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote. “This court has previously granted review when lower courts have blocked similarly significant administration policies.”

Under the 14th Amendment, “all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Trump claimed that people in the country illegally or temporarily are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the U.S. and therefore are not necessarily citizens.

The justices acknowledged that the case would likely return to them on the merits, but the families and nonprofits challenging the order said there are good reasons to deny Trump’s appeal.

Birthright citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution, a federal statute and 127 years of Supreme Court precedent. The vast majority of scholars considered birthright citizenship settled in 1898 when the Supreme Court upheld the right for children of noncitizens in United States v. Wong Kim Ark.

The families and nonprofits said that Wong Kim Ark already rejected Trump’s arguments.

“Petitioners offer no substantial reason to doubt Wong Kim Ark’s holding or its application to the categories targeted by the order,” the families and nonprofits wrote. “Their case amounts to little more than a jumble of historical misstatements, inapposite citations, newly manufactured doctrines, and — more than anything else — policy preferences.”","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/02/woman-and-child-immigrant-us-birthright-citizenship.jpg/w=1300,h=731",N,,2025-12-05 17:58:59.777292

An appeals court ordered the inquiry into whether the Merit Systems Protection Board and Office of Special Counsel are meeting their obligations amid Trump’s efforts to oust critics. Trump pushed the justices to pause the ruling, calling the inquiry a “fishing expedition” that risks intrusive and needless discovery and raises serious separation-of-powers concerns.

“If qualms about an agency’s ‘independence’ permit ignoring Congress’s decision to channel claims to that agency, it could be open season on agency-review processes in the Fourth Circuit,” U.S. Solicitor John Sauer wrote.

Chief Justice John Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee, quickly granted an administrative stay on Friday afternoon, temporarily pausing proceedings until the high court rules on Trump’s application.

The dispute began as a policy challenge to a rule barring immigration judges — U.S. attorney general-appointed attorneys who preside over deportation cases — from publicly expressing personal views on immigration. The National Association of Immigration Judges filed suit in 2020, but it was dismissed in 2023 for jurisdictional issues.

On appeal, the association argued the lawsuit should be treated as an enforcement challenge to an unconstitutional policy, rather than an employment action that must go through the Merit Systems Protection Board.

The Fourth Circuit, however, raised serious concerns about whether the board and special counsel can independently review adverse actions against federal employees, noting that Trump fired the Office of Special Counsel chief and removed merit board members earlier this year.

These and other adjudicatory boards were created under the Civil Service Reform Act.

Trump argued that Supreme Court precedent required that federal employees exhaust administrative remedies before filing a case in federal court. The administration chastised the appeals court for trying to revise precedent based on recent factual developments.

“‘[U]nelected judges’ do not get ‘to update the intent of unchanged congressional statutes if the court believes recent political events…alter the operation of a statute from the way Congress intended,’” Sauer wrote. “Further, the court of appeals’ unheard-of approach to channeling risks ‘far-reaching implications’ for all manner of jurisdictional schemes, which may be textually unambiguous yet susceptible to concerns that those schemes too are purportedly not working as Congress intended.”

If the Supreme Court did not intervene now, the administration warned that the government wouldn’t lose its opportunity to challenge the Fourth Circuit’s decision. The Trump administration said it would ask the justices to formally review the issue on the court’s merit docket to prevent other lower courts from issuing similar rulings.

“The court of appeals’ novel jurisdictional rule apparently demands constant relitigation of the present-day ‘functionality’ of the CSRA, as well as every agency-review scheme that might be said to have been undermined by subsequent factual events,” Sauer said. “Indeed, other district courts are already tilting at that windmill, perversely preventing the CSRA from working as Congress actually intended and depriving the MSPB of matters that Congress reserved for its resolution in the first instance.”

Roberts asked the association to respond to Trump’s application by Dec. 10.

Trump’s emergency appeal comes days before the Supreme Court hears oral arguments over the legality of executive branch firings on administrative boards.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/05/donald-trump-signs-drug-prices-executive-order.jpg/w=1300,h=731",N,,2025-12-05 15:58:52.634392

According to HRW, the man was initially arrested for unintentionally violating the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)’s directive prohibiting the use of drones in and around stadiums during sporting events, which usually only results in a fine. However, law enforcement officers asked the man about his immigration status and handed him over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The latter detained him and moved to deport him to his country of origin, where his life might be at risk.

The rights group explained that states and local law enforcement agencies that do not have arrangements with ICE, known as 287(g) agreements, should not ask people about their immigration status or arrest them to investigate their status. Additionally, agencies included in these agreements should take note of any inherent abuses and abandon them. HRW also pointed out that FIFA, as the World Cup organizer, should take action to address the impacts the US immigration policies might have on the running of the 2026 World Cup and ensure the safety of all eligible individuals during the event.

Rights organizations have criticized US President Donald Trump’s administration for its immigration enforcement measures, including raids and mass detentions, which have been cited as human rights violations. In September, an immigrant rights organization and Washington, DC, residents filed a complaint against the administration, alleging illegal arrests of immigrants. Authorities also raided a Hyundai-LG battery plant in the US, executing a search warrant with ICE and other law enforcement agencies, which resulted in the detention of over 300 Korean citizens. The latter were later released and repatriated following negotiations between South Korea and the US. On December 3, a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from conducting warrantless immigration arrests due to the absence of a risk of escape.",https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/03/foot_soccer_1615147613.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 14:57:35.493954

Advertising Afghans are not the only immigrant group that has been specifically targeted under the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown.","From her home in Tacoma, S has watched the flurry of immigration policy changes issued by the Trump administration in recent days with horror.

The Afghan woman was granted asylum in 2022 and applied for a green card in 2023, but has not received an update on her application since last December, when she fulfilled a request for medical records. She fears that application, now paused, may ultimately be denied, and that her asylum status, under new scrutiny, may be terminated.

If her case is litigated, “I would say to the judge, or whoever decides, that I would want to die here,” said S, who asked to go by her first initial because she fears speaking out could negatively impact her immigration case or result in attacks from the public.

“I will definitely be killed (if deported), but if I had the choice of dying here —” she stopped, her voice catching in her throat.

In the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members last week, allegedly carried out by an Afghan national, the Trump administration has begun a sweeping crackdown on immigration that could drastically alter the lives of immigrants already living in Washington state and those abroad seeking to come to the U.S.

Local advocates and service providers say the effects are already rippling across the state, as immigrants and their loved ones frantically call attorneys, scrape together legal funds, assemble personal documents and anxiously wait for any news about their cases.

The changes, by far the most widespread disruption on legal immigration since Trump’s return to office, were detailed in a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services policy memo posted online Tuesday.

All asylum decisions will be halted for people currently in the U.S., and asylum approvals issued during the Biden administration will be reviewed. The issuance of special immigrant visas to Afghans who assisted U.S. forces is suspended. Immigration applications, like requests for green cards or naturalization, filed by nationals from 19 countries, mostly in the Middle East or Africa, will be paused. And officials say they will also reexamine the green cards and immigration benefits already issued to people from those countries.

The exact number of Washington residents — including lawful permanent residents, refugees, those with asylum status and people seeking asylum — who will be affected by the new policies is difficult to calculate but easily in the tens of thousands.

Within 90 days, USCIS “will prioritize a list for review, interview, re-interview, and referral to ICE and other law enforcement agencies as appropriate,” according to the Tuesday memo.

‘Not much we can do’

S moved to the U.S. in 2015 to attend university on a student visa, she said, inspired by her readings at a U.S.-backed Lincoln Learning Center, including “The Diary of a Young Girl” by Anne Frank and books on the women’s rights movement.

“Women in these books were so much different, and were able to do so much more than I was,” said S, who graduated in 2019.

Once, when she returned to Afghanistan during college for a visit in 2018, she was physically assaulted over her work supporting women’s education there, she said. S and her parents also regularly received threatening calls. Things worsened in 2020 as Taliban activities increased in Afghanistan, she said. The killing of a friend, human rights worker Fatima “Natasha” Khalil, solidified her decision to apply for asylum.

“I suffered at the hands of the Taliban, and now I’m being labeled as a terrorist,” S said.

In federal fiscal year 2024 alone, which ended in September 2024, more than 12,500 refugees and other humanitarian immigrants made Washington home, including over 3,200 from Afghanistan. More than 32,000 people in the state obtained lawful permanent resident status in fiscal year 2023, according to the most recent publicly available USCIS data, including nearly 3,500 from the 19 “countries of concern” targeted by the new mandates.

The 19 “countries of concern” identified by USCIS are those under previously announced travel restrictions: Afghanistan, Burma, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela and Yemen.

At Asian Counseling and Referral Service in Seattle, at least one Afghan client had his citizenship interview canceled this week, said Alexandra Olins, director of employment and citizenship services. A client from Sierra Leone on the cusp of citizenship was told her oath ceremony, scheduled for Friday, was canceled.

“They got no explanation, no explanation about next steps, and their lives are just hanging in the balance,” Olins said. “It’s just so cruel, and there’s no benefit from it. … It’s just this collective blanket punishment.”

The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project has in recent days been reaching out to Afghan clients “to let them know we will continue standing by them,” said Executive Director Malou Chávez.

Beyond that, she said, “there’s not much we can do. We have to wait to see what steps the administration will take.” The nonprofit runs a project, currently serving 200 clients, helping Afghans apply for legal protections such as asylum, special immigrant visas and green cards.

How the Trump administration will review so many immigration cases and reexamine green cards remains uncertain. For years, USCIS has struggled to process a massive backlog of applications and petitions.

“There’s lack of clarity,” Chávez said.

There are processes for taking away immigrants’ lawful permanent resident status if they commit certain crimes or their green cards are found to have been granted in error, say because they misrepresented something in their application.

The removal of green cards cannot be done wholesale, Chávez said. The administration has to “go through every case and try to find a reason.”

‘In a state of terror’

USCIS said the increased scrutiny and widespread halt on immigration applications for people from “high-risk countries of concern” is necessary in the wake of the Washington, D.C. shooting on Thanksgiving eve that left one National Guard soldier dead and another wounded.

The suspect in that shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is a 29-year-old Afghan man who entered the country in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program created to help Afghan allies flee after the Taliban takeover. Lakanwal, who served in a secretive, CIA-backed unit, was living in Bellingham with his wife and five children and was granted asylum in April.

“In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people, USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is necessary,” the agency stated in the Tuesday memo.

Immigration advocates note many of the groups targeted under these new rules have already gone through extensive, yearslong vetting by federal officials. Refugees, for example, must prove they face persecution in their home country before they’re approved to enter the U.S., and undergo multiple rounds of interviews, background checks, medical screenings and more.

Meetra Alokozay, executive director of Sahar, a Seattle-based nonprofit that supports secret girls education programs in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, said the prospect of another round of vetting is anxiety-producing even for those, like herself, who have nothing to hide.

Alokozay, who was born in Afghanistan and, with her family, moved to Pakistan so she and her sister could get an education, came to the U.S. in 2018 as a Fulbright scholar and now has a green card. Before it was approved, authorities got her fingerprints and did a background check, she said.

“I’m more worried about people who are still waiting for a decision for their asylum,” she said. Many are in limbo and fearful they might be sent back to a country where they’re at risk, she added.

‘Even citizens are scared’

In Bellingham and greater Whatcom County, Afghans are “living in a state of terror right now,” said Jeremy Dorrough, executive director of Racial Unity Now, a civic organization dedicated to combating systemic racism.

Being repatriated to Afghanistan would be a death sentence for many Afghans whom Dorrough has spoken with, because they were allies for the U.S. before the military withdrew in 2021.

Many of the Afghan immigrants who have resettled in Whatcom County only have temporary permission to be in the U.S. that could expire in a year or more, Dorrough said. Community members have reported seeing their friends and family members’ asylum claims halted in the past few days, he said.

Eiman, a U.S. citizen living in Seattle who emigrated from Afghanistan in 2019, said her parents and siblings have already secured their asylum status. But with their pending green card applications now paused, her mother is terrified to leave the house.

“People are totally scared and afraid to go out,” Eiman said, who asked to use only her first name for fear of negatively impacting her family’s immigration applications. “My mom wanted to go to Costco yesterday, and she asked, ‘Can you buy groceries for me, because I feel scared?’”

She knows of several Afghan nationals with green cards who have canceled their holiday plans to visit family members abroad, Eiman said, fearing they will be barred from returning to the U.S. The return of rampant Islamophobia and scapegoating, similar to what Muslims and those often misidentified as Muslim (like Sikh men who wear turbans) experienced after 9/11, is an ever-present fear, Eiman said.

Afghans are not the only immigrant group that has been specifically targeted under the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown. Trump, who made a series of xenophobic comments about Somali immigrants Tuesday, calling them “garbage” who “contribute nothing,” launched a major immigration operation in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region targeting undocumented Somali immigrants this week.

Farhiya Mohamed, executive director of the Somali Family Safety Task Force in Seattle, said the president’s bigoted rhetoric and slew of immigration policy changes have left many confused and alarmed. She said her organization has started to reach out to legal experts for advice and organize meetings for community members to share updates.

“Even citizens are scared, saying we don’t know what’s going on,” she said, noting many live in mixed-status families. “Thirty years we’ve been here, we haven’t done anything.”

For now, immigrants across Washington remain on high alert for additional updates and guidance from immigration officials.

S, the Tacoma woman from Afghanistan, said she used to have nightmares every night she would be deported before she was granted asylum. When she won her case, she felt immense relief: “OK, I’m safe right now,” she recalled.

But that feeling of security has begun slipping away, she said. The nightmares have returned.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12042025_tzr_tzr_180150.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-05 14:57:38.671231

Billed as “a roadmap to ensure America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history and the home of freedom on earth”, the US National Security Strategy makes explicit Washington’s support for Europe’s nationalist far-right parties.

The document, with a signed introduction by Trump, says Europe is in economic decline but its “real problems are even deeper”, including “activities of the EU that undermine political liberty and sovereignty, migration policies that are transforming the continent, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition … and loss of national identities”.

The 33-page exposition of Trump’s “America First” worldview appears to espouse the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory, saying several countries risk becoming “majority non-European” and Europe faces “the real and stark prospect of civilisational erasure”. It adds: “Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognisable in 20 years or less.”

US policies must therefore include “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations” as well as enabling Europe to “take primary responsibility for its own defence” and “opening European markets to US goods and services”.

Responding to the strategy document on Friday, Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said the US remained a vital ally on security but “questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies” did not fall into that category.

“We see ourselves as being able to discuss and debate these matters entirely on our own in the future, and do not need outside advice,” he said.

The policy document, released by the White House late on Thursday, underscores the Trump administration’s clear alignment with Europe’s far-right nationalist parties, whose policies centre on attacking supposed EU overreach and excessive non-EU migration.

In language that will appear extraordinary to close allies, it says the US should “stand up for genuine democracy, freedom of expression and unapologetic celebrations of European nations’ individual character and history”, adding that Washington “encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit”.

With far-right parties either in government, supporting rightwing coalitions or leading in the polls in several EU member states, the document says the “growing influence of patriotic European parties … gives cause for great optimism”.

The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to foster closer ties with Europe’s nationalist parties, including Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). In September a senior AfD party figure visited the White House for meetings with senior officials.

On immigration, the strategy document appears to endorse the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which claims ethnic white European populations are deliberately being replaced by non-white peoples. It says it is “more than plausible” that “within a few decades at the latest” some European Nato members “will become majority non-European”.

It claims Europe must “remain European, regain its civilisational self-confidence and abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation,” arguing that the continent’s lack of assurance is evident in its relationship with Russia.

As Trump seeks an end to the Ukraine war that would most likely favour Russia gaining territory, the document accuses Europeans of showing weakness. Despite a “significant hard power advantage”, it says, many on the continent “regard Russia as an existential threat”.

It argues it is a “core interest of the US to negotiate an expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine” but that Washington “finds itself at odds with European officials who hold unrealistic expectations for the war perched in unstable minority governments, many of which trample on basic principles of democracy to suppress opposition”.

It claims that a “large European majority” wants peace in Ukraine but that this “is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those governments’ subversion of democratic processes”.

The document’s publication came hours after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, reportedly warned his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that the US could “betray Ukraine on territory, without clarity on security guarantees”.

The thrust of the US text echoes JD Vance’s brutal ideological attack on Europe at this year’s Munich security conference, in which the US vice-president accused EU leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration and running from voters’ true beliefs.

The document concedes that Europe remains “strategically and culturally vital” to the US, with transatlantic trade one of the pillars of the global economy and US prosperity. It also says the US “needs a strong Europe to help us successfully compete and to work in concert with us to prevent any adversary from dominating Europe”.

It adds that Washington wants to “work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd54696065078c42340ef81a1f7c6f9a7abda60b/1159_667_2682_2146/master/2682.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b38e7aa9ac1bd32985fa2a01bf43d4d",N,,2025-12-05 15:57:54.535813

🔍 What Happened: Title Funds Have a New Home

The Department of Labor is slated to become the new overseer of some of the largest and most impactful federal K-12 funding programs as the Trump administration continues its effort to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education.

According to six agreements developed by the federal education department, many of its key functions will be distributed to other federal agencies. That includes the administration of billions of dollars in Title I funds that support school systems with high rates of poverty, special education, and English language learner students.

Traditionally, the labor department’s focus has been on the workforce, with a stated goal to “foster, promote, and develop the welfare of wage earners, job seekers, and retirees.” It is the body that administers income support programs like unemployment benefits and litigates complaints of unsafe working conditions.

🎯What it Means:

After more than four decades of functioning with a federal education department, this change will be a significant administrative shift in Washington, D.C., Education Week reports.

How it will impact school and district budgets, however, remains to be seen. Districts’ reliance on these federal dollars varies based on their student population. For those who receive a significant portion of money through the Title program, any hiccups in the implementation of a new process or delays in cash flow could create major short-term problems.

Some administrators looking to get ahead of potential delays or hurdles in receiving the money may be prepared to cut programs or contracts that heavily rely on it.

If that’s the case, many education companies could find their contracts on the chopping block. A majority of providers say their district clients use federal dollars to pay for their product or services, EdWeek Market Brief previously reported. Title I funding is the second most common source that companies say their district clients use, behind district general funds.

🔍 What Happened: Pushback Muddies Federal Department Shake Up

A group of states is pushing back following the announcement that four other federal agencies would take over the day-to-day management of key U.S. Department of Education grant programs, Education Week reports.

Democratic attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia argue in an amended complaint filed on Nov. 25 that federal laws require the U.S. Department of Education to carry out its own programs.

The 1979 federal law that created the Education Department allows the secretary of education some latitude to reorganize the agency, but not as much latitude as the Trump administration has taken, the expanded lawsuit argues.

🎯What it Means:

Even if the challenge doesn’t stop the move of major federal grant programs, it could slow the change while the legal challenge is argued in court.

Secretary of Education Linda McMahon has previously acknowledged that the Trump administration needs congressional approval to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, which was a Trump campaign pledge. Last month, she described the interdepartmental moves as a “pilot program” to prove to Congress that the changes could work long term.

This challenge comes from the same coalition of states that sued months ago to stop mass layoffs at the Department of Education.

🔍 What Happened: Immigration Enforcement Hurts Enrollment

Increased immigration enforcement activities supported by the Trump administration, including raids in schools, are impacting some large K-12 districts, K-12 Dive reports.

The Los Angeles Unified School District — one of the largest districts in the country — experienced a drop in enrollment that exceeded its expectations, with the student body declining by 4% year over year. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho categorized the loss as “deeply connected” to the realities immigrant families are facing.

Miami-Dade County Public Schools in Florida and Chicago Public Schools have also reported enrollment drops that they say are related, at least in part, to new immigration actions.

🎯What it Means:

Any change to a school district’s population impacts the budget. In many states, K-12 funding is distributed on a per-pupil basis, meaning a loss of students translates directly to an unanticipated loss of money.

If districts are also seeing a shift in a certain population of students, such as English language learners, that could also affect whether they qualify for Title I funds or how much money they receive per student. State funding formulas generally offer increased dollars for students with more academic needs, including those learning to speak English.

In many areas, the declines in LAUSD, Miami-Dade, and Chicago are driven partly by lower enrollment of newcomer students, K-12 Dive wrote.

Owner and chef Christina Nguyen said it was the first such incident since the restaurant opened more than a decade ago.

""Definitely our first ICE encounter,"" Nguyen said. She believes her restaurant, which serves Latin street food, was arbitrarily targeted after the Trump administration deployed more federal agents to the Twin Cities. On Tuesday, Ring camera footage captured what neighbors said were ICE agents in unmarked cars parked in the restaurant’s lot while it was closed.

The following evening, two federal agents walked into the dining room during dinner service.

General manager Naomi Rathke said she had been reviewing ICE protocols with employees at the time to ensure they knew their rights, including reviewing information from groups such as the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee. After the agents entered, she said she asked them to present a judicial warrant.

“They said, 'We don’t need one.' I said, 'Yes, you do,'” Rathke recalled. She then asked them to leave, noting that a signed warrant is required to conduct immigration operations inside a private business. Rathke and Nguyen believe the officers were using intimidation tactics to instill fear in the restaurant's employees, including telling them that agents ""have the place surrounded.""

""I think that they were just saying a lot of things to try to intimidate and scare us into letting them in the back, which we didn't,"" Nguyen said.

“They don’t have power over me, they don’t have power over us,” Rathke added. “I’m not scared of them, honestly.”

Nguyen praised Rathke for her response. ""Seriously brave to not crumble under that pressure,"" she said.

According to Nguyen, the agents said they were searching for a woman whose photo they showed on a phone, though Nguyen says the woman does not work at Hola Arepa. “It wasn’t anybody who works for us at all, but you know, possibly to them, everybody looks the same, I don’t know,” she said.

Employees recorded videos of the agents leaving and turning the wrong way onto a one-way street. ""Just endangering others, driving the wrong way,"" Nguyen said. ""They were lucky because usually that street is incredibly busy, especially during rush hour.""

Nguyen said some staff members remain shaken. “People who are here completely lawfully are just afraid,” she said. She hopes the incident encourages others to learn their rights. “We just all have to stay strong together and be in solidarity with each other.""",https://media.kare11.com/assets/KARE/images/d3a5eba9-b0fb-4b57-8f54-00ba2ba6dc68/20251205T030727/d3a5eba9-b0fb-4b57-8f54-00ba2ba6dc68_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:58:15.041224

Washington’s Immigrant Worker Protection Act would not override adherence to federal law or duty to comply with a subpoena or valid court order.","Washington Attorney General Nick Brown has teamed up with Sen. Rebecca Saldaña (D-Seattle) and Rep. Lillian Ortiz-Self (D-Mukilteo) to propose the Immigrant Worker Protection Act.

The proposed legislation would:

Require employers notify employees when the federal government has requested their employment eligibility information.

Remind employers that they are not required to give federal immigration officials access to their non-public places of business unless agents have a warrant.

Make sure employers follow the law and only share employees’ personal data when a subpoena or judicial warrant has been issued.

“What we’re seeing from this administration is a campaign of fear that’s left many people scared to go to work,” Brown said. “This law empowers workers so they get the same information as their bosses do and have the opportunity to get their affairs in order.”

“Immigrant workers keep our communities and economy strong. They deserve fairness, respect, and the peace of mind to work and provide for their families,” Saldaña said. “This legislation protects them from fear and uncertainty, ensuring they can continue contributing to the strength and prosperity of our state.”

“Immigrant workers keep Washington’s economy strong, and they deserve stability and respect in their workplaces – especially as unlawful federal enforcement continues to disrupt families and communities,” Ortiz-Self said. “This bill not only protects workers, but also gives employers the clarity, resources, and support they need to understand their rights and meet their responsibilities under state law. The Immigrant Worker Protection Act ensures timely notice of I-9 audits, strengthens protections on the job, and upholds our urgent commitment to keep Washington families safe and together.”

Immigrants help power Washington’s economy

Washington’s prosperity would not be possible without the contributions of immigrants. At just 15% of the state’s population, immigrants generate 21% of Washington’s economic output, according to research from the Immigration Research Initiative.

The state’s economic engine thrives when employees and employers have a safe, predictable environment in which to operate. However, federal immigration authorities’ tactics have had a destabilizing impact on Washington’s economy, sowing chaos and fear in communities throughout the state.

“As an employer, I know in the case of an I-9 audit there are steps I would need to follow,” said Ana Castro, owner of La Salvadorean Bakery and Restaurant in White Center. “This bill just adds one step to that process and ensures my workers have a chance to provide any updates to their documentation. This bill will help me stay in compliance with federal law because ultimately I rely on my employees to help me keep employment records up to date.”

“The Immigrant Worker Protection Act is an important bill for Washington state. It will help protect workers' privacy and level the playing field between employers and employees,” said April Sims, president of the Washington State Labor Council. “This bill can help immigrant workers, and all workers feel safer at work and help them to know what their employer is doing with their personal information.”

“The Immigrant Worker Protection Act is an important bill to protect workers and keep them in the know about when and how their information is being shared,” said Danielle Alvarado, executive director of Working Washington. “Workers who have had changes to their documentation and legal status should have the same opportunity to get their paperwork in order as employers do.”

“We fought to have provisions like these in many of our collective bargaining agreements. We know employers can comply with requirements like this – many already are,” said Stefan Moritz, secretary treasurer of UNITE HERE Local 8. “If an employer has advance knowledge that federal immigration will be doing an I-9 audit, workers should have that notice too so they can seek their own legal advice on how to respond to the situation.”

“The National Employment Law Project is leading the fight for a good-jobs economy, where all workers, regardless of immigration status, have the right to dignity, safety, and fair treatment on the job. When exploitative employers use worksite immigration enforcement to retaliate against immigrant workers, these rights and labor standards are eroded for all workers,” said Marisa Díaz, Director of the Immigrant Worker Justice Program at the National Employment Law Project. “The Immigrant Worker Protection Act supports good jobs because it will expand worker protections and increase access to information on employers’ and workers’ fundamental constitutional rights.”

Millions of people in the U.S., including over 18 million children, are living in a state of fear and chaos perpetuated by the Trump administration, which has enacted a number of policies and practices explicitly designed to scare immigrants from accessing the limited benefits available to them. This includes restricting access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for humanitarian-based non-citizens in HR 1.

The chilling effect is further intensified by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) efforts to obtain taxpayer information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and to access benefit data from the Social Security Administration and state SNAP and Medicaid agencies. These efforts violate federal privacy protections and break explicit commitments that the government has made to beneficiaries. These policies also place mixed-status families, many of which include U.S. citizen children and adults, in a climate of fear, causing even citizens to avoid critical supports out of concern for the safety and stability of their loved ones.

Together, these measures will deepen economic hardship, destabilize family well-being, and increase food insecurity for immigrant and U.S. citizen households alike.

Public Charge Proposed Rule

The administration just took another step to create fear in immigrant communities. On November 19, DHS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that, if enacted, would rescind a rule put in place in 2022 that defines what could be considered in making a public charge determination for people seeking a U.S. green card or visa.

What Is Public Charge?

When someone applies for a green card or a visa, either to adjust their status within the U.S. or to enter the country, a government official reviews their application to determine whether they are likely to rely on the government for support. Under long-standing law and the current 2022 rule, only cash assistance for income maintenance and long-term institutionalized care at the government’s expense could be considered in determining if someone could be considered a public charge. This proposed rule would rescind those regulations without any new guidance in its place. This vacuum creates confusion over what programs or benefits could be considered in the determination, meaning that, if enacted, the officials reviewing the applications could consider any programs as cause to deny someone a green card or visa.

The goal of this proposed rule is to not only change this policy but to create more confusion, fear, and barriers for immigrant families to have essential supports.

Making up 27 percent of the population in the U.S., immigrant families are a large part of our communities, and half of their households include a U.S. citizen. As of 2023, one in four U.S. citizen children live with a foreign-born parent. Policies, actions, and proposed rules such as this one will only lead to more hunger and increased poverty.

Here at home, so far, things are mostly quiet. Farmers in western Wisconsin report no ICE raids on the dairies where 60% to 90% of workers are immigrants without legal status. There have been a few high-profile arrests and deportations in Milwaukee, Madison and Manitowoc, but nothing like the scenes of chaos in the streets of Chicago and Minneapolis, where masked federal agents are aiming guns at civilians, smashing out car windows and dragging parents from their children, hustling them off to detention centers to be fast-tracked out of the country without due process.

One of the most disturbing things about this campaign of terror is that it seems to be directed by the president’s whim. In a Thanksgiving post full of invective and schoolyard insults directed at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, Trump denounced the Somali community he claimed was “completely taking over the great State of Minnesota.” One week later, CBS News confirmed that ICE operations were underway targeting Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities.

Since we can’t count on the federal government to stay inside the bounds of reason or the law, it is critical that local and state leaders stand up to the racist, unconstitutional and unAmerican assault on immigrants.

It was good news when, on Wednesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court accepted a case filed by the state chapter of the ACLU on behalf of the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera, contending that Wisconsin law enforcement agencies do not have the authority to make arrests or keep people in jail on detainers based solely on ICE’s administrative warrants.

Tim Muth, the ACLU of Wisconsin’s senior staff attorney, said hundreds of people throughout the state are being illegally held for days.

“It is extremely important for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to determine whether any law enforcement in Wisconsin has the legal authority to put or keep people in jail when they have not committed a crime and when no judge has issued an arrest warrant,” Wisconsin immigration attorney Grant Sovern wrote in an email to the Examiner. “Anyone in Wisconsin would want dangerous people to be kept from the public. But ICE is currently making no determinations about dangerousness or the likelihood to show up for a hearing if a summons is issued. A summons is a perfectly rational and legal way to address a civil legal question like someone’s immigration status. Jailing people before any independent adjudicator determines someone to be dangerous is against the Constitution and not the Wisconsin way.”

At a press conference Wednesday, Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces, told the story of a landscaper in Green Bay who was picked up for driving without a license (immigrants without legal status are barred by a 2007 state law from obtaining driver’s licenses). He was sent to county jail and then handed over to ICE. “He was a grandfather, very active in his church,” Neumann-Ortiz said, describing him as “someone who does not represent any kind of threat to society at all” and who, on the contrary, is a pillar of his community and beloved by his family.

Voces helped fight the deportation in a case that is still working its way through the courts. “At least he’s out and together with his family,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “But that’s an example of how people can be impacted by this.”

As it scrambles to meet arbitrary deportation quotas, ICE sends detainers even for people who have never been convicted of a crime and have only minor charges pending in Wisconsin courts.

Voces has been fighting at the local level since the first Trump administration for local law enforcement to refuse to collaborate with ICE unless there is a judicial warrant for someone, meaning that person is being sought in connection with a serious crime. As a result of Voces’ efforts, that is now the standard in Milwaukee County. The state Supreme Court case is an effort to establish the same standard statewide.

Neumann-Ortiz said she’s grateful the Supreme Court justices recognized the urgency of the issue in agreeing to take the case on an expedited basis, “given the current level of abuse that we’re seeing happen, and which will only escalate.”

And, she added, “We certainly very much anticipate Milwaukee being one of the cities that will be targeted for militarized occupation with these aggressive sweeps.”

Whether or not Wisconsin communities can protect people from the kind of violence we’ve been seeing in other states depends on the courageous actions of state and local officials, advocates and informed community members. It begins with recognizing that the Trump administration’s actions are wrong and then standing up.

At the press conference, a reporter asked about ICE’s assertion that the agency doesn’t have room for everyone in its detention facilities and therefore needs space in county jails. Muth responded: “Detain fewer people.”

Neumann-Ortiz added some clarifying context. “They are profiling people, they are just grabbing people without any probable cause. So it’s a very racist program that is using violence against people and is trying to hijack, through bribery and through threats, local law enforcement to be part of this mass deportation machinery,” she said.

“We’re seeing, at the local level, community come together,” she added, “to reject these efforts to undermine local law enforcement — which is supposed to play a public safety role — into just this arm of deportation driven by xenophobia and racism. And which is making a lot of money for the for-profit prison industry.”

This year, communities across the state have pushed back on 287g partnership agreements between local law enforcement and ICE that turn sheriff’s departments into an arm of the federal immigration agency. Palmyra, Ozaukee and Kenosha counties rejected ICE’s offers of money to transform their sheriffs into agents of federal immigration enforcement.

The Kenosha sheriff’s office made its decision not to participate after the ACLU and Voces had already named it in the Supreme Court lawsuit, along with Walworth, Brown, Sauk and Marathon counties. Palmyra also reversed a decision to accept a large payment from ICE to participate, responding to public outrage.

“Resistance is happening, it’s successful, it’s building community,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “But we do need state protections to uphold our rights.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Neumann-Ortiz-2048x1148.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 13:57:46.978837

During that time, both Bocanegra and Ramos Jimenez were detained by ICE.
The complaint filed against Wilton alleged fraud, unpaid wages, and violation of labor law.","The co-founder of a staple South Wedge Mexican restaurant has been detained by federal immigration agents.

Omar Ramos Jimenez, 50, is originally from Mexico and has lived in Rochester since 2004. He and his wife founded and ran La Casa on Alexander Street and, before that, operated La Placita at the Public Market.

Family and friends describe him as a father, beloved neighbor and community leader, and accuse Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of lying to Ramos Jimenez in order to get him to their office this week and arrest him.

ICE allegedly contacted Ramos Jimenez on Monday and told him he needed a new phone app installed for reporting to ICE, and it needed to be done in-person at the agency’s Buffalo field office.

He first was detained by ICE in 2013 and paid a $1,500 bond to be released. Since then, he had sought to receive both asylum status and a cancellation of removal. He was denied those protections in 2020 but quickly filed an appeal. The appeal of that ruling is ongoing. Ramos Jimenez has meanwhile been complying with all requests and check-ins from ICE for the past 5 years, according to a federal complaint filed Wednesday by his attorney, Grace Zaiman.

When he arrived at the ICE offices on Wednesday, the complaint states, he was immediately arrested.

“(Ramos Jimenez) was told by ICE officers that their decision to take him into custody was due to changes in presidential priorities and policies and to ensure his future attendance at court hearings,” the complaint reads. “When (Ramos Jimenez’s) counsel indicated he did not have any scheduled court hearings but was awaiting a decision on his appeal, the ICE officers responded that by taking him into custody his appeal decision would thus be expedited.”

Zaiman did not immediately return a request for comment. The complaint alleges the federal government denied Ramos Jimenez his right to due process by failing to hold a bond hearing or an individualized hearing prior to his detainment. It is seeking his immediate release or a hearing on the matter, as well as an order barring his removal from New York.

Ramos Jimenez founded La Casa in 2013 alongside his wife, Maria Bocanegra, under the ownership of landlord Lyjha Wilton. The couple had previously run a successful Mexican restaurant, La Placita, at the Public Market in a building owned by Wilton adjacent to Boulder Coffee. While the couple had set up and established the restaurant, they were never listed as owners due to their undocumented status. The original plan was for the restaurant to be transferred to their daughter, Leila, on her 21st birthday, according to a federal complaint later filed by the couple.

The relationship between the couple and Wilton soured shortly after the restaurant’s opening. During that time, both Bocanegra and Ramos Jimenez were detained by ICE. The complaint filed against Wilton alleged fraud, unpaid wages, and violation of labor law. They settled out of court in 2015.

Ramos Jimenez no longer has any affiliation with La Casa, a family spokesperson said, and the new complaint states that for the past eight years he has worked in lawn care and snow removal.

Rochester City Council President Miguel Meléndez said the way in which Ramos Jimenez was detained only stokes more fear of how immigration enforcement is unfolding under the second presidential administration of Donald Trump.

“This is exactly what we have anticipated, in terms of them targeting anyone and everyone,” he said. “It's happening.""

Ramos Jimenez is also the father of Cassandra Bocanegra, the senior manager of organizing and strategy for the Finger Lakes chapter of the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC). Bocanegra declined to comment until later in the day Friday. NYIC and other immigration advocacy groups are planning a rally at 5 p.m. outside Spiritus Christi Church on North Fitzhugh Street.

The sheriffs contend that state law does not prohibit them from cooperating with federal immigration officials.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case, bypassing the lower courts.

Brown County Sheriff Todd Delain is one of five Wisconsin sheriffs named in a petition seeking for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to rule that it's illegal for local jails to hold immigrant detainees at federal authorities' request.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin filed a lawsuit Sept. 18 on behalf of immigrant advocacy group Voces de la Frontera against five Wisconsin sheriffs who have honored immigration detainers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The state's highest court agreed to hear the case Dec. 3.

An immigration detainer is a request from ICE for the jail to notify ICE before an individual is released and to hold the person for 48 hours after they should have been released under state law to give ICE time to pick up and take custody of the person.

The sheriffs named in the lawsuit are Delain, Dave Gerber of Walworth County, Chad Billeb of Marathon County, David Zoerner of Kenosha County and Chip Meister of Sauk County.

The Brown County Sheriff's Office is part of ICE’s 287(g) program under the warrant service officer model, which authorizes local law enforcement officers to serve administrative warrants on undocumented immigrants in jail and detain them until ICE takes over custody.

In April, the sheriff's office updated a long-standing contract with the U.S. Marshals Service allowing the jail to house federal inmates to include individuals in ICE custody.

With the contracts, there are two ways a person can end up in ICE custody but housed in the Brown County Jail: they are arrested by ICE or another federal agency specifically for immigration violations and housed in the jail through the Marshals Service contract, or they are arrested on local criminal charges and later transferred into ICE custody.

The ACLU argues in its lawsuit that keeping a person in custody for extra time under an immigration detainer constitutes a new arrest, and that it's illegal because Wisconsin law doesn't allow officers to make civil arrests except in certain circumstances — none of which are relevant to civil immigration enforcement.

The lawsuit also argues that moving people into federal immigration custody while their local criminal cases are ongoing ""disrupts the Wisconsin criminal justice process, potentially depriving victims of justice and defendants of the opportunity to defend against the charges.""

The ACLU is seeking for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to declare that civil immigration violations are outside the authority of a law enforcement officer in Wisconsin, and to prohibit the sheriffs from holding people on ICE detainers.

The sheriffs pushed back against the court taking up the lawsuit, arguing in a response that the matter does not warrant skipping a typical litigation process. They also argued the issues raised by the ACLU ""do not rise to the level of statewide concern,"" a legal precedent for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take up an issue before it goes through any lower courts.

The sheriffs argued there is no Wisconsin law prohibiting ""a sheriff from cooperating with federal immigration officials by complying with a federal immigration detainer request and administrative warrant.""

""The petition makes no attempt even to address the constitutional, statutory, and common law duties and powers of Wisconsin sheriffs despite challenging the authority of Wisconsin sheriffs to engage in a practice that has occurred for decades,"" the response said.

The state Supreme Court will accept arguments from interested parties before setting oral arguments in court.

The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill remains the largest in our state’s history—and one of the landmark spills in U.S. history.
The more recent 2015 Refugio oil spill and 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill reinforced our strong opposition to any offshore drilling expansion.","U.S. Representative Salud Carbajal (D-CA-24) joined U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) and 27 members of the California Democratic congressional delegation in condemning the Trump Administration’s official draft 2027-2032 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program that includes six lease proposals off the coast of Northern, Central, and Southern California. The plan proposes opening vast swaths of previously protected federal waters to new oil and gas drilling for the first time in over 40 years, disregarding bipartisan opposition.

The Trump Administration’s overwhelmingly unpopular proposal directly targets areas former President Joe Biden withdrew from future leasing in January 2025, when he protected 625 million acres. In their letter to President Trump and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, the lawmakers stressed that this plan would undermine state laws that prohibit new offshore drilling along its 1,110-mile coastline and ban new leases for oil and gas infrastructure in state waters.

“We stand united with the overwhelming majority of Californians who fundamentally oppose any proposal that would expand offshore drilling and risk our state’s invaluable, ecologically unique coast,” wrote the lawmakers. “This proposal, coupled with ongoing efforts to reduce federal staffing and funding for agencies that protect our environment, including for safety and oil spill response, is not only dangerous but outright reckless.”

“As we have repeatedly seen in California and other parts of the country, offshore drilling is a ticking time bomb,” continued the lawmakers. “Any expansion of offshore drilling in the waters off the coast of California and the spills that would inevitably accompany it would be devastating to the communities we represent.”

The lawmakers emphasized the devastating impacts new oil and gas leasing would have on California’s environment, military readiness, and diverse coastal economy, threatening the state’s tourism, recreation, fisheries, deepwater port commerce, and defense infrastructure industries. California’s marine economy accounted for $51.3 billion in GDP and $26.7 billion in wages, and pollution off its coast would significantly damage the state’s world-leading economy.

California began efforts to block offshore drilling in 1969 when an oil rig off the coast of Santa Barbara leaked 3 million gallons of crude oil into the ocean, blanketing beaches with a thick layer of oil and killing thousands of marine mammals and birds. It was the largest oil spill in U.S. history until the Exxon Valdez spill 20 years later. In the past decade, the 2015 Refugio State Beach oil spill and the 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill have further demonstrated the immense risks of offshore drilling expansion.

Last month, Carbajal hosted a press call with Central Coast public officials, environmental advocates, and business leaders to condemn the Trump Administration’s plan immediately after it was announced. In addition, Carbajal spoke at a national press conference hosted by Senator Padilla and House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-CA-02).

In April, Carbajal announced the reintroduction of the California Clean Coast Act. The California Clean Coast Act was the first bill Congressman Carbajal introduced as a Member of Congress, demonstrating his longstanding commitment to protecting California’s coast from offshore drilling and the devastating impact of oil spills.

Full text of the letter is available here and below:

Dear Mr. President and Secretary Burgum:

We write in strong opposition to the Draft Proposed Program (DPP) for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. We specifically want to express our strongest opposition to the inclusion of the Northern California OCS Planning Area, the Central California OCS Planning Area, and the Southern California OCS Planning Area in the DPP for oil and gas leasing disposition.

We stand united with the overwhelming majority of Californians who fundamentally oppose any proposal that would expand offshore drilling and risk our state’s invaluable, ecologically unique coast. This proposal, coupled with ongoing efforts to reduce federal staffing and funding for agencies that protect our environment, including for safety and oil spill response, is not only dangerous but outright reckless. As we have repeatedly seen in California and other parts of the country, offshore drilling is a ticking time bomb. Any expansion of offshore drilling in the waters off the coast of California and the spills that would inevitably accompany it would be devastating to the communities we represent.

In April 2025, California officially became the fourth-largest economy in the world, behind only the United States, China, and Germany in global rankings. Our economy is diverse and robust, including sectors such as tourism, recreation, fisheries, deepwater port commerce, and Department of Defense infrastructure. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), California’s marine economy alone accounted for $51.3 billion in GDP and $26.7 billion in wages in 2021. The economic well-being of these sectors is dependent upon a healthy and clean coastline. Further industrialization off our coast will inevitably pollute our beaches, spelling disaster for California’s economy and detrimentally impacting the rest of the country, which relies on California as an economic engine.

California is all too familiar with the devastating impacts of oil spills. The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill remains the largest in our state’s history—and one of the landmark spills in U.S. history. Immediate damage to birds, intertidal organisms, beaches, and the economy was severe. That experience galvanized Californians and secured an unshakable commitment to protecting our coastline. The more recent 2015 Refugio oil spill and 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill reinforced our strong opposition to any offshore drilling expansion.

Our Congressional delegation, state leaders, and dozens of California municipalities and Tribes have expressed their opposition through resolutions or comment letters, along with state groups and citizens. The bipartisan consensus against expanded offshore drilling has been clear and consistent over five decades. This has resulted in current state laws that include a permanent ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling along California’s 1,110-mile coastline and a prohibition on new leases for oil and gas infrastructure in state waters that enable increased oil and gas production from federal waters. As stated in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)’s Request for Information and reinforced by the comments BOEM received from our state, “As a result of Congressional moratoria, subsequent Presidential actions, and consistent opposition by the States of Washington, Oregon, and California to any activity off their coasts, the Pacific OCS has not been included in any National OCS Program since the 1987–1992 Program.”

In addition to the economic and environmental reasons for not expanding drilling off California’s coasts, our national defense would be better served by keeping additional oil rigs away from our shores. California’s waters and coastline are strategically vital, hosting a significant number of military installations, key logistics routes, and special-use airspace. Allowing oil and gas development, or the risk of spills, in areas where our servicemembers routinely operate would undermine military readiness and pose risks to national security.

For these reasons and more, we write in strong opposition to the Proposed Program (DPP) for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program.

Matthew R. Galeotti, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney John A. Sarcone III for the Northern District of New York made the announcement.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Rouse’s Point and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol Champlain Station are investigating the case. HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit in Washington D.C. and CBP’s International Interdiction Task Force provided significant assistance.

The investigation is a result of the coordinated efforts of Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and other transnational criminal organizations and eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating within the Americas that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the southwest border, the Northern District of New York, the District of Vermont, and the Southern District of Florida. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations and the Office of International Affairs, among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 425 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 375 U.S. convictions; more than 325 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its policy manual to cut the validity period for employment authorization documents from five years to 18 months.

The change is slated to impact job opportunities for admitted refugees, individuals granted asylum, those granted withholding of deportation or removal and those with pending applications for adjustment of their status, according to a document the agency published describing the updates.

“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the United States do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,” USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said in a statement.

“After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens,” he added.

USCIS and the Trump administration have ramped up immigration restrictions and enforcement after two soldiers were shot outside of a metro station in Washington, D.C., by alleged shooter Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who first entered the country in 2021 under the Biden administration’s Operation Allies Welcome program.

“In state fiscal year 2025, the average number of legal non-citizen residents receiving Kansas SNAP benefits per month was 9,483,” she said.
SNAP requires recertification case reviews to be done within the next six to 12 months, La Row said.
“Any family that is no longer eligible to receive benefits will be notified once that review has taken place,” she said.
“We have minimized our expenses as much as we can to prioritize direct services and support to the families,” Silva-Renteria said.","TOPEKA — The Trump administration in January cut off 36 people who were bound for Kansas when it canceled travel plans for refugees who planned to relocate to the United States.

Months later, cuts in aid through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act continue to eliminate needed food services for immigrants living in Kansas.

One refugee was a mother waiting to join her family, which had immigrated without her because she was pregnant and unable to travel, said Yeni Silva-Renteria, executive director of International Rescue Committee in Wichita.

Today, that mother still awaits approval to reunite with her husband and children who live in Wichita, she said.

“Now she’s stuck,” Silva-Renteria said. “People come to the office all the time, asking when is my son coming, when is my wife coming, and we cannot answer that at this moment. People are going through a lot of stress right now, and it’s very difficult. This world right now, especially within resettlement and within the immigration system — I’ve never experienced this much stress.”

That stress ramped up when new regulations for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program went into effect in November.

Many immigrants who had previously received SNAP support for food and Temporary Assistance to Need Families, or TANF, were kicked off the programs, including human trafficking victims and refugees, Silva-Renteria said.

Silva-Renteria stressed that anyone in the country illegally was never able to receive those government dollars, as is often erroneously reported.

Refugees, who often have been living in refugee camps for years before they are approved for relocation, usually receive a work permit and a Social Security card and, typically, eligibility for programs like SNAP to help them as they adjust to their new lives, she said.

SNAP and TANF are especially important when refugees first arrive in the country, Silva-Renteria said.

“The expectation is that within 90 days they’ll obtain a job,” she said. “Within the systems, we know that they’re not going to be self-sufficient within 90 days. Especially in Kansas, day care is a challenge, transportation is a challenge, the language barrier.”

It doesn’t mean that they’re not working, she said, or that they’re taking advantage of the system.

“There is an investment that we provide to those families until they get on their feet,” Silva-Renteria said. “These are people who have been at refugee camps for several years and have endured a lot of trauma. Some of them are the only survivors in their family. That support is critical for them because there’s no other way they’re going to make it without relying on that assistance.”

Eliminating support

Federal law previously allowed certain categories of noncitizen residents, such as refugees and human trafficking victims, to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, said Erin La Row, spokeswoman for the Department for Children and Families.

“In state fiscal year 2025, the average number of legal non-citizen residents receiving Kansas SNAP benefits per month was 9,483,” she said.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act changed eligibility, limiting it to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants and Compact of Free Association citizens, which is an agreement between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, La Row said.

Beginning Nov. 1, 4,039 individuals in the state were no longer eligible to receive benefits, although the loss of those benefits may not occur until DCF processes a review of their case, La Row said. SNAP requires recertification case reviews to be done within the next six to 12 months, La Row said.

La Row said DCF couldn’t be certain who would lose benefits until each case was reviewed, so after Nov. 1, all applications, reviews or other changes would be verified through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system, called SAVE.

“Any family that is no longer eligible to receive benefits will be notified once that review has taken place,” she said. “Additionally, we are working with the International Rescue Committee to determine how best to notify families, as that is the entity that engages with the majority of the population losing their eligibility for these benefits.”

The fallout

Silva-Renteria said her organization is doing its best to work with immigrant families as their assistance disappears.

“We’re doing a lot of outreach and communicating with the families. They have to understand this new change and see what that means for them,” she said.

IRC is connecting families with community resources and also using donations to its organization for food and other types of assistance.

Their work happens amid the organization’s own federal grant losses, including the shutdown of a grant funding its resettlement program that forced the layoff of 11 people in February.

“We have minimized our expenses as much as we can to prioritize direct services and support to the families,” Silva-Renteria said. “There’s only so much we can do.”

She and her staff have watched as immigrants have been vilified across the country, including online discussions and political comments after an Afghani immigrant shot two National Guard members.

Cautious about being misunderstood, Silva-Renteria said she doesn’t support violence in any way, but she knows that one person’s actions don’t speak for their entire immigrant communities.

“We do need a lot of support, obviously financially but also understanding and awareness that we’re dealing with people,” she said. “We’re dealing with families, children who deserve a safe space, a home, a place. Unfortunately right now, even within our community in Wichita, some of them may not feel as welcome or as safe just because of the climate.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-84/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-1024x6831764947325.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=jw7BfXHx,N,,2025-12-05 11:57:42.663391

• Asylum seekers to be housed in military sites instead of hotels This week, the Home Office opened Campsfield immigration removal centre in Kidlingon, Oxfordshire, where up to 400 migrants will be detained next to Oxford airfield.
As part of the asylum proposals, ministers will seek to bring in legislation to prevent human rights laws being used to frustrate deportations and make it easier to remove people.
The Conservatives said Labour had to be more transparent to allow public debate over its proposals to reform the way in which the ECHR is interpreted in British courts.
“Labour are refusing to publish key enforcement data and they avoid saying how many cases are affected by human rights laws.","Separate plans to reopen the Haslar detention centre in Gosport, Hampshire, have been hit by further delays and will not be ready until 2027, four years later than originally planned.

The immigration removal centre, which has been closed since 2017 because of major refurbishment works, was due to accommodate up to 600 beds. It has been cited as part of Labour’s plans to significantly increase the number of illegal migrants and foreign criminals deported from the UK.

• Asylum seekers to be housed in military sites instead of hotels

This week, the Home Office opened Campsfield immigration removal centre in Kidlingon, Oxfordshire, where up to 400 migrants will be detained next to Oxford airfield. It takes the total capacity to nearly 3,000 across eight immigration detention centres.

A report by the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford has warned that gaps in official migration statistics are hampering public debate and policy decisions on immigration, including on cases relating to human rights laws.

The migration experts has flagged ten major areas where information was lacking, including enforcement and returns, and the unknown size of the illegal migration population in the UK.

The research also raised how it was difficult to understand how many immigration cases were affected by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which has been subject to political debate including calls to quit it by the Conservatives and Reform UK.

Experts found there was little data to know who and how many people applied for and were granted permission to stay in the UK through the convention, or successfully appealed against their removal.

Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory, said: “The UK’s membership of ECHR is a major issue in public debate, in large part due to its impacts on migration policy.

“But the current data can’t give us a clear picture of where and when it has most impact. This makes it harder for the public or policymakers to make an informed choice about an important decision with long-term repercussions for the UK.”

Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, announced a series of reforms to both the asylum system and legal migration to cut the number of people coming to the country.

As part of the asylum proposals, ministers will seek to bring in legislation to prevent human rights laws being used to frustrate deportations and make it easier to remove people.

The Conservatives said Labour had to be more transparent to allow public debate over its proposals to reform the way in which the ECHR is interpreted in British courts.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “Labour have spent months hiding the very data the public need to understand what is happening to our borders. The Migration Observatory confirms what we have been warning about. Labour have chosen secrecy over honesty.

“Labour are refusing to publish key enforcement data and they avoid saying how many cases are affected by human rights laws. This Labour government is keeping the country in the dark because the truth would expose how weak and incompetent their approach really is.”

Georgina Sturge, the author of the Migration Observatory report, said the prominence of debate about the ECHR in British politics warranted much more thorough data on how many migrants were using human rights laws to remain in the UK.

She said: “We have some pretty major ongoing policy discussions that include big ideas about even removing ourselves from the ECHR and there are quite a lot of perceptions about how much of a role of human rights appeals play in the appeals system. But the data is very thin and we don’t have granular data to tell us how many people are getting leave to remain based on human rights, how many people are bringing human rights appeals and at what stage.”

The Home Office said: “We are furious at the level of illegal migrants and asylum hotels. Moving to large military sites is an important part of our reforms to tackle illegal migration and the pull factors that make the UK an attractive destination.

“We are continuing to accelerate plans to move people into Crowborough and Cameron Barracks, when the sites are fully operational and safe. We will not replicate the mistakes of the past where rushed plans have led to unsafe and chaotic situations that impacts the local community.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F25910b6d-7cef-4cba-b033-671786bee437.jpg?crop=7983%2C4490%2C0%2C192&resize=1200,N,,2025-12-05 11:57:47.038702

“Banished by Bargain: Third Country Deportation Watch sheds light on the human suffering behind these unlawful and secretive transfers,” said Uzra Zeya, President and CEO of Human Rights First. “Beyond their cruelty, these agreements reflect a transactional foreign policy driven by xenophobia—punishing non-citizens for seeking protections enshrined in law, while undermining human rights and setting dangerous new norms for migration management globally. We are working to hold the U.S. government accountable for policies that flout international law and endanger lives.”

“Our new tracker exposes how the Trump administration is methodically shredding the longstanding American principle of protecting vulnerable people from harm. These third-country transfer agreements frequently underpin harmful practices and human rights violations in other countries” said Jeremy Konyndyk, President of Refugees International. “These deals will put lives at risk. This Kafka-esque system of agreements risks creating a modern gulag of abusive detention. We are committed to pulling back the curtain on these arrangements and holding both the U.S. and recipient governments accountable on the global stage.”

Since early 2025, the Trump administration has expanded the use of forced third country transfers—sending asylum seekers, people granted withholding of removal under the Refugee Convention or the Convention Against Torture, and those with family ties in the United States to countries where they are often stranded, separated, detained, or face onward deportation, in some cases to the country they fled persecution. The practice—which began with the transfer of Asian and African asylum seekers to Panama and Costa Rica and Venezuelans to El Salvador’s CECOT prison—now spans multiple continents through a web of secretive diplomatic agreements with different qualities and quid pro quos. As part of its coercive deportation agenda, the Trump administration is also refusing to consider the asylum applications of thousands of additional individuals and instead threatening them with future forced transfer to third countries.

The new website offers an invaluable comprehensive picture of the diplomatic deals behind the agreements and their various forms. It details where people are being sent and how they are treated when transferred. It also provides resources for journalists, policymakers, advocates, and attorneys working to understand and challenge what is happening.

Human Rights First and Refugees International have long worked to expose and oppose abusive migration policies. Human Rights First is actively litigating to challenge unlawful third country transfers and so-called “asylum cooperative agreements,” as well as tracking deportation flights through its ICE Flight Monitor. Refugees International brings decades of experience documenting the harms of refoulement (return to persecution) and its recent, successful efforts to build public and political opposition to the 2019 U.S.–Guatemala Asylum Cooperative Agreement.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HRF_2025_linkB.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 11:57:51.332902

But what if that person committed a burglary in their late teens, served years in state prison, turned their life around, and now mentors at-risk youth?

Do the details matter? Researchers found that they do.

A new poll by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research examines California voters’ attitudes toward due process for immigrants with criminal convictions during the Trump administration’s nationwide crackdown on unauthorized immigration. The survey also examined support for how tax dollars are spent and Californians’ views on the state’s sanctuary policies.

It found bipartisan support for ensuring that immigrants facing deportation receive due process, including ones with criminal records.

“This survey shows that there’s clear concern about the current administration’s approach to immigration enforcement,” said Sara Knight, a research director at Goodwin Simon Strategic Research. “I’m not surprised by the results, but I am heartened to see how strong the support for due process is and the growing frustration with treating people inhumanely in our immigration system.”

President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise of mass deportations that targeted criminals, among other things, and he has made good on that. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested more than 160,608 noncitizens nationwide with criminal convictions or pending charges, since his inauguration.

The Trump administration has sought to expand the use of “expedited removal,” which allows immigration officers to remove certain non-citizens, like those convicted of crimes, from the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge.

Researchers say this latest poll by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research, released to CalMatters this week, also reflects waning support, even among a small majority of Republicans for the harshest immigration enforcement practices. It showed 84% of Democrats, 61% of independents, and 54% of Republicans agreed that “even if someone does have a record, they deserve due process and the chance to have their case heard by a judge before being deported.”

The poll was commissioned by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, both pro-immigrant organizations. Goodwin Simon Strategic Research describes itself on its website as an “independent opinion research firm.” Researchers wrote the survey questions and polled more than 1,200 self-identified voters. Knight said the partisan divide among those polled mirrored the party-affiliation split in the electorate. The margin of error was 3 points.

Some other recent polls echo similar conclusions released in recent weeks, including one released last week by UC Berkeley’s Possibility Lab that found one-third of Latino voters who supported Trump now regret their choice. Another public opinion poll by the nonpartisan research firm Public Policy Institute of California found 71% of Californians surveyed said they disapproved of the job ICE is doing. And, a CNN exit poll after the Proposition 50 redistricting election on Nov. 4 found that about three-quarters of California voters said they’re dissatisfied with or angry about the way things are going in the U.S., and 6 in 10 said the Trump administration’s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far.

Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, pointed to other recent national polls to argue the public supports Trump’s immigration policies.

“President Trump and Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem are delivering on the American people’s mandate to deport illegal aliens, and the latest polls show that support for the America First agenda has not wavered – including a New York Times poll that nearly 8 in 10 Americans support deporting illegal aliens with criminal records,” McLaughlin said in a written statement.

“The American people, the law, and common sense are on our side, and we will not stop until law and order is restored after Biden’s open border chaos flooded our country with the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” she continued.

From prison to ICE

In the more recent Goodwin Simon Strategic Research poll, 61% of voters surveyed said they want California’s prison system to stop directly handing immigrants over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation.

The state’s sanctuary law does not apply to immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes. State prisons have transferred to ICE more than 9,500 people with criminal records since Gov. Gavin Newsom took office in 2019, according to data released to CalMatters. So far in 2025, ICE has picked up 1,217 inmates directly from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the data shows.

The corrections department also provides ICE with information that helps the agency locate, arrest, and deport people who are not directly transferred. CalMatters obtained and reviewed more than 27,000 pages of emails between state prison employees and ICE. The emails show prison employees regularly communicate with ICE about individuals in state custody, including U.S. citizens. They often share personal details about their families, visitors, and phone calls. Often, these family members have no criminal records and are U.S. citizens

Newsom, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla, and Speaker Robert Rivas have all denounced ICE’s broader deportation efforts. But all three have also indicated some level of support for having federal immigration officials remove noncitizens with prior convictions for violent crimes from the community.

The governor has stated he would veto legislation that seeks to restrict the state prison system’s ability to coordinate with federal immigration authorities for the deportation of felons.

‘We may be deporting the wrong people’

Goodwin Simon researchers found that voters’ opinions change when they find out more details about the personal circumstances of a noncitizen with a past criminal conviction, even for violent crime. Pollsters gave two narratives to voters.

One was about a man who was brought to the United States from Mexico as a child. He got into a fight in his early 20s that left someone injured. The man was sentenced to seven years in state prison, where he turned his life around by taking college classes and helping other inmates get their high school diplomas. When he got out of prison, he was deported to Mexico before an immigration judge could decide on his case.

The other narrative was about a person closely connected to a man whose family fled genocide in Cambodia when he was a baby. In the U.S., the man was the lookout for a robbery when he was a teenager and served 30 years in state prison. Upon his release, prison officials turned him over to ICE.

“We may be deporting the wrong people. Although this last person did commit a crime, he has served his time and is now a valuable member of society, so it would be hard to say for sure if a person ever committed a crime deserves to be sent back. That is why the due process is important,” one Republican voter from Sacramento responded to the poll. She shifted her opinion from the view that people with past criminal convictions should be automatically deported to favoring a judge reviewing each individual case after hearing the narratives.

After voters reviewed both pro- and anti-messaging and the two stories, support for having an immigration judge review individual cases before deportation increased from 84% to 90% among Democrats; from 61% to 74% among independents, but it dropped from 54% to 51% among Republicans. Central Coast voters and Republican women voters increased support for due process by 9 points after hearing the stories.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125-socal-raid-pr-031764953191.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=XyGcjPBu,N,,2025-12-05 11:57:57.889138

Migrants who qualify for work permits The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would reduce the amount of time work permits are valid for refugees, asylum seekers and people granted asylum, among other migrants.","The Trump administration has made sweeping changes to the immigration system in the wake of last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan who received asylum in April, has been charged in the attack, which killed Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and seriously wounded Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe. Mr. Lakanwal has pleaded not guilty.

President Trump has cited the shooting to deepen his crackdown on immigration. In the last week, officials have issued a number of policies upending the legal pathways for immigrants to enter or live in the United States, particularly for Afghans and other people from countries subject to Mr. Trump’s travel ban.

For now, the new rules halt the ability of Afghans to obtain visas to come to the United States. But they also indefinitely prevent a broader swath of migrants already in the country from moving ahead with efforts to obtain benefits like green cards and citizenship. And they have halted decisions on asylum applications for people regardless of their nationality.

It is unclear how long the administration will pause decisions on asylum and other benefit applications. On Tuesday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said the hold would be “lifted by the U.S.C.I.S. director through a subsequent memorandum.”

Here are the major changes and who is affected:

Asylum applicants

The federal government has frozen decisions on asylum applications that have been filed with U.S.C.I.S. by migrants currently inside the country. That benefit is granted to migrants seeking protection in the United States because they fear persecution in their home countries.

The hold could affect as many as 1.5 million people who had pending applications with U.S.C.I.S. as of June, according to the latest government data.

The change does not appear to prevent people from submitting new asylum applications if they are applying within the United States. But decisions on new filings would be paused, immigration lawyers said.

Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization, said the halt on asylum decisions could be extremely disruptive for people who have already been waiting months or years for a ruling.

The pause affects citizens from the 12 countries that Mr. Trump subjected to a travel ban in June: Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

It also applies to citizens from seven countries with partial travel restrictions: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Citizens of those countries cannot enter the United States permanently or receive certain visas.

In a memo, U.S.C.I.S. said the hold affects benefits such as green card renewals, which legal permanent residents typically need to obtain every 10 years.

The pause on benefits has also effectively halted the citizenship process for migrants from the 19 countries subject to the travel ban, according to immigration advocates and officials.

In recent days, lawyers for migrants who have applied for benefits have said that some of their clients have already had their green card interviews or naturalization ceremonies canceled with little explanation.

Migrants from those countries who entered the country since the start of the Biden administration and were approved for benefits such as green cards, asylum and citizenship will also be subject to a reassessment, “to fully assess all national security and public safety threats along with any other related grounds of inadmissibility or ineligibility,” according to U.S.C.I.S.

Those people could be required to complete additional interviews with officers to defend their applications if federal officials find any potential discrepancies, said Jeff Joseph, the president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. That could mean more people are subject to deportation, he added.

“They’re going to be looking for everything that they can do to screen up people and put them in removal proceedings,” Mr. Joseph said.

Applying for benefits like green cards or citizenship could also take longer for other applicants, regardless of their countries of origin, because immigration officers will be reassessing certain benefits that have already been approved, said Sarah Pierce, a former policy analyst at U.S.C.I.S. who now serves as the director of social policy at the center-left think tank Third Way.

“This is an agency that is already over-strapped with very, very long processing times,” Ms. Pierce said of U.S.C.I.S.

Last week, the agency also said it would consider “country-specific factors” included in the travel ban as “significant negative factors” when evaluating applications for green cards and other benefits. The policy change, which could make it harder for immigrants from those countries to receive approvals, had been under consideration before the shooting of the National Guard members.

Migrants who qualify for work permits

The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would reduce the amount of time work permits are valid for refugees, asylum seekers and people granted asylum, among other migrants. Federal officials will now require them to renew their work permits every 18 months instead of every five years.

The Biden administration previously extended the maximum period to five years, up from two years, in an effort to reduce burdens on the agency that processes applications for employment authorization.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/multimedia/05dc-immig-explainer-fptm/05dc-immig-explainer-fptm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 10:59:07.088281

It happened at a simple green card hearing last Monday at 26 Federal Plaza. The building, home to ICE in New York, is intimidating these days, but Allen Dabrio Marrero and Matthew Marrero, married for two years now, felt confident.

""We were scared, but we also felt like we'd done everything right up to this point,"" Matthew Marrero said. ""My husband has been meticulous with his immigration paperwork. And we've paid all the fees, we pay our taxes, we do everything we're supposed to.""

It was especially surprising since he'd had hearings, gotten work authorization and even a driver's license since then and applied to school to become a nurse.

Allen Dabrio Marrero has been in detention since ICE officers took him into custody at that hearing last week but has been granted a stay that's keeping him from being deported, for now.

The couple is waiting for the chance to tell a judge this was a simple oversight, and that he should be home for Christmas.

""The way the narrative has been spun to the general public is that they're going after the worst of the worst. And that is not true,"" Matthew Marrero said. ""My husband is a contributing member to society, is proud to want to be an American.""

""The families, and the babies, and the people who are sitting out in the cold and the rain, just to get a glimpse of their loved one. This is wrong. This is wrong,"" Matthew Marrero said.

With the Dec. 8 candidate filing deadline fast approaching, the high court’s decision likely means Texas’ new map will be used for the 2026 midterm elections.

Justice Samuel Alito ruled that it was “indisputable” that Texas’ motivation for redistricting was “pure and simple” partisan advantage, which the court has previously ruled is permissible. Alito rejected the argument that Texas had engaged in racial gerrymandering.

The ruling is a major win for Republicans in Texas and nationally. President Donald Trump had pushed Texas to redraw its map over the summer, hoping to secure five additional GOP seats to shore up the party’s narrow majority in the U.S. House through the midterms.

Earlier this month, two federal judges barred Texas from using the new map for 2026, saying there was evidence state lawmakers had racially gerrymandered in redrawing the lines. Galveston District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, authored the opinion ordering Texas to return to its 2021 map, while 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith vociferously dissented.

The state asked the Supreme Court to overturn Brown’s ruling entirely, but that could take weeks or months to proceed through the court system, especially if the justices decide they want to hear arguments in Washington, D.C. With Thursday’s ruling, the justices have temporarily paused Brown’s ruling while that longer legal process can play out.

The ruling said the lower court, under Brown, “improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.”

The new map, approved by the Texas Legislature and signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in August, is engineered to give Republicans control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts, up from the 25 they currently hold under the 2021 map. Numerous Republican candidates have stepped forward to run in the newly favorable districts, while several Democratic incumbents were pushed into nearby districts already occupied by another Democrat, forcing them to contemplate primaries or retire.

Brown’s ruling upended those calculations. But in restoring the new map, the Supreme Court likely ensured that Republicans running for redrawn districts will get to campaign under the new lines in 2026.

Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated the ruling, saying it was a win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.”

Texas Democrats, meanwhile, condemned the outcome, with House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu of Houston saying the high court had “failed” Texans.

“This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won’t protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face,” Wu said.

In her dissent, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court for reversing Brown’s 160-page ruling “based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.”

“Today’s order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge,” Kagan wrote on behalf of the liberal justices. “Today’s order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47644/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-08-06-texas-redistrict-hearing-reuters-scaled1764892812.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=sN_F_b8y,N,,2025-12-05 10:59:38.572222

In a written order, the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit lifted an injunction that said the troops needed to leave the nation’s capital by 11 December.

The DC circuit’s order, while not a final judgment, allows Trump to continue a deployment he began this summer and has ramped up in response to a 26 November shooting of two national guard members near the White House.

The order came in a lawsuit filed by the DC attorney general, Brian Schwalb, a Democrat and the capital city’s top legal officer.

More than 2,000 national guard soldiers have been in Washington since Trump’s initial deployment in August, part of the president’s contentious immigration and crime crackdown targeting Democratic-led cities.

The guard troops in the city include contingents from the District of Columbia, as well as Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and Alabama.

US district judge Jia Cobb ruled on 20 November that the troop presence was probably unlawful. She temporarily blocked the deployment, but paused her ruling for three weeks to allow time for the administration to remove the troops, as well as to appeal her decision.

Rather than begin a wind-down, Trump, a Republican, ordered 500 more troops to Washington after the shooting of two members of the West Virginia national guard, which officials described as a “targeted” attack. One of the troops has since died from her injuries.

A 29-year-old Afghan national is facing charges for the shooting, prompting Trump to escalate his anti-immigrant rhetoric and declare a halt to immigration from what he called “third-world countries”.

Schwalb sued on 4 September, accusing Trump of unlawfully usurping control of the city’s law enforcement and violating a law prohibiting troops from doing domestic police work.

The president has unique law-enforcement powers in Washington, which is not part of any state, but local officials say he overstepped by taking over the mayor’s policing role and flouting laws that forbid federal troops from doing civilian police work.

Trump administration lawyers called the lawsuit a political stunt in court filings and said the president iswas free to deploy troops to Washington without the approval of local leaders.

Trump has also moved to deploy troops in Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon, to combat what he describes as lawlessness and violent unrest over his immigration crackdown.

Democratic leaders of those cities and their states have sued to block the deployments, saying they amount to an attempt to punish political foes with militarized shows of force.

Trial courts around the country have ruled against the troop deployments. The US supreme court is expected to soon weigh in on the legality of Trump’s use of the national guard in Chicago, a decision with repercussions for other cities.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81ff0974b16d5f219c7530321dae6917a12d82d/333_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26cf5146587ea2d2a01747d8aaf5e28d",N,,2025-12-05 10:59:10.071618

Mr. Miller and others in the Trump administration do not appear to know that those 1924 immigration restrictions are no longer on the books.","Sixty years ago, the United States abolished immigration restrictions based on nationality alone. By 1965, such discrimination had become an embarrassment. In an emotional ceremony by the Statue of Liberty, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared that the legislation he was signing “corrects a cruel and enduring wrong” and makes Americans “truer to ourselves both as a country and as a people.”

Now the Trump administration is reviving nationality-based discrimination. After an Afghan refugee allegedly shot two National Guard members on Nov. 26, the Trump administration “indefinitely” stopped processing immigration-related applications for all Afghans — even those who have lived legally in the United States for years. The administration extended that same suspension to immigrants from 18 other countries, including those on the verge of receiving green cards or citizenship. President Trump declared that Somalis are “garbage” on Tuesday, adding that they should “go back to where they came from,” and has threatened to denaturalize citizens. Meanwhile, his administration claims it can classify undocumented 14-year-old Venezuelans as “alien enemies” and deport them without judicial review.

Starting in 1875 and for most of the century that followed, country-specific immigration bans were the norm, not the exception. To be born in a disfavored country was considered to be inherently unfit to immigrate to the United States.

Nativism escalated gradually. In 1875, a law barred prostitutes from “China, Japan, or any Oriental country” from entering the United States. Although people from all backgrounds practiced the world’s oldest profession, Congress perceived women from these countries as a particular threat. “Virtue is an exception” among Chinese women, one lawmaker had claimed years earlier. Another had warned that these women “spread disease and moral death among our white population.” The law succeeded in shutting down immigration for almost all Asian women, prostitutes or not.

Seven years later, the Chinese Exclusion Act went further, barring all laborers from China. Once again, Congress relied on sweeping generalizations about the Chinese. “Alien in manners, servile in labor, pagan in religion, they are fundamentally un-American,” said one congressman, referring to hundreds of millions of people.

Once the nation started thinking this way, it was hard to stop. When a Jewish factory manager was accused of murder in 1913, his conviction fueled antisemitic xenophobia. Likewise, the 1921 murder conviction of two Italian anarchists, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, helped incite the Red Scare and the restrictive immigration laws that followed. At the heart of these crackdowns were not only assumptions of collective national guilt, but beliefs in a collective national character.

Nativist fervor culminated in 1924 with the Immigration Act. Aimed at slowing immigration from undesirable countries, the law capped immigration to 2 percent of a nationality’s U.S. population as of 1890, over 30 years earlier. It proved impossible to unwind Americans’ tangled ancestry, but no matter. The law was used to justify giving the majority of visas to Northern and Western Europeans, while strictly limiting immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe — a change celebrated by the Ku Klux Klan for keeping out Catholics and Jews. The door remained almost entirely closed to people from Asia and Africa.

Why would lawmakers choose to reject a promising scientist from Asia while welcoming an illiterate farmer from Germany? Because they conflated race, nation and culture into a set of immutable traits attached to entire countries. The national character was in their “alien blood,” lawmakers said, rendering some nationalities inherently unfit for membership in the United States.

If the Trump administration has its way, these assumptions will once again govern U.S. immigration policy. Last week, Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump’s immigration policy, defended collectively punishing Afghans for the shooting that killed one National Guard member and injured another. “You are not just importing individuals. You are importing societies,” he wrote. “Migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” Mr. Miller would have felt right at home in the 1924 Congress.

Mr. Miller and others in the Trump administration do not appear to know that those 1924 immigration restrictions are no longer on the books. Abolishing national origin discrimination was a sea change in law that stands alongside the Voting Rights Act as one of our most important pieces of civil rights legislation. That 1965 law allocated visas based primarily on family reunification and an applicant’s ability to contribute to the labor market. Every immigrant is individually vetted, and immigration is capped worldwide, but no longer are any nationalities automatically restricted.

America is stronger for it. Nearly half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children — and many came from countries that were heavily restricted before 1965. Immigrants generally commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans, and Afghans are no exception.

The recent shooting was horrific, and the perpetrator should be punished to the full extent of the law. But collective punishment is just the sort of bigotry that the nation rejected decades ago.

It’s also likely to be illegal. As the Supreme Court explained when upholding Mr. Trump’s first travel ban back in 2018, the president has statutory authority to suspend entry into the United States based on national origin, at least for some period of time. But that does not permit him to deny visas, cancel green cards or denaturalize immigrants based on nothing more than their country of origin.

Without question, today’s antiquated immigration system is in need of a major overhaul. But we should never go back to a system that made collective judgments about the worthiness of specific nationalities to immigrate to the United States — particularly not based on an incident involving a single person.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/multimedia/05frost-klpf/05frost-klpf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 10:59:15.098799

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D, Minn.) on CNN Sunday pushed back against the Trump administration's characterization of Somalis.","Driving the news: Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on Tuesday that her agency will be targeting visa fraud in Minnesota, where around 87,000 people with Somali roots live.

What they're saying: Trump said last week that he wanted to end temporary protected status for Somalis, which would impact approximately 700 people covered by TPS.

""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It's OVER!"" he posted on Truth Social.

The other side: Minnesota State Attorney General Keith Ellison suggested in a post on X that he may seek legal recourse if Trump removes the TPS protections.

""Trump's announcement of termination of Somali TPS holders in Minnesota is legally problematic,"" he wrote. ""While a president does have a lot of authority to designate and revoke TPS, he cannot legally wield that power to discriminate against an ethnic group or to target a state, like MN.

""This ain't over.""

What we're watching: The deployment of 100 ICE agents to Minnesota also starts this week, the New York Times reported.

""When ICE agents interact with Somalis here, they will find what we've been saying for years: Almost all of us are U.S. citizens,"" state Sen. Zaynab Mohamed (DFL-Minneapolis), said in a statement.

""This act of political theater is a waste of taxpayer money and will result in the harassment of peaceful American citizens trying to go about their day.""

Here's what to know about the administration's targeting of Somalis in the U.S:

The Trump administration's visa fraud allegations

Zoom in: Noem levied allegations of visa fraud this week.

""You told me to look into Minnesota and their fraud on visa programs, 50% of them are fraudulent,"" Noem said, blaming Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during a Tuesday Cabinet meeting, without citing evidence for the figure.

Walz responded to Noem on X, saying, ""We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime. But pulling a PR stunt and indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.""

Reality check: Ana Pottratz Acosta, professor at the Immigration and Human Rights Clinic at the University of Minnesota Law School, told CBS News the 50% figure ""doesn't sound plausible"" based on her two decades of experience.

""I think before giving any credence to those numbers, I really would want to see more specific data from the Department of Homeland Security to substantiate those allegations because they're very, very serious and really should not be made unless there is data or information to back up those claims,"" she said.

Acosta also added that the rate of immigration fraud is relatively low overall because the penalties for doing so are serious.

In a response to a request for evidence about the 50% figure, the DHS told Axios that Noem was referring to Operation Twin Shield, an investigation led by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, ICE and the FBI.

""Investigations found approximately half of the cases investigated were fraudulent,"" spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. ""This operation targeted cases including naturalization, H-1B visas, marriage fraud, and the Ukrainian humanitarian parole program.""

""USCIS is working to implement the most rigorous screening and vetting protocols in agency history,"" McLaughlin said, accusing the Biden administration of ""prioritizing sheer numbers over rigorous vetting and strict adherence to legal requirements.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said his police department, which includes Somali officers, will not aid federal agencies with immigration enforcement.

""Our values and our commitment to the Somali community, to every community of immigrants and people in our city, is rock solid and will be unwavering,"" Frey said at a press conference on Tuesday.

Fraud charges with reported ties to the Somali community

Catch up quick: In March, a federal jury in Minneapolis convicted the leader of a now-defunct nonprofit Feeding Our Future and an associate on federal charges for their roles in a fraud scheme that involved $250 million in federal COVID aid.

Feeding Our Future bilked funds from a long-running federal program for feeding needy children by claiming reimbursements for thousands more children a day than they served, a 2022 federal indictment alleged.

Prosecutors at the time asserted that officials loosening the federal program's rules in 2020 as pandemic lockdowns took effect had left the door open for abuse.

As of late November, 78 defendants in total had been charged for their involvement in the scheme, and there have been 50 convictions so far.

Zoom out: While thealleged ringleader was white, many of the defendants were Somalis, and most of them were U.S. citizens, fueling the Trump administration's scrutiny into the community.

Following Feeding Our Future, several other fraud cases involving Medicaid and Minnesota's autism program came out implicating members of the state's Somali community.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on X this week that his agency will investigate allegations that money stolen from Minnesota programs ""may have been diverted"" to the Al-Shabaab militant group in Somalia.

In 2018, similar claims about a child care assistance program funding Al-Shabaab surfaced, but the nonpartisan legislative auditor's investigation wasn't able to substantiate the allegations.

Federal prosecutors have rejected claims that defendants charged in recent schemes are linked to terrorists, and none have faced terrorism financing charges so far.

Former U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Andy Luger, who oversaw the Feeding Our Future case, told the Minnesota Star Tribune last week that the defendants his office prosecuted ""were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism.""

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D, Minn.) on CNN Sunday pushed back against the Trump administration's characterization of Somalis.

""Every state has a problem with crime, but what the President has done here is taken a horrific crime that occurred in Washington, D.C., where one beloved guard member is still struggling for his life, another was shot and killed. … He took that case, and then he went 2,400 miles away to Somalia and somehow indicted an entire group of people.""

""He tries to stoke division,"" Klobuchar said, ""and make people hate each other.""

The Trump administration threatens funding

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy threatened to withhold over $30 million in federal highway funding from Minnesota, citing concerns that the state improperly issued commercial drivers' licenses.

Duffy demanded Minnesota revoke licenses, blaming ""illegal foreign drivers"" for ""months of deadly crashes,"" accusing the state of doling out ""trucking licenses to unsafe, unqualified non-citizens.""

""My statement on this is, we are following the law exactly as it's written, exactly as we've implemented it for decades,"" Walz responded.

Flashback: Duffyrevoked $40 million in federal funding from California, claiming that the state wasn't enforcing English language requirements.

Between the lines: Between threatening SNAP funds to ""blue states"" and Duffy's threats over CDLs, the administration is targeting states where leaders have publicly brawled with Trump.

Every state Duffy has threatened has been a Democrat-led state, but he has said the department is auditing others, including Texas and South Dakota.

Walz, who has maintained that the state ""followed the law"" on issuing CDLs, suggested Tuesday that the administration's actions were retaliation for his online spat with Trump.

""Strange coincidence that the President goes on a rant and uses a slur against me, and I just asked him to do what every other president has done, release his medical records, and now they bring this in,"" he said.

The Somali population in the U.S.

By the numbers: An estimated 260,000 people of Somali descent were living in the U.S. in 2024, per the Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey.

Many Somalis began immigrating to Minnesota in the 1990s amid a civil war, drawn to employment opportunities and social services in parts of the state, Ahmed Ismail Yusuf wrote in his 2012 book ""Somalis in Minnesota.""

Context: Somali citizens were first granted TPS status in 1991, under former President George H.W. Bush.

There ""exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in Somalia that prevent aliens who are nationals of Somalia from returning to Somalia in safety,"" the U.S. Attorney General found at the time.

TPS status for Somalis has been either extended or re-designated 27 times since then due to ongoing conflict in the nation, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service earlier this year.

""It was never meant to be an asylum program,"" Noem said in a press briefing on Sunday, defending Trump's decision to end the TPS for nationals of Somalia, Venezuela and Nicaragua, among other nations. ""It was always meant to be put in place after an incident or an event on a temporary basis, and that's what the evaluation will be.""

Duffy has cited some of those directives as he has withheld congressionally approved transportation funds.
And administration officials have defended doing so, claiming that a post-Watergate law asserting Congress’ power over spending improperly restrains the president’s authority.
But a congressional watchdog and the courts have taken issue with that expansive interpretation of federal authority.
“The Constitution specifically vests Congress with the power of the purse,” the congressional watchdog wrote, arguing that the payments should resume.","Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been one of the most vociferous defenders of President Donald Trump’s expansive use of executive authority, withholding billions of dollars in federal funding to states and dismissing protests of the White House’s boundary-pushing behavior as the gripings of “disenfranchised Democrats.”

But court documents reviewed by ProPublica show that a decade ago, as a House member, Duffy took a drastically different position on presidential power, articulating a full-throated defense of Congress’ role as a check on the president — one that resembled the very arguments made by speakers at recent anti-Trump “No Kings” rallies around the country.

In an assertive, thoroughly researched 2015 legal brief, Duffy, then a Republican representative from Wisconsin, detailed the history of America’s creation in reaction to the absolute power of the English crown, invoking the Magna Carta and the Founding Fathers as he made the case for the separation of powers.

“Just as Congress may not bestow upon the President Congress’s own exclusive power to make, or to repeal, federal law,” Duffy argued, citing a 1998 court decision, “it may not bestow upon the Executive its own exclusive power of the purse.”

The brief went on to cite James Madison’s account of the Constitutional Convention, where there was “unanimous agreement that Congress, not the President, should control the purse.”

At the time, Duffy filed the friend-of-the-court brief in support of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau gets funded. Duffy, who chaired the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, maintained that the agency’s unique funding system — its dollars come directly from the Federal Reserve System rather than by a congressional appropriation — improperly bypassed lawmakers’ authority.

The 39-page brief was filed under Duffy’s name along with a nonprofit group aligned with the Republican legal activist Leonard Leo and submitted by a preeminent conservative lawyer. Today, it stands in stark contrast to Duffy’s own actions as transportation secretary in the first year of Trump’s second stint in the White House. Indeed, his attempts to restrict congressionally appropriated transportation funding across all 50 states this year have been condemned by a congressional watchdog and federal judges, resulting in stinging public rebukes from the other branches of government that echo his own 2015 position.

Peter Levine, a civics expert at Tufts University, said that while it could be that Duffy’s views on presidential power have evolved over time, his apparent flip-flopping on something as fundamental as the meaning of the Constitution raises the prospect that Duffy may “just be playing a game for power.”

“The Constitution is a promise to continue to apply the same rules and norms over time to everybody,” he added. “When political actors completely ignore that, and just go after their own thing, I don’t think the Constitution can actually function.”

In response to questions, a Department of Transportation spokesperson asked for a copy of Duffy’s brief. But after ProPublica provided it, the spokesperson stopped responding. A message sent to a number listed for Duffy hasn’t been returned.

The expansion of executive power has been a hallmark of Trump’s second administration. The president issued a whopping 214 executive orders between Jan. 20 and Nov. 20, according to the The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In both “number and ambition,” the orders and resulting actions are “exceeded on these dimensions in the last century only by Franklin D. Roosevelt,” one Harvard Law School professor recently noted.

Duffy has cited some of those directives as he has withheld congressionally approved transportation funds. And administration officials have defended doing so, claiming that a post-Watergate law asserting Congress’ power over spending improperly restrains the president’s authority.

But a congressional watchdog and the courts have taken issue with that expansive interpretation of federal authority.

For Duffy, the first instance came in May, when the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, concluded that the DOT had violated the law when it halted payments in February from a $5 billion fund for electric car charging stations that Congress approved under former President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law.

“The Constitution specifically vests Congress with the power of the purse,” the congressional watchdog wrote, arguing that the payments should resume. “The Constitution grants the President no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation.”

A White House spokesperson called the GAO’s opinion “incorrect” when it was issued and argued that the DOT was “appropriately using” its authority.

In June, a federal judge in Washington ordered transportation officials to lift the pause after a handful of states sued Duffy and the DOT, writing that when the executive branch “treads upon the will of the Legislative Branch,” it’s up to the court “to remediate the situation and restore the balance of power.”

The government has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, writing that it had revamped the grant application process for the charging station money and also that the states’ constitutional concerns were unfounded, since another part of the Constitution “vests the President with broad, discretionary authority to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” The suit is ongoing.

Separately, a federal judge last month sided with states that had challenged an attempt by Duffy to condition billions of dollars more in federal funds for highway maintenance and other core transportation functions in exchange for helping the administration detain immigrants.

“Should Congress have wished, it could have attempted to entice State cooperation with federal civil immigration enforcement through lawful means, and it could have sought to empower federal agencies to assist it in doing so,” John McConnell Jr., the chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, wrote in a Nov. 4 decision blocking Duffy’s actions.

But it didn’t, he said, and instead administration officials had “transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions.”

“The Constitution demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior,” he wrote.

The lawsuits are among hundreds of legal actions this year challenging the constitutionality of the White House’s various actions, including its attempts to halt the disbursement of hundreds of billions of dollars in government spending that Congress had previously approved.

As for the legal challenge Duffy supported in 2015, it was ultimately unsuccessful and the Supreme Court last year affirmed the constitutionality of the CFPB’s funding mechanism.

Yet the ruling has not insulated the bureau from the Trump administration, and officials have advanced novel legal theories to achieve what Duffy sought a decade ago. The administration now argues that since the Fed operates at a loss, it has no profits to transfer to the CFPB.

As a result, the bureau is being starved. According to a recent court filing by government lawyers, it will run out of operating funds by early next year.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2231496543_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2025-12-05 10:59:19.057270

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

U.S. Southern Command said that it killed four men in a strike on a suspected drug vessel in the eastern Pacific yesterday. Ismail Shakil reports for Reuters.

In closed-door briefings yesterday, Adm. Frank M. Bradley and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine are said to have told lawmakers that they assumed the hull of the vessel might have stayed afloat following the initial strike on Sept. 2 because it still contained packs of cocaine. They believed the survivors could have managed to float back to Venezuela, allowing them to try again to deliver the cocaine. Bradley denied that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had told him to kill everyone, and insisted that the follow-up strike was lawful. Helene Cooper, Megan Mineiro, Julian E. Barnes, and Charlie Savage report for the New York Times; Stephen Groves and Lisa Mascaro report for AP News.

The video footage of the strikes on Sept. 2 showed that around 30 minutes after the first strike, the front portion of the boat was overturned but still afloat, and the two individuals were visible, according to lawmakers and congressional staff who viewed the video and were briefed on it yesterday. The video does not show the survivors using any radios or satellite phones, according to sources, as U.S. officials had told the New York Times earlier this week. Helene Cooper, Megan Mineiro, Julian E. Barnes, and Charlie Savage report for the New York Times; Stephen Groves and Lisa Mascaro report for AP News.

The Defense Department is considering publicly releasing the video footage of the Sept. 2 strikes, Axios has learned. Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-AR) said he supports releasing the full video, adding that yesterday’s briefing “demonstrated exactly what I thought it would demonstrate – that these were righteous strikes completely within the law of armed conflict.” Cotton called the reports that Hegseth had given orders to leave no one alive a “total lie.” Other lawmakers emerged from the briefings feeling increasingly concerned about U.S. military action in the Caribbean. Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) said what he saw was “one of the most troubling things” he has ever seen in public service, adding “any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors — bad guys, bad guys — but attacking shipwrecked sailors.” Stef W. Kight reports; Josephine Walker reports for Axios.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

The Kremlin said today that Russia and the United States were making progress in peace talks, adding that Moscow is ready to carry on working with the current U.S. team. Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday however restated Russia’s demand for full control over Ukraine’s Donbas region, saying Moscow would take it by force unless Ukrainian troops withdrew. “We need real peace, not appeasement,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also said yesterday.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed concern on a confidential call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week that U.S.-led peace negotiations could pressure Kyiv into yielding territory, according to the transcript reported by Der Spiegel. Macron said, “There is a chance that the U.S. will betray Ukraine on territory without clarity on security guarantees.” Merz warned Zelenskyy that U.S. negotiators are “playing games” and that he should be “very careful” over the next few days. Andreas Rinke and Gabriel Stargardter report for Reuters.

Macron yesterday pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to help end the war in Ukraine during three-day visit to China. Marcon told reporters that the two leaders had discussed the war “at length,” adding that he hoped Xi would join efforts to achieve “at the very least” a halt in attacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine. Xi did not commit to anything, telling reporters, “China will continue to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the crisis, while resolutely opposing any irresponsible actions of shifting the blame or smearing.” Vivan Wang reports for the New York Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

The Israeli military said yesterday that its forces have killed around 40 Hamas fighters who had been trapped in tunnels below Rafah, in an area currently under Israeli control. Hamas has not officially confirmed the number of those trapped or how many remain in the tunnels. Maayan Lubell and Nidal al-Mughrabi report for Reuters.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

“We’re succeeding where so many others have failed and this has become the eighth war that we’ve ended in less than one year,” Trump said yesterday as he hosted the leaders of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at the newly renamed Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace. Trump went on to praise yesterday’s agreement, which is set to open up the region’s copper and cobalt reserves to U.S. companies. “We’ll be involved with sending some of our biggest and greatest companies over to the two countries,” Trump said. Fighting is ongoing in eastern DRC, and the economic deals agreed yesterday may prove difficult to implement due to instability in the region.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

New data shows that in ICE operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and across Massachusetts, more than half of those arrested had no criminal record, despite the Trump administration’s position that the aggressive operations are necessary because sanctuary policies have made it harder for federal agents to go after immigrants who have committed crimes. The data was obtained through a lawsuit and made available by the Deportation Data Project. Albert Sun reports for the New York Times.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced yesterday that some migrants will now be required to renew their work permits every 18 months instead of every five years.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Trump National Security Strategy was released yesterday, providing insight into the administration’s foreign policy strategy. The document focuses closely on increasing U.S. military presence in the Western Hemisphere to battle migration, drugs, and the rise of adversarial powers in the region, adding that this is largely about protecting the U.S. homeland. The document describes such plans as part of a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, a notion from 1823 that the U.S. will not tolerate malign foreign interference in its own hemisphere. In relation to Europe, the strategy sets out that the administration will pursue a policy of “burden-shifting” intended to make Europe “stand on its own feet,” as “the days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over.” Nahal Toosie reports for POLITICO; Ben Hall reports for the Financial Times.

The Government Accountability Office confirmed yesterday that it opened an investigation into Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, amid complaints about Pulte’s efforts to go after Trump’s political opponents. Ben Berkowitz and Courtenay Brown report for Axios.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Dream Act has historically attracted some bipartisan support.","WASHINGTON, D.C. (NEXSTAR) — Democrats and immigration advocates joined forces on Capitol Hill Thursday to call for renewed protections for young undocumented immigrants as the Trump administration ramps up nationwide immigration raids.

Lawmakers reintroduced the Dream Act, legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship for people brought to the United States illegally as children, often known as “Dreamers.”

Advocates say stepped-up enforcement has left many in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) community living in fear.

“Our communities are being hunted,” Greisa Martinez Rosas, the executive director at United We Dream, said, urging Congress to act.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) who is retiring at the end of his term, noted he has introduced the Dream Act every Congress since 2001.

A“I’m not giving up,” Durbin said, calling himself “a proud son of an immigrant” committed to helping the next generation. He also urged former President Barack Obama to create the DACA program in 2012, which has allowed hundreds of thousands of undocumented young people to legally work and live in the United States without immediate threat of deportation.

Since Pres. Donald Trump returned to office, advocates report that immigration agents have detained as many as 20 DACA recipients. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif) said one of his constituents, a deaf DACA recipient, was detained while working at a Los Angeles car wash.

“He cannot hear, but he was stopped and detained by federal agents,” Padilla said.

The Dream Act has historically attracted some bipartisan support. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is the bill’s lead Republican sponsor, though she did not attend Thursday’s press event. Padilla said many Republicans privately express support but have yet to do so publicly.

“All I’m waiting for is for enough of my Republican colleagues to express their support publicly the way they’re sharing it privately,” Padilla said. “They know it’s wrong for so many young people to be limited in their opportunities.”

The bill still faces long odds. Some Republicans insist Congress must focus on enforcing existing immigration laws before considering broader reforms.

“There’s a process by which you can come here legally,” said Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) “If you don’t abide by that process, you don’t have a right to be here.”

The Trump administration has encouraged undocumented immigrants to self-deport. While Trump has not moved to end DACA during his current term, he attempted to do so in 2017, an effort the Supreme Court blocked in 2020. The administration is now pursuing actions to prevent DACA recipients from accessing certain federal health and education benefits.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/AP25249755383898-e1757597058271.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-05 10:59:24.277499

They argued the new election map for Texas was drawn based on partisan advantage, not the race of the voters.
They cited the so-called “Purcell principle” as grounds for setting aside the district court ruling because it came to close to an impending election.
“Texas has also made a strong showing of irreparable harm and that the equities and public interest favor it,” the Supreme Court ruling said.
The District Court violated that rule here.” Acting at the behest of President Trump, Texas Gov.","The Supreme Court ruled for Texas and its GOP leaders on Thursday, clearing the way for the state to use a new election map in 2026 that is expected to send five more Republicans to Congress.

The justices set aside, for now, a 2-1 ruling by district judges who called the state’s map a racial gerrymander. Thursday’s vote was 6-3 along the usual lines, with the conservative justices in the majority and the three liberals in dissent.

The court’s five-paragraph order said the district judges “failed to honor the presumption of legislative good faith by construing ambiguous direct and circumstantial evidence against the legislature.”

“The impetus for the adoption of the Texas map (like the map subsequently adopted in California) was partisan advantage pure and simple,” wrote Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. in a concurring opinion.

Texas lawmakers had said they acted out of partisan motives, not racial ones.

“Today’s order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge — that put aside every consideration except getting the issue before it right,” wrote Justice Elena Kagan in dissent. “And today’s order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race. Because this Court’s precedents and our Constitution demand better, I respectfully dissent.”

She was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The decision bolsters Republicans in their bid to retain control of the House, and it’s a setback for Democrats and voting rights advocates.

It is consistent with the conservative majority’s view that drawing election districts is a “political question” left to state lawmakers, not judges. But in the past, the court also said racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional under the 14th and 15th Amendments.

In response to the Texas mid-decade redistricting, California Gov. Gavin Newsom won voters’ approval for redrawing his state’s congressional districts with the aim of electing five more Democrats in 2026.

On Nov. 21, Texas state’s attorneys filed an emergency appeal at the Supreme Court, urging the justices to act quickly to block the lower court’s ruling.

They argued the new election map for Texas was drawn based on partisan advantage, not the race of the voters. And they said a further delay would disrupt the next election because Dec. 8 is the filing deadline for candidates.

They cited the so-called “Purcell principle” as grounds for setting aside the district court ruling because it came to close to an impending election.

The Texas mid-decade restricting arose in July.

“Texas has also made a strong showing of irreparable harm and that the equities and public interest favor it,” the Supreme Court ruling said. “This Court has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election. The District Court violated that rule here.”

Acting at the behest of President Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called for a special session of the Legislature to redraw its 38 congressional voting districts with the aim of ousting five Democrats from the House of Representatives.

As justification, he cited the “constitutional concerns” raised by Harmeet Dhillon, the head of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice.

She contended the state had several unconstitutional “coalition districts” which had a “non-White” majority made up of Black and Latino voters.

Voting rights advocates said Texas Republicans followed her view and redrew districts near Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth to erase those where Latino and Black voters formed a majority.

U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown said the evidence showed the Texas “Legislature had redistricted not for the political goal of appeasing President Trump nor of gaining five Republican U.S. House seats, but to achieve DOJ’s racial goal of eliminating coalition districts.”

If so, he said, the new map should be set aside, and the state should use the 2021 map drawn by the GOP.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/75d89e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F42%2F3bc5af52ca0364da41a6a470435e%2Fdac9254fd08e4a8c8f57f299e4ae126d,N,,2025-12-05 07:57:23.343265

The surge by Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to target individuals in the Twin Cities area with deportation orders, the official said. The exact scope and duration of the operation are not clear so far.

The crackdown comes as Mr. Trump castigates Minnesota's large community of Somali immigrants, regularly pointing to the country — often in incendiary terms — as a justification for his administration's sweeping mass deportation campaign.

During a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump called people from Somalia ""garbage"" and claimed they ""contribute nothing.""

""I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,"" the president said Tuesday. ""Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.""

In recent days, the Trump administration has halted all immigration cases, including citizenship ceremonies, for people from Somalia and 18 other nations on its travel ban, and has ordered a reexamination of all green cards issued to immigrants from those countries, CBS News has reported.

And last month, Mr. Trump said he was ending a deportation protection program called Temporary Protected Status for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, claiming without evidence that ""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people."" The TPS program for Somalia is set to expire in March 2026, though the Department of Homeland Security has not formally announced its termination.

Mr. Trump has also brought attention to a massive public assistance fraud scandal that has dogged Minnesota politics for years, in which dozens of defendants — most of whom are of Somali descent — were accused of bilking hundreds of millions of dollars from food aid, autism services and housing programs. The president has blamed Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the fraud schemes and claimed Somali immigrants have ""ripped off that state.""

Democratic officials and members of Minnesota's Somali community have denounced Mr. Trump's statements, with Walz on Thursday calling them ""vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.""

""I am not garbage,"" Hamse Warfa, a Somali-born entrepreneur who lives in the Minneapolis area and runs a nationwide education nonprofit, told CBS News Minnesota. ""I'm a proud American citizen.""

Minnesota has one of the country's largest Somali populations, with some 76,000 people of Somali descent statewide — representing just over 1% of the state's population, according to 2024 data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

The state's Somali community grew after the East African country descended into civil war in the early 1990s, causing scores of people to flee Somalia, which still faces instability, threats of insurgency and poverty.

In some cases, Somali refugees were resettled elsewhere in the U.S. before moving to Minnesota, drawn in many cases by job opportunities, safety, good schools and a longstanding network of nonprofits in the state that assist refugees, Somali American and Macalester College professor Ahmed Samatar told CBS News Minnesota in 2019. Just over half of Somali Minnesotans arrived in the U.S. before 2010, and one in five moved to the U.S. before 2000.

As of last year, the vast majority of Somali Minnesotans were American citizens.

“ICE law enforcement are risking their lives to protect Minnesotans while their own elected officials sit by and do nothing.","Federal officials say they arrested the “worst of the worst” undocumented immigrants during a law enforcement operation in Minneapolis this week.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the arrests of 12 people with varying levels of criminal history.

The dozen people are from Somalia, Mexico and El Salvador, according to DHS. Federal officials say eight of them have been charged or convicted of crimes, including DUI, criminal sexual conduct, domestic violence, and assault, but didn’t specify when or where.

A search of Minnesota court case records showed 11 convictions between three of the men, with seven of those convictions occurring over a decade ago.

There are no publicly available records for the others, although it is possible they were charged or convicted in another state.

The men that DHS officials say have previous convictions were named as:

Abdulkadir Sharif Abdi

Sahal Osman Shidane

Mukthar Mohamed Ali

Ahmed Mohamed Said

Rudy Arendondo Jarillo

Alberto Gallardo-Montiel

Ismael Bonilla Avalos

Feisal Mohamed-Omar

Four of the arrestees had no listed criminal history. Their names and reasons for arrest are below.

Alvaro Davila Alanis was arrested for aggravated assault with a weapon.

Oscar David Ayala-Ocampo was arrested for domestic violence.

Ismael Higuera Chupin was arrested for driving under the influence.

Carlos Mark Boquin-Alfaro was arrested for domestic violence.

“Sanctuary policies and politicians like Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey allowed these pedophiles, domestic terrorists, and gang members to roam the streets and terrorize Americans,” said Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “ICE law enforcement are risking their lives to protect Minnesotans while their own elected officials sit by and do nothing. No matter when and where, ICE will find, arrest, and deport ALL criminal illegal aliens.”

Apple Valley mom detained

“We’re trying to do whatever we can,” a man named Abdul, who doesn’t want to share his last name, quietly told 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS on Thursday.

The Apple Valley father-of-three spoke with reporter Richard Reeve outside the Whipple Federal Building near Fort Snelling, where his wife is being held in ICE custody.

“I’m an American citizen, all her children are American citizens,” Abdul said. “She was working for over 20 years in the area, especially with refugee settlement. She never had any crime.”

He says his wife was driving on Thursday to pick up her 11-year-old son at school, after the boy complained about not feeling well.

The woman says she was driving along Highway 77 when she was blocked in by several unmarked SUVs, and that one of the people detaining her said he had a warrant and that she was under arrest.

Steven Thal, her attorney, says that many years ago, an immigration judge granted the 45-year-old mother “withholding of removal,” which means she can’t be deported back to her native Somalia.

He says he’s still working to learn why his client was picked up by ICE agents.

“She’s able to live and work here in the United States,” Thal notes. “She’s paid her taxes, she’s filed for work permits, she’s stayed out of trouble.”

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS checked and was unable to find any criminal prosecution or conviction for the woman.

Thal says she’s being transferred to the Crow Wing County Jail.

He says he plans to file for a bond hearing before an immigration judge as early as Friday and possibly may file a writ of habeas corpus petition before a federal judge, challenging the legality of the woman’s detention.

Abdul says he’s not sure what’s next.

“Something like that, it’s not fair,” he says. “That’s not the America that we know. It’s not the America where we choose to live.”",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICE-IN.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 04:56:36.513277

Some of those citizens report having been beaten, tased, tackled, dragged, and shot by immigration agents during their arrests.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests have skyrocketed during President Donald Trump's second term, but they're still well below the benchmarks set by White House officials.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Axios that since Trump's return to office, agents under DHS authority have arrested nearly 579,000 ""illegal aliens."" The spike in immigration arrests is credited to anti-immigration policies championed by White House Deputy Chief of Staff and immigration czar Stephen Miller.

According to government data obtained by the outlet, ICE has been arresting roughly 1,100 people per day in recent weeks. While this number is significantly higher than the 821 arrested on average per day in the first ten months of the year, it is still some way off the administration’s goal of 3,000-per-day.

The Trump administration initially insisted that only illegal migrants with criminal records would be targeted for its sweeps, but that standard has fallen by the wayside. A majority of those arrested don’t have a conviction, while agents are being encouraged to make “collateral arrests,” including undocumented people who happen to be with someone on a target list, according to Axios.

That is a departure from the Biden administration, when individuals without criminal records were not prioritized in immigration arrests.

""The new data confirms that the Trump administration isn't focused on legitimate public safety risks, but rather on hitting politically motivated arrest targets,"" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, told Axios.

He said that DHS is ""sweeping up families and workers with clean records and arresting people who are complying with their obligations to attend court hearings and check-ins,""

In a recent incident, immigration agents arrested and deported a 19-year-old college student who was trying to fly home to surprise her family on Thanksgiving, even though a court order ruled that she should be allowed to stay in the U.S.

Immigration raids across the country have sparked lawsuits in their wake, but the Trump administration has been dragging its heels on complying with court orders resulting from that litigation.

In Chicago, a judge ordered that 600 people detained by immigration agents be released after they were arrested without a warrant. A judge in Washington, D.C. halted similar warrantless arrests following a lawsuit challenging the practice.

Mclaughlin told Axios that, despite the resistance, this is ""just the beginning.""

""This is just the beginning. President Trump and Secretary Noem have jump-started an agency that was vilified and barred from doing its job for the last four years,"" she said.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson made similar comments, insisting that President Donald Trump is ""delivering on the President's promise to the American people by carrying out the largest mass deportation operation of criminal illegal aliens in American history.""

""Despite an unprecedented number of legal challenges and unlawful rulings by lower courts, the arrests and deportations will continue,"" she said.

That ""unprecedented number of legal challenges"" is likely to grow thanks to immigration agents' lack of discernment in their arrests. According to a recent ProPublica report, at least 170 — but likely many more — American citizens have been detained by ICE, with dozens held for more than a day without being given a chance to call loved ones or a lawyer.

Some of those citizens report having been beaten, tased, tackled, dragged, and shot by immigration agents during their arrests. Others report having been held outside in detention facilities in nothing more than their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when they were detained.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/03/21/30/2025-in-Reuters-Pictures-kqfg89fm.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-12-05 07:57:27.765627

The woman wished to remain anonymous.

Community members in Canyon County are raising concerns after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents reportedly detained several people in what people described as ""random traffic stops"" this week.

Community members and local nonprofits have reported witnessing these events in parts of Canyon County. However, this situation could spread to additional areas of Idaho.

KTVB obtained a video from a Nampa woman, who asked to remain anonymous, showing her family being detained on Amity Road in Nampa.

The woman told KTVB that four of her cousins were taken into custody during a traffic stop on Monday, Dec. 1. She said all four were undocumented but had no criminal record.

""They are not people with a criminal record, they are not bad people,"" she said. ""They are good, hardworking people who come to this country, taking risks to provide for their families.""

She mentioned that two were transferred to the Elmore County Detention Center, and one minor was released the same day.

KTVB confirmed two of the cousins are currently held in ICE facilities in Texas, while another is in Nevada.

""We were in shock by what happened yesterday, because it happened right outside our house,"" the woman said. ""I mean, it's not like they were speeding or anything like that. And it was early, around 7 a.m.""

Several witnesses to these traffic stops have told KTVB the officers involved were not wearing clear agency markings. Some also recall seeing Nampa police on the scene.

A spokesperson for the Nampa Police Department told KTVB they have no records of assisting with ICE-related traffic stops, but said – as with any law enforcement agency – they would respond if asked.

The Canyon County Sheriff's Office confirmed that ""ICE enforcement and removal operations"" are ongoing in Canyon County, but the sheriff's office is not involved in or assisting with these activities in any capacity.

Caldwell's police chief Rex Ingram says they are aware of ICE enforcement and traffic stops within Canyon County and Southwest Idaho. The chief's full statement is below:

“The Caldwell Police Department would like to address recent media reports concerning ICE enforcement and traffic stops within Canyon County and Southwest Idaho. We want to clarify that the Caldwell Police Department has not engaged in any traffic stops or detentions related to ICE activities and does not plan to do so in the future. Our department does not enforce federal immigration laws.

""We highly value our relationship with the Latino community and maintain open lines of communication with our community stakeholders. We recognize that this period may bring uncertainty and concern among residents. Therefore, we want to reassure everyone that the Caldwell Police Department will not engage in traffic stops that inquire about immigration status.

""The safety and trust of our community members are our top priorities. We are committed to serving and protecting all residents without prejudice.”

KTVB also contacted the Department of Homeland Security and Idaho State Police for comment, but has yet to hear back as of publication time.

The question remains whether ICE agents can carry out random traffic stops. Advocacy groups claim that ICE can perform such stops and sometimes identify themselves as ""police,"" even when they are not. Residents can always inquire whether an officer is local law enforcement or immigration authorities.",https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/3c2fea58-721c-434a-9359-c4030830879c/20251205T013020/3c2fea58-721c-434a-9359-c4030830879c_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 04:56:40.703335

Silent public witness at Atlanta ICE field office

What we know:

The American Friends Service Committee and Atlanta Friends will gather at 2 p.m. Saturday outside the Atlanta ICE field office for one hour of what they describe as silent public witness. The group says the event is part of a coordinated nationwide response to recent federal actions in multiple communities.

Prayer service to ‘bear silent public witness to the injustice’

What they're saying:

Jacob Flowers, regional director for the American Friends Service Committee, said his organization has been committed to human rights for more than a century.

""The American Friends Service Committee is a global organization committed to human rights. We’ve been working since 1917,"" Flowers said.

He told FOX 5 the rallies are meant to push back on federal immigration raids and show support for immigrant families.

""What we see going on in our community with immigrants is unacceptable,"" Flowers said.

""On Saturday, we’re coming out to the localized field office to bear silent public witness to the injustice that we see going on with our immigrant neighbors, brothers, sisters, co workers because of the actions of the Trump Administration,"" he said.

Flowers added that the group chose the ICE office in Atlanta because of the ongoing enforcement actions taking place across the nation.

""We want to be able to go there to pray silently, pray that this ends and really show love is an action towards hate,"" Flowers said.

He said similar events will be held in several major cities.

""We’ll be in solidarity here in Atlanta with other public worships happening in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and even in the Midwest in Des Moines, Iowa. All of those places, for one hour on Saturday, coming together in silent worship to say what we see happening to our immigrant neighbors, is wrong,"" Flowers said.

‘ICE is doing a public safety mission’

The other side:

Federal officials have defended their recent operations. In a separate interview, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said agents are focused on public safety.

""ICE is doing a public safety mission, and these are the people that people should want out of their neighborhoods,"" Lyons said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed that position.

""So, these operations are based on where we have a criminal element to our illegal alien population that's in the country and what we can do to get them off of our streets and protect our children and people,"" Noem said.

According to the sailor's account in the video, the service member was stopped for window tint and an ICE agent on scene detained the sailor for an hour. The sailor claims his service member showed a military ID but was told it wasn't acceptable and that he needed a passport instead.

The video gained additional attention when it was shared Wednesday morning by Virginia Del. Jackie Hope Glass on social media.

The Norfolk Police Department told WTKR News 3 Wednesday it does not ride along with ICE agents.
