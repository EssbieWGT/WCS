ICE officials said they detained Santiago “Diego” Martinez, 30, for having a drunken driving conviction. However, his attorney said ICE admitted they made a mistake – Martinez does not have a criminal conviction – but he remained in custody as of Monday.

It was the morning of Aug. 11 that Jennifer Choi got a call from Martinez’s girlfriend, who said he needed help. Choi went behind her restaurant, Sushi Motto, and saw ICE officers detaining Martinez.

“So when I go, Diego was in the car,” Choi said. “And then I said, ‘OK, what's going on?’ They say he don't have a green card. I tell them, he has a green card. He has a green card. I tell them, like two, three times, but they said, ‘We have to take him.’”

Martinez had worked for Choi for more than five years as a sushi chef. She said he was a great employee.

“He has a good heart,” Choi said. “He helped, even though he’s a sushi chef, he helped in the kitchen, dishwash, whatever needed help. He did everything. He never complained.”

Martinez is a Mexican national who was in the country illegally, ICE spokeswoman Christine Cuttita said in an email. ICE officials first encountered Martinez in 2019 when he entered the country and was arrested by airport police, Cuttita said. His case was dismissed by a judge in 2022 for “prosecutorial discretion.”

Margaret Stock, Martinez’s attorney, said Martinez is an Indigenous person from Mexico and was seeking asylum in the United States. The charges for his initial immigration arrest were dismissed, because the judge ruled he had a valid asylum case, Stock said.

“He does have a very good reason not to return,” Stock said. “I mean, people in the family have been killed and murdered.”

It’s not uncommon for asylum cases to take years to resolve, she said.

Cuttita with ICE wrote that Martinez, “jeopardized any legal privilege to remain in the United States when he was arrested by the Anchorage Police Department on Nov. 12, 2024, for driving under the influence.”

But the charges were thrown out, Stock said, and Martinez doesn’t have a drunken driving conviction on his record.

“I talked to the ICE people, and they were operating on misinformation that he had a DWI conviction, which he doesn't have,” Stock said. “But they claim that was the reason, on the telephone to me, that they were arresting him, was that he had a DWI conviction.”

Stock said the ICE officials told her they made a mistake arresting Martinez, since he doesn’t have a drunken driving conviction, but they still won’t release him.

“They told me that once they grab somebody, they're not allowed to release him anymore,” Stock said. “And they say that this is a new rule that has been made up by the DHS leadership, that people who are pending asylum, they can just grab them anytime and put them in detention.”

Cuttita said that convictions and arrests can both jeopardize someone’s immigration status. But Stock said the Department of Homeland Security isn’t following the law.

“I think it's illegal and it's un-American,” Stock said. “It's unconstitutional, and then on top of it, there's obviously errors in the system. So how can we trust the Department of Homeland Security when they make these kinds of egregious errors all the time?”

For now, it remains unclear if Martinez will be deported.

Stock said she was able to meet with Martinez when he was being held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex, but the opportunities were limited.

“He was freezing cold and shivering while he was talking to me,” Stock said. “He said it's freezing in there, and then he also told me that they would only let him make one phone call a day. They've denied me access to speak with him because they have special rules that attorneys aren't allowed to go in there for huge chunks of the day. You know, they have hours that are off-limits to attorneys.”

Those rules, Stock said, contradict what ICE’s website says about the Anchorage Correctional Complex, that attorneys can access clients from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day.

Martinez was transferred to a detention center in Tacoma, and Stock is there, too, working to get him released. But she said she was worried that the center will have similarly harsh conditions and the same lack of access as the Anchorage jail.

Meanwhile, Choi, Martinez’s boss, said she’s concerned about how his detention will impact her business and her employees.

“Everybody is getting sad, like, depressed, I think,” Choi said. “And, you know, some people, they don't even want to work, even though they have a green card. You know, they’re just scared to work.”

Choi said she’s also pitching in to try to get Martinez back to Alaska.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/818a2bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0f%2F21%2Fcad574aa4eddaa48fe2d0b7f864a%2Fimg-7976.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 22:56:26.930002

The reporting uses internal ICE documents obtained by the Post that outline national expansion plans to allow the agency to detain over 107,000 people at once. That’s up from a capacity of some 54,500 at the beginning of the year, and almost 66,000 as of July.

Arizona facilities slated to be newly included are the Maricopa County Jail and the Marana Correctional Facility outside Tucson. Neither facility is currently in use for immigration detention.

Jordan Garcia, Colorado program coordinator with the American Friends Service Committee, says the way local facilities are contracted for federal use varies from state to state. But, local authorities, like cities and counties, have little control over federally-contracted facilities.

“People tend to get really frustrated when they don’t have local control, so the county itself wouldn’t have as much control over the facility if it’s a federally contracted facility,” he said. “People are like ‘oh, I really thought that we would have some sort of say of how things will go in our community,’ and then they get this facility that’s federally-contracted, and then they don’t have that decision-making power.”

An existing facility called the Central Arizona Florence Correctional Center, south of Phoenix, will also expand to get more beds, according to the reporting. A spokesperson with CoreCivic, the private prison company that operates the facility, said the company works within ICE's established procurement processes and directed capacity questions to the agency.

ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency's effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative reached by telephone told The Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans' case.

Evans' arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department's E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

The town is aware of reports that Evans plans to leave the country voluntarily, Chard said Monday.

“The town reiterates its ongoing commitment to meeting all state and federal laws regarding employment,” Chard said in a statement. “We will continue to rely on the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form and the E-Verify database to confirm employment eligibility.”

ICE's detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy. It was unclear if Evans was represented by an attorney, and a message left for him at the detention facility was not returned.

ICE officials said in July that Evans overstayed his visa and unlawfully attempted to purchase a firearm. WMTW-TV reported Monday that Evans' agreement to a voluntary departure means he will be allowed to leave the U.S. at his own expense to avoid being deported.

Ramirez (IL-03) convened local faith leaders and community defense organizations to discuss the critical role faith communities play in supporting families impacted by the Trump Administration’s attacks and policies. From immigration defense and protection of workers to assisting with food and fighting the criminalization of unhoused neighbors, the leaders shed light on the work their communities have done and how they must stand stronger together to serve the most vulnerable.

During the interfaith convening, Ramirez and local organizations shared information to equip faith leaders to continue supporting neighbors during these challenging times.

“Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. It’s powerful to be in a room with faithful people who hope for a just future. In hard moments, when faith feels difficult, we must remember we are not alone and lean into what we know - that community keeps us safe,” said Congresswoman Ramirez. “Now more than ever, it’s important that people see faith leaders and faith communities stepping into hope, faith, and action: declaring that we will love our neighbors, welcome the stranger, care for the vulnerable.”

The convening counted with the participation of the Public Policy Director at Arise Chicago Adam Kader, Executive Director at CAIR-Chicago Ahmed Rehab, Palenque LSNA’s Rev. Juan Pablo Herrera, and Sanctuary Movement's Pastora Emma Lozano as panelists. The group shared their expertise with nearly 20 faith leaders of various religions and denominations.

“Sanctuary is not a crime, it’s a moral duty. Sanctuary is not only a protection, it’s about resistance. It’s about declaring every human being deserves dignity, safety, and belonging,” said Pastora Emma Lozano, Sanctuary Movement.

“I invite you all to join ARISE Chicago in defending our immigrant neighbors and coworkers, to exercise their rights, to work free from fear, and free from oppression,” added Adam Kader, Public Policy Director at ARISE Chicago, who invited participants to a mobilization action during Labor Day.

“Civil rights are a subset of human rights, and human rights are a subset of empathy for all creatures. What our movement is about is to wake us up from whatever division may exist, whatever fearmongering and terrorizing that happens–usually by really wealthy, privileged people that divide– to stand up together, here in the United States and abroad, for our common humanity and our common existence,” said Executive Director at CAIR-Chicago, Ahmed Rehab.

“As Christians, we follow a God that tells us all the time to welcome a stranger, to love our neighbor, to stand with the most vulnerable, and the Bible for us is clear on that. So I ask you: what does it mean when a stranger is not welcomed but is hunted in our streets? Or when a child sees flashing lights and doesn’t think of safety, but instead thinks of separation? This is an attack on the very image of God in our community,” expressed Rev. Juan Pablo Herrera, Palenque LSNA

Monday, physicians from the nonprofit New York Doctors Coalition tried to get into 26 Federal Plaza, requesting access to assess conditions on the 10th floor. That's where the doctors say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has an overcrowded and unsanitary holding facility for detained immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security calls it a processing center.

The doctors were turned away by security.

Last month, video released by the New York Immigration Coalition and verified by CBS News New York showed conditions on the 10th floor, although it was unclear when the footage was taken. The person taking the video was heard saying ""Look how they have us here, like dogs.""

""This building has been turned into a place of health abuse""

Last week, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from detaining people in spaces with fewer than 50 square feet per person, and calling for improved access to hygiene, providing sleeping mats and access to medical care.

""The building has been turned into a place of health abuse,"" Dr. Steve Auerbach of New York Doctors Coalition said. ""We've had observers that went to the 10th floor.""

""It is not a residential building. They are violating zoning laws,"" Auerbach added.

""They detained a 7-year-old last week. A 7-year-old. How is that helping anybody?"" Dr. Sonni Mun of New York Doctors Coalition said. ""I think the distress these families are going are similar to people who lose young family members.""

Several advocacy groups who rallied with the doctors Monday called for medical professionals independent of DHS to be allowed in. They told CBS News New York loved ones of those detained fear retaliation for speaking out publicly.

""Complete fiction about 26 Federal Plaza,"" DHS says

New York Lawyers for the Public Interest described recent calls they've received.

""Some of the people do not have vital medications that they need to maintain their health. Some of the most alarming things we hear is not having access to HIV medications that they've been on for long term,"" Karina Albistegui Adler of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest said. ""We were contacted about a month ago about a young person who had open heart surgery ... they were detained without their medication that they needed to maintain their health ... unfortunately, by the time they reached us, they opted to leave because they were worried they would die in detention because they were feeling so sick.""

The temporary restraining order remains in place for about another week while the judge considers more longer term relief. DHS says it is appealing the order.

""This order and this lawsuit are driven by complete fiction about 26 Federal Plaza. The fact of the matter here is the Trump administration is carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history and is removing the worst of the worst from American communities. Any claim of subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false. 26 Federal Plaza operates as a processing center, brief intake for illegal aliens, and then transfer to an ICE detention center meeting national standards for care and custody, which are in most cases better than facilities which detain Americans.

A blog post reportedly authored by Eric Lendrum celebrated the January 6 insurrection and compared the following fallout for conservatives to the Holocaust and slavery, Notus reported.

“American conservatives are, right now, on a course for being every bit as ostracized and alienated from broader society as Jews were in the years leading up to Nazi Germany,” he claimed in a 2021 blog post on American Greatness, a rightwing opinion and news site. Lendrum posted on the site until March of this year.

His podcast, The Right Take, is listed in the author’s description on the site. On one episode of the podcast, he said he liked watching videos of scared legislators during the Jan 6 insurrection.

“There’s something so gratifying about seeing the images of these members of Congress — especially the Democrats — crouching under their chairs, putting on those stupid, like, bubble masks, those anti-gas bubble masks, and then taking selfies,” a laughing Lendrum said just days after the Capitol riot.

In another episode, published in October 2022, Lendrum said immigrants put Europe at risk, while also backing the “great replacement theory.” The far-right theory claims that nonwhite immigrants are damaging the influence of white people.

“Given the direction of Europe right now, we could use a far-right government at this point,” said Lendrum.

On X, the account @realEricLendrum has argued for the removal of transgender “ideology” and compared asylum seekers to “scum.”

In another podcast episode, Lendrum referenced his brief period as a press assistant at the Interior Department during the first Trump administration, saying that he would only return to government if he could be closer to the president.

“If I could work more closely with him, that is the one case in which I would ever go back into government work,” said Lendrum, whose online profile was first reported by Notus. “Government work is not fun.”

The Independent has attempted to reach Lendrum for comment.

The DHS Office of Public Affairs states that a speechwriter at the department is responsible for preparing “speeches, talking points, editorials, Congressional testimony, video scripts, web content, and other written content for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary.” The department ranks as the largest federal law enforcement agency.

In one of the blog posts linked to Lendrum, he appeared to argue that conservatives were facing political oppression similar to that of slaves and victims of the Holocaust.

“It has been said that the most surefire way to create an authoritarian regime is to completely dehumanize a significant portion of the population, so that their subsequent enslavement by the state will not face any larger resistance. It was true during slavery, it was true during the Holocaust, and it is true now,” the blog post stated.

Responding to questions from The Independent, DHS shared a link to the text of the First Amendment.

The X account linked to Lendrum argued that the U.S. should treat immigrants as an “invading army.”

“They are not migrants. They are not ‘undocumented.’ They are an invading army. The largest invasion in American history,” one post stated in May 2023. “And what are you supposed to do with an invading army? Crush it, by any means necessary. That’s the #AmericaFirst way.”

Also in the blog post about January 6, the author said, “The Democrats were absolutely terrified — literally cowering under their seats, horrified at the prospect of mere peasants walking through the halls of their castle.”

The lawmakers, including Republicans, were escorted by Capitol Police through the Capitol complex.

“The truth is that they are grateful the events of that day unfolded as they did,” the post argued regarding the Democrats.

In a podcast episode published in April 2023, he said he would “always properly deadname t***** freaks.”

“I will keep calling them t******* because I know it’s derogatory, and I know they freakin’ hate it. That’s why I deadname them. That’s why I use their original pronouns,” he said. “You control the language. Don’t give these freaks an inch on the language.”

“We need to eradicate transgenderism. Wipe it off the face of the Earth. Destroy it. Get rid of it,” he added. “As a disclaimer, I’m not saying to wipe the people out. I’m not saying get rid of the people. I’m saying eliminate the ideology. Cure these people.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/18/18/42/eric-lendrum.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-08-18 22:56:45.058916

Sanctuaries under fire The battle over federal funding for sanctuary jurisdictions goes far beyond VOCA funds.","SALEM, Ore. — Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield is joining a group of 21 AGs in suing to unlock federal funding for programs meant to help victims of crime, funding which the Trump administration has withheld from ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions across the country.

The funding in question is authorized by Congress under the Victims of Crime Act and distributed through grants to organizations which support victims and survivors of crime. VOCA has been law since 1984, but the Trump administration is now conditioning that funding on states agreeing to assist with federal immigration enforcement.

""This is yet another attempt to place unlawful conditions on federal funds coming into Oregon to advance the President's unpopular agenda, this time at the expense of crime victims and survivors,"" Rayfield said. ""These grants support services like the counselor who picks up the phone at 2 a.m., the shelter bed that keeps a mom and her kids safe tonight, or the advocate who walks a victim through the court process.""

STRIAGHT TALK: Oregon AG Dan Rayfield addresses legal challenges on Trump's executive orders

Last week, a sexual assault resource center in Beaverton had to abruptly pause all services due to the cutoff of federal funds, Rayfield said during a press conference on Monday. There is no timeline for reopening.

Clackamas County District Attorney John Wentworth added that VOCA funding is directly responsible for keeping things like domestic violence shelters open, and they're now under threat. His office will need to cut more than half of its victim advocates as well, he said.

""Let me be clear about what (this) means: When you cut victim services, you're choosing to have more crime,"" Wentworth said. ""A victim without support is a victim who cannot testify. A survivor without a place to go is a survivor who is forced to return to her abuser.""

Melissa Erlbaum of Clackamas Women's Services said that a prior 40% cut to VOCA funds had already forced them to lay off staff and reduce services. But even those reduced funds are now out of reach, she said, forcing programs to pause or shut down entirely.

""We are at the perfect storm of funding catastrophe,"" said Jenny Gilmore-Robinson with children's aid organization CARES Northwest. ""Loss of federal funding, increased competition for private grants, financial uncertainty among donors; and, as a health care clinic with 75% of our pediatric patients on Oregon Health Plan, we're also potentially facing cuts to Medicaid.""

According to Rayfield's office, 146 organizations in Oregon rely on VOCA grants, and they stand to lose $15 million in 2025 alone. VOCA isn't funded by taxpayer dollars, but by criminal fines.

Nationwide, VOCA funds go to help nearly 9 million crime victims each year, providing compensation for some 200,000 victims claims.

""VOCA funding is hugely important to the statewide domestic and sexual violence services system,"" said Oregon State Representative Tawna Sanchez. ""The reduction in these funds is likely to have a devastating effect on the programs that serve some of the most vulnerable populations in our state.""

In 1987, Oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a sanctuary law. What it means in practice is that state and local officials and law enforcement are barred from assisting with federal immigration enforcement. The law prohibits the use of any state or local resources to ""detect and apprehend"" people whose only crime was being in violation of immigration laws.

The states suing to release VOCA funding argue that Congress would need to approve the placement of any additional restrictions on those funds, and that the Trump administration is violating the separation of powers by imposing its own political conditions on the funds.

In this lawsuit, Oregon joins the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

Sanctuaries under fire

The battle over federal funding for sanctuary jurisdictions goes far beyond VOCA funds. In a letter sent to Gov. Tina Kotek on Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired a warning shot over Oregon's sanctuary status.

Bondi threatened investigations, civil or criminal legal actions, and the leveraging of federal contracts or funds if Oregon doesn't aid federal immigration enforcement efforts — which is, again, prohibited under Oregon law.

""You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States,"" Bondi's letter reads. ""This ends now.""

As of Monday morning, Kotek's office told KGW that they were reviewing the AG's letter, but they argued that Oregon's sanctuary law does not obstruct federal immigration efforts.

""I will fight for the safety and prosperity of every Oregonian, from recent immigrants to people who have been here for generations,"" Kotek said in a statement. ""Threats like this undermine our values and our right to govern ourselves. We will not be bullied into doing the federal government's job of immigration enforcement.""

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson received a letter from Bondi as well over the Evergreen State's sanctuary status. Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said that the DOJ has no legal standing, calling the letter a threat.

""I don't take those threats lightly,"" Brown said. ""I mean, to have the AG of the United States making threats against local officials is absurd, and should be noteworthy for everyone that's paying attention.""

Ferguson posted on social media that he would respond to Bondi on Tuesday, but said that Washington has no intention of turning its back on its values.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/e2472f22-06b5-46e4-b570-00a00ed55feb/20250424T233950/e2472f22-06b5-46e4-b570-00a00ed55feb_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 20:56:29.009225

According to HRW, while the protests had largely been peaceful, the law enforcement officers frequently used a range of “less lethal” weapons, such as tear gas, pepper balls, hard foam rounds, and flash-bang grenades, at protestors without apparent justification and clear, audible dispersal orders or warnings. HRW stated these less deadly weapons can still potentially cause serious injury and death.

Ida Sawyer–the crisis, conflict and arms director at Human Rights Watch–stated, “Local, state, and federal law enforcement’s aggressive response to these protests violently oppressed the public’s right to express outrage and the media’s right to report safely.”

HRW specifically documented 39 cases of journalists injured by law enforcement, including Lauren Tomasi, an Australian journalist from 9News, who was fired at by a police officer using a kinetic impact projectile, resulting in a bruise on her leg. The events prompted the injured journalists and protesters to file lawsuits against the County of Los Angeles and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

HRW further stated that the use of force by the law enforcement violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the United States is a party, the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Personnel, as well as the First Amendment of the US Constitution.

In particular, Article 21 of ICCPR permits restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly only in limited circumstances that are “necessary in a democratic society” to protect public order, public safety, and the rights of others. Moreover, the UN Basic Principles stipulate that law enforcement officials should first use non-violent means to disperse protests, and avoid using force at all to disperse non-violent protests, regardless of whether the authorities consider the protests illegal.

Section 13652 of California’s Penal Code additionally forbids law enforcement from using “kinetic energy projectiles” to disperse a protest, except “to defend against a threat to life or serious bodily injury” or to “bring any objectively dangerous and unlawful situation safely under control.”

Thousands of people protested in and around Los Angeles between June 6 and 14 in response to the Trump administration’s orders to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to increase daily arrests of undocumented immigrants.

OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine (AP) — A Maine police officer arrested by immigration authorities has agreed to voluntarily leave the country, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Monday.

ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency’s effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative reached by telephone told The Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans’ case.

Evans’ arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department’s E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

Officials with Old Orchard Beach did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE’s detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy. It was unclear if Evans was represented by an attorney, and a message left for him at the detention facility was not returned.

ICE officials said in July that Evans overstayed his visa and unlawfully attempted to purchase a firearm.

Some said they had watched violence intensify on the very streets where they work overnight shifts or walk on early mornings as they open up shops.

But in recent days, workers, small business owners and street vendors say they have found themselves at the center of two crackdowns: one on crime, another on illegal immigration. With Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents appearing alongside National Guard members and federal agents as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on crime in Washington, these workers say they worry that the federal show of force may only complicate efforts to lower violence in the city.

Immigrants interviewed in and near Washington in recent days described a new sense of anxiety, whether they were undocumented or had legal status in this country. And some said they worried that the result could be the opposite of the president’s intended goals, fracturing relationships between immigrants and local authorities, deterring immigrants from reporting crimes and, in the end, making the city less safe.

“My friend told me to be careful because they are squarely picking up everyone, simply for having a Hispanic face,” said Aracely, a legal resident who was wiping windows outside a furniture store near U Street. Like many of those interviewed, she declined to provide her full name for fear of retaliation from the authorities or of reprimands from employers.

As the Trump administration stepped in this month, announcing that it was taking control of law enforcement in the city, immigration enforcement has emerged as a key element. Of 308 people arrested since the federal push began on Aug. 7, 135 were unauthorized immigrants, according to the White House.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has also sought to end D.C. policies that bar local police from most collaboration with federal immigration authorities and from arrests of people solely for being in the country illegally. That issue is still being contested as part of a court battle expected to continue this week, but a federal judge allowed the administration on Friday to require the city’s help on immigration enforcement for now.

The administration threatens to withhold the funds unless states agree to unlawfully imposed immigration enforcement requirements on congressionally authorized grants for victims—jeopardizing more than $34 million slated for Washington programs in fiscal year 2025.

“Nothing is safe from the Trump administration’s political attacks—including funds to help people at their most vulnerable, after they’ve survived a crime,” Brown said. “As Attorney General, public safety is one of my top priorities, and that includes ensuring the federal government makes good on its obligations to crime victims.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable states to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives. The programs fund such things as victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and much more.

These funding streams—totaling more than $1 billion a year nationwide—have long ensured that states could fulfill their most fundamental duties to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents. States use these funds to assist nearly 9 million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year.

In Washington, the grants in jeopardy include an anticipated award of $29.2 million for fiscal year 2025 to support emergency shelters, mental health services, child advocacy groups, and organizations for victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, and human trafficking. Loss of the funds will likely require cuts to these and other services.

Also at risk is $4.8 million slated for Washington in fiscal year 2025 to provide benefits directly to crime victims. The money helps victims with everything from medical expenses for injuries resulting from criminal acts to grief counseling and burial expenses.

Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to states based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump administration, through the U.S. Department of Justice, has declared that states and the victims and survivors they serve will be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the administration’s political agenda.

This directive conflicts with core principles of American governance—the separation of powers, and federalism. As such, Brown and the coalition are requesting the court permanently enjoin the Trump administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.

Veronica Escobar is the first U.S. lawmaker to carryout an oversight visit inside the new East Montana ICE detention facility on Fort Bliss in El Paso.

Intentions to build the soft-sided facility were first announced in February 2025, and a spot was selected the following month.

It will be the largest facility in the U.S. once completed, holding up to 5,000 immigrants scheduled for removal.

The new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility on Fort Bliss is now open, U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar said following the first visit to the massive facility.

Escobar, D-El Paso, discussed the conditions in the facility at a news conference after she spent more than two hours touring the East Montana Detention Facility on Monday, Aug. 18.

She described the facility as ""massive"" and said ICE officials were transparent with her and her team's questions. Escobar added that she has encouraged ICE to grant access to the facility for El Paso County and city officials, news reporters and the Catholic Diocese of El Paso.

The facility began to receive immigrants on Aug. 1, Escobar said. There are currently over 1,000 immigrants being held at the facility, but Escobar said she was unable to speak with any detainees.

Escobar is the first lawmaker to tour the inside of the new soft-sided immigration detention facility. U.S. Senator John Cornyn carried out a brief ""windshield"" tour of the facility on Aug. 11.

Concerns with East Montana detention facility

The expansive facility on the periphery of Fort Bliss is currently being run by generators, but there are plans to connect it to the El Paso electric grid. The facility also includes what Escobar described as ""a very highly sophisticated medical unit.""

But Escobar also raised several concerns about the facility, including that it could place a strain on the El Paso community. She also argued that the $1.24 billion, which the project received through the approval of President Donald Trump's ""One, Big Beautiful bill,"" could have gone to the El Paso community to improve conditions in the Borderland.

""I want you to think about how much good that money could do in El Paso if it were spent on the community,"" Escobar said. ""There is a tremendous amount of good that that money could do for El Pasoans, but it is instead being used to fund mass deportation by the Trump administration.""

Lastly, Escobar also raised concerns with the lack of trained ICE agents at the facility, which is an expansive area run by contractors, creating concern for oversight of the conditions at the site. She said that she would raise this issue with the Appropriations Committee and internally with members of Congress.

""When you have a facility this big that is operating to detain as many people as they are detaining now and then hope to detain in the future, I have always been very deeply uncomfortable and opposed to privately run facilities,"" Escobar said. ""I think it's far too easy for standards to slip when there are private facilities. I think private facilities far too frequently are operating with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.""

The largest detention facility in the U.S.

Once completed, the detention facility on Fort Bliss will be the largest in the country.

The facility has also been dubbed “Lone Star Lockup” and ""Camp East Montana"" by political leaders.

The Trump administration announced the construction of the facility in February, and officials confirmed in March that the facility would be constructed on the site between the park-and-ride and the Texas National Guard building on Montana Avenue. The facility is about a 10-minute drive from the El Paso Processing Center.

The Trump administration has sought to expand the infrastructure for holding immigrants for deportation.

The El Paso sector, which stretches from New Mexico through El Paso County, will house one of the largest detention infrastructures in the U.S. The sector will have the capacity to hold over 8,000 people in the four ICE detention centers in the region once the Fort Bliss detention center is completed.

ICE will use the new detention facility at Fort Bliss as a hub for deportations, primarily to countries in Central America, Escobar said.

Congressional democrats sue Trump administration

Escobar is currently part of a lawsuit against the Trump administration for blocking her and other congressional representatives from carrying out surprise oversight visits to ICE detention facilities. The lawsuit was filed on July 30.

Members of Congress have the right to carry out surprise oversight visits of facilities. But the Trump administration placed new restrictions on congressional oversight visits in June 2025.

Congressional representatives continue to be blocked from carrying out oversight at ICE detention centers, including those run by private companies. Most recently, U.S. Rep.

Thanedar was later able to arrange the August meeting, which included a priest, several nuns, and leaders of Strangers No Longer, who presented their letter and spoke with ICE agents for about an hour.

In its letter, the group expressed concerns about “face masks and the lack of identification” by agents during raids, along with “actions carried out without a federal warrant.” The group also alleged a lack of “communication with local law enforcement” before operations are carried out.

Strangers No Longer further criticized “the arrest of individuals who have committed no felony” and alleged that ICE “appears to be targeting men for incarceration and expedited removal, leaving women and children (many of whom are U.S. citizens) behind to ‘fend for themselves.’”

“This pattern of separating families is having a devastating impact on those left behind,” the letter added.

Victoria Kovari, one of the organizers of the July demonstration who attended the meeting, told CNA that the agents “were very respectful” and listened to “these stories … [about] how it’s impacting our community” but did not give any indication they would make any adjustments to immigration enforcement.

“We wanted this to be a dialogue,” Kovari said. “We wanted them to understand us and we want to understand them.”

Kovari said she spoke to ICE about cases in which agents arrived in unmarked vehicles wearing masks and carrying rifles to arrest people who “hadn’t committed any violent felonies.” She also spoke about parishioners who hadn’t committed any felonies “being picked up” by ICE for deportation.

“We really hope that they focus these [enforcement] priorities on the more difficult cases of gang members, drug cartel [members], drug dealers, violent offenders, and [work] with our local law enforcement,” she added.

“That’s what would really help our communities,” Kovari said.

Thanedar similarly told CNA the ICE agents “listened to us” and offered to help connect Strangers No Longer with some detainees, but that there was no indication they would make policy changes.

“Their response remained that these people — anybody that has broken the law — [ICE] will go after, and they were not willing to commit to prioritizing the hardened criminals and the people who are gang members, like the president has said,” he continued.

“What we are seeing lately is ICE is focusing more on migrants that have been working 20 years in the hospitality industry, working as cooks, doing landscaping, [and doing] work that makes our lives better,” Thanedar alleged.

Kovari added that Raycraft told the organization that many criticisms of ICE are based on “media manipulation,” which she said made the conversation more difficult.

CNA reached out to Detroit ICE, the national ICE headquarters, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment but did receive a response by the time of publication.

In a July 22 op-ed in the Detroit News, three weeks before the meeting, Raycraft addressed some of the concerns raised in the Strangers No Longer letter.

Raycraft said agents “identify themselves with visible markings, badges, or other identifiers” but “do not wear uniforms or drive marked vehicles.” He contested that assaults on agents have increased by about 830% and “our officers wear masks to protect their families.”

The op-ed states that agents follow the law when making arrests. He said the law allows for “the issuance of warrants upon a finding of probable cause that someone is [unlawfully] present” and works with courts to obtain warrants for other criminal matters. It adds that agents do not need to display the warrants.

Raycraft also said that ICE “routinely coordinates with local law enforcement agencies” and that they “know where to reach us … if there is an issue regarding communication.”",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/detroitprocession.jpg?jpg,N,,2025-08-18 18:56:46.985041

The lawsuit, filed Monday in Rhode Island federal court, seeks to block the Justice Department from enforcing conditions that would cut funding to a state or subgrantee if it refuses to honor civil immigration enforcement requests, denies Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers access to facilities, or fails to provide advance notice of release dates of individuals possibly wanted by ICE because of their immigration status.

President Donald Trump's administration has sought to withhold or pull back other federal funding or grant funding midstream, saying awardees and programs no longer agree with its priorities.

""Law enforcement officers...used brutal, excessive, and unnecessary force against people standing up for human rights and those reporting on the protests,"" said Ida Sawyer, the rights group's crisis, conflict and arms director.

The protests erupted on June 6, in anger at raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has been ordered by the Trump administration to target undocumented migrants across the sprawling, heavily Latino city.

The demonstrations were mainly confined to a small section of downtown Los Angeles. Largely non-violent, they at times spiraled into chaotic scenes that Trump pounced on to send 4,000 National Guard and 700 Marines into the city -- a move loudly protested by local officials.

Compiling the report, Human Rights Watch staff observed protests, visited locations of immigration raids in mid-June, and interviewed dozens of people.

The report documented 65 cases in which law enforcement officers injured protesters and journalists but warned that the ""actual number is most likely much higher.""

On one occasion, a police officer shot three people at ""very close range with kinetic impact projectiles,"" leaving them in serious pain for days.

""Before shooting one of them in the groin, the officer said: 'I'm going to pop you, as you are taking up my focus,'"" the report found.

Other reported injuries included broken bones, concussions, an amputated finger, and severe eye damage.

“People have called me the N-word online, they’ve called my wife a b**** and it just keeps getting worse,” said state Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford. He said multiple posts have called for his arrest and some have gone as far as to target his grandparents.

Paris, who has been in office since 2021, on Friday posted an Instagram story saying he had been informed of multiple reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the district he represents. He went on to urge residents “to remain vigilant, stay aware of your surroundings, and, above all, prioritize your safety.”

The story is no longer visible online as Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours.

He also encouraged residents to “look out for one another” and seek out legal and community resources if needed.

The post was soon shared by the X (formerly Twitter) page “Libs of TikTok” which falsely stated he was “doxxing” ICE’s live location and demanded his arrest. Doxxing is the sharing of people’s personal information without their consent, often with malicious intent.

Comments on the post called for Paris to be jailed, advocated vigilante justice and referred to him using racist language and as a DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) politician. Others called for his execution and requested the home and work address of his family members.

The backlash stepped up when ICE shared the post on the department’s official X page, and also tagged the U.S. Justice Department.

Paris on Sunday said he had been in contact with law enforcement officials, including Attorney General William Tong’s office. In a statement, Tong said federal law enforcement “should know and does know what First Amendment-protected speech is.”

Tong said the implied legal threat was “dangerous, disturbing and unacceptable” and that online harassment and threats against legislators and public servants don’t stop with words.

“We have seen far too much violence and death this year to ignore this kind of reckless rhetoric by federal law enforcement,” Tong said. “Please stop. Before anyone else gets hurt.”

House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, expressed his support for Paris, saying “the message of ‘neighbors looking out for neighbors’ is powerful and not uncommon for an elected official.”

Ritter added “any threats and racist taunts are disgusting” and said those responsible would be held accountable.

Paris said his own situation was mild compared to the fear that undocumented people in the country live with every day, and said he does not regret making the original post.",https://ctnewsjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/corey-paris-jr-20250729-1200x900-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 17:57:21.846787

2 Republican, suggested that such a move might help alleviate concerns, adding that the House could not address the Epstein files while the courts were weighing in.
Instead, they have turned to legal maneuvers meant to force the Justice Department to provide the Epstein files to Congress.
On Monday, he told reporters he was confident that “we’re going to get the documents,” citing “productive” conversations with the Justice Department.","When House Republican leaders rushed to leave Washington for a long August break, they seemed desperate to quell the anger among their supporters about the Trump administration’s backtracking on a promise to release files related to its investigation of the accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

But halfway through a five-week congressional recess, the clamor shows little sign of quieting. While Republicans had hoped that legal rulings might insulate them from having to confront the issue, the courts have yet to intervene. Back in their districts, lawmakers have continued to face questions about the Epstein investigation from their constituents. And the Justice Department, which ignored a Friday deadline from Senate Democrats and is set to miss another on Tuesday to comply with a bipartisan subpoena to provide the materials to Congress, has yet to release anything.

On Monday, Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said that the Justice Department would begin sharing its Epstein records with his panel by Friday. He also suggested that the release of the documents would take some time, all but ensuring that questions about the Epstein affair will drag on for weeks.

At the same time, Democrats, in some cases with the help of Republicans, have laid a series of procedural traps that will make it all but impossible for the G.O.P. to avoid confronting the issue again when Congress reconvenes in September.

Lawmakers of both parties concede that the Trump administration could quiet the furor over the Epstein files on Capitol Hill and nationwide by simply releasing them to the public. Mr. Comer’s statement on Monday was the only public indication to date that it might do so.

All the while, several efforts connected to Mr. Epstein, a disgraced financier who was found dead in his prison cell in 2019, have been percolating and threaten to disrupt a busy month in which Congress also faces a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government and avert a shutdown.

Chief among them may be a maneuver led by Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who is a frequent Trump critic, to try to force a floor vote on the release of the files. Such a vote would thrust Republicans into a politically thorny position between Mr. Trump and constituents who are unhappy with the administration’s handling of the case.

Before leaving Washington, Mr. Massie and Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, filed what is known as a discharge petition, which allows any member of the House to force legislation to the floor if a majority of members — 218 — sign on. Because of arcane procedural rules, the pair cannot start collecting signatures until they return in September, but they appear to have more than enough support to succeed.

The timing all but guaranteed that the issue would hang over lawmakers throughout the August recess and that Republican leaders would be forced to address it when they returned. While they could try to table the effort, several rank-and-file Republicans earlier this year blocked a similar attempt to circumvent a measure that had majority support.

So far, 43 other lawmakers, 11 of them Republicans, have signed on to Mr. Massie and Mr. Khanna’s initiative. Last week, the pair announced plans for a news conference with victims of Mr. Epstein and his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, to be held outside the Capitol on lawmakers’ second day back from their break.

Last month, Democrats effectively paralyzed the committee — and by extension, Republicans’ legislative agenda — with the threat of such votes. Facing pressure from their constituents, Republicans were reluctant to take up the issue, essentially forcing the committee to adjourn and keeping substantive legislation from advancing.

Matthew Bonaccorsi, a spokesman for Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the panel, said the committee had “no plans to let up pressure on this until Republicans release the Epstein files.”

Republican leaders never found a solution to the committee’s impasse, which led them to send the House home a day ahead of schedule. But they seemed to take solace in the Trump administration’s request that federal judges release transcripts of grand jury testimony in three cases related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.

Both Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 Republican, suggested that such a move might help alleviate concerns, adding that the House could not address the Epstein files while the courts were weighing in.

“That process is underway right now,” Mr. Johnson said last month. “Now, we’ve got to zealously guard that and protect it and make sure it’s happening. And if it doesn’t, then we’ll take appropriate action when everybody returns here.”

Yet so far, federal judges in two of those three cases have denied the government’s requests. A judge overseeing Ms. Maxwell’s case said that the Justice Department’s suggestion that grand jury testimony “would bring to light meaningful new information” was “demonstrably false.” A third judge, who oversaw Mr. Epstein’s 2019 case, is still considering whether to unseal grand jury materials connected to that prosecution.

And Republicans and Democrats alike have argued that the grand jury testimony falls far short of the promise that Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top officials had made. Instead, they have turned to legal maneuvers meant to force the Justice Department to provide the Epstein files to Congress.

This month, the Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to Ms. Bondi asking the Justice Department to give the committee its files related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell by Aug. 19.

Mr. Comer, a staunch Trump ally, was forced to send the subpoena after a small group of Republicans joined Democrats in voting to approve it at a subcommittee meeting last month. On Monday, he told reporters he was confident that “we’re going to get the documents,” citing “productive” conversations with the Justice Department.

The committee also sent subpoenas to former officials who were linked to the Justice Department at times that it was grappling with legal matters related to Mr. Epstein. After Mr. Barr, several other officials are scheduled to be deposed over the next two months, and each hearing is likely to generate renewed attention on the Epstein case.

Even as the Justice Department told Mr. Comer it would release the files, it did not suggest a clear timeline for doing so. Democratic lawmakers will most likely highlight any delays, forcing more attention to the issue.

Senate Democrats have already started to pressure Republicans over the matter using a little-known and infrequently tested maneuver to try to force Ms. Bondi to turn over the Epstein files.

Under a provision of federal law, government agencies are required to hand over relevant information if any five members of the Senate’s chief oversight committee requests it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and seven other Democrats asked the Justice Department to give them Epstein-related materials by Aug. 15. They also asked that a briefing be held for the committee’s staff before the end of the month.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/18/multimedia/18dc-cong-epstein-vmwt/18dc-cong-epstein-vmwt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 16:57:08.923850

The City reports that on August 12, federal agents abducted and detained a 7-year-old child, her 19-year-old brother, and their mother when they went to an immigration check-in at the Manhattan federal courthouse — marking the first known ICE arrest in New York City of a child under the age of 18, according to The City, which was the first news outlet to report on the case.

The courthouse where the family was abducted, also known by its address, 26 Federal Plaza, has become a symbol of Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

Masked agents roam the hallways, abducting people who show up for mandatory immigration appointments or hearings. The 10th floor of the building has been transformed into “hell,” according to one person who was detained there for six days. After the American Civil Liberties Union and others filed suit, a judge ordered ICE to provide people with sleeping mats, period products, towels, and soap, although ICE can still refuse them toothbrushes.

ICE sent the child, a Queens public school student, and her mother to a detention facility in Texas, and her brother to Delaney Hall, an ICE jail in New Jersey run by the private prison company GEO Group.

The girl’s school principal and elected officials have demanded her release.

“We are fighting to get this family back together and will not stop until they are safely back in their community and home in Queens,” State Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and New York City Councilmember Shekar Krishnan said in a joint statement.

ICE has abducted several students after they attended routine immigration appointments or hearings — a 20-year-old student identified in the press as Dylan, a Venezuelan public school student; Derlis Snaider Chusin Toaquiza, an 11th grader who attends high school in Queens; and Mamadou Diallo, a 20-year-old asylum seeker from Guinea.

On June 8, ICE agents abducted Derlis Snaider Chusin Toaquiza, who was 19 at the time, when he went to a court appearance for his asylum application. He was detained at 26 Federal Plaza for several days and then sent to an ICE jail in Texas. He told his attorneys that while at 26 Federal Plaza, he was only given one meal a day and had to sleep sitting up because it was so crowded.

More than a month later, a Texas immigration judge set his bond at $20,000, which was paid for by the Envision Freedom Fund (formerly the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund) and he was released. On July 18, he finally arrived home on a Greyhound bus; his family greeted him at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan.

Community members, educators, and elected officials have rallied around the students and their families.

“Mamadou did the right thing,” City Councilmember Rita Joseph said at a rally demanding his release. “He showed up for his routine check in and he was abducted.”

At least two of his teachers attended the rally.

“He’s a very bright, sweet, respectful young man that was going to a court date that was unjustly taken,” one teacher told CBS News.

Another teacher said, “For me, to be standing here today to advocate for one of my students to be released from ICE, it’s just horrible.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/2025-8-18-teachers-for-mouctar.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 19:56:37.927513

Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.
The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.

The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants.","Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.

So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.

Rhode Island is among more than dozen states facing threats from the Trump administration for alleged “sanctuary” policies. Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.”

McKee and Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies.

“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.

Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.

“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”

But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.

It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula.

Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.

The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.

Facing cuts, abuse survivors implore Maine lawmakers to bolster victim services funding

If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.

“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”

The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.

The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.

The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks.

‘The most heinous acts’

“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.

Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.

“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”

Facing cuts, abuse survivors implore Maine lawmakers to bolster victim services funding

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.

The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.

“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.

In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint. Neronha’s office began developing the portal in fiscal year 2020, though the rollout was delayed to fiscal 2022 because of the pandemic.

Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment. The lawsuit also names Maureen Henneberg, acting assistant attorney general for the U.S. Office of Justice programs, and Katherine Darke Schmitt, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime, as defendants.

Sabina Carmona-Lorenzo is asking for a judge to order her release on bond, which an immigration court judge granted a month ago, so that she can reunite with her family and help take care of her children.

This is the second case challenging Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention that the ACLU of Nebraska has brought in recent weeks. More impacted community members are detained in the same unjust circumstances.

Carmona-Lorenzo has been in the United States for more than 25 years. She and her husband have five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. Three are minors. One of the adult children is currently in college but is now considering pausing his education to help support his family. The other is serving in the military.

ICE agents detained Carmona-Lorenzo and dozens of her coworkers in the June raid at Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha. She is currently four hours away from her family at Lincoln County Detention Center in North Platte. Although an immigration court judge granted Carmona-Lorenzo release on bond on July 15, she remains in detention due to an automatic stay issued by ICE . Her lawsuit argues that her continued detention extends beyond ICE's legal authority and violates her right to due process.

Carmona-Lorenzo's case follows a lawsuit that the ACLU of Nebraska announced earlier this month challenging nearly identical conduct. In that case, ICE blocked the release of another Nebraska mother who had been granted bond, seemingly based on new ‘interim guidance’ that asserts nearly all immigrants are ineligible for release on bond. The ACLU of Nebraska says that these back-to-back cases highlight the urgent need for immigration authorities to comply with constitutional requirements and respect immigration court judges’ bond determinations.

Speaking through a Spanish interpreter, Carmona-Lorenzo said:

“I wish no one had to live through this. It is horrible. I hope God gives me an opportunity to stay with my family and see my children graduate. I do not ask for anything else but to remain in the country to experience what I have worked so hard to accomplish for my children.”

Christopher Pacheco-Carmona, one of the plaintiff’s sons, said:

“It’s not something that I was ready to face. The impact that this has had on my family has been, to put it into simple terms, it’s just been tough. It’s tough on all of us. [...] Honestly, it’s the only thing I think about right now is my mom being home, and that day can’t come soon enough.”

Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director at the ACLU of Nebraska, said:

“Our client was granted bond by the Immigration Judge and has met every requirement for release, yet ICE is holding her without any individualized reason and without giving her a fair chance to challenge this decision. Due process is not a suggestion; it is a constitutional right. We are committed to ending these unlawful detentions and ensuring our client can return to her family.”

Like many of the people taken by ICE in the June Omaha raid, Carmona-Lorenzo has no criminal convictions and was a key earner for her family.

Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., has released a sweeping investigation documenting hundreds of human rights abuses in U.S. immigration detention, including dozens of cases involving pregnant women and children.

Since January, Ossoff’s office has identified 510 credible reports of abuse across facilities run by the Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Prisons, Health and Human Services, county jails, federal prisons, and even overseas U.S. military bases in Cuba and Djibouti. Among them were 41 cases of physical and sexual abuse, 14 involving pregnant women, and 18 involving children.

The report describes detainees beaten by guards, held in solitary confinement after reporting assaults, or forced into painful “stress positions” as punishment. At a federal detention center in Miami, detainees reported being confined for hours without food or water, then attacked with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets when they protested.

Pregnant women were frequently denied medical care, the report found. One detainee miscarried alone in a hospital room after staff delayed treatment for days, while others were told to “just drink water” instead of receiving exams. Attorneys reported clients waiting weeks for appointments that were later canceled.

Children as young as two — including U.S. citizens — were also mistreated, according to the investigation. A girl recovering from brain surgery was detained without access to follow-up care, while another child undergoing cancer treatment was deported without seeing a doctor. In one case, a U.S. citizen child vomited blood in custody; a guard allegedly responded, “Just give the girl a cracker”.

Most reports of abuse originated in Texas, Georgia, and California, with facilities run by DHS and private contractors accounting for the majority of complaints. The investigation also cited records of sexual assaults at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California and the South Texas ICE Processing Center.

Ossoff has pressed DHS, the Justice Department, and the Pentagon for answers, demanding transparency on detention conditions, including the use of federal prisons and military sites such as Guantánamo Bay to hold migrants. He warned that administration efforts to lower ICE detention standards and restart family detention “risk systemic violations of basic human rights.”

“This is an active and ongoing investigation,” the report states, adding that the 510 credible reports represent only a fraction of potential abuses still unreported or undocumented.

ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency’s effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative reached by telephone told The Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans’ case.

Evans’ arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department’s E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

The town is aware of reports that Evans plans to leave the country voluntarily, Chard said Monday.

“The town reiterates its ongoing commitment to meeting all state and federal laws regarding employment,” Chard said in a statement. “We will continue to rely on the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form and the E-Verify database to confirm employment eligibility.”

ICE’s detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy.

In four briefs filed Friday, McIver’s attorneys urge a federal judge to dismiss the three counts.
The incident at the center of the allegations was recorded on videos shared publicly by the Department of Homeland Security.
That decision said some lawmakers’ actions are “manifestly legislative” — and McIver’s attorneys argue her actions at Delaney Hall on May 9 were indeed manifestly legislative.
The Speech of Debate Clause was designed to prevent that kind of message and intimidation,” one of McIver’s filings says.","Federal assault charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver should be thrown out just as similar charges facing dozens of people involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol were tossed, McIver’s lawyers argue in a new court filing.

McIver, a Democrat accused of shoving officers during a melee at a migrant jail in Newark in May, said there is no “conduct-based justification” for the U.S. Department of Justice dismissing cases against 160 people involved in the Jan. 6 riot but continuing to prosecute her for allegedly violating the same statute.

“Her alleged conduct was manifestly less egregious than storming the Capitol, throwing explosives, beating officers with bats and riot shields, and spraying them with pepper spray. Some of those defendants had significant criminal histories. Some admitted that they engaged in their assaultive conduct as part of an effort to overturn an election. Some escalated their threats in the subsequent days. Some bragged about their exploits and vowed that they would do it again,” one of the new filings says.

McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting or impeding officers while Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, was arrested May 9 outside of immigration detention center Delaney Hall. Prosecutors say McIver, who says she was there with two other members of Congress to conduct an oversight visit, interfered as federal agents attempted to arrest Baraka for trespassing (prosecutors dropped the charge against Baraka days later).

McIver, who was elected to Congress last year, has pleaded not guilty to the charges. A judge set a tentative trial date of Nov. 10.

In four briefs filed Friday, McIver’s attorneys urge a federal judge to dismiss the three counts. Her lawyers argue the confrontation was provoked by agents who escalated the situation, that her inspection of Delaney Hall was a legislative act that she cannot be prosecuted over, and that evidence cited in the indictment is contradictory to video footage of the episode shared by the Department of Homeland Security. McIver also wants a judge to order the Department of Homeland Security to delete social media posts that McIver’s attorneys say harm her ability to have a fair trial.

“Individually and collectively, those statements are extraordinarily prejudicial: they unequivocally declare Congresswoman McIver’s guilt; they assail the defenses DHS expects her to assert; they demean her as a ‘gutter politician’ responsible for purportedly escalating rates of assault on ICE agents; and they attempt to associate her with ‘Murderers, Rapists, Suspected Terrorists, and Gang Members’ supposedly housed in the detention facility that the Congresswoman inspected on May 9, 2025, as part of her congressionally authorized oversight responsibility,” one of the filings says.

The incident at the center of the allegations was recorded on videos shared publicly by the Department of Homeland Security. Attorneys for McIver, who is seen in the videos pushing two agents during a chaotic scuffle, call her actions a “modest, proportional, and reactive response to a flood of armed and marked ICE agents.” Federal prosecutors previously said she acted as a “human shield” preventing Baraka’s arrest.

One of McIver’s arguments for dismissal of the indictment focuses on whether her prosecution violates the Constitution’s speech or debate clause, which grants members of Congress broad immunity for legislative acts. McIver, a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, “unquestionably had congressional authority” to conduct oversight on government agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, her attorneys argue.

Putting McIver on trial for constitutionally vested duties would deter other Congress members from oversight and “imperil the separation of powers,” that filing says.

“That sort of intimidation of independent legislative prerogatives is exactly the evil that legislative immunity was designed to prevent,” her attorneys wrote.

McIver’s filings cite a U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals decision from 2016 that found against then-Sen. Bob Menendez’s arguments that he was indicted over legislative acts protected by the speech and debates clause. That decision said some lawmakers’ actions are “manifestly legislative” — and McIver’s attorneys argue her actions at Delaney Hall on May 9 were indeed manifestly legislative.

“Her sole purpose was to fulfill her constitutional and statutory responsibility of Executive Branch oversight,” they said.

One of the lawmakers who visited Delaney Hall on May 9 with McIver was Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08), the former senator’s son.

McIver’s attorneys also argue that legislators conducting oversight amid escalating immigration enforcement tactics from the Trump administration “have been met with alarming resistance.” They point to Baraka’s arrest, the detention of California Sen. Alex Padilla after questioning Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference, and New York City Comptroller Brad Landler’s arrest at an immigration court.

“If these charges are allowed to move forward, they will send a chilling message to Congress on the risk it takes when it scrutinizes the Administration’s activities. The Speech of Debate Clause was designed to prevent that kind of message and intimidation,” one of McIver’s filings says.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0JS13795_1-2048x1518.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 15:57:03.119226

The lawsuit filed Monday in Rhode Island federal court seeks to block the Justice Department from enforcing conditions that would cut funding to a state or subgrantee if it refuses to honor civil immigration enforcement requests, denies U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers access to facilities or fails to provide advance notice of release dates of individuals possibly wanted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their immigration status.

The lawsuit asks that the conditions be thrown out, arguing that the administration and the agency are overstepping their constitutional and administrative authority.

The lawsuit also argues that the requirements are not permitted or outlined in the Victims of Crime Act, known as VOCA, and would interfere with policies created to ensure victims and witnesses report crimes without fear of deportation.

“These people did not ask for this status as a crime victim. They don’t breakdown neatly across partisan lines, but they share one common trait, which is that they’ve suffered an unimaginable trauma,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said during a video news conference Monday, calling the administration's threat to withhold funds “the most heinous act” he’s seen in politics.

The federal conditions were placed on VOCA funding, which provides more than a billion dollars annually to states for victims compensation programs and grants that fund victims assistance organizations. VOCA funding comes entirely from fines and penalties in federal court cases, not from tax dollars.

Every state and territory has a victims compensation program that follows federal guidelines, but largely is set up under state law to provide financial help to crime victims, including medical expense reimbursement, paying for crime scene cleanup, counseling or helping with funeral costs for homicide victims. VOCA covers the cost of about 75% of state compensation program awards.

The funds are also used to pay for other services, including testing rape kits, funding grants to domestic violence recovery organizations, trauma recovery centers and more.

Advocates and others argue that the system needs to protect victims regardless of their immigration status and ensure that reporting a crime does not lead to deportation threats. They also say that marginalized communities, such as newly arrived immigrants, are more likely to be crime targets.

“The federal government is attempting to use crime victim funds as a bargaining chip to force states into doing its bidding on immigration enforcement,” New York Attorney General Letitia James, who also joined the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday. “These grants were created to help survivors heal and recover, and we will fight to ensure they continue to serve that purpose … We will not be bullied into abandoning any of our residents.”

The Associated Press left a message seeking comment from a DOJ spokesperson Monday afternoon.

President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to withhold or pull back other federal funding or grant funding midstream, saying awardees and programs no longer agree with its priorities. In April, it canceled about $800 million in DOJ grants, some of which were awarded to victims service and survivor organizations.

And in June, states filed a lawsuit over added requirements in Violence Against Women Act funding that mandated applicants agree not to promote “gender ideology,” or run diversity, equity and inclusion programs or prioritize people in the country illegally.

Several attorneys general said the VOCA conditions appear to be another way the administration is targeting so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, though there is no clear definition of what a sanctuary state or city is.

The Trump administration earlier this month released an updated list of states, cities and counties it considers sanctuary jurisdictions. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the August announcement that the department would “continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”

As of Monday afternoon attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin — all Democrats — had signed on to the lawsuit.

Executive Director of NJCA Dena Mottola Jaborska has called for the following actions on Gaza:

An immediate ceasefire of military operations in Gaza

Immediately allow the free flow of humanitarian organizations and aide into Gaza to address the urgent food and health care needs of the population

The immediate release of all Israeli and Palestinian hostages

All elected officials, in New Jersey and elsewhere, to condemn the violence and actions to stop the flow of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.

An end to labeling calls for justice and support to Gaza as anti-Semitic. What is occurring in Gaza is an attempt at genocide and a gross human rights violation. Palestinians deserve the same human rights protections as the people of Israel.

“The protection and preservation of human rights is essential to a thriving democracy – and yet, the genocide in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels,” said Mottola Jaborska. “With U.S. support, Israeli military operations in the troubled region have devastated civilian infrastructure, killed over 18,500 of children, and pushed millions to the brink of famine and displacement. The U.S. must demand that Israel take immediate action to end the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza or face withdrawal of US financial, military and diplomatic support.

“At the same time, here in the United States, the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort, being carried out in the most grossly inhumane way imaginable, is hurting families and communities across our country. People have been abused, denied basic needs, separated from their families and have had their human rights violated.”

On U.S. immigration policy NJCA urges all elected US representatives to:

End the targeted round up and mass deportation of non-criminal immigrants sweeping the country causing irreparable harm to (or violating) innocent people, including those with protected immigration status, refugees we invited in and people who came to the U.S for humanitarian reasons.

Require ICE / DHS officers abide by the same rules as any law enforcement officials by requiring them to identify themselves, advise people of their rights and follow all laws pertaining to arrest, including having valid warrants. ICE/DHS officers must be in a uniform - marked with their affiliation and in vehicles that are also marked, unmasked with visible faces, and fully identifiable.

Require anyone detained by ICE to have rapid access to lawyers, family, and full and fair due process proceedings before being placed in detention center.

End all incentives and quotas for ICE/DHS officers that is driving many to violate laws and rights of immigrants including wrongfully detaining citizens

End privately owned immigration detention facilities from operating in New Jersey

End any use of our military in civil protests or deportation efforts

Reverse the decision to use McGuire-Fort Dix as an immigration detention camp

Ensure detention centers in NJ and around the country have independent oversight of facilities and immediately investigate appalling conditions reported. Take immediate action to fix our immigration system and pass comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship and honors our history, as a nation of immigrants, and helps this country to thrive.

“These tactics and policies undermine our democracy and must be stopped. As a non-profit organization committed to justice, we cannot remain silent while these atrocities are carried out with our tax dollars. Now is not the time for silence or neutrality. Our democracy cannot thrive while it is complicit in the abuse and dehumanization of people: whether they are children in Gaza or families seeking safety and opportunity in the United States. We call on our elected leaders to join us in this call. Our collective voice must rise louder than the forces of injustice. We must act now.”

Organized by the group Finger Lakes Rapid Response Network, they have been advocating against the ICE raids since 2017. Opposing the family’s separation, but also current immigration policies.

“There’s real grief,” Finger Lakes Rapid Response Network organizer Hannah Dickinson said. “I think we all feel like it's really sad that this is happening.

Miami (CNN) — A federal judge heard arguments Monday but declined to make an immediate ruling about the legal conditions of detainees at “Alligator Alcatraz.”

US District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz II heard arguments over detainee access to attorneys, if a clear immigration court was assigned for those held at the camp, and if the case was filed in the correct federal court.

“There have been a lot of changes on the ground” at “Alligator Alcatraz,” Ruiz said Monday during the hearing.

The Trump-nominated judge did not immediately rule on any of the issues from the bench or issue a preliminary injunction requested by the plaintiffs.

The harm taking place at the facility is “extorting,” an attorney for the ACLU told the court.

“What is happening at ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ is not normal,” Eunice Cho, senior counsel with the ACLU’s National Prison Project and the lead attorney in the case, told the court.

Plaintiffs argue detainees had no assigned immigration court

In the lawsuit filed by a number of those held at the camp and advocacy groups for immigrants, the plaintiffs claimed those held at the camp did not have an assigned immigration court of jurisdiction.

In a filing over the weekend, the United States government notified the court the Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami would serve as the immigration court with “administrative responsibilities over the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility.”

An attorney for the ACLU was skeptical the government would make this a permanent solution.

Detainees lack attorney access, ACLU says, but government says ‘access has been growing’

“There is a clear case and controversy” about attorney access at the detention camp, Cho told the court Monday.

She said the detention center had little or no means for attorneys to communicate with their clients with confidentiality via phone, mail or video conference.

The federal government and the state of Florida, both defendants in the case, sat at the same table in the courtroom Monday.

“Legal access has been growing as the facility stands up,” Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state of Florida, told the court. “Every day that goes by there is more access,” he added.

“The facility has continued to build more infrastructure,” and there are now rooms where attorney-client meetings can take place in private, Meros told the court.

Marlene Rodriguez, with the US Attorney’s Office, told the court “it just seems at the core” the issue is about the Attorney General and president’s initial decision to send detainees to the facility.

The judge noted the ACLU was not asking for the detention camp to be shut down as part of their litigation.

‘Venue is a very significant concern’

The state and federal government argued the case was filed in the improper court since the physical detention camp is not within the jurisdiction of the Miami court.

“Venue is a very significant concern,” the judge said.

He noted one of the federal defendants, Garrett Ripa, who is head of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in Miami, was within the court’s district.

The government argued Ripa didn’t play a significant role in the case.

The judge read back an agreement between the state and the federal government indicating the Miami office was responsible for supervision at “Alligator Alcatraz,” including a provision stating attorney-client privilege was protected.

The federal government noted any supervision happening is at the facility – physically outside the court’s district.

The judge, repeating previous comments, said he believes the case – at least for the federal defendants – was in the proper court.

The judge then took his focus to Florida. “Where is venue proper for the state defendants?” the judge asked the ACLU attorney.

The ACLU argued the case was in the proper venue, since the state and federal government had previously entered into an agreement with the Miami immigration field office, but the judge was skeptical.

“When it comes to running ‘Alligator Alcatraz,’ it seems like the state defendants are doing their thing, without input from the federal government,” the judge said, adding he had seen no documentation that the “day-to-day direction of operations” was coming from the federal government.

The judge said he needed to rule on the state’s issues about venue, adding, “I don’t want this to be delayed any further.”

What the plaintiffs are seeking

The goal of the plaintiffs was to make ensure the “basic constitutional rights” of detainees are being upheld, including the “basic right to be able to speak to their lawyers and the basic right to be able to petition the government for release from custody,” Cho, the ACLU attorney, told CNN last weekend.

The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, telling CNN in a statement Sunday the “facility maintains a physical space for attorneys to meet with their clients,” and attorneys may also request to speak with detainees they represent via email.

Deep in the marshy wetlands of the Florida Everglades, “Alligator Alcatraz” has been mired with controversy since the start, with reports of hundreds of migrants confined in cages amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals.

The state of Florida has pushed back, saying conditions at the camp are in “good working order” and that claims to the contrary are false.

During court on Monday the ACLU claimed at least one person held at the facility was improperly removed from the United States.

“Alligator Alcatraz cannot end up being a black hole where people disappear,” Cho previously told CNN.

Roger, an immigrant minor himself, is the latest child known to have been detained by ICE in private hotels.
They soon ended up in New York City, in a hotel near Times Square that was repurposed as a shelter for asylum seekers.
We couldn’t even look out the window.” The Izas were put on an ICE deportation flight to Guayaquil, Ecuador, on August 14.","The case of a 7-year-old detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sparked indignation across New York City. The child, however, is not the first New York youth caught up in President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant dragnet.

The Intercept has confirmed the identity of a 15-year-old Manhattan high school student deported to Ecuador after a secretive detention that involved days trapped inside hotels hundreds of miles away, while unable to contact the outside world.

The teen, Roger Iza, and his father, Edison Iza, were arrested by ICE at a check-in in New York on August 9 and, after being whisked to hotels in Louisiana then Texas, deported to Ecuador on August 14, the pair said by phone from Quito.

“We couldn’t call or go on the web to ask for help,” Roger said. “Without our phones, we didn’t know any names or phone numbers.”

ICE’s latest published data, from June and July, indicates that 48 minors were arrested in New York City, some counties north of the city, and parts of Long Island during those months, and 32 of them had been deported by last week. But who those children are is frequently shrouded in mystery. Roger Iza’s is the first account from a minor deportee to emerge from the Trump administration’s crackdown on New York City.

Detention centers operated by ICE allow unlimited phone calls to anyone with the money to pay for them or make collect calls; they also allow for attorney calls. The case of the 7-year-old and her mother has been highly publicized and garnered efforts by immigration activists, political leaders, and school administrators to keep her in the U.S.

Roger, however, was not in a detention center where it would have been relatively easy to communicate with the outside world. He was locked up with his father in a private hotel, with no ability to use the internet or phone to get attention to his case before it was too late. (ICE did not respond to questions for this story.)

As the immigration detention system is becoming more overcrowded, authorities are turning to hotels to house detainees. Earlier this month, The Intercept and Injustice Watch reported on the case of a mother and her infant son, a U.S. citizen, being locked incommunicado inside a Chicago Sonesta hotel for five days by ICE contractors. Roger, an immigrant minor himself, is the latest child known to have been detained by ICE in private hotels.

There may be many other such children.

Snatched at ICE Check-in

Two years ago, Edison and Roger Iza traveled to the Mexican border and presented themselves to border agents in El Paso, Texas, to apply for asylum. They soon ended up in New York City, in a hotel near Times Square that was repurposed as a shelter for asylum seekers. The New York Department of Education enrolled Roger, who was 13 at the time, in a public middle school near Union Square, where he quickly made an impression.

“Most of the immigrant kids kept to themselves, but Roger wasn’t insular,” said a native-born classmate who grew close to Roger there and requested anonymity for privacy because he is a minor. “He was fascinated with America and really into being an American. For instance, if people pronounced his name like in Spanish, ‘Ro-hair,’ he would say ‘No!’ and demand that they pronounce it like in English.”

Despite a language barrier, the two became good friends. They rented Citi Bikes and rode to Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. While Roger’s dad worked in construction, Roger spent time at his classmate’s apartment after school.

“He was giggly, shy, and joyous,” the classmate’s mother recalled. “And so sweet and polite.”

After Roger completed middle school, he enrolled in the Manhattan Academy for Arts and Language, near the Empire State Building.

In October of last year, an immigration judge in Manhattan denied a joint petition for asylum submitted by the Izas. They had filed it without a lawyer’s assistance because they could not afford counsel. Edison Iza said in an interview that he applied for asylum due to his inability to make a living in his home country because his business was constantly threatened by extortionists. Their attempt to appeal also failed.

In July, the Izas said, they were ordered to report to ICE for a check-in — a monitoring program requiring in-person attendance. The first meeting concluded without incident. Meanwhile, Roger attended a summer class at his high school, to raise a poor grade he’d gotten in math during the regular academic year.

According to a document examined by The Intercept, however, he and his father were ordered to appear at another check-in on August 9 — and this time they were arrested.

Edison, by phone from Quito, said, “It was so unexpected.”

“They Monitored Us”

Edison said that he and his son were taken to a holding area in a federal building in Manhattan, where their phones were seized. Roger recalled that within hours they were driven to LaGuardia Airport and put on a plane bound for Louisiana.

The Izas were taken to a Sheraton hotel in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to location information from Roger’s phone shared with The Intercept. The hotel is near a major ICE holding facility that serves as a deportation hub for Central and South America. (Neither the hotel nor Marriott International, Sheraton’s parent company, immediately responded to requests for comment.)

The father and son were told by security officers that they could make one call a day that could last for at most two minutes. They were ordered to speak in loud voices when they made the call, and not to disclose their location.

“They monitored us,” Roger said.

They made calls to Roger’s grandmother in New York. She said that Roger’s math teacher had called to ask why he wasn’t in class.

“When my grandmother told her I was being deported,” Roger said, “the teacher said that I could get a lawyer, but I would have to be in New York for that.”

The teacher may have been talking about the possibility of an attorney filing a habeas motion in a New York federal district court to free Roger. But he was no longer in New York, and he couldn’t contact his teacher.

After four days in the hotel, the Izas said they were flown to McAllen, Texas, and put into another hotel under the same conditions of isolation. Roger said they had no privacy.

“The guards were with us day and night, and they wrote down everything we did, even when I went to the bathroom. We couldn’t leave the room. We couldn’t even look out the window.”

The Izas were put on an ICE deportation flight to Guayaquil, Ecuador, on August 14.

When the father and son landed in Guayaquil and were given back their phones, the first person Roger called was his American friend, who was shocked to hear what had happened.

“It’s hard for me to comprehend that I might never see him again,” the friend said.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2230132283-e1755439700872.jpeg?fit=6000%2C3000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-18 16:57:25.585394

Atlanta, Ga. — U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff has successfully pressured the Trump Administration to restore Federal support for foster children that the Administration paused earlier this year.

In April, Sen. Ossoff soundedThis is an external link the alarm after the Trump Administration abruptly cutThis is an external link key Federal grants for programs that provide advocacy and support for foster children in Georgia. According to expertsThis is an external link, the Administration’s decision threatened the ability of Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) and volunteers to support children who have faced abuse, neglect, and instability.

Following sustained pressureThis is an external link from Sen. Ossoff and child welfare advocates across Georgia, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has now reversed course and reinstated the funding, according to the National CASA/GAL Association for Children.

“The Trump Administration should never have paused this funding in the first place,” Sen. Ossoff said. “I will continue my oversight to ensure that vulnerable foster children in Georgia and nationwide receive the support Congress directed to them.”

Georgia CASA leaders expressed deep gratitude for Sen. Ossoff’s intervention.

“We sincerely appreciate the support of Senator Ossoff and his team in following up on the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) termination of grant funding for the National CASA/GAL network. The reinstatement of funding from DOJ will allow the National CASA/GAL network to continue our critical work on behalf of children who have experienced abuse and neglect and deserve a caring, consistent adult to speak for their best interests in the courtroom and in the community,” said Sally Wilson Erny, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, National CASA/GAL Association for Children.

“This funding is more than just dollars, it is hope for children in foster care. At Atlanta CASA, it means we can continue to stand up for children who need someone in their corner, making sure their voices are heard, and their needs are not overlooked. Restoring this support ensures our volunteers and staff can do what they do best fight for stability, safety, and brighter futures for every child we serve,” said Domonique Cooper, CEO, Atlanta CASA.

“We are deeply grateful to Senator Ossoff for championing this funding. His support ensures that CASA volunteers can continue to stand beside children in foster care, giving them a consistent voice and trusted advocate during their most uncertain times. This investment strengthens families and protects the well-being of our community’s most vulnerable children,” said Kate Blair, Executive Director of Savannah/Chatham CASA.

The reinstated funding will allow CASA/GAL volunteers to continue providing life-changing advocacy and support to foster children in Georgia, ensuring their voices are heard and their needs are met.

Last year, Sen. Ossoff led a 13-month bipartisan investigation into Georgia’s foster care system, uncovering systemic abuse and neglect and issuing a series of recommendations to improve safety, oversight, and support for vulnerable children.

People with no criminal convictions at all make up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 people deported between January and May.
The numbers are estimates from a Marshall Project analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, provided to the Deportation Data Project in response to a FOIA request.
During that period, an average of 80 people a month were deported with only traffic offenses, compared with an average of over 350 per month so far under Trump’s second term.
The number of people deported with only nonviolent offenses — like trespassing, failure to appear in court, marijuana offenses, shoplifting and traffic violations — has almost doubled since January.","Contractor Hector Madrid Reyes was driving to Home Depot in March when he was rear-ended. As he and the other driver exchanged information, a Georgia State Patrol officer pulled up and asked for their licenses. Madrid, who arrived in the U.S. from Honduras as a teenager and was awaiting a court hearing for his asylum claim, didn’t have one.

“There’s no public transportation where we’re at, no Uber or Lyft,” said his wife, Jacqueline Maravilla, about his choice to drive. “Everything’s 45 minutes from everything. It’s a calculated risk we have to take to support our family.”

That risk has grown even greater for thousands of immigrant families under the Trump administration, as officials expand efforts to deport people with little or no criminal history.

The monthly number of people deported whose most serious conviction was a traffic violation — such as driving without a license — has more than tripled in the last six months, hitting almost 600 in May, according to new estimates by The Marshall Project. In total, over 1,800 people with traffic violations have been deported this year.

People with no criminal convictions at all make up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 people deported between January and May. For another 8%, the only offense on their record was illegal entry to the U.S. Only about 12% were convicted of a crime that was either violent or potentially violent. The numbers contradict officials’ continued claims that immigration enforcement is focusing on the “worst of the worst” criminal offenders.

The numbers are estimates from a Marshall Project analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, provided to the Deportation Data Project in response to a FOIA request. The group noted the dataset may be incomplete and could undercount the true numbers of deportations.

ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.

For many facing removal, the crimes on their records are years old. So far this year more than 600 people have been deported whose most serious convictions were marijuana-related offenses, and in three out of four cases, the offense occurred at least five years ago.

“It’s not at all about convictions anymore,” said Tim Warden-Hertz, a directing attorney of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a Washington-based legal organization. “There is no discretion. It’s just trying to get as many people as they can, any way that they can.”

Historical data from the Deportation Data Project shows that previous administrations also deported people with no convictions or only minor offenses, but the numbers have increased under Trump. From President Biden’s inauguration through the end of fiscal year 2023, the last day with available data, over half of the people deported had no criminal conviction. During that period, an average of 80 people a month were deported with only traffic offenses, compared with an average of over 350 per month so far under Trump’s second term.

Some of Trump’s advisors have said publicly that the administration’s goal is for 3,000 ICE arrests each day. But in recent court filings, immigration officials have denied having a quota.

Some attorneys worry this pressure to deport more people is leading to an increase in racial profiling, and that more drivers of color are being pulled over for minor traffic violations as a way to check their legal status. Twenty states have recently passed laws that increase local police’s involvement in immigration enforcement. And a growing number of police departments are signing agreements with the Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration laws during encounters like routine traffic stops.

“We hear people pulled over for minor reasons, like a broken blinker, crossing the yellow line, or the tint is too dark on windows,” said Paul R. Chavez, director of litigation and advocacy for Americans for Immigrant Justice, a Miami-based nonprofit. “People are arrested for those very minor things, brought to jail, fingerprinted, and then handed over to ICE.”

Chavez noted that many people are being charged solely with driving without a license, a crime police generally discover only after making a traffic stop. “If you’re pulled over and that’s the only accusation, in my mind that’s pretty clear evidence of racial profiling,” he said.

The number of people deported with only nonviolent offenses — like trespassing, failure to appear in court, marijuana offenses, shoplifting and traffic violations — has almost doubled since January.

After Madrid’s accident, he says he passed a breathalyzer test. But he admitted he had smoked weed the night before, 18 hours prior. The Georgia State Patrol officer arrested him on charges of driving without a license and driving under the influence.

Madrid’s only existing conviction was for driving without a license in 2019, he said. Back then, “He got arrested, I bailed him out, he had a court date, he paid the fine,” Maravilla said. “And that was the end of it.”

Things went differently this time. After Maravilla paid Madrid’s bond, ICE officers picked him up and ultimately took him to Stewart Detention Center, south of Columbus, Georgia. A judge denied his release from detention, citing the DUI charge for marijuana use the night before the accident. But the hearing in his criminal case wouldn’t happen until the following summer. Madrid had to decide between spending at least a year stuck inside a remote, overcrowded detention center — or leaving his wife and family behind.

In early July, Madrid opted to self-deport to Honduras. Maravilla, a U.S. citizen who has never been on a plane and doesn’t have a passport, is working to save enough money to visit him and bring him some of his belongings. The two were married just three weeks before his arrest.

“It’s a deep pain,” Madrid told The Marshall Project in Spanish. “I am not there with my wife, cannot see my mother and give her a hug, or help them with what I earn from my work. Listening to my wife cry on the phone has been something I do not wish for anyone.”

As such, Attorney General Neronha and the coalition are requesting that the Court permanently enjoin the Trump Administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.

Neronha today co-led a coalition of 21 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit in Rhode Island against the Trump Administration over the imposition of illegal conditions on more than $1 billion in Congressionally-authorized funds for Victims of Crime Act grant recipients. The Trump Administration, disregarding the law and the intent of Congress, has declared that states will be unable to access these funds – used to support victims and survivors of crimes – unless they agree to support the Trump Administration’s extreme immigration enforcement efforts.

“When the U.S. Department of Justice is actively preventing Americans from receiving – justice – we have a problem,” said Attorney General Neronha. “We’ve seen this before, DOJ threatening to unlawfully withhold critical federal funding for things like disaster relief and safe roads and bridges. Now, the department tasked with ensuring justice for all is targeting victims and survivors as they attempt to navigate some of the most difficult times of their lives. And their supposed reasoning here is unfounded: Rhode Island consistently cooperates with all federal law enforcement agencies, as required by federal law. What we won’t, and can’t do legally, is divert important state law enforcement resources to do the federal government’s civil immigration law bidding.

“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable. In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation. We can and must support crime victims, and support must not be illegally tethered to federal policies. We are on the right side of the law here, and we will prevail.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable states to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives. Supported programs include victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and much more. These funding streams—totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide—have long ensured that states could fulfill their most fundamental duties: to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents. States use these funds to assist nearly nine million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year. Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to states based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump Administration, through the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ), has declared that states, along with the victims and survivors they serve, will be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the Administration’s political agenda – namely its immigration enforcement priorities. To receive these funds, states must assist the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with civil immigration enforcement efforts – a federal government responsibility.

This directive conflicts with core principles of American governance – the separation of powers and federalism. Congress did not authorize USDOJ to impose conditions on these grant programs that coerce states to devote their resources to enacting the Administration’s immigration agenda. As such, Attorney General Neronha and the coalition are requesting that the Court permanently enjoin the Trump Administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.

In Rhode Island, VOCA grants are the primary source of funding for victim services. Most of that funding flows from VOCA’s two main grants: victim compensation grants, which provide direct financial support to crime victims, and victim assistance grants, which are almost entirely distributed to nonprofits throughout the state to provide additional support services to those impacted by crime. For federal FY 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3 million in VOCA victim assistance funds and another close to $300K in VOCA victim compensation funds. During that same time period, VOCA assistance funds were used to provide services to approximately 41,015 individuals through dozens of nonprofits, and 635 individuals received VOCA compensation payments through the State’s Crime Victim Compensation Program.

Attorney General Neronha co-leads the coalition together with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and is joined in filing the lawsuit by the attorneys general of Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

Greece's conservative government suspended all asylum claims for migrants arriving by sea from North Africa in July, a move it argued helped deter crossings that peaked in July at more than 2,500 in a single week.

The suspension passed by a vote of 177-74 despite fierce opposition from left-wing parties, which unsuccessfully challenged the amendment as unconstitutional.

The emergency measures drew sharp criticism from international human rights organisations.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees expressed ""deep concern."" While acknowledging Greece's right to manage borders, UNHCR said border control ""must be in line with international and European law.""

Michael O’Flaherty, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, also condemned Athens' response, arguing it ""would legalise returning people to face a risk of torture and other serious violations, in breach of (Greece's international) obligations.""

But Thanos Plevris, the migration affairs minister, told lawmakers up to 1,000 migrants were arriving daily and described the situation as resembling an ""invasion.""

Trying to reach Europe

Greece remains a key entry point to the EU for individuals fleeing conflict and hardship in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

Arrivals surged last year, with over 60,000 migrants landing in Greece — the majority by sea — compared to around 48,000 in 2023, according to UN refugee agency data.

""Alligator Alcatraz cannot end up being a black hole where people disappear,"" Cho previously told CNN.","MIAMI — A federal judge heard arguments Monday but declined to make an immediate ruling about the legal conditions of detainees at ""Alligator Alcatraz.""

U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz II heard arguments over detainee access to attorneys, if a clear immigration court was assigned for those held at the camp, and if the case was filed in the correct federal court.

What's at stake in Monday's Alligator Alcatraz hearing

""There have been a lot of changes on the ground"" at ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" Ruiz said Monday during the hearing.

The Trump-nominated judge did not immediately rule on any of the issues from the bench or issue a preliminary injunction requested by the plaintiffs.

The harm taking place at the facility is ""extorting,"" an attorney for the ACLU told the court.

""What is happening at 'Alligator Alcatraz' is not normal,"" Eunice Cho, senior counsel with the ACLU's National Prison Project and the lead attorney in the case, told the court.

Plaintiffs argue detainees had no assigned immigration court

In the lawsuit filed by a number of those held at the camp and advocacy groups for immigrants, the plaintiffs claimed those held at the camp did not have an assigned immigration court of jurisdiction.

In a filing over the weekend, the United States government notified the court the Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami would serve as the immigration court with ""administrative responsibilities over the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility.""

An attorney for the ACLU was skeptical the government would make this a permanent solution.

Environmental court battle over 'Alligator Alcatraz' exposes impacts on state

Detainees lack attorney access, ACLU says, but government says 'access has been growing'

""There is a clear case and controversy"" about attorney access at the detention camp, Cho told the court Monday.

She said the detention center had little or no means for attorneys to communicate with their clients with confidentiality via phone, mail or video conference.

The federal government and the state of Florida, both defendants in the case, sat at the same table in the courtroom Monday.

""Legal access has been growing as the facility stands up,"" Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state of Florida, told the court. ""Every day that goes by there is more access,"" he added.

""The facility has continued to build more infrastructure,"" and there are now rooms where attorney-client meetings can take place in private, Meros told the court.

Marlene Rodriguez, with the U.S. Attorney's Office, told the court ""it just seems at the core"" the issue is about the Attorney General and the president's initial decision to send detainees to the facility.

The judge noted the ACLU was not asking for the detention camp to be shut down as part of their litigation.

'Venue is a very significant concern'

The state and federal government argued the case was filed in the improper court since the physical detention camp is not within the jurisdiction of the Miami court.

""Venue is a very significant concern,"" the judge said.

He noted one of the federal defendants, Garrett Ripa, who is head of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in Miami, was within the court’s district.

The government argued Ripa didn't play a significant role in the case.

The judge read back an agreement between the state and the federal government indicating the Miami office was responsible for supervision at “Alligator Alcatraz,” including a provision stating attorney-client privilege was protected.

The federal government noted any supervision happening is at the facility — physically outside the court’s district.

The judge, repeating previous comments, said he believes the case – at least for the federal defendants – was in the proper court.

The judge then took his focus to Florida. ""Where is venue proper for the state defendants?"" the judge asked the ACLU attorney.

The ACLU argued the case was in the proper venue, since the state and federal government had previously entered into an agreement with the Miami immigration field office, but the judge was skeptical.

""When it comes to running 'Alligator Alcatraz,' it seems like the state defendants are doing their thing, without input from the federal government,” the judge said, adding he had seen no documentation that the “day-to-day direction of operations” was coming from the federal government.

The judge said he needed to rule on the state’s issues about venue, adding, ""I don't want this to be delayed any further.""

What the plaintiffs are seeking

The goal of the plaintiffs was to make ensure the ""basic constitutional rights"" of detainees are being upheld, including the “basic right to be able to speak to their lawyers and the basic right to be able to petition the government for release from custody,"" Cho, the ACLU attorney, told CNN last weekend.

The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, telling CNN in a statement Sunday the ""facility maintains a physical space for attorneys to meet with their clients,"" and attorneys may also request to speak with detainees they represent via email.

Deep in the marshy wetlands of the Florida Everglades, ""Alligator Alcatraz"" has been mired with controversy since the start, with reports of hundreds of migrants confined in cages amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals.

The state of Florida has pushed back, saying conditions at the camp are in “good working order” and that claims to the contrary are false.

During court on Monday the ACLU claimed at least one person held at the facility was improperly removed from the United States.

""Alligator Alcatraz cannot end up being a black hole where people disappear,"" Cho previously told CNN.

(Reuters) -A group of Democratic-led states filed a lawsuit on Monday seeking to prevent the Trump administration from forcing them to cooperate with immigration enforcement activities in order to receive grant funding to support crime victims.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in Rhode Island is the latest case to challenge efforts by Republican President Donald Trump's administration to impose immigration-related conditions on states' ability to receive federal funding.

Monday's lawsuit by state attorneys general in 20 states and the District of Columbia takes aim at a condition the U.S. Department of Justice recently imposed on the ability of states to receive grants pursuant to the Victims of Crime Act, which Congress enacted in 1984 to bolster support for crime victims.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The department administers programs funded by fines and penalties assessed in federal criminal cases that allow states to receive grant funding to provide services for victims including medical care, counseling, shelter and compensation for lost wages.

Attorneys general from states including California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island say those funds help about 10 million people annually. In 2025, nearly $1.4 billion in such funding is available, the lawsuit said.

But under a new Trump administration policy, states can lose out on such funding if they decline to provide U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to facilities or honor all civil immigration enforcement requests, the lawsuit said.

The conditions were imposed in keeping with a policy Attorney General Pam Bondi unveiled in February requiring the Justice Department to ensure that federal funds do not flow to so-called ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" that do not cooperate with ICE.

The states' lawsuit argues that such conditions are unlawful and violate the U.S. Constitution by undermining Congress’ power over appropriations. They are asking a judge to block the Justice Department from enforcing the conditions.

Judges in Rhode Island have issued a series of rulings preventing the administration from imposing conditions on grant funding that align with Trump's broader agenda.

Most recently, a judge in the state this month barred the Justice Department from enforcing new restrictions on grant funding used to support victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.

All law enforcement agencies involved should respect the right to protest and ensure that those responsible for abuse are held to account.

(Los Angeles, August 18, 2025) – Law enforcement officers responded to protests against immigration raids in and around Los Angeles, California, between June 6 and 14, 2025, with excessive force and deliberate brutality, Human Rights Watch said today.

Officers fired tear gas, pepper balls, hard foam rounds, and flash-bang grenades directly at protesters, journalists, and other observers, often at close range and often without sufficient warning or provocation. Scores of people suffered injuries, ranging from severe bruising and lacerations to broken bones, concussions, an amputated finger, and severe eye damage.

“Sweeping immigration raids have terrorized communities across Los Angeles and driven thousands of people to the streets in protest,” said Ida Sawyer, crisis, conflict and arms director at Human Rights Watch. “Local, state, and federal law enforcement’s aggressive response to these protests violently oppressed the public’s right to express outrage and the media’s right to report safely.”

The protests were sparked by a dramatic escalation of immigration raids across Los Angeles and the surrounding area, following the Trump administration’s orders to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to increase daily arrests of undocumented immigrants. Heavily armed federal agents have stormed stores, warehouses, hotels, restaurants, farms, car washes, taco stands, and other workplaces and detained those they suspect of being undocumented with the aim of deporting them.

Human Rights Watch observed protests and visited locations of ICE raids in and around Los Angeles from June 10 to 14, and interviewed 39 people, including protesters, journalists, legal observers, volunteer street medics, immigration rights advocates and organizers, and others affected by the raids. Researchers analyzed lawsuits, documentation by the Los Angeles Press Club, media reports, and photos and videos recorded during the protests and posted on social media or shared directly with researchers.

Human Rights Watch documented 65 cases in which law enforcement officers from various local, state, and federal agencies injured protesters, journalists, and other observers. The actual number is most likely much higher. In the three weeks following June 6, more than 280 people contacted the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Southern California, most reporting that they had been personally injured by law enforcement agents while engaged in protest activity.

The first major protests began on June 6, when ICE agents raided several locations, including two Ambiance Apparel facilities in the Los Angeles Fashion District. On June 7, a group of protesters encountered armed federal agents and Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) deputies in the suburb of Paramount, across from a Home Depot store outside an office park where there were reports of a planned raid.

In a directive issued on June 7, US President Donald Trump claimed the Los Angeles protests “constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States,” called in the National Guard, and authorized the deployment of “any other members of the regular Armed Forces as necessary.” On June 9, the administration mobilized 700 active-duty Marines to join several thousand National Guard soldiers, who primarily guarded federal buildings. Local and state officials objected to Trump’s actions, though local police themselves acted to aggressively shut down the protests.

Starting on June 6 and at least through June 14, protesters gathered every day outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, where agents detained many undocumented people. Protesters also demonstrated at other government buildings in the surrounding area of downtown Los Angeles.

Human Rights Watch repeatedly witnessed and documented law enforcement officers forcing protesters to leave certain areas, often with no apparent justification and without delivering clear, audible dispersal orders or warnings. Officers frequently aimed and fired their “less lethal” launchers directly at protesters, sometimes at close range, including using tear gas, pepper balls, hard foam rounds, and flash-bang grenades. These weapons, while less deadly than bullets, can cause serious injury and death.

Human Rights Watch documented 39 cases of journalists injured by law enforcement, most of whom were holding cameras and wearing visible press credentials. Several appear to have been deliberately targeted. On June 8, a police officer fired a kinetic impact projectile directly at Lauren Tomasi, an Australian journalist from 9News, while she was reporting live on television from downtown Los Angeles, leaving a bruise on her leg.

On June 9, a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer shot three people—all known advocates for police accountability—at very close range with kinetic impact projectiles, leaving each of them in serious pain for days, according to two of the advocates and video footage Human Rights Watch reviewed. Before shooting one of them in the groin, the officer said: “I’m going to pop you, as you are taking up my focus.”

A volunteer street medic, who was himself hospitalized after being lacerated by a hard foam round that caused a deep, gaping wound, said he spent several hours in downtown Los Angeles on June 14 responding to people yelling for help. They included protesters hit by projectiles and bleeding from their heads or faces, one with a broken leg, and others with difficulty seeing and hearing because of the flash-bangs and tear gas.

There were some acts of violence against police and property destruction by protesters, primarily in the early days of the protests. Human Rights Watch found evidence that most of the violence by protesters occurred after acts of violence by law enforcement officers, and that only a small portion of the protesting crowd engaged in destructive acts. To the extent individuals engaged in violent or destructive acts, law enforcement officers did not limit their aggressive actions and response to those individuals.

Human Rights Watch found that law enforcement officers committed clear violations of international human rights law. These findings also implicate civil rights protections under the US Constitution, as well as recently amended California state law, which includes strict restrictions on when and how law enforcement officers may use force to disperse protests and provides protections for journalists covering protests.

Human Rights Watch wrote to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the LAPD, and the LASD on July 31, but has not received responses.

In a June 23 statement, Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said the department would conduct a “comprehensive evaluation of each use-of-force incident” and act against any officer “who has fallen short” of the department’s standards. While he said the protests had “most often been marked by peaceful expression,” they were at times “hijacked by violence, vandalism, and criminal aggression” and “officers were justified in taking swift and measured action to prevent further harm and restore public safety.”

Journalists, protesters, and legal observers have filed several lawsuits against the City and County of Los Angeles and the DHS regarding the harm caused during these protests. Past lawsuits regarding law enforcement misconduct during protests in Los Angeles have cost taxpayers millions of dollars in settlements, but secured little to no accountability for the agencies and senior officials responsible for the abuse nor changes in law enforcement practice.

“Law enforcement officers in Los Angeles used brutal, excessive, and unnecessary force against people standing up for human rights and those reporting on the protests,” Sawyer said. “All law enforcement agencies involved should respect the right to free speech and protest, protect journalists, and ensure that those responsible for abuse are held to account.”

Applicable Legal Standards

International Law

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the United States is a party, protects the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. US obligations under the covenant extend to authorities at every level of government, federal, state, and local. The Unites States is thus obliged to ensure that all law enforcement personnel respect fundamental rights.

The ICCPR allows only for limited restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly that are “necessary in a democratic society” to protect a narrow range of important interests including public order, public safety, and the rights of others. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, an international expert body that monitors compliance with the ICCPR, issued a General Comment in September 2020 that offers detailed practical guidance on how governments should approach their obligation to respect the right to peaceful assembly.

It emphasizes that restrictions on the right should be carefully tailored; more specifically, they should both be necessary for and proportionate to a permissible ground for restriction. It also emphasizes that restrictions justified on grounds of public safety require the authorities to demonstrate “a real and significant risk to the safety of persons (to life and security of person) or a similar risk of serious damage to property.”

Even when law enforcement personnel may have a legitimate basis to confront or curtail demonstrators, their use of force should be carefully calibrated. Under the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Personnel, law enforcement officials should use nonviolent means before resorting to force and avoid using force to disperse nonviolent protests, regardless of whether the authorities deem the protests illegal.

Using force is only appropriate if other measures to address a genuine threat have proved ineffective or have no likelihood of achieving the intended result. When using force, law enforcement should provide clear warnings, exercise restraint, and act proportionately, taking into account both the seriousness of the offense and the legitimate objective to be achieved.

Federal Law

The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees the right to free speech and peaceful assembly and treats these rights as a core pillar of the country’s system of governance. US courts have evolved a deep jurisprudence governing permissible regulation of, and limitations on, the exercise of these rights. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable search and seizures by law enforcement, including the use of excessive force during an arrest or other seizure.

State Law

Following the 2020 George Floyd protests, California passed laws restricting the use of less lethal weapons during protests and protecting the rights of journalists and others. Section 13652 of California’s Penal Code forbids law enforcement from using “kinetic energy projectiles” to disperse an assembly, protest, or demonstration, except “to defend against a threat to life or serious bodily injury” or to “bring any objectively dangerous and unlawful situation safely under control.”

Even under those circumstances, such use of force is permitted only when a list of other requirements are met, including making reasonable efforts to identify violent individuals and not shooting indiscriminately into a crowd; not targeting heads, neck, or vital organs; giving clear, audible warnings; allowing people a chance to leave; and attempting reasonable de-escalation techniques. Law enforcement may not use these weapons solely to confront curfew violations, verbal threats, or noncompliance with law enforcement directives. The same provision requires officers to minimize use of these weapons on bystanders, journalists, medical personnel, and others.

Penal Code section 409.7 states that journalists may enter areas closed by law enforcement during protests and that law enforcement officers shall not remove or otherwise interfere with individuals who are lawfully gathering news at these events.

The Los Angeles Police and Sheriff’s departments issued directives in late 2021 outlining how officers should comply with these laws.

Law Enforcement Agencies Deployed to Los Angeles Protests

A range of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies were deployed to protests in the Los Angeles area from June 6 to 14.

Los Angeles police officers and sheriff’s deputies were present at nearly all protests and led efforts to police or disperse these protests. Officers from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) primarily blocked entry points to the 101 Freeway in downtown Los Angeles.

Federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)—including from ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP)—as well as agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) engaged with protesters at immigration raids and deployed outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility, along with other federal buildings in downtown Los Angeles.

Following President Trump’s June 7 directive, approximately 2,000 National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles under federal authority. On June 9, the administration sent an additional 2,000 troops and mobilized 700 active-duty Marines to join them. They primarily guarded federal buildings. All but around 250 National Guard personnel have since been withdrawn.

Less Lethal Weapons Used Against Protesters and Observers

Law enforcement officers fired a range of less lethal weapons at protesters. They included chemical irritants, including tear gas, pepper spray, and pepper balls, all of which are designed to temporarily incapacitate people through severe irritation to the eyes, nose, face, lungs, and skin. Officers also fired kinetic impact projectiles, including sponge or hard foam rounds, which are designed to cause pain upon impact without penetrating the skin, and flash-bang grenades, which are meant to disorient people by temporarily disrupting sight and hearing.

Police officers also used horses, batons, shields, and their hands to knock protesters and observers over, push them back, or beat them.

Excessive Force by Law Enforcement

Human Rights Watch documented the 65 cases of individuals injured by law enforcement officers during the protests based on interviews with victims and witnesses, analysis of photos and videos, and reviews of lawsuits, credible media reporting, and documentation by the Los Angeles Press Club.

Most were hit and injured by kinetic impact projectiles, including hard foam rounds, pepper balls, or the canisters delivering tear gas and flash-bang grenades. In many cases, officers fired directly at individuals, sometimes from very close range, and targeted their upper body, head, or groin area. Several others were injured by officers on horseback, using their horses to trample or ram into people and beating people from atop their horses with batons, or when officers not on horseback beat individuals with their batons or hands.

The injuries included severe bruising, lacerations, hematomas, concussions, broken bones (including to the ribs, hand, fingers, and nose), near-severing of a finger in one case and an amputated finger in another, severe eye damage resulting in loss of vision in one eye, and large gaping wounds caused by projectiles that entered or hit legs.

Of these injuries, it appears that police officers were responsible for 36 cases, federal agents were responsible for 13 cases, sheriff’s deputies were responsible for 8 cases, and Highway Patrol officers were responsible for 1 case. In seven cases, it is not clear which agency was responsible.

Human Rights Watch also documented many incidents of officers firing tear gas and other chemical irritants into crowds, causing temporary incapacitation. These cases are not included among the 65 injured.

The actual number of injured is likely much greater than those documented, including those with more minor injuries who did not seek medical attention or speak out publicly.

The Los Angeles Times reported on July 10 that the police department was investigating 86 complaints against officers from the recent protests, including 59 cases of possible excessive force and 3 in which people were hospitalized.

Researchers repeatedly observed and documented law enforcement officers using force to disperse protesters and others, without giving clear, audible dispersal orders or a reasonable opportunity to disperse. Protesters and observers also expressed frustration about the lack of clarity about where they were allowed to go. In many cases, a line of officers would forcibly push the protesters in one direction, only for them to meet another line of officers pushing them in the opposite direction. In at least one case, officers clearly “kettled” or contained protesters, without giving them a way to disperse, before detaining them.

Violence by Protesters

Human Rights Watch researchers were present on June 11, 12, and 13 and saw no acts of protester violence. During protests earlier in the week, particularly on June 8, some protesters threw water bottles and rocks in the direction of law enforcement officers, lit fireworks, set a tire on fire, and wrote graffiti on government buildings, based on accounts from protesters and observers and videos Human Rights Watch reviewed. A few people set five empty Waymos, self-driving vehicles, on fire that day. Some people threw objects at police cars on the freeway. In the most serious incident documented, also on June 8, a video Human Rights Watch analyzed shows an individual throwing a rock from an overpass over the 101 Freeway near City Hall, hitting a police officer’s protective face gear. The officer then runs for cover under the overpass. Witnesses and a Los Angeles Times reporter covering the protest said the crowd had been peaceful until police initiated the use of force.

On June 14, Human Rights Watch observed and documented a few instances in which protesters threw bottles at police officers, after police had charged the crowd with horses and fired large quantities of less lethal ammunition at them. There may have been isolated incidents by individual protesters earlier that day, but otherwise the protest was not violent or destructive.

Los Angeles Police Chief McDonnell said that 52 officers suffered injuries requiring medical treatment, but did not elaborate on the extent of those injuries or how they occurred.

Selection of Incidents Documented by Human Rights Watch

Below is a selection of the incidents documented in which law enforcement officers used force against protesters.

Ambiance Apparel Warehouse and Store, June 6

In the late morning on June 6, federal agents, including from ICE and the FBI, conducted a series of coordinated raids of workplaces. Masked and dressed in tactical gear, they went to the Ambiance Apparel headquarters on 15th Street and their clothing showroom and warehouse on Towne Street, both in the Fashion District near downtown Los Angeles. They arrested over 40 people, handcuffed them, loaded them into vans and SUVs, and took them to the Metropolitan Detention Center downtown.

According to the US Attorney for the Central District of California, federal officials had a judicial warrant to search the business for “fictitious employee documents.” It is unclear how they determined who to detain and take from these workplaces.

As news of the raids spread, people gathered outside the two Ambiance Apparel facilities to support the workers and voice opposition to the raids, including family members of workers, people living and working in the surrounding community, and labor and immigrant rights advocates. Human Rights Watch spoke to several witnesses who saw the federal agents loading people into unmarked vans and said the agents prevented detainees from speaking with their family members. One person, who watched agents take his father, said the agents were aggressive with the people they detained, even though they were compliant. Advocates yelled out to the detained workers, advising them in Spanish to exercise their right to remain silent.

At the 15th Street facility, some people stood in front of the ICE vans attempting to enter the facility through the front gate. David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West (SEIU-USWW), positioned himself at the gate until federal agents pushed him to the ground, injuring him, and then arrested him. The US Attorney filed criminal charges against Huerta, alleging “conspiracy to impede an officer.” Los Angeles Police Department officers later formed a skirmish line and moved protesters away from the front gate, assisting the federal agents leaving the facility.

Family members and protesters similarly gathered at the Towne Street facility. Masked and helmeted FBI agents, in combat gear and brandishing assault rifles, forcibly cleared the crowd, knocking people down with batons and shields to allow ICE agents and their vans to leave with their prisoners. After the vans left, FBI agents backed away from the facility as the crowd followed them. A couple of people threw plastic bottles at the well-armored and shielded agents, who fired flash-bang grenades at the crowd as they left the area.

Paramount, June 7

On June 7, federal agents in full tactical gear from the DHS, including CBP, deployed outside a commercial park across from a Home Depot store on Alondra Boulevard in Paramount, a southern suburb of Los Angeles. As word spread of the agents’ presence, people from the neighborhood and around Los Angeles gathered in protest. From late morning into the evening, federal agents repeatedly fired tear gas, pepper balls, and hard foam projectiles at the crowd, who mostly stayed across the street, with people often hiding behind trees, based on witness accounts and video footage Human Rights Watch reviewed.

An immigrant rights advocate said that around noon, federal agents shot him repeatedly with less lethal munitions: “They had just done a round of tear gas. I had a gas mask on and no one else did, so I went … to move the [tear gas] canister away from the families protesting.” He said that he put the canister into a container and turned around to go back, when he “heard lots of shooting and felt the impact on my back.”

They hit him at least four times with what appear to have been 40mm blue-capped foam rounds that left large bruises on his buttocks, lower-left thigh, back of his right knee, and back of his right ankle, based on the injuries seen and photographs Human Rights Watch reviewed. He said they also hit him in the back with pepper balls, which did not leave longer-term marks, but made him feel like his “back was on fire.”

The advocate said there was no dispersal order before the officers fired at him, that his back was to them, and that he was “not even approaching them,” leading him to view the shooting as arbitrary and unwarranted.

Federal agents also injured Ryanne Mena, a reporter from the Los Angeles Daily News, shooting her in the head above the ear with a less lethal projectile, then unleashing a large amount of tear gas. “I’ve been teargassed a number of times,” she said. “But nothing like this. I have asthma, and it was really tough for me to breathe or see. My friend [another journalist, who was also hit above his eye with a projectile] helped lead me around the corner to get away from this really big cloud of tear gas. We were just coughing, struggling to breathe.” Mena suffered a concussion and shared her medical report with Human Rights Watch.

Sheriff’s deputies deployed to surrounding streets, where protesters had also gathered.

Nick Stern, a Los Angeles-based British photojournalist, arrived in the area at around 3 p.m., and saw a skirmish line of sheriff’s deputies and a group of about 150 protesters further west along Alondra Boulevard. “We pulled up to the sound of less lethals being fired,” he said. Stern said it appeared that deputies were firing projectiles at the crowd and that some in the crowd responded by throwing plastic water bottles. Later in the day, he said, some protesters also threw stones and set off fireworks. But, Stern said, the protesters were 150 to 200 feet away from the deputies, and so the objects they threw hit the ground without reaching the officers.

Starting around 7:30 p.m., Stern said, “the LASD just launched this barrage of less lethals: high foam impact devices, flash-bangs, pepper balls. It resembled a war zone.” Stern said he was clearly identified as a journalist, holding up his press card and carrying a large professional camera. At 8:50 p.m., he was standing in the street near a group of people. At that moment, Stern said, “no one had stones, bottles, or fireworks at all near me. They were just waving flags.” Then, he suddenly “felt this excruciating pain in my right thigh. I instinctively put my hand down and felt something solid sticking out of my leg.”

A bystander captured the moment on camera. In the video, Stern is standing in the middle of the street, about 150 feet from the police line, when a sudden bang and flash of light erupts just a meter in front of him. Clutching his leg in pain, Stern begins to stagger away.

A group of protesters carried Stern to the curb, where a volunteer medic cut his pants off and applied a bandage to stop the bleeding. Stern briefly passed out. “It was really scary,” he said. “When I came back, I had no clue where I was or who these people were.” They rushed him to the hospital. He had surgery the next day to remove a 3-inch (7.5-centimeter) long, hard plastic object that appears to have housed an explosive warning device or flash-bang.

Stern remained in the hospital for three nights. When Human Rights Watch interviewed him a week after the incident, he was still in pain and largely bedridden.

Downtown Los Angeles, June 6 to 14

After the detainees from Ambiance Apparel were taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center on June 6, protesters gathered outside and in the surrounding neighborhood every afternoon and evening through at least June 14. Protests varied in size, with the largest on June 8 and 14. Following are some of the incidents Human Rights Watch documented.

June 8

Thousands of protesters were in downtown Los Angeles on June 8. National Guard soldiers deployed outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, police officers set up lines throughout the surrounding area, and large numbers of California Highway Patrol personnel were on and around the nearby 101 Freeway. Human Rights Watch interviewed six protest participants.

The National Guard fired tear gas at the crowd starting in the early afternoon, two witnesses said. A Los Angeles Times reporter who was present described the protest as “peaceful” until National Guardsmen charged the crowd and launched tear gas and smoke grenades. By 2 or 3 p.m., large groups of protesters had gathered on Alameda Street between Temple and Aliso Streets, on either side of the detention center. At Alameda and Temple, the police arrived in riot gear and started firing less lethal projectiles at the crowd, three witnesses said.

The police actions scattered the crowd as another larger group of protesters marched into the area. Some went to Los Angeles and Temple Streets, by City Hall, where police officers fired kinetic impact projectiles and pushed the protesters back with horses. Two witnesses said they saw officers striking one person with batons.

Meanwhile, another group of protesters was near the 101 Freeway, north of the Metropolitan Detention Center. A witness in that area said that Highway Patrol officers had initially blocked the entrance to the freeway, but then moved. Once the ramp was clear, a few dozen protesters went down the ramp and onto the freeway, unfurling a banner. Highway Patrol officers formed a skirmish line and pushed the protesters off the freeway using force, including tear gas, and arrested some of them.

As police were firing on the protesters near City Hall and addressing the situation at the freeway, a separate group of people vandalized and burned five empty Waymo driverless cars on Alameda Street, just north of the protest. Police did not appear to respond. Later in the day and into the evening, after the bigger protests had largely dispersed, small groups of people vandalized government buildings with graffiti and some people on the street above the freeway threw things, including chunks of concrete, at Highway Patrol cars and officers on the freeway below them.

Two street medics said they treated multiple people for injuries from the projectiles on June 8. One described the spent ammunition propellent cartridges she saw lining the streets. The other said that after treating dozens of injuries, including many head injuries, she was shot in the head with a projectile while in her car near the Federal Building at around 6 p.m. She said she experienced headaches, nausea, blurred vision, and an inability to concentrate for almost a week afterwards. She also said that police shot her husband in the foot, causing him pain for weeks.

June 9

Protesters again gathered in downtown Los Angeles on June 9. Human Rights Watch documented several instances in which police officers fired less lethal munitions at close range at people without justification, causing injuries.

Jeremy Lindenfeld, a reporter, was filming police officers as they rushed toward a group of protesters near Little Tokyo at around 7:30 p.m. “I had my press helmet on, my press badge, and I was videotaping them detain a protester right in front of me,” he said. “They tackled him, got him down to the ground, detained him, and then, a few seconds later … one of the LAPD officers raised the foam baton launcher at me and just fired.” A video shows him backing away from the line of police after the arrest is made. An officer standing a few meters away fires a projectile directly at Lindenfeld, without warning. Lindenfeld said it left him with a bruise on his stomach.

At around 9:30 p.m., a police officer shot three people, all known advocates for police accountability, at very close range with less lethal projectiles, just outside police headquarters. An officer “had his less lethal 40mm pointed at us as we were walking by the headquarters,” one of the advocates said. “We were like, ‘What are you doing? Are you going to shoot us right now?’ Within a minute, he shot my buddy in the leg. He had his hands up when he was shot… I back up into the street, clearly not a threat,” and then the officer pointed his weapon “directly at me and gets me in the stomach.”

The officer didn’t have his name or badge number on his helmet, so the third advocate then approached him, while filming, and asked for his name and badge number. The officer said: “I’m going to pop you, as you are taking up my focus,” and shot him in the groin at close range. Moments later, the officer shot him again as he was backing away.

All three were still in pain several days later. One said: “It felt like I got hit by a 90 miles-per-hour fastball in my stomach. It hurts to move or get up when I’m sitting.”

June 11

On June 11, protesters marched from Pershing Square to Grand Park, across the street from City Hall. Police officers and sheriff’s deputies were there by the time protesters arrived, around 6:15 p.m., with skirmish lines on the steps of City Hall and at the north end of the block by Temple and Spring Streets. The protesters were chanting and standing in the park and on the street. One witness said police gave a dispersal order at Temple and Spring Streets, but that it was not audible in the park where most people were, and it was not repeated.

By about 6:30 p.m., Human Rights Watch observed police officers forming lines sealing off the area and firing flash-bang grenades. Around 6:45 p.m., police officers and sheriff’s deputies were firing what appeared to be pepper balls and other kinetic impact projectiles at people in the park.

At 6:53 p.m., Human Rights Watch saw police officers on horseback moving in on protesters who were fleeing that section of the park. One officer on horseback rammed a protester to the ground using their horse as the protester was moving away with her back turned. Several other mounted officers immediately moved toward her. Other protesters rushed in to assist her. One officer drew a baton, swung it, and struck another officer’s horse on the head, then hit a protester. Another officer fired a projectile at close range toward the protesters.

The officers continued pushing the crowd from the area. At around 7:20 p.m., on Hill Street by 1st Street, researchers saw officers form a line at 1st Street blocking protesters who were being moved down Hill Street from the park by another line of officers, trapping them in a “kettle.” The officers detained dozens of protesters and several legal observers, wearing clearly identifiable green hats, and took them to a police station over seven miles away. Those arrested were given citations and released later that night, said one arrested person and a lawyer who represented the group.

“No Kings” Protest, June 14

On June 14, tens of thousands of people gathered downtown to protest the Trump administration generally, some as part of the national “No Kings” protests, and more specifically to protest the Los Angeles-area ICE raids.

A Human Rights Watch researcher arriving in the early afternoon observed a festive atmosphere until around 3:30 p.m. At that time, a line of police officers moved south down Alameda Street toward the Metropolitan Detention Center, while another group formed a line at Temple Street, indicating they might intend to trap or kettle protesters. The researcher and others left the area up Temple Street to avoid possible detention.

Between 4 and 4:06 p.m., Human Rights Watch saw police officers, led by a line of horse-mounted officers just northeast of the Federal Building, charge at a large crowd of cheering, chanting people gathered on Los Angeles Street. Human Rights Watch heard no dispersal order and observed no violent or destructive acts that might have triggered a lawful dispersal order. Officers pushed those fleeing down Los Angeles Street, pointing less lethal launchers at the crowd, as horses nearly trampled some people. At Los Angeles and Temple Streets, officers fired tear gas and less lethal projectiles into the crowd.

At Temple and Spring Streets, officers formed a skirmish line and fired a barrage of hard foam projectiles into the crowd. For the next several hours, police officers continued to fire less lethal weapons into crowds as they moved their lines down various downtown streets.

A protester said he had been impressed by the protest’s “happy vibe” until the police, with no discernible dispersal order, attacked the crowd, seemingly at random. As the protester fled, he turned onto 4th Street from Broadway. Police officers shot him in the head with a less lethal projectile. He said it felt like getting hit with a baseball bat. He fell to the ground, losing consciousness. Other protesters helped him get away, and a street medic provided first aid. The protester learned at the emergency room the next day that he had a concussion with extensive bruising to the brain, in addition to a laceration on his ear and numbness in his arm.

Another protester, Sergio Espejo, a 28-year-old data engineer and artist, joined the protest waving an American flag and chanting “peaceful protest” alongside others. After he made his way to the courthouse by City Hall, he saw sheriff’s deputies holding shields arrive on the opposite side of the street. Espejo said the deputies shouted something inaudible on loudspeakers before firing tear gas and throwing stun grenades at the crowd. At around 5 p.m., a sheriff’s deputy fired a flash-bang device that exploded upon impact on Espejo’s hand. “As soon as I got hit, I dropped to the ground and then immediately got teargassed,” he said. “I couldn’t catch my breath.” A street medic helped Espejo before he was rushed to Los Angeles General Medical Center, where he underwent surgery the same day. The explosion resulted in the amputation of the top two inches of his left index finger. Espejo is left-handed and his ability to work and produce art have been seriously affected. Human Rights Watch reviewed Espejo’s medical report and photos and videos of the injury.

Christopher Fernandez, an intensive care nurse at a local hospital, came to the protest with a wagon with medical gear to treat injured protesters. He said it was calm until about 4 p.m., when police officers started using tear gas and firing less lethal rounds at protesters. Over several hours, he treated 20 to 30 people, including about a dozen injured with kinetic impact projectiles, five of them with head injuries, including a pregnant woman. One man had lost his hearing and was bleeding from his right ear due to a flash-bang explosion. Fernandez used a flagpole to create a splint for another man with a broken leg. He helped many people wash chemical irritants out of their eyes.

In the midst of this, a police officer shot Fernandez in the back of his left thigh with what appeared to be a 40mm hard foam projectile, leaving a gaping 2-by-3-inch open wound that went down to his muscle.

From when he arrived at the protest at around 11 a.m., until he left just before 8 p.m., Fernandez said the only violence by protesters that he observed were two incidents later in the day when protesters threw empty plastic water bottles toward the police line. “Both times, a lot of [other protesters] yelled out saying, ‘Hey, don’t do that!’ I never saw any police injured or any use of force against the police.”

The overwhelming violence by police made Fernandez feel like he was in “a wartime movie.” He said: “The chaos. The volume of everything. I was just going from people screaming, ‘Medic, medic!,’ one after another, for hours… People were bleeding from the head or the face, and they needed someone to look at them to tell them if they should go to the hospital. I have never experienced anything like this.”

Fernandez never heard any police officers issue orders to protesters to disperse or warning that they would use force. The officers didn’t respond when he and other protesters asked where they could safely go. “It was really frustrating,” he said. “They gave us zero directions, and it was so disorienting.”

When Human Rights Watch spoke with Fernandez, he had been unable to return to work for six weeks and still had difficulties walking or bending his knee.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/08/082025CCA_US_LAprotest%20cover%20photo.jpg?h=2d91fedc&itok=gAvapGEM,N,,2025-08-18 12:57:06.181194

Nofil said immigration advocates have been warning for years about how bad ICE was and how much worse things could get, but many of those warnings were not heeded.
Nofil called those local collaborations the “most unsettling” aspect of the new version of ICE.
There were calls by activists and some Democratic representatives to completely “abolish ICE,” but despite what Republicans say, this was never embraced by Democratic Party leadership.
“There’s always a lot of blurriness around jurisdiction and immigration law,” Nofil said.","“They were sort of saying they were focusing on removing people who had broken some law that wasn’t just illegal entry,” Nofil said. “I think what is absolutely changing right now is that there is no pretense of that anymore. It has become very clear that the goal is just maximizing the numbers.”

She added that the recent explosion in funding will have a dramatic impact. The massive legislation package championed by Trump and passed narrowly by Congress in July included about $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security, with $75 billion of that specifically going to ICE — unprecedented amounts. Nofil said immigration advocates have been warning for years about how bad ICE was and how much worse things could get, but many of those warnings were not heeded.

“It does feel like the gloves are sort of completely off now,” Nofil said. “It also feels like a lot of chickens have come home to roost.”

ICE is currently trying to recruit a lot more agents to carry out the Trump administration’s immigration policies, and many have noted that they seem willing to hire just about anyone, and they’re offering some major incentives to take a job with the agency. To observers, this push looks increasingly dire.

“I think that the hiring is really scary,” Nofil says. “They have never tried to recruit on this massive of a scale. I don’t know if they’re having trouble recruiting right now or not, but it does feel increasingly desperate.”

Also worrying are the moves by ICE to expand its reach by partnering with local police forces. Nofil said that could have many negative effects and could contribute to the impression that immigration enforcement is reaching every corner of the country.

Nofil called those local collaborations the “most unsettling” aspect of the new version of ICE.

“I think that you just cannot undersell how dramatically that reshapes ICE’s power and their reach and their footprint,” Nofil said.

As with many other issues, experts warned things could get really bad if the wrong person was put in the White House, and not enough was done to make sure that things didn’t spiral out of control if that did happen. There were calls by activists and some Democratic representatives to completely “abolish ICE,” but despite what Republicans say, this was never embraced by Democratic Party leadership. Now, Donald Trump is taking advantage of the fact that things were not done to limit his powers when they could have been done.

“There’s always a lot of blurriness around jurisdiction and immigration law,” Nofil said. “It seems like they have kind of capitalized on a lot of that blurriness.”",https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/suploads/2025/08/ice_immigration_crackdown_trump.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 15:57:07.937301

What we know:

The local nonprofit announced that José Gregorio González donated a kidney to his brother, José Alfredo Pacheco, in a surgery completed last week at a Chicago-area hospital.

Pacheco, who lives in Chicago, suffers from end-stage renal disease and needed the transplant to survive.

The backstory:

Gonzalez came to the United States last year in the hopes of being a donor, and the two were scheduled for a transplant evaluation in April.

But on March 3, ICE agents arrested Gonzalez while he was accompanying his brother to a dialysis appointment in Cicero. His attorney said Gonzalez has no criminal record and has complied with federal immigration requirements since arriving in the U.S.

A month later, he was granted humanitarian parole following weeks of advocacy, including nearly 2,000 petition signatures and pressure from elected officials.

What they're saying:

""Today we celebrate not just a successful surgery, but the triumph of love and community over fear and cruelty,"" said Erendira Rendón, vice president of immigrant justice at The Resurrection Project.

González still faces the possibility of deportation after one year, though he is eligible to apply for a work permit in the meantime.

""My brother saved my life before being deported,"" Pacheco said in a statement on GoFundMe. ""There aren't enough words to describe his generosity. He's about to leave the country, but before that, he left me the most valuable gift: the opportunity to continue living.""

""This victory shows us what’s possible when communities organize together,"" said Tovia Siegel, director of organizing and leadership for immigrant justice at The Resurrection Project. ""José Gregorio came to this country with one mission – to save his brother’s life… While their story is remarkable, it shouldn’t be extraordinary.

Most clicked story of the week:

When, if ever, is it racially discriminatory to use or to ban Native American mascots? Who gets to decide what a mascot should be? And who should pave the road to approval?

These questions are at the heart of a long-standing debate stretching from school sports to the big leagues. And in recent months, the Trump administration has brought that debate back into the spotlight with a push to revive Native American mascots on the grounds that bans on them constitute discrimination based on race and national origin.

Number of the week:

10,000+

The number of students Austin Independent School District lost within the past decade — resulting in about 21,000 empty seats across its classrooms. The Texas district is weighing school consolidations that could go into effect as soon as the 2026-27 school year, amid challenges with prolonged declining enrollment, Superintendent Matias Segura told families in a letter on Aug. 11.

Education in the courts:

Federal Judge Myong Joun is standing by his June decision requiring the U.S. Department of Education torestore the Office for Civil Rights “to the status-quo” so it can “carry out its statutory functions.” The order, which prevents the department from laying off OCR employees, comes despite a U.S. Supreme Court emergency order in a separate case allowing the agency to move forward with mass layoffs across the agency.The Education Department appealed Joun’s ruling Thursday to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, asking the appellate judges to allow the department to move forward with shrinking OCR.

A 2024 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission discrimination charge constituted an overly broad and vague “fishing expedition” that a federal court should block, the board of education for New Mexico’s Gallup-McKinley County Schools alleged in a lawsuit filed Aug. 8. Per the complaint, then-Commissioner Andrea Lucas submitted a charge alleging that the district discriminated on the basis of race in its hiring practices. The district claimed that EEOC refused a request for information about the charge’s basis, violating its due process rights, and that EEOC’s request was overbroad and exceeded its investigative authority.

The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a ruling on an Indiana teacher’s failure-to-accommodate claim Aug. 5, saying the evidence raised questions over whether the teacher’s requested religious accommodation — an exemption from calling transgender students by their chosen names — created an “excessive” or “unjustifiable” burden on the school district.

Schools on ICE alert:

A 15-year-old Los Angeles Unified School District student with disabilities was detained outside of Arleta High School on Monday morning by immigration enforcement officers who refused to identify themselves, according to a district spokesperson. During the incident, agents drew guns on and handcuffed the student “in an alleged case of mistaken identity,” LAUSD Board Member Kelly Gonez said in a Monday statement.

While the arrest was not on public school grounds, it took place near school property, outside of the district’s Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School.

As time went on, boats carrying refugees and migrants began to set sail from Libya with the intention of reaching Greece.
The route from Libya to Greece is notoriously deadly.
Refugees and migrants travel in flimsy boats, dangerously overloaded and equipped with engines not suited for such a lengthy and perilous crossing.
The rise in arrivals wasn’t just on Crete — boats were also reaching the small island of Gavdos, Europe’s southernmost point.","After Ahmed left Egypt, he made the journey through Libya and across the Mediterranean Sea to the Greek island of Crete. He carried with him not just the dream of a better future but the hope to survive. “Our trip was difficult,” he said. “We were at sea, and we feared we would drown. We had no gasoline for the boat, no food, no water.”

At the time he recounted his crossing, he had only been at the old Kitrenossi Building, an abandoned structure on the outskirts of Crete’s Rethymno that now served as a makeshift shelter, for one day. He described a grueling journey at sea. The passage from Libya to southern Greece, an often deadly corridor that was once used less often than the Aegean crossing from Turkey, has now become increasingly common. In recent months, displaced people from Sudan, Egypt, Bangladesh, and beyond have set off from North Africa to the Greek islands of Crete and Gavdos in growing numbers.

“As far as I remember, the first report came sometime in the autumn of 2023,” explained Lefteris Papagiannakis, director of the Greek Council for Refugees. At the time, he added, “there was an issue because we knew that there had been some arrivals in Crete, but we couldn’t quite understand how or why.”

Many of the early arrivals to Crete, Greece’s largest island, had reportedly intended to reach Italy. In June 2023, for instance, an Italy-bound fishing trawler from Libya went afoul of its route and sank off the coast of southern Greece’s Pylos, killing hundreds. As time went on, boats carrying refugees and migrants began to set sail from Libya with the intention of reaching Greece.

The route from Libya to Greece is notoriously deadly. The journey itself can take several days on the open sea, and survival isn’t guaranteed. Refugees and migrants travel in flimsy boats, dangerously overloaded and equipped with engines not suited for such a lengthy and perilous crossing.

Worse yet, it’s common for boats to run out of fuel or face harsh weather along the way. The Missing Migrants Project documented 139 cases of missing migrants on the Central Mediterranean route between January and February 2025 alone, making it the deadliest migrant route in the region.

Rihab had left Sudan with her sister, both hoping to reunite with their mother in France. That reunion is now shrouded in uncertainty. The sisters ended up in temporary housing in Crete’s Agia, not far from Chania. Having gone barefoot for days, Rihab now hoped to find a pair of shoes. “We almost died,” she explained. “Our journey was hard. The boat engine wasn’t working.”

“We were at sea, and we feared we would drown. We had no gasoline for the boat, no food, no water.” – Ahmed

Crete, Europe’s fifth-largest island, had never before been a sustained landing point for migrants, nor was it prepared to become one. Local authorities, eager to preserve the island’s visitor-friendly image, have passed responsibility for creating temporary housing facilities back and forth, despite clear signs since 2023 that Crete would face a growing influx. Combined with a lack of national government planning, this has transformed a manageable flow into a visible humanitarian crisis, during the heart of the tourism season, leaving real people in limbo. The result: men and women sleeping in port areas, sports fields, and abandoned buildings.

At the port of Rethymno, up to 442 people took shelter on a small fenced-off plot, hidden from tourists. Exposed to 40-degree heat (104°F), they had access to just three chemical toilets and no running water. They lay on blankets and pieces of cardboard, drying their clothes on the ground or hanging them over rocks by the port. The only shade came from olive netting, hastily strung up to offer minimal relief. The reasons they ended up there were unclear. Locals said the facility in Agia was full; others claimed it was the result of phone calls from high-ranking officials. Whatever the cause, it added to the atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty that shapes their daily lives.

Most were young men, and many explained that Libya is too dangerous to pass through with women and children. As one Egyptian man, at the time waiting for transport to one of the three holding facilities, said, “I hope someday I can bring my son with me.”

In response to far-right rhetoric that portrays the majority of arrivals as young men without legitimate asylum claims, and criticizes them for arriving without their families, several realities must be acknowledged. The journey is perilous, and it is often the men, those physically able to withstand the risks, who migrate first in hopes of earning enough to eventually bring their families. Moreover, Libya is notoriously dangerous, particularly for female migrants. It is known for its slave markets and remains a deeply hostile environment where women face extreme risks, including sexual violence, trafficking, and forced labor or prostitution.

One of the temporary shelters, a facility in Heraklion known as the “Fridge,” was off-limits to press, but multiple sources explained that the conditions there were dire: Refugees were held in a basement with no windows, and fainting wasn’t uncommon.

Many of the refugees and migrants had to wait for days under the summer sun at the port before the authorities eventually transferred them to the old Kitrénosi building near Latsimas. A dilapidated, makeshift facility, it was set up hastily by the municipality. It was only meant to hold some 150 people, but its occupancy now topped 450, according to Alekos Marinakis, a regional councilor with the Communist Party of Greece, or KKE. “We want people to live in dignity,” he explained. “We don’t want our country to become a prison of souls.”

In the dark, cramped Kitrénosi building, where the only bathroom facilities were chemical toilets, the stench of sweat and sewage hung thick in the humid air. People slept shoulder to shoulder on flat strips of cardboard retrieved from the garbage outside. Ventilation was as scarce as privacy. For his part, Ahmed, the Egyptian migrant, said he was just grateful to have food. “Life in Egypt is almost unlivable,” he went on. “It’s too hard. There’s no future there. That’s why we left.”

All around him, people lined up in the midday heat to escape the suffocating air inside the building. They gathered under the few trees that offered shade, or cooled off beneath the makeshift water faucets, before returning inside. Some asked for cigarettes. Others just asked where they were.

At the gate, new arrivals were getting off buses. They scavenged scraps of cardboard to piece together ramshackle pallets to sleep on atop the hard cement floor. Communication with the police wasn’t helpful. No translators were present, and the police officers shouted orders in Greek, adding to the confusion and tension. Arguments erupted — not just between police and migrants, but among the exhausted, displaced men. Across the street, staff turned away drivers who’d spotted a sign that led to the sea. This part of the island, it seemed, was not meant to be seen.

The rise in arrivals wasn’t just on Crete — boats were also reaching the small island of Gavdos, Europe’s southernmost point. At Trypiti Beach, eight boats that had shuttled migrants to Greek shores sat abandoned. Nearby lifejackets, clothes, and other personal belongings sat in scatters — silent markers of who landed and pressed on by foot along a nearby path. “If we kept all the boats here,” one local said at the harbor, “we’d be sunk.”

A ferry was preparing to depart, and close by, tourists on holiday sat in a small boat, fishing and drinking by the shore not far from a dinghy still holding lifejackets and discarded clothing. The eerie signs of desperate journeys were invisible to the tourists, who appeared happily relaxed as they carried on.

Refugees and migrants hardly spend much time on Gavdos, sticking around only when bad weather delays the ferries off the island, but many locals have adopted the view that their presence threatens the tourism the community relies on. Local Manolis Tsigonakis had escorted migrant boats to the shores during the trying winter months, but he was concerned. “We only experience migration in passing,” he said. “They’re kept at the port, but it still creates a negative image for tourists.”

Concerns like these have taken root amid the Greek government’s rapid shift toward far-right rhetoric on migration. Right-wing politicians now speak of the humanitarian crisis as a “hybrid war” and issue panicked warnings about the impact of immigration on the country’s social fabric. Still, Greece isn’t alone in this rightward shift: The European Union at large has moved toward stricter migration controls and hardline anti-migrant policies, some of which have led to embarrassing diplomatic mishaps.

In July, EU envoys, including Greek ministers, turned up in Libya with the hopes of visiting Benghazi. General Khalifa Haftar, the unrecognized warlord who rules eastern Libya, immediately declared the European visitors persona non grata. After following his orders to depart and effectively granting him legitimacy, the EU has appeared to prepare to renew engagement with Libya under new terms.

Some have speculated that this could result in a new migration pact flush with enormous sums of money for Libya, a deal not unlike the EU-Turkey agreement in 2016. These agreements, which the EU has also struck with Lebanon and Egypt, outsource migration controls to third countries: In other words, political concessions and funds are traded for reduced migration. “To prevent escalation, we’d give them money to run the trafficking networks,” argued Papagiannakis of the Greek Forum for Refugees. “Then, they’d collect the profits and cut their losses, somehow channeling funds into the war to help Haftar, who is aligned with European interests, win. It sounds bizarre, but in international relations, nothing is impossible.”

Meanwhile in Crete, the tourist season continues to deliver surreal scenes of leisurely holidaymaking alongside the misery of exile. At an exhibition center in Agia, a 20-minute drive from Chania, another ad hoc shelter has come up. Out of the three camps in Crete, this one has appeared most often on television. On the backside of the building, posters advertising tourist destinations are pinned up: “Must Visit Rural Crete,” “Visit All-Year Round,” and “Must Do Alternative Activities.”

During a visit to that facility, two refugees fainted from the heat. An ambulance soon arrived — one was worse off than the other, reportedly because of dehydration. People all around were asking for painkillers. Volunteers said many were suffering from fevers. Any health concern not deemed urgent on the spot meant a long wait to see a medical professional.

For the refugees and migrants, life inside the camp was a routine: eat, sleep, wait. Small children kicked soccer balls. Men and women stayed in separate areas. Two young girls sprinted to their father for a hug, then played games with one another beside him. Some prayed together. Others prayed on their own. One man grabbed a broom and swept the rugs scattered across the floor. Mealtime came around again. Some took showers in makeshift stalls. There was only one faucet they could all use to wash their clothes.

In exchange for waiting patiently, they hoped to soon file their asylum claims. For most, the Greek government has already dashed that hope. New migration policies mean their next stop will likely be closed refugee facilities in Malakasa or Amygdaleza, both on mainland Greece near Athens. On July 9, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced that his government had introduced a three-month suspension of new asylum claims for refugees and migrants arriving from North Africa. Human rights groups and legal experts have condemned the move, especially regarding Sudanese refugees fleeing an ongoing war, but the Greek government has only shrugged.

According to Papagiannakis, Greece has already violated the principles of asylum. For years, Greek authorities have carried out pushbacks — extrajudicial expulsions in which displaced people are effectively denied their right to request asylum — on the country’s land and sea borders with Turkey. Despite challenges, pushbacks have continued in ebbs and flows.",https://inkstickmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC07713-1920x1280.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 12:57:18.401086

Lockett didn’t specify an exact figure of the number of undocumented patients who could lose access to health services at the district.
Another “unintended consequence” could mean emergency rooms and trauma systems seeing an uptick in people who normally seek health services through community clinics, Lockett said.
The guidelines, if fully implemented, would mean immunizations, communicable disease testing and screening could be carried out without checking immigration status, Lockett said.","Health officials say federal attempts to bar community health clinics from offering care to people regardless of immigration status will lead to unintended consequences for Nevada’s medical infrastructure while also preventing vulnerable populations from vital services.

The Trump administration in July announced changes to long-standing federal guidelines that allowed social safety net programs including community health centers, homeless shelters, and child care programs to offer services without verifying immigration status.

“Currently, no individual is being denied services at the Health District or Southern Nevada Community Health Center under this reinterpretation,” Jennifer Sizemore, a spokeswoman with the Southern Nevada Health District, said in an email. “We are closely monitoring developments, providing input, and preparing for potential operational changes should the policy take effect. Our priority remains protecting the health of all residents and maintaining access to essential public health services.”

SNHD couldn’t answer additional questions about the potential impact of the federal policies changes on undocumented people accessing health services, since the issue is being litigated.

Days after the administration’s announcement in July, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford joined 19 other states and the District of Columbia and signed onto a lawsuit challenging the rule.

Dr. Cassius Lockett, the District Health Officer for the Southern Nevada Health District, told district board of health members at a July 24 meeting that “a little over 50% of our clients in the Southern Nevada Community Health Center are undocumented” and could lose access to primary care services, behavioral health services and family planning under the rule change as written.

Lockett didn’t specify an exact figure of the number of undocumented patients who could lose access to health services at the district.

The district is conducting an analysis to understand the fiscal impact from the federal changes, he said.

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 had a long-standing practice of allowing various community based programs that rely on federal funds to serve people regardless of immigration status.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced July 10 it would reverse that policy and require agencies to check immigration status.

“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” said Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr in a statement.

In their suit challenging the policy reversal, attorneys general argued multiple programs “cannot realistically conduct verification at the door, such as 24/7 crisis hotlines, emergency services for individuals suffering an overdose, and homeless shelters.”

“Even if some programs could implement such verification with time and resources, vulnerable people lack government identification when accessing these services for myriad reasons—some may be undocumented immigrants, but many others are U.S. Citizens or permanent residents,” the suit contends. “For the first time, millions of people are facing a new demand before they can access the Nation’s most essential programs: ‘show me your papers.’

Dr. Frank Nemec, the vice chair for the health board, said during the board’s July 24 meeting that the decision wasn’t just cruel but could have a “devastating economic impact on an already fragile medical infrastructure” in Nevada.

Another “unintended consequence” could mean emergency rooms and trauma systems seeing an uptick in people who normally seek health services through community clinics, Lockett said.

Federally Qualified Health Centers, which receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations, are still unclear on the full impact of the rule change, said Randy Smith, the CEO of Southern Nevada Community Health Center.

“The individuals that we’re talking about are some of the most vulnerable members of our community,” he said. “There’s also a public health implication. They may have communicable diseases that are going to go untreated. Certainly on the individual level, it’s about quality of life … It’s a whole system of care really impacted in a very significant way in terms of access to care and the costs associated with that care.”

While roughly half of the patients coming into the Southern Nevada Community Health Center are uninsured, Smith said he wasn’t sure how many lacked health insurance because they didn’t have legal status.

“The health center program has never had a requirement to collect eligibility documentation,” he said. “What I do know is a significant portion of them are and that’s because we’ve made efforts to help folks get on insurance and they’ve been unable to do so.”

There are also public health implications around the spread of communicable diseases.

The guidelines, if fully implemented, would mean immunizations, communicable disease testing and screening could be carried out without checking immigration status, Lockett said.

Some in the board worried that many people, even those who are legal permanent residents or have Green Cards, aren’t seeking care, including vaccinations.

Lockett said the district is working on doing more outreach to “make it clear they still have access to immunization services at the health district and they still have access to communicable disease services.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-8-15-25-at-12.01%25E2%2580%25AFPM-1024x5721755535895.jpeg?h=335cd77d&itok=O6ty4tqE,N,,2025-08-18 12:57:25.429379

It’s better known now by its other name, tuberculosis, and it’s the most deadly infectious disease in the world, the World Health Organization says, responsible for killing 1.5 million people each year, even though it’s both preventable and curable.

Detainees have tested positive for tuberculosis at the Anchorage Correctional Complex in Alaska and Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, according to news reports. One immigrant died days after a diagnosis of the disease in the Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, an ICE death notice shows. Detainees may have been exposed at the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, according to a lawsuit. And in Washington state, several possible cases of tuberculosis in the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma were reported this month to state authorities, and one man was hospitalized for it, his attorney said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not respond to a request for comment. Officials have previously downplayed the presence of tuberculosis, the reports show, including responding to questions about the cases in Tacoma by saying, “This false claim needs to stop.”

The same conditions that allowed the disease to flourish at the end of the 1800s are hallmarks of immigration detention, medical experts and immigration advocates told the Prospect, including overcrowding, poor sanitation, and a breakdown of health protocols.

Tuberculosis outbreaks can allow the disease to become more resistant to treatment, one of the major global concerns about the massive outbreaks in post-Soviet Russia. And, of course, the disease doesn’t recognize the limits of prison walls, Dr. Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University, noted. If someone leaves ICE with an active case of tuberculosis, they can transfer it to the larger population. “By protecting people in carceral settings,” he said, “we’re protecting people outside of carceral settings.”

There is no good reason why tuberculosis is spreading in ICE detention, Martinez and other medical experts said. They called on the Centers for Disease Control teams to control outbreaks and for federal detention sites to provide proper screening, isolation, and care, and to follow their own protocols.

Even simply giving detainees more space would make the situation safer, medical experts said. But they doubted ICE will spend much of its new windfall from the GOP mega-bill, which includes billions more for detention facilities, on detainee health measures. As the Prospect reported earlier this month, the two big companies that provide or run most of ICE’s detention centers, CoreCivic and Geo Group, are raking in the cash, with plans to expand thanks to “unprecedented growth opportunities.”

“I hesitate to say there aren’t enough resources,” said Dr. Katherine Peeler, medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights and assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. “ICE just got an appropriation of $45 billion, but if I had to predict, the line item for health care is not the thing that’s going to be increased.”

TUBERCULOSIS THRIVES IN CARCERAL SETTINGS of all kinds. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or spits, and it only takes a few droplets to sicken someone.

Those with active infections can develop symptoms that grow progressively worse, including a chronic cough that brings up blood, high fever, and “wasting,” the process of unintentionally losing significant amounts of weight. Almost everyone who contracts it needs treatment to survive, and those who do may live with lungs so damaged they struggle to breathe.

The federal government has long acknowledged that tuberculosis is a problem in immigration detention. More than two decades ago, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies examined the spread of the disease among ICE detainees and decided not to remove or release from custody anyone suspected of having an active tuberculosis case without first consulting the U.S. Public Health Service. Agencies have addressed the issue repeatedly since then, such as in 2011, when they held a conference about how to halt the spread among people in ICE detention.

National medical care standards in immigrant detention facilities require all facilities where detainees are held for more than 72 hours to have on-site clinical settings. But that doesn’t necessarily happen, as the recent lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security over its dirty and overcrowded makeshift detention site on the tenth floor of Manhattan’s 26 Federal Plaza illustrates. A judge last week ordered ICE to improve the conditions immediately.

Tuberculosis outbreaks can allow the disease to become more resistant to treatment, and the disease doesn’t recognize the limits of prison walls.

Under federal law, everyone entering an ICE facility must be screened for tuberculosis within 12 hours of intake, then subsequently retested every 12 months. But that doesn’t always happen, either, the government also acknowledges. At the now-shuttered Nye County Detention Center in Pahrump, Nevada, for example, unannounced inspectors from the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General found that staff failed to perform such screenings before transferring detainees to another facility, according to a report published in May.

Anyone in ICE custody with symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis is supposed to be placed into an airborne infection isolation room with negative pressure ventilation, which experts in infectious diseases told the Prospect was necessary to avoid spreading the illness to other detainees and staff. Such rooms reverse the flow of air to make transmission less likely.

But ICE detention facilities don’t necessarily have such rooms, medical experts said. Instead, they often put those with infectious diseases in solitary confinement, which they refer to as “segregation” to avoid criticism. The typical solitary cell does not use negative pressure, detention and medical researchers said.

When they do use a negative-pressure room, there’s no guarantee staff will clean it between patients, as the unannounced inspectors in Nevada found. “We observed that medical staff did not clean the medical isolation room in between medical isolation stays. Additionally, wads of soaked toilet paper were stuck to the ceiling … and there was graffiti on the walls throughout much of the room,” the report stated. “Failure to thoroughly clean medical isolation rooms in between detainee stays increases the risk of disease transmission and other safety hazards for detainees and medical staff.”

Even if a location has competent medical practices, it may not have enough staff to execute them, as an unannounced visit to the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, New York, found, according to a report published in June. Investigators found there was no permanent physician or dentist at the facility, so detainees had to wait months for help when they got sick. As of September 10, 2024, the medical scheduler had a backlog of 150 “specialty appointments” for the next five months. Detainees had a five-month wait for dental appointments, too.

THE OVERALL SENSE MEDICAL DOCTORS have about ICE squares with that of immigrants, their families, and their lawyers: The U.S. government is unconcerned about detainees’ health. The litany of failures specific to tuberculosis is just one symptom. Others include reported outbreaks of COVID-19 and ongoing reports describing how ICE routinely denies detainees medical attention.

A recent report Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) published late last month described such instances in brief but potent detail, such as an attorney who reported that a U.S. citizen child with severe medical issues was detained with her mother, “and that when the girl began vomiting blood, the mother begged for medical attention. A CBP guard reportedly responded, ‘Just give the girl a cracker.’” Ossoff said he has received 510 credible reports of human rights abuses against immigrants in detention since the beginning of the year, including multiple instances of abuse against pregnant women and children.

Melissa Chua, co-director of the New York Legal Assistance Group’s immigrant protection unit, told the Prospect in an interview that immigration detention staff are denying her clients medicine and medical attention, too, including people with life-threatening pre-existing conditions. One client in detention is a whistleblower seeking asylum from Ecuador, who is recovering from a severe liver infection and must eat a special diet. It would be straightforward to provide, but ICE won’t do it. He also hasn’t gotten the medication he needs to prevent the infection from recurring. In another instance, a high-school-age client said he asked for a doctor, only to be met with beratement and, ultimately, silence.

The ultimate symptom of the government’s disregard for detainee health is death, including by suicide. So far this calendar year, ICE has recorded ten people who have died in custody, including the man in Arizona who tested positive for tuberculosis, and at least one who news reports said later died by suicide, though the notice didn’t list that as the cause of death.

But that is an undercount by at least one. Earlier this month, 32-year-old Chaofeng Ge hanged himself in Pennsylvania’s Moshannon Valley Processing Center, according to reports. He is not listed on ICE’s death roster; ICE has 30 days to publish initial information after someone dies in custody and another 60 days to complete and release subsequent reporting.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment about Chaofeng Ge.

Experts expect the situation to get much worse in the months ahead. That’s because Trump’s drive to deport one million people hasn’t yet coincided with the height of flu season, or the GOP’s recent cuts to the health care system, or its exclusion of undocumented immigrants from several social programs. Active Medicaid cuts threaten to kick millions of people off their health insurance and have already shuttered hospitals across the country, as the Prospect reported last month.

Trump’s immigration raids are further eroding societal health by discouraging documented and undocumented people alike from seeking medical care, even when they’re very ill. So, medical doctors told the Prospect, not only will more people enter detention facilities, but more will enter sick and with weakened immune systems, which makes contracting tuberculosis much likelier. It doesn’t have to be that way, Martinez said, but it does indicate political priorities.

“We know this population has a really high risk of tuberculosis and many other infectious diseases,” Martinez said, yet the federal government and prison companies don’t spend the money to control them. “It gives some indication that this health care issue is not being given priority.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/23384/download/Wimbish-ICE%20tuberculosis%20081825.jpg?cb=15ac46ef89a880bbf7233b81d3945a2a&w=1024,N,,2025-08-18 11:56:52.469288

Practical Guidance for Litigators Federal Government Cases: The Casa decision primarily restricts district courts from issuing universal injunctions against the federal government, especially preliminary injunctions that restrict the government’s conduct towards non-parties.
Courts must ensure that injunctive relief is no broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the parties.
Review of Existing Injunctions: Courts may revisit the scope of existing injunctions to ensure they are not broader than necessary, especially in light of Casa.","On June 27, the US Supreme Court issued a significant decision in Trump v. Casa, clarifying the limits of federal district courts’ authority to issue broad, so-called “universal” injunctions against the federal government.

The Court held that district courts generally cannot prohibit the government from enforcing a law or executive action against non-parties to a lawsuit. Instead, courts should focus on providing “complete relief” to the parties before them, not sweeping relief “against anyone, anywhere.”

Key Principles From the Decision

Universal vs Complete Relief: The Court distinguished between “universal injunctions,” which bar the government from enforcing a law against anyone, and “complete relief,” which is narrowly tailored to the parties in the case. The Court emphasized that “complete relief” is not the same as “universal relief.” Relief for non-parties should be incidental, not the primary purpose of the injunction.

Separation of Powers Concerns: The Court expressed concern that universal injunctions intrude on the executive branch’s authority by preventing the government from enforcing its policies against those not involved in the litigation.

Remand for Tailoring Relief: The Supreme Court remanded the cases to the district courts, instructing them to determine whether their injunctions were broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.

Implications for Commercial and IP Litigation

Courts will have to grapple with how the Casa decision impacts litigation that does not involve the US government, especially as litigants attempt to use the holding creatively to avoid expansive injunctions in other contexts. Recently, in an appeal before the Ninth Circuit, the appellate court rejected Google’s arguments that a nationwide injunction against Google was overbroad. In the antitrust dispute with Epic Games, Google argued that “Epic is a single plaintiff…[b]ut the injunction does not just impact Epic; it seeks to regulate Google’s interactions with over half a million developers, OEMs, mobile carriers, and Android app stores—none of whom are parties.” The Ninth Circuit issued its opinion on July 31 and explained that the Casa decision does not render the injunction against Google overbroad because “the scope of a permanent injunction following a finding of antitrust liability” is not comparable to that of a preliminary injunction against the US government “on a constitutional question.” The Ninth Circuit further explained that the Casa decision clarifies that traditional, parties-only injunctions can apply nationwide and restrict parties’ conduct towards individuals and entities that are not involved in the lawsuit.

Practical Guidance for Litigators

Federal Government Cases: The Casa decision primarily restricts district courts from issuing universal injunctions against the federal government, especially preliminary injunctions that restrict the government’s conduct towards non-parties. Courts must ensure that injunctive relief is no broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the parties.

Private Party Disputes: In cases between private parties, such as intellectual property disputes, litigants should still avoid unnecessarily broad injunctions. However, if broad relief is required to fully remedy a party’s harm, incidental benefits to non-parties do not automatically render the injunction improper. With that said, as a direct result of Casa, we expect to see novel and creative arguments attacking the scope of injunctions.

Review of Existing Injunctions: Courts may revisit the scope of existing injunctions to ensure they are not broader than necessary, especially in light of Casa. Parties should be prepared to argue whether the scope of relief was appropriately tailored.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15973_4423.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 12:58:13.996598

Once home, the men called San Bernardino police to report the incident, Martin said.
According to KABC, San Bernardino police cited the California Values Act, which prevents local law enforcement from helping federal officials with immigration enforcement actions.
CNN has reached out to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department and San Bernardino Police Department for further information.","US Customs and Border Protection officers opened fire during a targeted immigration enforcement operation in San Bernadino, California, on Saturday, calling it an act of self-defense after a man “struck two CBP officers with his vehicle,” the Department of Homeland Security said.

But the family inside the vehicle said they drove away out of fear for their safety after masked men emerged from unmarked cars and surrounded their truck with weapons drawn before smashing the truck’s windows.

Martin, one of the three men in the vehicle, told CNN affiliate KABC he was working with his father-in-law and 18-year-old brother-in-law on Saturday morning when their vehicle was suddenly surrounded.

The agents did not identify themselves and the family stayed inside the locked car, said Martin, who KABC only identified by his first name.

Videos recorded from inside the family’s truck show at least three masked agents wearing tactical vests marked with “police” surrounding the car. At least one of the agents is wearing a hat marked “CBP.”

The agents are seen asking the men inside the truck to roll down the window, but the men refuse. The agents are then seen breaking two windows in the truck before the driver accelerates away.

It’s unclear why DHS was pursuing the men in the vehicle.

“Once the glasses were shattered, my father-in-law, fearing for his life from his perspective … he drove the vehicle away from where those agents were at,” Martin told KABC.

It is unclear in the videos when officers were struck by the vehicle. In its statement, DHS said two officers were injured. It did not specify the severity of the injuries.

As the truck drives away, three apparent gunshots can be heard in the videos and one video shows what seems to be bullet holes in the side of the truck.

Watch a different angle here:

“Thank God the bullets didn’t go through the truck. They just went in, got stuck into the door, but they were aimed at my brother-in-law, who was in the passenger front,” Martin told KABC.

Once home, the men called San Bernardino police to report the incident, Martin said.

At 9:30 a.m., about an hour after the vehicle stop, armed immigration and Homeland Security agents, along with San Bernardino police, surrounded the family’s home, according to the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice. They remained at the scene until 3:45 p.m., despite never presenting a warrant, “pressuring the individual to come outside and placing the entire family in fear,” the organization said in a statement to CNN.

“This is a clear abuse of power. Firing at civilians, detaining families without cause, and silencing community voices is unacceptable and must end,” the organization said.

DHS said local police “located the subject at a residence and briefly had him in custody,” but “he was set free” and officers left the scene.

“This decision was made despite the subject refusing to comply and wounding two officers — another terrible example of California’s pro-sanctuary policies in action that shield criminals instead of protecting communities,” DHS said in a statement.

According to KABC, San Bernardino police cited the California Values Act, which prevents local law enforcement from helping federal officials with immigration enforcement actions.

Police told KABC they later returned to the scene after a request from federal officials due to a large crowd forming as federal officers attempted to arrest a man. The department said it learned the man, whose identity was not revealed, was wanted for assaulting a federal officer.

It’s unclear if the man was taken into custody.

CNN has reached out to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department and San Bernardino Police Department for further information.

While some have had protocols on the books for such a situation, they have been sharpening up those policies and training staff as students in Orange County start heading back to school after a summer break that saw widespread deportation raids rock the region.

Voice of OC reached out to administrators in five school districts covering Santa Ana, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Costa Mesa and Orange – cities that have strongly felt the impacts of the sweeps and where residents have called on city leaders to step up and support immigrant families.

Carlos Hernandez, Anaheim Union High School district’s director of Community Schools & Community & Family Engagement, said it was important for districts to prepare for ICE showing up to campus as they hear stories of families self-deporting amid increased fear and anxiety in the community.

“That’s what we’re trying to avoid, at least, to give them an opportunity to know what we are doing to ensure the safety and security of our families,” he said in a phone interview.

“Unfortunately, other superintendents may not make this a priority for their district.”

Officials in many districts say school staff would initiate a school lockdown where classrooms are locked and lessons continue if ICE shows up on campus or if there is immigration enforcement nearby.

They also say they won’t let agents in without a federal judicial warrant.

At the same time, some elected officials like State Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva are worried that the sweeps will have other impacts as families worry about leaving the house – a fear that could impact attendance, which in turn could impact district funding.

“For school districts, this could be a very big hit to their budget,” she said in a Wednesday interview.

Meanwhile, a 15-year-old boy with disabilities was detained at gunpoint outside a high school in Los Angeles last week before being released causing city and district officials there to look at expanding safe passage ways to schools.

What Happens if ICE Shows Up?

Anaheim Union High School District officials say they have been spending the summer break enhancing a 2018 policy dictating how school administrators should respond if federal immigration agents show up to one of the campuses.

“Now what we do is we immediately go on what’s called a level two lockdown and what that means is the school shuts the perimeters of the school, the classrooms are secured and locked. Instruction continues,” Jaron Fried, the district’s assistant superintendent, said.

“That gives our office staff and our admin time to, one, verify if it’s an actual ice agent or not and then, two, if they have proper papers with them.”

Fried, who is expected to take over as superintendent at the end of the year, said if the immigration agents don’t have a warrant signed by a judge they won’t be allowed to speak to the student or staff member they are looking for.

“If they begin to become more aggressive or abrasive, then the administrator knows that they may choose to elevate to a level three lockdown,” he said.

That is the type of lockdown schools in the district follow in the event an active shooter is on campus.

If they do have a warrant, Fried said the student or staff would be brought out to the agents rather than letting the agents enter the campus.

“We’re still protecting our students in large if they have a proper court order signed document,” he said.

While the lockdown is initiated, school administrators notify the district and the local police department.

“We’ve talked to our site admin about being very proactive with doing lockdown drills to start the school year and I hate to say it, but we want to normalize, God forbid, wherever the situation there’s preparation that has taken place on how to operate under a level two or level three lockdown,” Fried said.

He adds they’re asking parents not to come to campus if a lockdown occurs as they worry that federal immigration agents might show up to schools as a tactic to draw out the adults.

Garden Grove Unified officials have also implemented a new similar lockdown procedure as their counterparts in Anaheim if there is immigration enforcement near a school campus.

Administrators there first implemented their immigration response policy in 2021 which requires school staff to document and inform the district superintendent if ICE shows up on campus or requests data.

Under the policy, school administrators can’t grant access to the agent unless they have a a federal judicial warrant or if they declare “exigent circumstances exist.”

If the immigration enforcement agent enters without permission from the school, staff is instructed not to physically stop the officer but document their actions.

“We value our district’s primarily immigrant families and are committed to do everything in our power to keep our families and students safe,” wrote Abby Broyles, a spokeswoman for the district, in a Friday email.

“It is our duty and our moral imperative to uphold the constitutional rights of our students to attend school freely and without fear and to ensure our families know how to protect themselves.”

Rachel Monárrez, the new superintendent at Orange Unified, said the district has had protocols in place since January in case of such a scenario and immigration agents have to show a federal judicial warrant before they could be let on campus.

She also adds that the building will be locked while instruction continues.

Monárrez said that while she was not at the district at the time the protocols were instituted many districts started to prepare after President Donald Trump was elected to office.

“Just going with what was happening at the federal level, knowing that there was going to be more targeted approaches to immigration, and knowing that the families that we serve, the children that we serve, there could be a potential need for it,” she said in a phone interview.

Fermin Leal, a spokesman for the Santa Ana Unified School District, said school administrators are directed to contact the district immediately if a federal immigration comes to campus.

“Agents are routed to the District office, and no access to non-public areas or student information is permitted without a valid judicial warrant reviewed by District legal counsel,” he wrote in an email last week.

“Our goal is to minimize disruption to instruction, keep students supervised, and communicate with families if an incident affects school operations.”

Leal said the protocol was first developed in February and staff has been regularly trained on them – sharing a training video with the Voice of OC.

Officials from Newport-Mesa Unified did not respond to multiple requests for comment and emailed questions on the issue.

According to the Newport-Mesa Unified School District website, any request by immigration agents to enter a district school should be reported to district staff.

The district adopted a Immigration Enforcement Response policy in 2019.

The policy states the superintendent will create protocols for a scenario where immigration agents show up to a campus and train staff on those procedures.

The policy does not provide details on what those protocols are exactly.

Know Your Rights Resources & Student Support

School districts are also offering immigration resources and other support to their students and their families.

Anaheim Union High School District officials have held know your rights forums for the community and a town hall last month on keeping schools safe amid the ICE raids.

Beyond that, the district has launched a webpage with immigration resources as well as a plan to help families prepare if a loved one gets taken.

They are also offering academic and mental health support for students on campus as well as connecting families to food pantries.

“When our family calls and says, I need x, y, z, we point them immediately to site staff, to the people that they have a relationship with, and we go from there,” Hernandez said.

Broyles said Garden Grove Unified has been partnering with different organizations to host Know Your Rights webinars, distributing Know Your Rights information and helping families develop an emergency plan in response to the deportation sweeps.

They also have created a hotline to help respond to families’ needs and trained staff on how to provide social emotional support to students and families struggling with immigration related challenges.

“Over the Summer, we launched a Family Helpline (714-663-6257) which now has extended hours and is staffed by bilingual community liaisons who provide connections to food, immigration assistance, mental health counseling, legal referrals, and more—in Spanish, Vietnamese, and additional languages upon request,” wrote Broyles in an email.

Monárrez said Orange Unified has launched a webpage with a variety of resources for families including Know Your Rights information and a resource handbook is being shared with school staff.

“It just shows where all these resources are,” she said. “If there’s food insecurity, here’s what you can share with the family. If they need shelter, here’s what you can share so all those things are put into this resource handbook that was pulled together by our staff really aligning to what’s already in the community.”

Leal said Santa Ana Unified offers mental health support for students. The district also has a Know Your Rights page on their website as well.

Offering Online Options

District leaders in Anaheim are also offering families who do not want to go to school right now the option to learn virtually from home or enter a hybrid educational program.

“You can imagine the fear and the anxiety of sending your student to school and not knowing if they’re going to be coming back to you if the ICE agents are out in the community. So we’ve had a few families reach out, and so we’ve developed some options,” Robert Saldivar, the district’s executive director of educational services, said in a phone interview.

One of the options is the district’s independent learning center which offers a hybrid or virtual educational program and home visits from teachers, counselors and social workers.

Officials in other districts are encouraging in person attendance but also offering virtual options in some circumstances.

Broyles said Garden Grove Unified is offering a virtual learning academy but also increasing bus options for families scared to take their kids to school.

Monárrez said in-person learning is really important for students but there is an option for people to temporarily enroll into their virtual academy .

“They can do a 15-day, short term independent study where they would do some learning at home, not the ideal, but for some families, that might be just enough for them to feel comfortable. So we are going to give them options, but we’re really going to try to encourage them to bring their children to school,” she said.

Leal said the district can work with families on short-term independent study in limited circumstances on a case by case basis reviewed by principals and counselors.

Meanwhile, officials in Anaheim Union High School District – who say they have one of the strongest protocols in place in OC – are worried that other districts are not planning for ICE coming to campus as thoroughly as they are.

Salidivar said he hopes other districts in the county will follow the lead they have set.

“I can’t imagine how many families are out there … feeling paralyzed and not knowing who to turn to in terms of their son or daughter’s education,” he said in a phone interview.

Fried agreed.

“I don’t think there’s another district doing what we do,” he said.

“I think we’re way out in front even in this work.”

By contrast, it does not encompass the two categories of U.S.-born persons described in the Trump Citizenship Order.
Therefore, their U.S.-born children are birthright citizens, in contrast to the children of diplomats.
As to each of the three established excepted categories of persons born in the United States, the answer to that question was: no.
The “occupied forces” exception applies when a foreign sovereign has displaced the federal government in the United States.","This is the second in a series of four articles about the many pending suits that challenge the legality of President Donald Trump’s Executive Order No. 14160 (the “Citizenship Order”). In that Order, Trump declares that two categories of persons born in the United States to foreign nationals are not U.S. citizens by virtue of their birth, and instructs federal officials not to treat them as citizens, at least if they were or will be born after February 19, 2025. (In an earlier post I briefly discuss the implications for individuals born before that date.)

A couple of weeks ago, I published a long post about the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc., in which I assessed (among other things) how the Court’s decision might affect the nonsubstantive questions that remain open and contested in the lower court cases. The remaining posts in this series, beginning with this one, are about the substantive merits of the challenges to the Trump Citizenship Order. Of course, by now many scholars and lawyers have written a great deal about this issue. I don’t intend to rehash all of that here. Instead, my focus in this and the remaining installments of this series is on the Department of Justice’s arguments in support of the Trump Citizenship Order in the courts of appeals, because those arguments are likely to shape how the Supreme Court approaches the question when it eventually considers the merits.

Recently, in Washington v. Trump, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit became the first appellate court to opine on the legality of Trump’s attempted redefinition of birthright citizenship. Like every other court (or Supreme Court Justice) to have addressed the merits in the past few months, the Ninth Circuit panel concluded that the purported limits on birthright citizenship in the Trump Citizenship Order are likely to be inconsistent with the Citizenship Clause found in Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The panel also held that the Citizenship Order likely violates the statutory provision establishing birthright citizenship, 8 U.S.C. § 1401. (These holdings, like those of other courts, were framed in terms of the “likelihood” of unlawfulness because they were issued at a preliminary stage in the litigation. None of the courts, however, has concluded that it’s a close question and the issue has been fully briefed; in other words, “likelihood” is a virtual certainty here.)

As the Supreme Court noted in its decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. (pp. 24-25 n.18), the Solicitor General committed to the Court that he would “absolutely” seek certiorari when the Government lost one of its pending appeals. Therefore, presumably the SG will petition for certiorari from the Ninth Circuit decision sometime in the next few weeks or months (assuming the court of appeals doesn’t hear the case en banc).

On August 1, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit heard two oral arguments in three other cases raising the merits issues—two from U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (O. Doe v. Trump and New Jersey v. Trump) and the third from the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire (New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support v. Trump). Until recently, an appeal was also pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in CASA, Inc. v. Trump, but on July 29 that court dismissed the appeal and remanded the case to the district court, which has now entered a new preliminary injunction protecting a certified class of plaintiffs that includes every child born after February 19, 2025 who’s covered by the Citizenship Order. That classwide preliminary injunction conforms with another such injunction that a district court in New Hampshire entered on July 10. The Government has yet to appeal either of these classwide preliminary injunctions, but it might do so soon.

Judge Ronald Gould’s opinion for the Ninth Circuit in Washington v. Trump, joined by Senior Judge Michael Daly Hawkins, nicely summarizes the judiciary’s uniform views on the merits thus far. (Judge Patrick Bumatay dissented on questions related to the standing of States to challenge the implementation of the Citizenship Order. He did not address the merits.) Interested readers should start with the relevant section of Judge Gould’s opinion (see pages 24-43) in order to understand the merits questions. The remainder of this series offers a deeper dive into certain important and/or underemphasized aspects of the Department of Justice’s arguments in defense of the Citizenship Order.

In this post, I evaluate DOJ’s lead argument in each of its appellate briefs, which is an argument about what the key, contested phrase in the Citizenship Clause—“subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]”—allegedly cannot mean.

According to DOJ, the plaintiffs’ proposed construction, which the Ninth Circuit, several district courts, and three Supreme Court Justices in Trump v. CASA, Inc. have now adopted, simply can’t be right because (according to DOJ) it’s inconsistent with at least two of the accepted, historical exceptions to birthright citizenship. My primary objective in this post is to explain why, properly understood, the plaintiffs’ reading of “subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” derived from the Supreme Court’s governing opinions in Elk v. Wilkins (1884) and United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), does justify the three established exceptions but does not cover the two categories of U.S.-born persons described in the Trump Citizenship Order.

The next article will examine DOJ’s principal affirmative reading of “subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” which is that it requires a person born in the United States also to be domiciled here on the date of birth in order to be a birthright citizen. That post will explain why DOJ’s “domicile” argument can’t be reconciled with the ratio decidendi of the Supreme Court’s governing opinion in Wong Kim Ark. It’ll also highlight an important, and widely overlooked, aspect of DOJ’s affirmative argument, which is that it’s almost entirely devoted to defending the second (and less numerous) category of persons identified in Section 1 of the Trump Citizenship Order—persons born in the U.S. to women who were, on that date, lawfully but temporarily present in the country (for example, on a work or student visa). As the post will discuss, DOJ’s reading of the Citizenship Clause offers almost nothing in support of the Order’s declaration that the first, and much larger, category of persons—those born in the U.S. to women who, on the date of birth, were not legally authorized to be in the country—are not birthplace citizens.

In my final post, I’ll address plaintiffs’ (and certain amici’s) statutory argument, which is independently sufficient to demonstrate that the Trump Citizenship Order is unlawful. That article will explain that DOJ’s argument about the relevant statutory enactments—in 1940 and 1952—is based upon an unconvincing account of the public and governmental understanding of the scope of birthright citizenship in the decades between Wong Kim Ark and 1952.

* * * *

The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” A federal statute Congress first enacted in 1940, and re-enacted in 1952, likewise provides, in materially identical language, that “a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” shall be a national and citizen of the United States “at birth.” 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a).

On the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump issued the Citizenship Order. Section 1 of that Order declares that neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the federal statute guarantees U.S. citizenship for two categories of persons who were born in the United States to a father who wasn’t a citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of the person’s birth: (1) those whose mothers were “unlawfully present” in the United States on the person’s date of birth; and (2) those whose mothers were lawfully present in the United States on a temporary basis, such as on a student, work, or tourist visa, on the child’s date of birth. (Sections 2 and 3 of the Order direct Executive agency officials to implement President Trump’s new definition of citizenship in particular ways. I discuss those aspects of the Order in my earlier article.)

All parties in the various suits agree that the legality of the Citizenship Order turns on the constitutional and statutory phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently concluded that that phrase means, simply, “subject to the laws and authority of the United States,” such that an individual born in the United States is a citizen if, on the date of birth, she was “subject to” the regulatory authority of federal law—unless she falls within one of three discrete historical exceptions. Justice Sonia Sotomayor offered a similar formulation in her dissenting opinion in Trump v. CASA, Inc.: “To be ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the United States means simply to be bound to its authority and its laws. … As the Government would presumably concede, virtually everyone born in the United States and present in its territory is subject to its authority and its laws.”

DOJ offers a different understanding of “subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]”—a very unusual, counterintuitive reading that depends upon whether the individual in question (the newborn) was “domiciled” in the United States on the date she was born here. As the next article in this series will explain, and as the Ninth Circuit held in its recent Washington v. Trump decision, DOJ’s affirmative, domicile-dependent argument about the scope of the Citizenship Clause is (at best) unconvincing in light of the Court’s rationale in Wong Kim Ark.

There is, however, one aspect of DOJ’s argument that appears to be much more formidable, at least on first glance. At the outset of each of its appellate briefs, DOJ argues that the definition of “subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]” that the plaintiffs and the courts have adopted—in the Ninth Circuit’s words, being “subject to the laws and authority of the United States” at birth—simply can’t be right because (according to DOJ) it doesn’t account for at least two of the three well-recognized exceptions for categories of persons who, everyone agrees, are not deemed citizens on the basis of their birth in the United States—the children of diplomats and persons who are members of Indian tribes at birth. If the plaintiffs’ reading were correct, says DOJ (see, e.g., its opening brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at 9), it would leave the term “jurisdiction” “without a coherent meaning,” and would read the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” condition “out of the Citizenship Clause, since everyone born or present on U.S. soil is subject to U.S. regulatory jurisdiction.” See also id. at 13-16 (purporting to explain how Congress has the power to subject persons in each of the excepted categories to regulation). And therefore, DOJ insists, “jurisdiction” in the Citizenship Clause must have some other, less familiar meaning.

The first problem with DOJ’s critique of plaintiffs’ (and the courts’) reading is that it caricatures that reading. The plaintiffs in each of the cases readily concede (or presumably they’d do so if pressed) that Congress has the power to regulate the persons described in at least two of the three historically exempt categories (i.e., all but the children of occupying forces). After all, as Justice Horace Gray wrote for the Court in Wong Kim Ark itself (pp. 683-684), quoting Chief Justice John Marhsall in The Schooner Exchange, “‘[t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute.’” The plaintiffs do not take issue with that proposition. Their argument is, instead, that “subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]” refers to whether the individual in question was in fact bound by federal law at the moment of birth, rather than to whether Congress had the constitutional power to regulate that newborn person.[1]

Even so, this “negative” aspect of DOJ’s argument has at least some superficial analytic force by virtue of the fact that U.S. law does regulate, at least in some measure, two of the historically exempted categories of newborns—those born to foreign ambassadors and ministers, and those who are members of federally recognized Indian tribes. If that is so—i.e., if those categories of U.S.-born persons are not citizens (as all agree) even though they are subject to U.S. law—then how can it be that, as Justice Sotomayor put it, “[t]o be ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the United States means simply to be bound to its authority and its laws”? That puzzle is the thrust of DOJ’s lead argument.

As I’ll explain in this article, however, not only is there a throughline that connects each of the three historical exceptions, but that common ground does, indeed, depend upon the application of U.S. regulatory law to the categories of newborns in question (rather than merely to their parents). The common ground, however, is not quite as simple as whether Congress has authority to regulate such persons (it does) or whether Congress has actually regulated their conduct in some degree (which it has, at least as to some of the excepted categories). Instead, as the Supreme Court explained in Wong Kim Ark (quoting its earlier decision in Elk v. Wilkins), each of those excepted categories describes persons whoare, at birth, immune in a material respect from the application or enforcement of U.S. law, such that they are not “completely subject” to the “political jurisdiction” of the United States.[2]

* * * *

Before I examine more closely the Court’s gloss on the “subject to” phrase and explain how it is designed to encompass the three recognized exceptions—and only those exceptions—it’s important to emphasize that the Court’s reading of the Citizenship Clause was powerfully influenced, and perhaps ultimately determined, by its understanding of why the framers of the Clause included that qualifying language in the constitutional provision. That doesn’t mean the words of the phrase are unimportant. Indeed, Justice Gray acknowledged in Wong Kim Ark that “the intention of the Congress which framed and of the States which adopted this Amendment of the Constitution must be sought in the words of the Amendment,” and that “the debates in Congress are not admissible as evidence to control the meaning of those words.” 169 U.S. at 699 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, Gray stressed that legislators’ statements were “valuable as contemporaneous opinions of jurists and statesmen upon the legal meaning of the words themselves,” id., and, of greater significance here, the ultimate touchstone for the Court’s holdings was “the intention of the Congress which framed and of the States which adopted this Amendment”—i.e., the Court’s assessment of what the framers were trying to accomplish. Cf. King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 498 (2015) (“A fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan.”).

So what was the framers’ objective? In Wong Kim Ark, the Court held that the Citizenship Clause is “declaratory in form, and enabling and extending in effect.” 169 U.S. at 676. Thus, explained Justice Gray, the Clause is “not intended to impose any new restrictions upon citizenship, or to prevent any persons from becoming citizens by the fact of birth within the United States who would thereby have become citizens according to the law existing before its adoption.” Id. (emphasis added). (That understanding reflected the views of Senator Jacob Howard of Michigan, who introduced the Clause. Howard characterized the amendment as “simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already.” Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 2890.)

Accordingly, far from establishing an open-ended condition that might apply to various additional categories of U.S.-born persons whom the framers had not contemplated, “[t]he real object” of the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” phrase apparently was, instead, simply “to exclude, by the fewest and fittest words, (besides children of members of the Indian tribes, standing in a peculiar relation to the National Government, unknown to the common law,) the two classes of cases—children born of alien enemies in hostile occupation, and children of diplomatic representatives of a foreign State—both of which, as has already been shown, by the law of England, and by our own law, from the time of the first settlement of the English colonies in America, had been recognized exceptions to the fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the country.” Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 682.

In other words, in order to be faithful to the framers’ objectives, the Court construed the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” phrase as establishing a ceiling of those U.S.-born persons who are excepted from the baseline citizenship guarantee, rather than a general standard that might result in further exceptions for additional, unforeseen categories of native-born persons.

Until very recently, the fact that the “real object” of the Citizenship Clause was to establish a hard-and-fast general rule with a small handful of discrete, established exceptions would have been virtually sufficient, in and of itself, to decide the question of whether the Trump Citizenship Order is constitutional. It wouldn’t have been necessary to explain whether and how the Trump categories materially differ from the established exceptions. The only reason DOJ’s critique of the plaintiffs’ position might have any purchase at all in 2025 is that some Justices on the current Court purport to be far more textualist than the Court has been in previous eras—including in 1898, when it decided Wong Kim Ark—and concededly it’s difficult to understand the scope of the conditional clause merely by viewing the words in isolation, given the consensus about the three preserved exceptions.[3]

Even in this purported age of textualism, however, there’s nothing to prevent the Court from using such a “framers’ objectives” lens in resolving the challenges to the Trump Citizenship Order. Indeed, that approach would be fully consistent with the way the modern Court itself—including self-professed textualist Justices—approaches another very important, familiar part of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Citizenship Clause is the first sentence of Section 1. The much more well-known second sentence of Section 1 then famously provides that “[n]o State shall … deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Read literally, that clause might appear to prohibit states from drawing just about any legal distinctions whatsoever among persons; its language, like “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” one sentence earlier, is remarkably open-ended. Yet in construing the Equal Protection Clause, the Court has developed an elaborate edifice of doctrinal distinctions among different forms of discrimination that has no grounding in the text.

For example, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recently pointed out in her concurring opinion in United States v. Skrmetti, the Court has generally adhered to “the principle that ‘[w]hen social or economic legislation is at issue, the Equal Protection Clause allows the States wide latitude, and the Constitution presumes that even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic processes’” (quoting Cleburne). In contrast, the Court has created various tiers of “scrutiny” that are to apply to some other grounds of discrimination in state and federal laws (e.g., race, national origin, and sex)—a method, as Justice Barrett noted, the Court has derived from Carolene Products footnote 4 rather than from the text of Section 1. The Court has also established “tests” that are to be applied at each level of scrutiny; and has applied such tests to countless different factual scenarios. The result is that, notwithstanding the broad prohibitory language of the Equal Protection Clause, grounds of distinction found in state statutes are ordinarily permissible … but not invariably.

In creating and adjudicating all of these fine-grained distinctions, the Court has virtually always disregarded the broadly worded constitutional text entirely; instead, the Court has focused on what the Justices believe to be “the real object[s] of the Fourteenth Amendment,” 169 U.S. at 682, just as the Court did when construing the Citizenship Clause in Wong Kim Ark.

Examples of the Court’s text-free, purpose-centered application of the Equal Protection Clause are legion. Most recently, Chief Justice John Roberts explained in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023)—as he had in earlier cases—that the Court applies strict scrutiny to race-specific distinctions, including affirmative action laws, not because of any textual command, but instead to reflect “‘[t]he clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment … to eliminate all official state sources of invidious racial discrimination in the States’” (quoting Loving v. Virginia). In that same case, Justice Clarence Thomas insisted that the Equal Protection Clause requires strict color-blindness “with no textual reference to race whatsoever”—indeed, even though Congress chose not to use an earlier proposal from Representative Thaddeus Stevens that would have provided expressly that “[n]o discrimination shall be made by any State nor by the United States as to the civil rights of persons because of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” According to Thomas, the lack of a textual hook is no matter; it’s sufficient to point to the “equality vision reflected in the history of the Fourteenth Amendment’s enactment.” (Thomas further noted that the Court applies strict scrutiny to race discrimination by the federal government even though the Fifth Amendment doesn’t include an equal protection clause at all (citing Bolling v. Sharpe).) Similarly, in last Term’s decision in Skrmetti, the extensive debate between Justices Barrett and Sotomayor about whether discrimination against transgender persons should be subject to heightened scrutiny included discussion of many factors, but the text wasn’t among them.

If the Court were to apply a similar sort of analysis to the Citizenship Clause, with an emphasis on the “real object” (Wong Kim Ark) or “clear and central purpose” (SFFA) of the Clause, then it would be clear as day that the Trump Citizenship Order directs federal officials to act unconstitutionally, because (as the Court has already held in Wong Kim Ark) the framers’ object in including the “subject to the jurisdiction” qualifier was simply to codify the three established exceptions, and nothing more. There would be no need for the Court to discern or apply any sort of Grand Unified Theory of what “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” means for categories of U.S.-born persons who don’t fall within one of those three established exceptions.

* * * *

In any event, the Supreme Court already has determined the proper way to apply the qualifying phrase to various categories of native-born persons, and it did so in a way that fully accounts for the three established exceptions the framers intended to preserve.

There are only two Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Citizenship Clause—Elk v. Wilkins (1884) and Wong Kim Ark (1898). Justice Gray wrote the opinion for the Court in each case. “The evident meaning” of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” wrote Gray in Elk, “is, not merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely subject to their political jurisdiction, and owing them direct and immediate allegiance.” 112 U.S. at 102 (emphasis added); see also Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 680 (quoting this holding from Elk); Inglis v. Trustees of Sailors’ Snug Harbor, 28 U.S. 99, 155 (1830) (Story, J., dissenting) (“the party must be born within a place where the sovereign is at the time in full possession and exercise of his power”).

In other words, in order to explain the established exceptions that the framers uncontrovertibly intended to preserve, the Court concluded that the “subject to” phrase must be construed to have an implied modifying adverb: “completely.” Accordingly, the determinative question the Court asked in both cases (the “test,” in a sense, that it employed) was whether U.S. law entirely regulated the conduct of the person claiming citizenship himself—not his parents—on the date of his birth in the United States.

Before turning to examine how Justice Gray’s formulation explains the three established exceptions, it’s important to address two conceptual matters.

First, in its appellate briefs in the pending cases, DOJ oddly insists that the Court’s use of the term “political jurisdiction” in Elk (which Justice Gray then repeated in Wong Kim Ark) did not refer to the federal Government’s regulation of an individual’s conduct. See, e.g., Appellants’ Reply Brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at 4-7. Yet Justice Gray made clear in Wong Kim Ark that even a temporary visitor to the country is “subject to the political jurisdiction” of that nation’s government in the sense that “‘for so long a time as he continues within the dominions of [the] foreign government’” he “‘owes obedience to the laws of that government, and may be punished for treason, or other crimes, as a native-born subject might be.’” 169 U.S. at 693-94 (quoting Secretary of State Webster’s report in Thrasher’s Case). In other words, the Court itself used the term “political jurisdiction” to mean the government’s exercise of regulatory or prescriptive authority.

Best I can tell, DOJ’s argument that “political jurisdiction” “cannot mean regulatory jurisdiction,” Reply Brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at 7, is predicated entirely on the fact that the Court held in Elk that tribal Indians were not completely subject to the “political jurisdiction” of the United States even though it “was well settled when the Citizenship Clause was ratified that the United States could exercise regulatory power over Indian tribes,” id. at 6. As I’ve tried to explain in this post, however, the holding in Elk was based on the fact that Congress generally had not exercised its available regulatory authority against tribal members and thus had chosen not to subject them to Congress’ “complete” regulatory jurisdiction. There’s nothing inconsistent between that holding and the fact that Congress could have exercised regulatory power over tribal Indians.

Nor does DOJ offer any plausible alternative meaning of “political jurisdiction.” DOJ posits that an individual is only subject to the “political jurisdiction” of a nation if she owes that nation “allegiance.” That gets things backwards: required allegiance (at least while one is present in a state) is an incident of being subject to a state’s political jurisdiction, rather than a precondition for being subject to that jurisdiction. In any event, DOJ’s alternative understanding doesn’t support their argument: As the Wong Kim Ark passage quoted above, as well as others, establishes, and as the next post in this series will explain in greater detail, the Court held that even persons temporarily visiting the nation do owe it “allegiance” in the relevant sense—that is, they “owe[] obedience to the laws of that [nation’s] government,” 169 U.S. at 694—while they are present within its territory.

Second, there’s concededly something formalistic about a reading of the Citizenship Clause, such as the one the Court adopted, that turns on a fact about whether federal law regulates a person’s conduct at the moment of their birth in the United States. To be sure, persons born in U.S. territory technically owe obedience to federal law on their date of birth; they are prohibited, for example, from violating any part of the federal criminal code. But what does that matter, given that they aren’t aware of that law and, in any event, can’t form the requisite mens rea? Likewise, as the Court in Wong Kim Ark explained, 169 U.S. at 680, it’s true that individuals born in the United States presumptively owe the United States “direct and immediate allegiance” from the very moment of their birth. But, again, that’s effectively a legal fiction that has little or no practical significance, at least during infancy, given that a newborn can’t choose whether or not to honor such a duty.

Even so, the language of the Citizenship Clause does appear to make regulatory, i.e., prescriptive, jurisdiction over the child relevant to the question of birthright citizenship; and, more to the point, the Supreme Court held, in both Wong Kim Ark and Elk, that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” turns on whether the United States exercises complete “political jurisdiction” (i.e., prescriptive authority) over a person at the moment of his or her birth in the United States.[4] As I’ll now elaborate, that gloss on “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” explains each of the three categories of persons born in the United States who are not deemed citizens at birth. By contrast, it does not encompass the two categories of U.S.-born persons described in the Trump Citizenship Order.

1. Persons Born to Occupying Enemy Forces

This is the easiest of the three established exceptions to understand, because it involves a situation in which the territorial government of the relevant nation is disabled from exercising regulatory jurisdiction over the persons in question. If, for instance, military forces of an enemy nation were to occupy and govern the territory of the United States, the U.S. government established by the Constitution would lack the ability to apply or enforce its law as to anyone. To be sure, in such a case the foreign nation wouldn’t establish territorial sovereignty (see Chris Mirasola); nevertheless, the newborn child of one of those invading forces wouldn’t in any practical sense be subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the sovereign occupied state, let alone be “completely subject” to it. Justice Gray explicated this exception at page 683 of Wong Kim Ark, where he quoted at length from Justice Joseph Story’s opinion for the Court in United States v. Rice (1819):

In United States v. Rice, (1819) 4 Wheat. 246, goods imported into Castine, in the State of Maine, while it was in the exclusive possession of the British authorities during the last war with England, were held not to be subject to duties under the revenue laws of the United States, because, as was said by Mr. Justice Story in delivering judgment: “By the conquest and military occupation of Gastine, the enemy acquired that firm possession which enabled him to exercise the fullest rights of sovereignty over that place. The sovereignty of the United States over the territory was, of course, suspended, and the laws of the United States could no longer be rightfully enforced there, or be obligatory upon the inhabitants who remained and submitted to the conquerors. By the surrender the inhabitants passed under a temporary allegiance to the British Government, and were bound by such laws, and such only, as it chose to recognize and impose. From the nature of the case, no other laws could be obligatory upon them, for, where there is no protection or allegiance or sovereignty, there can be no claim to obedience.”

The “foreign enemy occupation” exception does, however, raise one thorny question. What about other children born during such an occupation, including to the citizens of the occupied state itself? Like the children of the occupying forces, they are not in a practical sense subject to the jurisdiction of the “native” nation at birth because the government of that state has been displaced. Does this mean that they’re not birthright citizens and therefore must be naturalized after the occupation ends in order to become citizens?

I haven’t studied how the common law treated such persons, but I imagine that it deemed them to be birthright citizens after the occupation, in contrast with the children born to the occupiers themselves. That is, in any event, what Justice Story himself suggested in his dissenting opinion in Inglis v. Trustees of Sailors’ Snug Harbor (1830). Story explained (28 U.S. at 156) that “the children of the natives, born during such temporary occupation by conquest, are, upon a reconquest or reoccupation by the original sovereign, deemed, by a sort of postliminy, to be subjects from their birth although they were then under the actual sovereignty and allegiance of an enemy.” (The majority in that case didn’t disagree with Story on this point—they didn’t address it because the case itself didn’t concern a dispute about birthright citizenship.) I assume Story was right about that, but it hardly matters whether his is the best explanation because—fortunately—this isn’t a conundrum the United States has had to deal with for centuries, if ever.

2. Persons Born to Foreign Ambassadors and Ministers

The second established exception is that the children of foreign ambassadors and ministers born in the United States are not U.S. citizens by virtue of their native birth because the national government has afforded them a particular sort of immunity from the enforcement of domestic law. See Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 685 (incorporating Chief Justice Marshall’s description in The Schooner Exchange (1812) of the form of diplomatic immunity that protects “foreign ministers”).[5] Notably, this exception is uncontroverted despite the fact that such persons are “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States in the sense that they are obligated to comply with U.S. law.

It’s a mistake to assume, as many commonly do, that doctrines of “diplomatic immunity” afford foreign ministers and their families—let alone all foreign representatives—a right to violate domestic law while they’re present in the United States. Even the foreign representatives protected by the strongest form of such immunity—“personal inviolability,” which is the common label for the sort of immunity the Court discussed in Wong Km Ark—are generally subject to U.S. law, in at least two important senses: (i) they have a legal obligation to comply with the law; and (ii) law enforcement officials can constrain them from committing offenses. They also can be removed from the United States if they violate its law, and they can even be subjected to trial for violating the law if their home country consents.[6] Thus, as the State Department explains, “[i]t should be emphasized that even at its highest level, diplomatic immunity does not exempt diplomatic officers from the obligation of conforming with national and local laws and regulations. Diplomatic immunity is not intended to serve as a license for persons to flout the law and purposely avoid liability for their actions.”

The more limited effect of the doctrine of personal inviolability is, instead, that covered diplomatic representatives (and their family members) may not be subjected to criminal trial or sanction (nor to civil proceedings, either, except under particular circumstances) for violating the law of the host state, absent the consent of their home state. Moreover, in most cases they can’t be arrested or held in custody, either, though they can be temporarily interdicted in order to prevent them from violating the law.

This is a longstanding norm of international relations, which now appears in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Such personal inviolability is only available by virtue of the host state’s consent, see Won Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 684, but virtually all nations confer it, not only because they have entered into a treaty requiring it, but also because their ability to engage in foreign relations would be significantly compromised if they didn’t extend such inviolability. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote in The Schooner Exchange (quoted in Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 685), “without such exemption, every sovereign would hazard his own dignity by employing a public minister abroad. His minister would owe temporary and local allegiance to a foreign prince, and would be less competent to the objects of his mission.”

The First Congress codified the personal inviolability rule in Section 25 of the 1790 Crimes Act, 1 Stat. 117-18,[7] and it remains U.S. law today.[8] Under current law, as under early American law, such personal inviolability extends only to diplomatic agents and to family members who are part of their households—including newborns.[9]

Because the children of such diplomats themselves enjoy personal inviolability, they don’t become U.S. citizens when born in the United States. This exception carries over into the Constitution the common law rule that the Citizenship Clause incorporates. See Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 658 (“every child born in England of alien parents was a natural-born subject, unless the child of an ambassador or other diplomatic agent of a foreign State, or of an alien enemy in hostile occupation of the place where the child was born) (emphasis added)).

Importantly, children born in the United States to all other sorts of foreign representatives are citizens pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment because they are not protected by the personal inviolability rule. For example, although consular officials enjoy some limited forms of immunity when performing official acts, they and their families aren’t entitled to the personal inviolability that diplomats and their families have even for conduct undertaken in their personal capacity, because the consuls don’t represent their home nations in the conduct of foreign relations. See Foreign Ministers, Consuls, Etc., 1 Op. Att’y Gen. 406 (1820); see also Respect Due to Consuls, 1 Op. Att’y Gen. 41, 42 (1794) (because a consul “is not in any degree invested with the representative character[,] it has, more than once, been judicially determined that he is not entitled to the privileges attached to the person of every public minister”). Therefore, their U.S.-born children are birthright citizens, in contrast to the children of diplomats. (Check out, for example, the extraordinary case of Moncada v. Blinken, 680 F. Supp. 3d 1190 (C.D. Cal. 2023), in which the State Department treated the plaintiff as a citizen for many decades based upon the assumption that he’d been born while his father was serving as Nicaraguan Consul in New York, only to have the first Trump Administration strip him of citizenship—and revoke his passport—when it determined that his father had become an attaché to the permanent mission of Nicaragua to the United Nations, a diplomatic position subject to full personal inviolability, before the plaintiff was born.)

The children-of-diplomats exception, then, is not a case, akin to foreign occupation, in which the federal government is incapable of exercising its jurisdiction over the newborns in question. It may do so, but it has chosen, in light of international law obligations and diplomatic norms, to confer upon them a form of partial immunity—freedom not from the application of domestic law but from being subject to certain means of enforcement of that applicable law. In this respect the United States has “‘waive[d] the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction, which has been stated to be the attribute of every nation.’” Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 684 (quoting The Schooner Exchange) (emphasis added). Personal inviolability of the child of a foreign minister, which is “traced up to [the Government’s] own consent, express or implied,” thus creates an exception to the exercise of the Government’s “full and absolute territorial jurisdiction” that it is entitled to exercise. Id. at 686. And that, according to the Court in Wong Kim Ark, is sufficient to trigger an exception to the rule of birthplace citizenship, because although children born to diplomatic agents in this country are subject in some respects to the federal government’s “political jurisdiction,” they aren’t “completely subject” to it (id. at 680).[10]

3. Persons Born as Members of Indian Tribes

The final exception is the one the Court recognized in Elk—the only one of the exceptions that doesn’t have its genesis in the common law. A person who, at birth, is a member of an Indian tribe is not deemed a U.S. citizen pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, even if (as in Elk) they later purport to leave the tribe and pledge full allegiance to the United States. See Elk, 112 U.S. at 102 (holding that the “subject to” phrase relates to the time of birth rather than the date on which the individual seeks to be treated as a citizen). (This constitutional exception is no longer of practical importance because in 1924 Congress enacted a statute conferring citizenship upon persons who are born in the United States to a member of an Indian tribe. See 8 U.S.C. § 1401(b).)

In support of its argument that the plaintiffs’ reading of “subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]” must be wrong, DOJ emphasizes that this tribal exception exists despite the fact that Congress has the constitutional power to regulate the conduct of tribal members—even on Indian lands and with respect to other tribal members—and that Congress has exercised that authority (relatively rarely before ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, but more commonly after 1871). According to DOJ (reply brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at 5), “plaintiffs’ articulation of the legal standard is clearly incompatible with the Supreme Court’s treatment of tribal Indians, who plaintiffs concede are subject to the government’s regulatory jurisdiction, … but are nonetheless not ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the United States for the Citizenship Clause, Elk, 112 U.S. at 102.”

The Court’s holding in Elk, however, wasn’t predicated on the (incorrect) supposition that Congress is constitutionally disabled from regulating members of tribes. The Court recognized that Congress has such authority. See 112 U.S. at 107 (discussing an 1871 statute, Act of March 3, 1871, ch. 120, the effect of which was “to require the Indian tribes to be dealt with for the future through the legislative and not through the treatymaking power”); id. at 100 (observing that historically “[g]eneral acts of Congress did not apply to Indians, unless so expressed as to clearly manifest an intention to include them”) (emphasis added).[11] What made tribal newborns “the anomalous case,” Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 683, then, was not that Congress couldn’t regulate them, but that it had done so only rarely: such tribal members might have been “subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States,” but they were not “completely subject to their political jurisdiction” at their “time of birth,” Elk, 112 U.S. at 102 (emphasis added), and therefore were not deemed U.S. citizens by virtue of their birth on U.S. territory.

* * * *

Before turning to the question of whether the persons covered by the Trump Citizenship Order are “subject to [U.S.] jurisdiction” at birth in light of the Court’s understanding of that phrase in Elk and Wong Kim Ark, it’s necessary to highlight one other thing about the three established exceptions to citizenship for native-born persons. As elaborated above, when evaluating whether an individual was born “subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]” in Elk and Wong Kim Ark, the Court identified the relevant question not as whether the national government had authority to exercise regulatory jurisdiction over that person at the time of their U.S. birth—something it can do in all cases apart from occupation—but instead whether the government had in fact applied its regulatory power to that person “completely” on the date of birth. As to each of the three established excepted categories of persons born in the United States, the answer to that question was: no.

But that’s not the only thing the three established exceptions had in common. To be sure, as Justice Story noted in Inglis, 28 U.S. at 155, each of the exceptions is “founded upon peculiar reasons.” See also Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 682 (“children of members of the Indian tribes … stand[] in a peculiar relation to the National Government”). Yet they aren’t simply random, idiosyncratic situations in which Congress happens to have chosen, willy-nilly, not to assert its full authority over a subset of minors. (And they certainly aren’t cases in which Congress elected not to fully regulate a class of newborns specifically in order to circumvent Fourteenth Amendment citizenship.) Rather, there’s an important throughline connecting those three exceptions: Each is a function of a particular relationship between the United States and another sovereign—or, in the case of tribes, other quasi-sovereign entities. The “occupied forces” exception applies when a foreign sovereign has displaced the federal government in the United States. The “children of diplomats” exception applies because international law requires states to confer “personal inviolability” that precludes enforcement of the law against certain resident agents and families of fellow sovereign states. And the uniquely American exception for tribal members was a function of the federal government’s treatment of tribes as “distinct, independent political communities” (Worcester v. Georgia (1832)) embedded within U.S. territory.

Although Justice Gray did not write, in so many terms, that such an “inter-sovereign” justification is a necessary condition for an exception under the qualifying phrase of the Citizenship Clause, that characteristic is emphasized throughout the Court’s opinions in Elk and Wong Kim Ark.[12]

* * * *

By contrast with the newborns covered by the three established exceptions, all other persons born in the United States to foreign nationals are—and historically have been—subject to the complete political jurisdiction of the United States (as are their parents in the United States) on the day they are born. That includes both of the categories of persons described in the Trump Citizenship Order. United States law does, of course, apply in its entirety to a person born in the United States to a woman who entered the nation unlawfully (or who violated the law by overstaying her visa or other permission). And the same is true of someone born while their mother is visiting the United States lawfully—just as the law applies to the person’s mother herself while she is in the United States. As the Supreme Court held in Wong Kim Ark, when “private individuals of another nation enter the territory and mingle indiscriminately with its inhabitants, for purposes of business or pleasure,” they are not subject to any “exemption from the jurisdiction of the country in which they are found,” and therefore that jurisdiction remains “absolute,” 169 U.S. at 686, as applied not only to such persons, but also to their newborn children. And the application of such “absolute” regulatory jurisdiction means that the child becomes a citizen at birth.

* * * *

The next post in this series will address DOJ’s affirmative, alternative reading of the Citizenship Clause, which is that a newborn in the U.S. is “subject to [U.S.] jurisdiction” only if he or she is domiciled here.

[1] The disconnect here might be attributable, at least in part, to the fact that most of the plaintiffs invoke the 1865 edition of Noah Webster’s American Dictionary of the English Language, which defined a nation’s “jurisdiction” as the “[p]ower of governing or legislating,” the “power or right of exercising authority,” the “limit within which power may be exercised,” or the “extent of power or authority.” The recent Ninth Circuit decision (see p.26) also cites that and similar dictionary definitions concerning a nation’s authority to regulate. Those definitions of “jurisdiction” are fine as far as they go, but they don’t address what it means for a newborn to be subject to that jurisdiction for purposes of the Citizenship Clause. Fairly read, the plaintiffs (and the Ninth Circuit) are not arguing that a newborn is “subject to” U.S. jurisdiction simply because Congress could in theory obligate that person to comply with U.S. law; instead, they contend that the child is “subject to” U.S. jurisdiction if such federal laws do, in fact, regulate that person.

[2] For what it’s worth, I think the Court’s understanding in Elk and in Wong Kim Ark was correct, at least as a matter of reflecting the framers’ objectives. Many others, however, have written about the original understanding and about pre-Wong Kim Ark interpretations. My focus in this piece and the next piece, by contrast, is on how the Supreme Court’s precedential holdings bear upon DOJ’s arguments.

[3] As noted in the text, Justice Gray wrote in Wong Kim Ark that the framers accomplished their objective by using “the fewest and fittest words.” “Fewest,” perhaps. “Fittest,” however, is a stretch. One can easily imagine “fitter,” i.e., more descriptive, words. For example, if, as the Court held in Wong Kim Ark, the “object” of the phrase was merely to carve out three discrete exceptions (two emanating from the common law and the other to deal with the idiosyncratic relationship of the federal Government to Indian tribes), and nothing more, the framers could have precluded any uncertainty simply by identifying those three exceptions by terms. Likewise, if the pertinent “test” is, as Justice Gray indicated in Wong Kim Ark, whether the newborn child is completely subject to the nation’s political jurisdiction, the framers of the Citizenship Clause surely could have added the adjective “completely” in order to be clear about what is and isn’t covered. As far as I know, there doesn’t appear to be any evidence of why the drafters of the Clause (Senator Jacob Howard, in particular) chose the particular words that appear in the qualifying phrase, rather than opting for a more cabined and precise formulation.

[4] DOJ at times emphasizes the flip side of the duty of allegiance—namely, that a birthright citizen “derive[s] protection” from the United States (Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 659). It’s true that that legal relationship, unlike allegiance, obviously is of practical significance at the moment of birth: The federal government has the same obligation to protect newborns from harm that it has for others within its territory, and when dealing with newborns it must comply with those legal obligations that apply to all persons—including, for example, the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Yet the Government has such obligations of protection with respect to all minors in the United States, whether they’re citizens or not, and whether or not they fall within one of the historical exceptions to birthright citizenship. (The federal government cannot, for example, refuse to protect children of ambassadors from harm, nor discriminate against them on the basis of race.) Application of the Citizenship Clause therefore cannot turn on whether the United States owes some duty of protection to the person at birth, for that would cover the waterfront and wouldn’t admit of any exceptions at all.

[5] As Marshall explained in The Schooner Exchange (see Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 684), such immunity also applies to a “foreign sovereign” him- or herself (e.g., a king or queen) when present in the United States.

[6] As to possible waiver of immunity by the sending state, the State Department explains: “Always keep in mind that privileges and immunities are extended from one country to another in order to permit their respective representatives to perform their duties effectively; in a sense, it may be said the sending countries ‘own’ these privileges and immunities. Therefore, while the individual enjoying such immunities may not waive them, the sending states can, and do. Police authorities should never address the alleged commission of a crime by a person enjoying full criminal immunity with the belief that there is no possibility that a prosecution could result. The U.S. Department of State requests waivers of immunity in every case where the prosecutor advises that, but for the immunity, charges would be pursued. In serious cases, if a waiver is refused, the offender will be expelled from the United States and the U.S. Department of State will request that a warrant be issued and appropriate entries to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database be made by the responsible jurisdiction.”

[7] Section 25 provided: “[I]f any writ or process shall at any time hereafter be sued forth or prosecuted by any person or persons, in any of the courts of the United States, or in any of the courts of a particular state, or by any judge or justice therein respectively, whereby the person of any ambassador or other public minister of any foreign prince or state, authorized and received as such by the President of the United States, or any domestic or domestic servant of any such ambassador or other public minister, may be arrested or imprisoned, or his or their goods or chattels be distrained, seized or attached, such writ or process shall be deemed and adjudged to be utterly null and void to all intents, construction and purposes whatsoever.”

[8] See 22 U.S.C. § 254d (providing that “[a]ny action or proceeding brought against an individual who is entitled to immunity with respect to such action or proceeding under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations … shall be dismissed”); Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations arts. 31(1) (“A diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State”), 32(1) (providing that the sending state can waive such immunity).

[9] See Vienna Convention art. 37(1) (extending that inviolability to “members of the family of a diplomatic agent forming part of his household”). Section 25 of the 1790 Act referred to the “domestic[s]” of the ambassador or minister. The United States defines members of the household to include spouses, children until the age of 21 (until the age of 23 if they are full-time students at an institution of higher learning), and such other persons expressly agreed to by the U.S. Department of State in extraordinary circumstances.

[10] Jim Jordan and 17 other members of the House Judiciary Committee, appearing as amici in some of the cases, argue that this sort of “partial” immunity can’t be the actual explanation for the “children of ministers” exception because “[i]f qualified, partial, or contingent immunity were sufficient to render diplomatic officials’ children not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, then the children of domestic officials who receive such immunity—e.g., judges and prosecutors—would likewise not be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and thus not citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment. That is wrong, of course.” Corrected Brief of Members of Congress as Amici Curiae in Support of Appellants and Reversal in O. Doe v. Trump at 30-31. Amici’s attempted analogy to judicial and prosecutorial immunity is misplaced. For one thing, foreign ministers, unlike judges and prosecutors, have “inviolability” from prosecution as to unlawful conduct undertaken in their personal capacity—it’s not merely an immunity for certain official-capacity acts. More importantly for present purposes, judges’ and prosecutors’ children don’t have any immunity at all, in contrast to the children of foreign ministers, who do. The relevant inquiry under Elk and Wong Kim Ark is whether the federal government exercised its complete regulatory authority over the newborn herself, rather than over the parents, even if the child’s immunity might be derivative of the parents’.

[11] The authorities the Elk Court cited for that proposition included United States v. Rogers, 45 U.S. 567 (1846), in which the Court wrote in dicta (id. at 572) that “it [is] too firmly and clearly established to admit of dispute, that the Indian tribes residing within the territorial limits of the United States are subject to [the United States’] authority, and where the country occupied by them is not within the limits of one of the States, Congress may by law punish any offen[s]e committed there, no matter whether the offender be a white man or an Indian”; as well as Crow Dog’s Case, 109 U.S. 556, decided less than one year before Elk, in which the Court appeared to assume (id. at 572) that Congress had authority to deviate from its “general policy” and to prohibit crimes by Indians against other Indians, at least as long as it provided a “clear expression” of an intent to do so.

Although the 1866 Senate debates are hardly clear on this point, it’s possible that some congressional proponents of the Citizenship Clause might have believed that Congress lacked any constitutional authority to regulate members of tribes—a view suggested, as well, by a sentence in an 1870 Senate Report, see S. Rep. No. 41-268, at 9 (“an act of Congress which should assume to treat the members of a tribe as subject to the municipal jurisdiction of the United States would be unconstitutional and void”). To the extent anyone in Congress held that view, however, it would have been inconsistent with the Supreme Court dicta in Rogers. And just a few months after the Senate Report, the Court adopted the Rogers dicta as a holding, going so far as to say that the propositions in Rogers about congressional authority over Indians were “so well settled in our jurisprudence that it would be a waste of time to discuss them.” The Cherokee Tobacco, 78 U.S. 616, 619 (1871); see also id. at 622 (Bradley, J., dissenting) (“the United States has not relinquished its power to make such regulations as it may deem necessary in relation to [Indian] territory, and … Congress has occasionally passed laws affecting it”). Congress itself likewise rejected any constitutional disability over Indians in the 1871 statute flagged in Elk, 112 U.S. at 107. Congressional enactments both before and, especially, after enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment also bely the idea that Congress can’t regulate the conduct of tribal Indians. See, e.g., United States v. Kagama (1886) (upholding Congress’ authority to enact an 1885 statute prohibiting Indians from committing violent felonies on Indian reservations); see also Maggie Blackhawk, Foreword: The Constitution of American Colonialism, 137 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 107 (2023) (noting that the process of Congress and the Executive regulating Native nations and their polities directly through domestic law “began much earlier” than 1871 “and progressed more informally over time”). Today, there’s little dispute within the Court that Congress has a “muscular” power to regulate tribal members. Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 273 (2023) (citing numerous cases); see also, e.g., United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 323 (1978) (noting that the “general government” “alone can enforce its laws on all the tribes”); Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 56 (1978) (“Indian tribes are, of course, no longer ‘possessed of the full attributes of sovereignty.’ Kagama. Their incorporation within the territory of the United States, and their acceptance of its protection, necessarily divested them of some aspects of the sovereignty which they had previously exercised. By specific treaty provision they yielded up other sovereign powers; by statute, in the exercise of its plenary control, Congress has removed still others.”). Justice Neil Gorsuch is a possible exception. Concurring in Brackeen, he wrote that the proposition in Santa Clara Pueblo that Congress has “plenary authority” to “limit, modify, or eliminate the powers of local self-government which the [T]ribes otherwise possess” is “an ‘inconceivable’ suggestion for anyone who takes the Constitution’s original meaning seriously.” 599 U.S. at 328 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). No other Justice expressed such doubts, however.

More to the point for present purposes, and as explained in the text, the Court in Elk didn’t rely upon the notion that Congress lacked constitutional authority; rather, it held that newborn members of tribes were not birthright citizens because, inter alia, Congress had chosen (in light of the unique relationship between the U.S. and recognized tribes) not to subject them to federal jurisdiction “completely,” 112 U.S. at 102. Nor did the Court in Wong Kim Ark rely upon any purported want of congressional power in describing the three established exceptions to birthright citizenship.

[12] In Wong Kim Ark, Justice Gray discussed a fourth situation in which states historically refrained from exercising jurisdiction over persons in their territory, which also involved a particular relationship between sovereigns—namely, when public armed ships of a friendly nation are docked in a domestic port. Gray quoted at length from Chief Justice Marshall’s discussion of this issue in The Schooner Exchange (1812), 169 U.S. at 684-85:

[A] public armed ship, in the service of a foreign sovereign, with whom the Government of the United States is at peace, and having entered an American port open for her reception, on the terms on which ships of war are generally permitted to enter the ports of a friendly power, must be considered as having come into the American territory, under an implied promise, that while necessarily within it, and demeaning herself in a friendly manner, she should be exempt from the jurisdiction of the country.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/getty.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 11:57:01.248887

uses the lure of a $50,000 signing bonus to recruit new ICE officers in a state as poor as Kentucky.","The immigration enforcement raids that have occurred in cities across the country have largely been absent in Louisville, Ky. Federal funds, which have been choked off to some municipalities, have continued to flow to the city. There has been no talk of deploying National Guard troops to neighborhood streets, as in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

Mayor Craig Greenberg of Louisville, elected to lead a blue city in a deep-red state, is trying to keep it that way with a rare gambit for a Democratic mayor. He has agreed to the Trump administration’s request to place a 48-hour hold on immigrant inmates at the city’s jail that would allow the Department of Homeland Security more time to detain them.

The new policy, a reversal of a 2017 city ordinance that limited how the police could work with immigration authorities, seems to have achieved the mayor’s goal for now. Louisville was removed this month from the Department of Justice’s list of sanctuary cities, counties and states that are being threatened with litigation.

But the mayor’s decision has also generated blowback from Democratic leaders and immigrant rights organizations in a city with a rich history of opening its arms to refugees and where Kentucky’s two headlining industries — horse racing and bourbon — rely heavily on labor from immigrants, including many who are undocumented.

Since the early 1990s, resettlement programs have helped make Louisville a landing spot for immigrants fleeing wars in Bosnia and central Africa, and economic hardships in Cuba and Haiti. Louisville, with a population of roughly 640,000, has more Cuban immigrants than any other U.S. city outside Miami. More recently, Central Americans have landed in Louisville.

The city estimates there are nearly 80,000 immigrants in the metro area, about half of whom are naturalized.

In announcing the policy change last month, Mr. Greenberg said he agreed to the request to prevent a widespread federal crackdown. “I will not risk the safety of our broader immigrant community,” he said.

While critics acknowledge that Mr. Greenberg was in a difficult position, they say that agreeing to the administration’s demands offers no guarantee that immigration raids will be tempered and federal funds won’t be cut off.

The move also raises the question of whether this will affect his political fortunes. In Louisville, he won in a crowded Democratic primary field by nearly 20 percentage points in 2022 and won the general election by five percentage points.

“Any day that we allow the administration to bully us is not a good day,” said Nima Kulkarni, a state representative who represents the area around the Churchill Downs horse racing track and is an immigration lawyer.

Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, has celebrated Mr. Greenberg’s decision. “This should set an example to other cities,” she wrote on social media. “Instead of forcing us to sue you — which we will, without hesitation — follow the law, get rid of sanctuary policies, and work with us to fix the illegal immigration crisis.”

But not all Democratic mayors are in the same spot. Some, as in Atlanta and Cleveland, do not have jurisdiction over the city jail. In New York, Mayor Eric Adams tried to allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into the city’s Rikers Island jail, but a state judge indefinitely blocked his executive order after the City Council sued in opposition. The mayor’s attempt to help the Trump administration did not stop the Department of Justice from suing the city.

Many Democratic mayors find themselves in positions similar to those who head law firms, universities and agencies that have promoted diversity initiatives. They face a multipronged attack from the federal government, which plays a sizable role in a city’s well-being through funding and policy.

Mr. Pureval, like other mayors who were interviewed, did not criticize Mr. Greenberg but added that “the fundamental question we all face is: When does protecting your constituents go from trying to avoid confrontation to confrontation?”

Kentucky Republicans have largely applauded the new policy, which puts Louisville into alignment with the commonwealth’s other cities. “Today is a victory for every Kentuckian and the rule of law,” Daniel Cameron, the former Kentucky attorney general and current Senate candidate, wrote on social media when the decision was announced.

Mr. Greenberg declined to be interviewed, but in his public remarks, he affirmed his commitment to Louisville’s immigrant community. Shortly after taking office in 2023, he created the Office of Immigrant Affairs, which coordinates a free leadership training program for foreign-born residents.

But leaders of support organizations in the city were irked that the mayor indicated in his public remarks that he had consulted them before reaching his decision. In reality, the mayor simply declared his plans and did not seek advice, according to two people who met with Mr. Greenberg who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. A spokesman for the mayor did not respond to a request to comment on the characterization of the meeting.

The mayor met again with community leaders last week.

Mr. Greenberg has said there are about 100 inmates annually in the Louisville jail who are subject to detainers, requests by federal officials to be notified of a release. As of last Monday, just after the 48-hour holds went into effect, the mayor’s office said 36 people were being held in the jail who were subject to detainers.

Louisville had been holding immigrant detainees for five to 12 hours, according to the mayor. While every state has seen an increase in immigration arrests since President Trump took office, Kentucky has experienced the smallest bump (28 percent), according to data reviewed by The New York Times. There are rarely more than 10 immigration arrests per day in the state.

Some expect those numbers to climb as D.H.S. uses the lure of a $50,000 signing bonus to recruit new ICE officers in a state as poor as Kentucky. ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Some immigrants in the city who were interviewed said they were disappointed in the mayor’s decision. An owner of a Louisville restaurant, who came to the United States as a teenager and said he was in the process of trying to gain legal residency, said the new policy made him feel as if people like him were unwelcome. But the man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is undocumented and concerned about drawing attention from federal authorities, said he was trying to stay hopeful.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/15/multimedia/nat-immig-louisville-top-ztbg/nat-immig-louisville-top-ztbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 08:56:35.370149

Connecticut creates new rules for gun sales, Texas redistricting maps face pushback over minority representation, Nebraska advocates press Congress for immigration reform and ICE officers expand their role in Washington, D.C. crime enforcement.

TRANSCRIPT

Welcome to 2025 Talks, where we're following our democracy in historic times.

They need to have a reasonable cause to believe the person is either at a risk of using the firearm to harm themselves or to make sure their reasonable controls are designed to prevent the sale.

Stacey Mayer with Connecticut Against Gun Violence says a new state law holds gun makers and sellers accountable and open to lawsuits if they fail to prevent illegal or risky sales.

One amendment groups object, but supporters say Connecticut is building on reforms since Sandy Hook, with a move intended to stop straw purchases, trafficking and sales to prohibited buyers.

In spite of Washington, D.C.'s violent crime being at a 30-year low, the Trump administration is continuing a crackdown there.

Borders Czar, Tom Homan says, deploying immigration officers in the nation's capital removes some criminals and deters others.

""I just saw an officer with a train and police taxis too.""

The move comes as former Vice President Mike Pence is voicing support for Trump's taking control of D.C. law enforcement and several GOP-led states sending National Guard troops.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott is calling another special legislative session to finish redistricting.

Democrats who stalemated the first session by breaking quorum now look likely to return to Austin.

President Donald Trump asked state Republicans to add five seats in the midterms, and Abbott says the new districts comply with court rulings.

But Tania Chavez with La Unión del Pueblo Entero says they're designed to dilute the power of Latino, Black and Asian voters.

The proposed map disrupts minority representation in K-12 South Texas and Central Texas.

And the ballot board would be triplet.

And the proposed map appears to have one goal, and that is to change the district just enough to force out the representative chosen by Latino voters.

Community groups in Nebraska are urging Congress to modernize decades-old immigration laws, by passaging long-stalled legislation creating a path to citizenship for Dreamers, migrants brought to the country as children.

Darcy Tromanhauser with Nebraska Appleseeds says that's better for families and local economies than sudden deportations.

We need better ways to transition from temporary to permanent status for neighbors, friends, family members who've been part of local communities for 20, 30 or more years who don't have a way to apply for residency. - Michigan state regulators may see tens of thousands of public comments on a plan by Canadian energy company Enbridge to replace part of a pipeline by tunneling under the Straits of Mackinac.

Native Americans and environmentalists say it's time to stop pumping the half a million gallons of crude a day through the 70 year old line, where a leak could devastate drinking water, fisheries, tourism, and shipping.

Massachusetts lawmakers are proposing a sweeping anti-poverty plan.

The ASAP Act would expand cash benefits, tax credits, and create state-funded baby bonds for children in deep poverty with the goal of cutting hardship in half in 10 years.

Other questions remain after rep's letter,"Bekah Morr, Paul DeBenedetto, www.keranews.org, rebekah-morr",,,,,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2025-08-18/does-dallas-partner-with-ice-287g,"What is the criteria used to determine when and how DPD engages with ICE or assists in immigration enforcement?
Johnson gave Comeaux an Aug. 21 deadline to respond, and DPD said the chief planned to respond by that date.
But ICE also offers a “task force model,” which grants law enforcement “limited immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties.” Johnson’s letter comes as the Trump administration continues its ramped-up immigration enforcement.
We know Chief Comeaux has faced criticism for his remarks about working with ICE.
It's voluntary if the police department chooses to become local ICE enforcers in addition to their other jobs.","The Dallas Police Department says it currently has no plans to enter into a formal agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, offering one of the clearest responses to date amid growing questions for Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux.

Asked whether DPD has opted in to ICE's 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement to help in the arrest and deportation of immigrants, department spokesperson Corbin Rubinson confirmed in an email it has not.

Asked whether the department was exploring opportunities to partner with ICE, Rubinson said, “The Department is not currently pursuing a 287(g) agreement.”

The statement appears to settle at least one question raised by North Texas U.S. Rep. Julie Johnson, who joined the chorus of people raising concerns about what they see as an unclear position taken by the department.

Johnson, who sent a letter to Comeaux last week, sought answers to six questions:

Has your department entered into any Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) or informal agreements with ICE or other DHS agencies?

What is the criteria used to determine when and how DPD engages with ICE or assists in immigration enforcement?

Does your department collect or share immigration status information during routine policing?

What is the department’s process for ensuring transparency and accountability in federal partnerships?

Are DPD officers ever stationed or detailed to work alongside ICE officers, and if so, in what capacity?

Has your department received funding, equipment, or other resources from ICE or DHS this year? If so, for what purposes?

Johnson gave Comeaux an Aug. 21 deadline to respond, and DPD said the chief planned to respond by that date.

In an interview with KERA News last week, which can be read below or listened to at the top of the page, Johnson said Dallas residents deserved answers to those questions.

“I think transparency in government is important,” Johnson said. “Constituents deserve to know what policies their law enforcement and their local governments are enforcing or not enforcing.”

The 287(g) program is often used by sheriff’s offices and other agencies that run jails, as part of ICE’s “jail enforcement model.”

DPD doesn’t operate a jail. But ICE also offers a “task force model,” which grants law enforcement “limited immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties.”

Johnson’s letter comes as the Trump administration continues its ramped-up immigration enforcement. The chief came under fire after remarks he made on Fox News earlier this year, in which he said the department would fully cooperate with ICE. He later walked back those statements in part.

Since then, Dallas residents have spoken publicly about their concerns and have called on the department to clarify its stance.

The Community Police Oversight Board also wants clarity on Comeaux’s immigration stance, and has requested his presence at the board’s next meeting to answer questions.

Asked whether Comeaux would attend, Rubinson would not confirm.

“The Chief’s schedule for next month has not been finalized,” Rubinson said.

The chief did attend a board meeting in June, but the board was prevented from asking him any direct questions.

KERA’s Bekah Morr spoke with U.S. Rep. Julie Johnson anbout her letter to the Dallas police chief. The below interview has been edited for length and clarity. For the full-length interview, listen at the top of the page.

We know Chief Comeaux has faced criticism for his remarks about working with ICE. He later told reporters he was specifically talking about undocumented people with felony warrants, but he reiterated the department would continue to assist, ""federal partners."" What are you specifically looking to hear from the chief?

JOHNSON: Well, I think transparency in government is important. Constituents deserve to know what policies their law enforcement and their local governments are enforcing or not enforcing. And it was my understanding, it was brought to my attention that constituents and community groups have asked and inquired of the chief of police, did they sign a 287(g) agreement with the federal government, yes or no?

They've not been provided those answers. And so I sent them a letter asking the questions just to tell us what are they doing, so that the community can then know and make their own decisions in response accordingly.

Has this been something you've been hearing about from your constituents?

JOHNSON: Well, yes, with Donald Trump having this reckless program of snatch and grab, just people based on the color of their skin, irregardless of whether they're citizens or not, or if they're here legally, or about anything. They're just snatching people with masked men who are unidentified, and people are very concerned about that.

But also, there's a lot of crime, there's lot of responsibilities that the local police department is in charge of. I mean, immigration is a federal law enforcement program. And then Dallas Police, they're supposed to enforce local laws and state criminal laws here within our city. And so, you know, there's agreements. It's voluntary if the police department chooses to become local ICE enforcers in addition to their other jobs. And I think the constituents of Dallas have deserved the right to know if the Dallas Police Department's participating in that program. Yes or no? It's a simple question. And we just want the answer.

Your letter sets a deadline of Aug. 21 to receive a written response from Comeaux. If that doesn't happen, what then?

JOHNSON: Well, we'll certainly take a look at our next steps to see whatever we need to do. I would expect that the police chief would respond to a sitting member of Congress' question about whether or not they're going to engage with federal ICE detention officers. I sit on the Homeland Security Committee, and I think we can subpoena him to our committee if that's where we go. But hopefully he'll just answer my questions, so that the public can get answers to the questions that they've raised.

There was a story in 2023 about former police chief Eddie Garcia, who's now in the running for Fort Worth police chief. He joined Dallas interfaith leaders, did a block walk in largely Latino and Hispanic communities with immigrant populations, and he made a point to reach out to those communities to try to garner trust. With everything happening now in Washington, and with the questions you've raised for Chief Comeaux, are you concerned that the trust that has been built in the past is now starting to go away?

JOHNSON: That's always a concern. You know, one of the strongest deterrents to crime is strong community engagement and strong trusted relationships with the police. You want people to feel safe in reporting crime to the police, you want people feel safe in their interactions with police and notification and that community joint response. We all want a safe community. No one wants dangerous criminals roaming our streets and we need our local police. To have the support of the local community, it makes everyone stronger.

So, you know, just answering questions, letting people know, these are the policies of the police department, this is what we're gonna do and what were not gonna do, just helps provide trust and helps provide information and let everyone know what page he's on, so that everyone is focusing down in the right plane and on the same page. And so I think that hopefully the police chief will answer my questions and we'll see what happens.

I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I do have to ask about redistricting, since it's been such a hot-button issue here in Texas as of late. Obviously, Texas House Democrats have left the state to block the passage of Republican-drawn maps that could give the GOP as many as five new seats in the midterms. You've publicly criticized the president's push for this redistricting. What would you say to Texans who might be impacted by this process, who may be feeling disenfranchised right now?

JOHNSON: Well, you know, unfortunately, Republicans are more concerned about a tweet of Donald Trump than they are about the votes of their voters. And it's really unfortunate that they're doing such a disservice to the communities of Texas. Here in North Texas, they're dismantling Dallas County and Tarrant County, the urban core, and pairing that with rural counties, east, west, and north, and south to try to dilute the urban vote, to dilute the minority vote in direct, overwhelming violation of the Voting Rights Act. So I think folks are outraged. You're seeing Democrats really engage and feeling disenfranchised by Republicans who don't care about their communities and their rights to vote and their rights to select their elected leaders, versus elected leaders selecting their voters.

What are your thoughts on the Democrats leaving the state? And if their efforts don't work, are Democrats in Washington prepared to step in in some way? Or do you see this more as a state's issue?",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/02b0e9e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7540x3959+0+535/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2Ff4%2F27194193464b8e524651c0523e91%2F04012025-dallas-police-chief-candidates-02-kera.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 08:56:38.664308

The organization sent a letter to town officials Friday demanding that Mason leadership halt the contract’s execution.
The town’s separate but related contract with ICE received three ayes, two nays, and two abstentions.
The ACLU also states that because the start date of the contract with CoreCivic is dependent on the start date of the ICE contract, the CoreCivic agreement is also void.
The ICE contract, a 200-page document, was presented to board members as a physical copy immediately before the Tuesday vote, he said, and was not available for public review online until two days later.","The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee is challenging the outcome of a vote in Mason that would enter the city into a detention facility contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The organization sent a letter to town officials Friday demanding that Mason leadership halt the contract’s execution.

The Town of Mason’s Board of Mayor and Aldermen approved a contract with private prison corporation CoreCivic to reopen the West Tennessee Detention Facility as an immigration detention center on Tuesday, voting 4-1 with two abstentions.

The town’s separate but related contract with ICE received three ayes, two nays, and two abstentions.

Questions over the vote’s outcome surfaced immediately after the chaotic meeting concluded. Some officials reported that the vote was successful in approving the ICE contract, claiming the abstentions did not count toward the vote total and therefore the vote passed 3-2, a simple majority of the votes counted (but not the number of members present).

West Tenn. town approves CoreCivic to run immigration detention facility after chaotic meeting

But the ACLU says this is an error, according to the letter sent to the town’s mayor, recorder and an attorney who spoke on behalf of the municipality during Tuesday’s meeting. The organization stated that, according to the town’s charter, the vote should have been counted based on members present. Thus, it would need four votes out of seven total votes to pass.

“The Town of Mason Charter says any form of board action should be passed by a majority of members present if there is a quorum,” ACLU of Tennessee Policy Director Bryan Davidson said Friday. The charter also states that the board can determine its own rules, and has chosen to follow Robert’s Rules of Order.

Based on the charter, state law and Robert’s Rules, the ACLU said the contract was not approved.

“We do not believe that this contract passed, and therefore any action taken by the mayor and board of the Town of Mason to further the execution of this contract is illegal and it’s invalid,” Davidson said.

Mayor Eddie Noeman, City Recorder Lureatha Harris, and attorney Nathan Bicks could not be immediately reached for comment.

The ACLU also states that because the start date of the contract with CoreCivic is dependent on the start date of the ICE contract, the CoreCivic agreement is also void.

ACLU Tennessee Legal Director Stella Yarbrough requested a written response from town leadership within seven days of the letter’s receipt. The organization also included a request for all communication between the mayor and board members and representatives of both CoreCivic and ICE, beginning in November 2024 through present day.

“Zooming out from the procedural deficiencies, there’s a lot of questions here around the total lack of transparency in this process,” Davidson added.

The ICE contract, a 200-page document, was presented to board members as a physical copy immediately before the Tuesday vote, he said, and was not available for public review online until two days later.

The majority of people who spoke at Tuesday’s meeting opposed using the currently empty prison facility as an immigration detention center.

Eloise Thompson, whose family has roots in Mason and surrounding areas going back to the 1870s, was one of the residents to stand in opposition.

“We’re just absolutely not interested in a for-profit prison operation … at the expense of human suffering,” she said on a media call Friday. “Not only does it come down to the human suffering part, it really can eat at one’s soul to feel a part of something like that.”

The community in Mason is interested in economic growth, she said, but “moving forward in the right way and in the way that lifts those around us and lifts our community.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mason004seqn-2048x1219.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 06:56:38.354493

“People have called me the N-word online, they’ve called my wife a b**** and it just keeps getting worse,” said state Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford. He said multiple posts have called for his arrest and some have gone as far as to target his grandparents.

Paris, who has been in office since 2021, on Friday posted an Instagram story saying he had been informed of multiple reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the district he represents. He went on to urge residents “to remain vigilant, stay aware of your surroundings, and, above all, prioritize your safety.”

The story is no longer visible online as Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours.

He also encouraged residents to “look out for one another” and seek out legal and community resources if needed.

The post was soon shared by the X (formerly Twitter) page “Libs of TikTok” which falsely stated he was “doxxing” ICE’s live location and demanded his arrest. Doxxing is the sharing of people’s personal information without their consent, often with malicious intent.

Comments on the post called for Paris to be jailed, advocated vigilante justice and referred to him using racist language and as a DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) politician.

The backlash stepped up when ICE shared the post on the department’s official X page, and also tagged the U.S. Justice Department.

Paris on Sunday said he had been in contact with law enforcement officials, including Attorney General William Tong’s office. In a statement, Tong said federal law enforcement “should know and does know what First Amendment-protected speech is.”

Tong said the implied legal threat was “dangerous, disturbing and unacceptable” and that online harassment and threats against legislators and public servants don’t stop with words.

“We have seen far too much violence and death this year to ignore this kind of reckless rhetoric by federal law enforcement,” Tong said. “Please stop. Before anyone else gets hurt.”

House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, expressed his support for Paris, saying “the message of ‘neighbors looking out for neighbors’ is powerful and not uncommon for an elected official.”

Ritter added “any threats and racist taunts are disgusting” and said those responsible would be held accountable.

Paris said his own situation was mild compared to the fear that undocumented people in the country live with every day, and said he does not regret making the original post.",https://ctnewsjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/corey-paris-jr-20250729-1200x900-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 08:56:47.125164

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles issued her ruling a week after holding a hearing with the federal government and legal advocates representing immigrant children in custody.

Gee called last week’s hearing “déjà vu” after reminding the court of the federal government’s attempt to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement in 2019 under the first Trump administration. She repeated the sentiment in Friday’s order.

“There is nothing new under the sun regarding the facts or the law. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone,” Gee wrote, referring to the government’s appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement.

In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement.

Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.”

Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Tiberius Davis, one of the government attorneys, said the bill gives the government authority to hold families in detention indefinitely. “But currently under the Flores Settlement Agreement, that’s essentially void,” he said last week.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of migrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s.

The agreement set standards for how licensed shelters must provide food, water, adult supervision, emergency medical services, toilets, sinks, temperature control and ventilation. It also limited how long U.S. Customs and Border Protection could detain child immigrants to 72 hours. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services then takes custody of the children.

The Biden administration successfully pushed to partially end the agreement last year. Gee ruled that special court supervision may end when HHS takes custody, but she carved out exceptions for certain types of facilities for children with more acute needs.

In arguing against the Trump administration’s effort to completely end the agreement, advocates said the government was holding children beyond the time limits. In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours. That included 14 children, including toddlers, who were held for over 20 days in April.

The Trump administration opened what it calls the largest federal migrant-detention center in the country’s history in Fort Bliss, Texas, under a $1.2 billion Defense Department contract.

Dubbed “Lone Star Lockup,” the facility holds 1,000 beds with a plan to expand to 5,000 beds by 2027. Inside are legal access and medical treatment areas, and recreational space — amenities that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say make it like a “traditional” facility.

Supporters of the detention center, like Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales, say it will help ease overcrowding at other facilities and serve as a processing hub, sending migrants with final removal orders directly onto ICE air flights back to their home countries.

“Fort Bliss is an amazing military facility,” Gonzales said. “Everything thrown their way, they’ve handled. We should be supporting this, not attacking it.”

The project does have its critics.

“That money will enrich private contractors. Imagine what one billion could do for health care or law enforcement here in El Paso,” Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of Texas said.

The new Fort Bliss facility joins Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz” as the latest migrant detention facility to get pushback. Critics have alleged the facility suffers from flooding, unsanitary conditions, and even deaths.

Officials insist no one has died there and deny reports of worms in food or sewage flooding, asserting that the facility meets federal detention standards.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has already unveiled a second site he’s nicknaming the “Deportation Depot.” The facility is inside a former state prison and staffed in part by the Florida National Guard.

These types of agreements originated in 1989 at the UN Refugee Agency to help humanely address the mass migration out of East Berlin and elsewhere.

The “Refugee Protection and Mixed-Migration: The 10-Point Plan in Action” report discusses the “phenomenon of refugees” who move in “an irregular manner” from countries where they have already found protection and leave to seek asylum and find permanent resettlement in a third country, calling it “a matter of growing concern.” The plan created standards for countries to share the responsibility of aiding refugees in seeking asylum.

While the report addresses why migrants may feel compelled to leave a country they pass through due to a lack of resources, employment, or educational opportunities, it didn’t address how migrants may want to leave due to not being welcomed or a country that can’t handle larger influxes of migrants. In today’s environment, various elements are at play, like regional xenophobia and white nationalism in the U.S., that weren’t major issues in 1989, and now these agreements are being used for a much different purpose: to outsource human rights obligations.

The U.S. began using these agreements after signing a formal SCTA with Canada in 2004. The U.S. later signed more informal “Asylum Cooperative Agreements” with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador that were established in 2019 under the first Trump administration.

A third class action case before the high court is Amgen Inc. et al.","Cases involving class actions that are of interest to risk managers and businesses are front and center for the U.S. Supreme Court session that begins Oct. 1.

Foremost among them is The Standard Fire Insurance Co. v. Greg Knowles, which deals with criteria that determine whether a class action can be moved to federal court from state court as permitted under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005.

Knowles is one of several cases the Supreme Court has accepted that are of interest to risk managers and businesses in general.

In fact, the Supreme Court once again is tackling a considerable business docket after broad issues such as health care reform and immigration reform overshadowed business cases in the last term, Robin S. Conrad, executive vice president of the Washington-based National Chamber Litigation Center, which handles litigation for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said during a court preview late last month.

Ms. Conrad said that as of late September, 48% of the court’s docket consisted of business cases. Since then, the court has agreed to hear an additional business-related case regarding the scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement powers.

But possibly the most closely watched case with risk management implications is Knowles. Under CAFA, the amount in controversy in a class action must be at least $5 million for such a case to be moved to federal court.

Mr. Knowles presented a sworn stipulation that the total damages in his putative class action suit would be less than $5 million. That was disputed by Standard, which argued the stipulation’s language “does not adequately bind plaintiff” and that the total amount will exceed $5 million once attorneys’ fees and costs are included, according to the Dec. 2, 2011, ruling by Judge P.K. Holmes III, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Fort Smith, Ark.

%%BREAK%%

Ruling in the plaintiff’s favor, Judge Holmes said, “The question is whether a plaintiff may meet his burden of proof by stipulating at the time the complaint is filed that he will not seek more than the federal jurisdictional minimum for himself and the putative class.”

In its ruling Jan. 4, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis denied Standard’s request for a rehearing.

Another class action case before the high court, Comcast Corp. et al. v. Caroline Behrend et al., involves the question of whether a trial court can certify class actions before it resolves whether plaintiff expert testimony is admissible.

A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held for Ms. Behrend and the class in the case.

As Dan Himmelfarb, a partner in the Washington office of Mayer Brown L.L.P., put it during a Supreme Court preview at the Washington Legal Foundation last month, the issue is an important one because the “certification stage is really where the action is” in class action cases.

A third class action case before the high court is Amgen Inc. et al. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds. At issue in Amgen, which is a securities case, is whether courts should reject certification for a securities class when the plaintiffs fail to adequately demonstrate that they relied on alleged misrepresentations when they purchased a stock.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held in favor of the retirement plan.

Foreign affairs and business converge in yet another case before the court, Esther Kiobel et al. v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. et al. At issue is whether the Alien Tort Statute of 1789 applies to conduct outside the United States.

During the NCLC briefing, Andrew J. Pincus, a partner in Mayer Brown’s Washington office, said the plaintiffs in the case are taking a broad position that “U.S. courts are open for business” to provide a civil remedy for anyone who is injured anywhere in the world.

The case was brought on behalf of the widow of Barinem Kiobel, a Nigerian activist who was executed in 1995. The plaintiffs allege that Royal Dutch Shell bribed witnesses to give false testimony to a special tribunal that sentenced Mr. Kiobel and others to death.

Lower courts had rejected the plaintiffs’ position, but the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, and held oral arguments in February. A few days later, the court said it was postponing its review until this term, and instructed lawyers on both sides to file new arguments as to whether the Alien Tort Statute allows U.S. courts to permit lawsuits for violations of international law that took place in foreign territory.

The court also will deal with an employment case — Mayetta Vance v. Ball State University et al. — that asks whether the supervisor liability rule under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to workplace harassment by people who oversee and direct a victim’s daily work or whether it is limited to those who have the power to hire, fire, demote or otherwise affect their victim.",https://www.businessinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NEWS06_309309978_AR_-1_0.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 20:56:22.506019

“Despite the US saying we are not accepting Palestinian ‘refugees’ into the United States under the Trump administration,” these people from Gaza were able to travel to the U.S., she said.
Trump has downplayed Loomer’s influence on his administration, but several officials swiftly left or were removed shortly after she publicly criticized them.
Heal Palestine said in a statement Sunday that it was “distressed” by the State Department decision to stop halt visitor visas from Gaza.
“This is a medical treatment program, not a refugee resettlement program,” it said.","A day after conservative activist Laura Loomer, an advisor to President Trump, posted videos on social media of children from Gaza arriving in the U.S. for medical treatment and questioning how they got visas, the State Department said it was halting all visitor visas for people from Gaza pending a review.

The State Department said Saturday the visas would be stopped while it looks into how “a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas” were issued in recent days. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday told “Face the Nation” on CBS that the action came after ”outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it.”

Rubio said that there were “just a small number” of the visas issued to children in need of medical aid but that they were accompanied by adults. The congressional offices reached out with evidence that “some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas,” he asserted, without providing evidence or naming those organizations.

As a result, he said, “we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the process of acquiring those visas.”

Loomer on Friday posted videos on X of children from Gaza arriving this month in San Francisco and Houston for medical treatment with the aid of an organization called Heal Palestine. “Despite the US saying we are not accepting Palestinian ‘refugees’ into the United States under the Trump administration,” these people from Gaza were able to travel to the U.S., she said.

She called it a “national security threat” and asked who signed off on the visas, calling for the person to be fired. She tagged Rubio, Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Trump has downplayed Loomer’s influence on his administration, but several officials swiftly left or were removed shortly after she publicly criticized them.

The State Department on Sunday declined to comment on how many of the visas had been granted and whether the decision to halt visas to people from Gaza had anything to do with Loomer’s posts.

Heal Palestine said in a statement Sunday that it was “distressed” by the State Department decision to stop halt visitor visas from Gaza. The group said it is “an American humanitarian nonprofit organization delivering urgent aid and medical care to children in Palestine.”

A post on the organization’s Facebook page Thursday shows a photo of a boy from the Gaza Strip leaving Egypt and headed to St. Louis for treatment and said he is “our 15th evacuated child arriving in the U.S. in the last two weeks.”

The organization brings “severely injured children” to the U.S. on temporary visas for treatment they can’t get at home, the statement said. After treatment, the children and any family members who accompanied them return to the Middle East, the statement said.

“This is a medical treatment program, not a refugee resettlement program,” it said.

The World Health Organization has repeatedly called for more medical evacuations from Gaza, where Israel’s 22-month war against Hamas has heavily destroyed or damaged much of the territory’s health system.

“More than 14,800 patients still need lifesaving medical care that is not available in Gaza,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday on social media, and called on more countries to offer support.

A WHO description of the medical evacuation process from Gaza published last year explained that the organization submits lists of patients to Israeli authorities for security clearance. It noted that before the war in Gaza began, 50 to 100 patients were leaving the territory daily for medical treatment, and it called for a higher rate of approvals from Israeli authorities.

The United Nations and partners say medicines and basic healthcare supplies are low in Gaza after Israel cut off all aid to the territory of over 2 million people for more than 10 weeks earlier this year.

“Ceasefire! Peace is the best medicine,” Tedros added Wednesday.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2e904d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4067x2135+0+288/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F86%2F1a5b6e6748fbab1b98d0b2d9f7c6%2F23e35d7da9da4c4fb0230be5ed32c882.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 17:56:57.442066

Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin shared a video on X around 5:37 p.m. on Aug. 16. The footage showed masked and unidentified officers who appeared to be ending an arrest. The video caught a confrontation between the officers and bystanders, with one individual saying, “You know you guys are ruining this country, right?” An officer responded, “Liberals already ruined it.”

In her tweet, McLaughlin stated, “What this video doesn’t show is the ICE officer on the ground with a bloody head and concussion due to violent resistance from the illegal alien they were apprehending.”

McLaughlin told 7News that ICE agents identified and arrested Cristian Enrique Carias Torres, a Venezuelan native who entered the U.S. in 2023. Torres allegedly had a final order of removal from an immigration judge issued that year and had multiple outstanding warrants in Maryland related to traffic offenses after failing to appear in court.

In response to the video, McLaughlin said that the officer conducted himself with dignity and did not violate DHS policy despite being taunted during the incident. She also claimed another ICE officer was left with a bloody head and a concussion after Torres allegedly resisted arrest.

United States

WASHINGTON — With additional state National Guard troops deploying to D.C. as untrained federal law enforcement agents perform local police duties in city streets, the American Civil Liberties Union is issuing a stark reminder to all federal and military officials that — no matter what uniform they wear or what authority they claim — they are bound by the U.S. Constitution and all federal and local laws.

Over the weekend, the Trump administration declared that state National Guard troops would be called in to Washington, and the governors of West Virginia, Ohio, and South Carolina announced they are deploying hundreds of their National Guard troops to the nation's capital on top of the 800 D.C. National Guard troops who were already activated by President Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported that in a major shift, these troops may receive orders “to start carrying weapons in the coming days.” National Guard troops are generally not trained in local policing or de-escalation and should never be used for federal immigration purposes.

President Trump has also ordered FBI personnel and other federal officers, who similarly are not trained for local policing, to patrol the city. He earlier promised to let police “do whatever the hell they want” — raising grave concerns about civil rights abuses, particularly for Black, Brown, and unhoused residents.

“Through his manufactured emergency, President Trump is engaging in dangerous political theater to expand his power and sow fear in our communities. Sending heavily armed federal agents and National Guard troops from hundreds of miles away into our nation’s capital is unnecessary, inflammatory, and puts people’s rights at high risk of being violated,” said Hina Shamsi, director of ACLU’s National Security Project. “Governors need to understand that with each order, the Trump administration increases legal and ethical jeopardy for state troops being deployed. No matter what uniform they wear, federal agents and military troops are bound by the Constitution, including our rights to peaceful assembly, freedom of speech, due process, and safeguards against unlawful searches and seizures. If troops or federal agents violate our rights, they must be held accountable.”

On Friday, D.C. sued the administration to block its order asserting federal authority over the city’s police department, saying it violated the Home Rule Act. After a federal court hearing on Friday afternoon, Attorney General Bondi rescinded her most brazen order undermining D.C.’s home rule, thereby allowing the D.C. police commissioner to remain at her post over the D.C. police department.

“The deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops and more federal agents onto D.C. streets is a brazen abuse of power meant to intimidate and create fear in the nation’s capital. This is an unnecessary overstep to micromanage D.C. under a phony emergency, causing real harm to residents and visitors — all to advance the Trump administration’s political agenda.” said Monica Hopkins, executive director of ACLU of D.C. “The ACLU-D.C. will continue to monitor the use of D.C. police and federal law enforcement to ensure that the constitutional rights of our community are protected. We need the nation to join us in the fight for statehood so that D.C. residents are treated like those in every other state and have the same guardrails against federal overreach.”

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Martinez was arrested in connection with a prior DUI.

Newsweek reported Martinez, who is well-known on TikTok for posting videos that document several ICE arrests, was filmed on Friday seated in her Tesla when agents opened her car door and pulled her onto the pavement. She also appeared to experience a medical event during the arrest, and at one point onlookers are heard demanding treatment for her.

The arrest was also briefly interrupted by a man who attempted to tow one of the police cars in the arrest.

“He mocked and videotaped ICE officers chasing after him,” McLaughlin also told Newsweek. “Secretary Noem has been clear: Anyone who seeks to impede law enforcement will be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Martinez was initially transported to White Memorial Hospital and is currently being held in a detention center in downtown Los Angeles.

On Thursday, Los Angeles Rep. Jimmy Gomez accused ICE of staging an empty migrant detention center.

“One person was talking to the Mexican consulate who happened to be there, and the other person was just in the cell with their head down on a table or on the table or something. He was just kind of sitting there,” Gomez said of the center he visited recently.

Gomez also questioned why the center was so empty despite the numerous arrests made recently. Nearly 2,800 people have been taken into ICE custody since early June.

Several Oklahoma City priests report parishioners being detained and deported, some with long-term residency and U.S.-born children.

While acknowledging the right to secure borders, priests express concern over the impact of deportations on families and the targeting of those seeking legal status.

In early summer, as immigration raids were ramping up across the country, Bishop Albert Rojas of the Diocese of San Bernardino granted a dispensation excusing undocumented parishioners in the diocese from attending Mass. The unusual move came out of fear they might be detained by immigration agents if they were in a public gathering like church.

News of the dispensation quickly got back to Little Flower Catholic Church in Oklahoma City, where the Rev. Tim Luschen oversees a heavily Hispanic parish.

The Most Rev. Paul S. Coakley, archbishop of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, has not granted such a dispensation in the archdiocese, which includes parishes across two-thirds of Oklahoma. Luschen said he hasn't seen a noticeable increase in absences at his church. However, he did know that Rojas' action in the wake of the U.S. immigration Enforcement and Customs efforts in California was a topic of conversation at Little Flower, 1125 S. Walker Ave.

Not surprising, Luschen said, because ""people are living on edge.""

""They're afraid.""

Two of his counterparts whose parishes are on the opposite end of the Oklahoma City metro area, shared similar comments.

""I've noticed that the anxiety level among my parishioners has increased,"" said the Rev. Jim Goins, pastor of St. Eugene Catholic Church, who described his church as the most diverse in the archdiocese.

Though neither Goins, Luschen or the Rev. Stephen Hamilton are aware of large numbers of parishioners disappearing from the pews, all three said they have been talking with their parishioners about the boosted ICE efforts occurring across the country.

And, Luschen said he knows of four people from his historic parish in south Oklahoma City who have been detained, including a man who had been in the U.S. for 30 years and whose son is in the military.

Luschen said he also knew of several people who attended the Warr Acres church where he served as pastor who have been detained. The priest said one of them already has been deported to Honduras. Another man from the Warr Acres church was apprehended by ICE, taken from Oklahoma City to Tulsa, and then on to a private prison in Drumright. Luschen said the man had been in the U.S. for 20 years and has four children who were born in America.

""It hurts me,"" he said.

""All you can do is make sure that people know their rights.""

Facing uncertainty

With people from around the world attending Mass, including people from Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Africa, ""it's like the United Nations here"" at St. Eugene, 2400 W. Hefner Road, Goins said. The church has two Spanish Masses and three English Masses each weekend, plus a Swahili Mass once a month, he proudly pointed out.

So, instead of tiptoeing around the subject, Goins said he spoke about the ramped-up immigration enforcement at one of the church's recent Spanish Masses.

""We just talked about how they might feel more vulnerable,"" he said. ""Many of them are unclear about their rights.""

Goins said St. Eugene has a large number of Hispanic parishioners who are in the U.S. legally. However, some of them worry about family members and friends who are undocumented.

""It's causing a lot of stress, particularly for 'mixed-status households,'"" he said.

The priest said he talked about self deportation — but, whether or not they are picked up by ICE or self deport, there is the agony of wondering what happens to their U.S.-born children who are legal citizens.

""They had to make that terrible choice ― it's heartbreaking,"" Goins said. ""I have had many people worry about their children ― 'Will I see them at the end of the day?'""

Both Luschen and Goins said they understand legalities of the situation, but Americans were initially told that the federal government would be concentrating immigration enforcement efforts on getting the most hardened criminals off the streets.

""If you have a criminal record, yes, I want you removed, but the vast majority (of immigrants) are very law abiding,"" Goins said.

He said apprehending and deporting those who have been stuck in the immigration system trying to take the legal route seems ""punitive.""

""In my mind, it's overzealous,"" he said.

""Most of our people have tried and are trying, and most of them have a valid case. There's really no path for them ― it just stretches for years. It's crazy.""

Luschen, at Little Flower, said he's also been told about the choices some parishioners are making, choices Goins described as heartbreaking. He said some people have told him of their plans to self deport, although their children will remain in America.

""The kids are going to stay here,"" he said.

Then, there are the concerns about people being deported to countries that they have never been to.

""No matter what president it is, it doesn't seem to be humane,"" Luschen said. ""This is a new level and new struggles that are really challenging.""

'Complicated and complex'

Hamilton, pastor of St. Monica Catholic Church in Edmond, said attendance at his parish's Spanish Mass has increased from about 225 people when he was first appointed to lead the parish in June of 2012, to between 475 and 550 each weekend now.

The priest said he's proud of the work his parish has done to minister to the Hispanic community, which is a significant part of the universal church.

Thus, he's been well aware of the fear that some parishioners are feeling as ICE's efforts continue.

""I've picked up conversations with people in my own parish and in the larger community that people are scared and unsettled and uncertain,"" he said.

Hamilton said he didn't know of anyone who had been deported and he couldn't say for certain that Mass attendance has dwindled because attendance may decrease in the summer months. The priest said he's not certain who is documented and who is undocumented, but their status is not his first concern.

""Frankly, the church's concern first and foremost, basically, is just human dignity and as a church is to preach the gospel and to proclaim the kingdom of God,"" he said.

The clergy leader said the issues surrounding immigration, border enforcement and deportation are complicated and complex. That's why he thinks people sometimes misunderstand the Catholic Church's position.

""I think it's fair to say that the church supports the country having sovereign borders and that the country does have a right to protect its borders,"" he said.

Having said that, Hamilton said some immigrants have come to the U.S. under policies by previous administrations and the country has a moral responsibility to those people who came under those past conditions.

""We can support border enforcement,"" he said.

""We can support, I think, the arrest and removal of people, who in addition to being here illegally, have committed other criminal acts, but I would say indiscriminate deportation is really not as easily supported by our Catholic social teaching.""","https://www.oklahoman.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/30/NOKL/85442770007-rev-jim-goins-03.JPG?crop=3098,1744,x0,y298&width=3098&height=1744&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-17 13:56:42.912866

The mother of a slain congressional intern killed in a drive-by shooting says the Trump administration is taking her son's death more seriously than the Washington, D.C., Council

The Metropolitan Police Department said Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in D.C. for an internship, was shot June 30 around 10:28 p.m. and died at a hospital July 1. At the time, Tarpinian-Jachym was an intern for Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan.

Several people were seen exiting a car before opening fire, with one of the shots wounding Tarpinian-Jachym. Police said Tarpinian-Jachym wasn't the intended target, adding an adult female and 16-year-old male were injured. The shooting happened in the 1200 block of 7th Street, Northwest, near the Mt Vernon Sq 7th St-Convention Center Metro stop.

MOTHER OF SLAIN CONGRESSIONAL INTERN SAYS DC COUNCIL TREATS VIOLENT CRIME LIKE A 'JOKE' AMID UNSOLVED KILLING

On Monday, President Donald Trump federalized police in Washington, D.C., after a string of high-profile incidents.

Tarpinian-Jachym's mother, Tamara Jachym, told Fox News Digital the Trump administration is taking more steps than the D.C. Council to fix the youth crime wave plaguing the nation's capital.

After the fatal shooting, Trump sent a letter to Jachym, saying he and Melania Trump were ""heartbroken for your entire family.""

""While we may never fully understand the impact that Eric has had during his meaningful life, we know he will be remembered for his kindness, faithfulness, and devotion to your family and his many friends,"" Trump wrote. ""He will also be remembered for his commitment to our country. I know how proud Congressman Estes was to have Eric represent his office, the people of Kansas' Fourth Congressional District, and our Nation.

""Eric will be held in my heart, and I promise never to forget or forgive the terrible act that took him from us. Please know that my Administration will not stop fighting to clean up our streets and ensure law and order. May God hold Eric in His eternal love and care and provide you and your other incredible children, Angela and Jeremy, with abiding peace and unending strength.""

Jachym said ""of course"" the Trump administration is taking her son's death more seriously than the D.C. Council.

""Or [the D.C. Council] would change the laws so 12- to 17-year-olds are booked and charged for crimes and get jail time or juvenile detention,"" Jachym said. ""I am not saying for stealing a pair of shoes, but for serious crimes.

""I believe that something needs to be done because the council is allowing these people to engage in serious crime in D.C., and it's getting worse, not better,"" she added. ""It's serious. And you know if they can't see that this is a serious problem, then we have a serious problem.""

The D.C. Council did not respond to a request for comment.

NBC Washington reported that the number of juveniles arrested in Washington, D.C., has risen every year since 2000, with over 2,000 minors arrested in 2023 and 2024.

In 2024, juveniles made up 51.8% of robbery arrests, according to police, adding that almost 60% of those arrested for carjacking in 2025 are also juveniles.

Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said the uptick in juvenile crime was one reason she helped establish a Juvenile Investigative Response Unit within the agency.

""Recently, we have seen an increase in fights in our schools and more serious criminal offenses outside of our schools,"" Smith said in April. ""And we have seen an increase in juvenile suspects involved in criminal offenses district-wide.""

Jachym said the D.C. City Council needs to go a step further and ensure minors are held accountable for any criminal behavior because, right now, she feels it's a ""crime utopia.""

""I mean, if you're old enough to walk around with a gun and pull a trigger, you're old enough for the consequences,"" Jachym said. ""And these things that the council have in place are not working. Then what's the alternative? Have more people killed, raped, robbed, carjacked? It's just, you know, it's really scary.""

More recently, two juveniles were arrested after allegedly assaulting a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee in Washington, D.C.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has begun detaining people at Fort Bliss as part of its mass deportation campaign. The military base – which has land across El Paso, Texas, and Doña Ana and Otero Counties in New Mexico – will detain up to 5,000 people, making it the country’s largest immigrant detention site. The administration also plans to use at least two more bases to detain and deport people who are immigrants.

The detention camp’s opening is the latest escalation in President Trump’s dystopian agenda to detain and deport millions of immigrants from communities nationwide. The Fort Bliss detention camp, similar to the hastily built detention camp in the Florida Everglades, is a tent facility that will leave detained individuals vulnerable to extreme heat and other harsh conditions. Media reports suggest that the administration is poised to spend $1.26 billion to build the camp. Last month, Congress passed a budget reconciliation bill which will funnel $170 billion to turbocharge deportations and detention.

This expansion marks another shameful chapter in Fort Bliss’ history, as the facility was used to intern German and Italian immigrants and people of Japanese descent during World War II, and later used to detain unaccompanied children in 2016 and from 2021 to 2023, where some were subjected to severe abuse.

The renewed use of this base to detain immigrants and stage deportations comes as the Trump administration continues to misuse military resources to deport long-standing residents and other immigrants and plans to deploy troops to other ICE detention sites around the nation, including at military bases.

Sarah Mehta, deputy director of government affairs, Equality division at the American Civil Liberties Union, issued the following statement in response:

“President Trump’s use of Fort Bliss for the nation’s largest immigrant detention site is cruel and a reminder of a shameful detention legacy. Thousands of people, including our neighbors and loved ones, will be torn from their communities while this administration enlists the military to rubberstamp its abusive agenda.

“Members of Congress must stop the use of the military – including its bases – for the Trump administration’s reckless and wasteful deportation drive.”

The judge said the ban was arguably unlawful on the grounds that it was disproportionate with rights to free speech and protest, and that the home secretary failed to consult Palestine Action or any human rights organisations.

As my barristers argued, the proscription has had a chilling effect on thousands of people across the country. Examples include a former headmaster arrested for displaying a Private Eye cartoon, and protester Laura Murton being accused by police of potentially committing a terror offence by displaying a Palestine flag and a placard that said “Free Gaza”. Even the UN human rights commissioner, Volker Türk, agrees the proscription is “disproportionate and unnecessary”.

For information about how The Observer protects your data, read our Privacy Policy.

The impact on free speech is evident even as I write this piece. I’m given less latitude to counter the home secretary’s claims than she is afforded to advance them. Her decision to proscribe gives her a higher degree of control of the narrative, as many papers will be reluctant, for legal reasons, to publish a piece that may make the readers sympathetic to Palestine Action’s aims. So all I am allowed to say on that is contained within my first witness statement. But I must do at least this. It is important that readers understand our case.

As I explained to the court, Palestine Action “take direct action against Israel’s arms trade in Britain”. We “put our bodies in the way of a military machine perpetrating genocide”. In my view the campaign has been effective, so I believe weapons firms and the Israeli embassy lobbied hard for ministers and police to crack down on Palestine Action.

However, proscribing a domestic direct action group has sparked outrage. So far, more than 700 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for holding signs, while opposition to the ban is growing across the political spectrum. To save face, it seems to me the government has resorted to a smear campaign. Rather than solely litigating the case in the courts, they’re also trying to litigate it in the media, where hard facts are swapped for soundbites.

Their newest claim refers to supposed evidence of “disturbing” plans and ideas. Yvette Cooper failed to reference any such evidence in court ahead of the “permission hearing” to challenge the ban, instead launching the claims on TV. These allegations are not supported by the security assessments disclosed by her own department, and don’t match the facts.

The assessment to proscribe Palestine Action was made in March 2025, but it seems Cooper delayed proscription until the most politically convenient moment. If there were “disturbing plans” and serious concerns of national security, why wait four months?

Even Keir Starmer weighed in, making reference to “Jewish-owned” businesses. The intention seemed to be to imply that Palestine Action was antisemitic. In reality, it targeted dozens of companies associated with Israel’s biggest weapons producer, regardless of the identities of the owners. This fact is known by the government, yet they continue to weaponise antisemitism.

I believe the idea behind the government’s statements is to deliberately mislead the public and parliament. The group was banned due to “serious property damage for a political cause”, not because of racism or alleged violence against people. It is false to claim the organisation had violent intent against people. The home secretary’s own security assessments say the direct action group didn’t advocate violence or pose a threat to life.

Cooper’s attempt to justify her decision by misleading the public shows only what a huge political misstep she has made. Her political career will be marked by the most draconian attack on our civil liberties in a generation.

A petition calls for ICE-free zones.

At-risk people worry any excursions bring risks.

The 9-year-old boy needed medical care.

His mother, an undocumented farmworker who lives in west Ventura County, was too scared to take him to an Oxnard clinic. She worried any excursion outside of her home could mean being detained, deported and separated from her son and his two siblings.

She canceled an appointment for what she described as a “highly important” medical procedure, then canceled a second date for the same treatment.

“I’m afraid they’re going to get me,” she said through an interpreter in a phone interview, declining to give her name. “I’m afraid with everything.”

Advocates with 805 UndocuFund contend more than 400 people in Ventura County have been detained by immigration police so far this year, though U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have provided few numbers.

As enforcement anxieties percolate, driven by actions like the July 10 raid at Glass House Farms near Camarillo, doctors and advocates worry many undocumented people are choosing to stay away from emergency rooms, urgent care centers and medical clinics.

And if they do come, they worry ICE will somehow find them.

“I’ve had two patients in the ER tell me that,” said Dr. Tipu Khan, an addiction medicine specialist at Ventura County Medical Center, the Ventura hospital that serves as a safety net for people with little money, no insurance and other barriers. Delays in care mean patients will become sicker and could ultimately need more treatment.

“This is the only access to care that they may have. They are very medically fragile,” Khan said.

It’s hard to quantify the extent to which fear is keeping people from seeking care in emergency rooms, urgent care centers or clinics.

At the countywide Clinicas del Camino Real health system that also delivers care to underserved populations, visits were once projected to rise by more than 10% in August. Instead, they’re down about 4% over last year largely because of fears of detention and deportation, said CEO Dr. Gagan Pawar.

A surge of enforcement actions across the county in June contributed to cancellations and no-shows too with about 1,800 less visits than June 2024. The system is encouraging people who are afraid to come to clinics to use telehealth options.

“Health care, education and food are not privileges, they are human rights. Those are at stake right now,” Pawar said, contending the fear is affecting medical facilities across the regions. “It’s everywhere. It’s not just us.”

At Ventura County Medical Center in Ventura, visits to the emergency room fell about 9% in June compared to 2024 — 330 visits ― and fell a little more in July, said Dr. John Fankhauser, the hospital's CEO. Numbers regularly fluctuate from month to month.

""It's not atypical,"" he said, noting it's too early to attribute the numbers to fear or any specific cause. He emphasized the hospital's mission is to treat everyone who needs care.

""For us as a hospital, it’s so important to message that we’re here for people,"" he said. ""We’re truly committed to providing care to all comers.""

ER visits for June and July were still slightly higher than 2023 levels, Fankhauser said. Usage for the calendar year so far is higher than last year, partly because of a surge of respiratory and other illnesses in January that packed hospitals across the county.

And while doctors say visits to some countywide clinics fell in the wake of the Glass House raids on July 10, officials said patient interactions in June and July were “comparable” to last year’s levels. The ambulatory care system saw about 31,000 patient visits in June, about 2,000 less than a year earlier, said spokesperson Lydia Collins.

Emergency room visits at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks are also down but the decline appears linked to seasonal trends and not to immigration anxiety, said spokesperson Megan Merino.

Officials at St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard did not respond to questions about the impact of immigration enforcement fears. Dr. Neil Canby, an emergency medicine doctor at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, said ER numbers were actually a little higher than normal in July. Ambulance calls across the county haven't changed significantly, said Steve Carroll, administrator for Ventura County Emergency Medical Services.

'Long-lasting consequences'

Some health care professionals are reluctant to talk publicly about the impact of immigration enforcement on patient visits. But a petition being circulated by doctors and employees in the county health system contends increased immigration enforcement has brought widespread fear.

“We have seen patients cancel appointments, forgo preventive care, and avoid seeking medical attention altogether—out of fear that accessing healthcare could lead to detention or deportation,” the petition reads. “These disruptions to daily life will have long-lasting consequences on both physical and mental health.

The petition calls on county leaders to declare county hospitals, clinics and their parking lots ICE-free zones where immigration enforcement is not allowed without a judicial warrant. The document also calls for posting signs that tell visitors immigration status is never asked about or shared.

“Our goal is a (medical) center without drama,” said Dr. Carlos O’Bryan-Becerra, the family practice physician who initiated the petition. “We want a safe space to focus on healing.”

Collins, Health Care Agency spokeswoman, said the agency has no comment on the petition.

On the day of the Glass House raids on July 10, people injured in protests outside the farms were taken to St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. The patients included a person who had been apprehended by ICE during the protests. Immigration agents came to the hospital to take the person into custody, triggering a large protest outside the hospital.

Khan of VCMC said the incident and reports of immigration enforcement visits to medical facilities or their parking lots elsewhere in California have created more concern among vulnerable patients. The petition circulated at VCMC calls for more training on what to do if ICE agents come to a medical campus.

Fankhauser said he hasn’t heard of any ICE activity at VCMC. Pawar said Clinicas facilities have also not been visited by ICE.

“We are prepared. We have protocol,” Pawar said, noting that warrants will be required from immigration agents.

Judicial warrants are required for immigration authorities to access private areas of hospitals and medical facilities, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

""In general health centers must allow ICE agents in any area where they would allow general members of the public,"" the ACLU said in a factsheet.

Protecting privacy

Hospital officials across the county emphasized they don’t ask people about immigration status and offer care to everyone who comes to their emergency room.

“We remain committed to safeguarding patient privacy, safety and dignity, no matter the patient’s legal status or situation,” Merino said. “We provide care to all patients who come to our facility in accordance with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), while protecting their confidentiality under the HIPAA privacy rule.”

Advocates still worry. Primitiva Hernandez, executive director of 805 UndocuFund, said she’s been told by clinic leaders in Ventura that more people who have made appointments for care simply don’t show up. She worries too about low-income people who bypass government health insurance because of reports that the federal government disclosed personal Medicaid information with ICE.

“It’s difficult to say if any place is safe at this point the way federal immingration enforcement is being carried out,” Hernandez said. “We take it day by day.”

Ryan Drury works with health care professionals who have joined the VC Defensa organization that monitors immigration enforcement and advocates for undocumented people. He said some people injured in the Glass House raids didn’t seek medical care because of fear they would be detained.

Martita Martinez-Bravo, executive director of Friends of Fieldworkers, worries about farmworkers and others who can’t sleep because of nightmares or have other mental health trauma but are afraid to reach out for treatment. She noted many people are afraid to send their kids to school or to leave home for any reason.

“People are not even going to the grocery store,” she said. “People are afraid to go to the laundromat.”

Doctors said people who don’t seek care will get sicker. They worry about people who bypass vaccinations at a time when measles risks are rising. Some said safety net systems designed to serve all comers now face a barrier in the form of immigration enforcement fear.

“We’re feeling a little bit helpless,” O’Bryan-Becerra said.

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police. The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

The attorney general’s new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi’s earlier directive. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

In a social media post Friday evening, Bondi criticized D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, saying he “continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety.” But she added, “We remain committed to working closely with Mayor Bowser.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office said late Friday that it was still evaluating how it can comply with the new Bondi order on immigration enforcement operations. The police department already eased some restrictions on cooperating with federal officials facilitating Trump’s mass-deportation campaign but reaffirmed that it would follow the district’s sanctuary city laws.

In a letter sent Friday night to D.C. citizens, Bowser wrote: “It has been an unsettling and unprecedented week in our city. Over the course of a week, the surge in federal law enforcement across D.C. has created waves of anxiety.”

She added that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now,” but added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy – even when we don’t have full access to it.”

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department largely under the control of the Republican president’s administration. Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

A push for compromise

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district’s lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden. The judge pushed the two sides to make a compromise.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Meanwhile, advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they’re still parsing the legal aspects of the policies.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,” Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they’ve seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Friday night along the district’s U Street, a popular nightlife corridor, an Associated Press photographer saw officers from the FBI, the DEA, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Park Police, U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!”

Prof. Bheki Mngomezulu

The issue of undocumented migrants in South Africa has caused a stir across various sectors. While some call for their immediate deportation because they deplete the country’s resources at the expense of the nationals, others – including some NGOs – plead on their behalf. They even invoke certain clauses of the Freedom Charter and sections of the country’s constitution to strengthen their argument on why these undocumented migrants should be allowed to stay in this country.

The main question that begs for attention is: where does one draw the line between addressing the challenge of undocumented migrants and upholding human rights? Another question becomes: should the rights of these undocumented migrants supersede those of South African citizens? These are very critical questions. To answer them properly, one must cogently interpret both the Freedom Charter and the Constitution.

Clause five of the Freedom Charter states that ‘all shall be equal before the law.’ Clause 6 states that ‘all shall enjoy equal human rights.’

The reality is that when the Freedom Charter was adopted in Kliptown, Soweto, on June 26, 1955, it did not envision a South Africa that people from outside the country would populate. In that sense, the “all” in both clauses did not refer to foreign nationals. Therefore, if these undocumented migrants were to be allowed to live in South Africa, it would be for other reasons, not because of the Freedom Charter.

Some cite different sections of the Constitution to make a case for these undocumented migrants, especially Chapter 2 on the Bill of Rights. Sec 25 states that “everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing.” Section 27 states that everyone has the right to basic education.

While these sections are relevant to the debate, it is Section 27 that has triggered a serious debate. Sub-section 1(a) states that “everyone has the right to have access to health care services, including reproductive healthcare.”

Some South Africans complain that they are unable to access health care services because they compete with undocumented migrants. It was for this reason that members of Operation Dudula were arrested for checking patients’ identity documents to ascertain if they were South Africans. Others criticise these undocumented migrants for taking their jobs. Whether this is true or not varies from one case to another.

This debate leads us to a broader discussion that we must focus on. In this regard, there are five questions to ruminate about.

Firstly, what role has our government played in creating this situation? For example, had they protected the country’s borders like other countries do, would this problem have arisen?

Secondly, to what extent are the home governments of these undocumented migrants to blame for many of the challenges South Africa is wrestling with? In other words, had these governments ensured political and economic stability in their countries, would these undocumented migrants have come to South Africa?

Thirdly, what role do NGOs play in sustaining this challenge? Do they assist the government on how to address the challenge, or do they use the desperation of these undocumented migrants to make themselves relevant and score cheap points?

Fourthly, how does the international community contribute to the sustenance of this challenge about undocumented migrants? Do they share their experiences with the South African government, or do they use these migrants for political expediency?

Fifthly, what is the way out of this dilemma? In other words, should South Africa simply learn to live with this challenge, or should a solution be found? If the latter is the case, how should the process unfold, and who should be the role-players?

On the first question, our government is to blame for the current situation. The country’s borders are porous. Corruption has become ‘normal’. Some argue that they were in exile in the countries where the undocumented migrants come from. While this statement is factually correct, it is analytically flawed. They lived in camps, were known to the authorities, respected the laws of those countries, and many of them did not compete for jobs with the citizens of their host countries.

On the second question, the home governments of these undocumented migrants are to blame. They created economic and political conditions not conducive to their citizens. As such, some had to find their way out to look for greener pastures in South Africa.

Regarding the third question, NGOs are not a homogeneous group. Some are doing a good job in filling the gaps where the government has failed. Others advance the interests of foreign governments that want to see South Africa fail. They do so under the guise of helping the needy. They take the side of undocumented migrants to paint the country in a bad light.

The fourth question is related to the third one. Some foreign governments are vocal whenever South Africa acts against undocumented migrants. Ironically, they are very tough in their own countries. In that sense, the fate of these undocumented migrants is used to tarnish South Africa’s global image while scoring cheap political points.

The fifth question is the most important. The South African government should demonstrate leadership. This includes teaching South Africans the correct interpretation of the Freedom Charter and the Constitution. Where the constitution has loopholes, these should be filled through constitutional amendments.

The government does not have all the solutions. Instead of claiming the ‘omniscient narrator’ status, politicians should solicit the views of other South Africans – including academics who conduct research and draw lessons from other countries through comparative analyses. Some ordinary South Africans could also proffer ideas on how this situation could be addressed.

Instead of labelling concerns about undocumented migrants as ‘xenophobia’ or ‘Afrophobia’, it is important to approach this issue objectively. Documented migrants and asylum seekers are not the problem. They can be accounted for. They officially contribute to the country’s economy. However, this is not the case with undocumented migrants.

South Africa’s laws should not be used for political expediency!

On Aug. 6, a woman was taken into custody outside Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista.","A federal official on Saturday said a man arrested by ICE two days ago had allegedly been using an unauthorized social security number.

The public learned of the arrest outside Linda Vista Elementary School when San Diego schools superintendent Fabiola Bagula held a news conference Friday to reassure the community about the off-campus arrest.

In a emailed statement from the San Diego field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin of the Department of Homeland Security described the man as an undocumented immigrant who “was fraudulently using an American’s social security number.”

Officers approached him “after he pulled over in a parking lot” on Thursday. ICE arrested him and placed him in removal proceedings, she said.

Other elements of McLaughlin’s statement run counter to those made by Bagula at her news conference.

ICE’s statement opens with the line “allegations that ICE targeted Linda Vista Elementary School are FALSE. ICE was NEVER on school grounds.’

Bagula didn’t say ICE officers were on campus. She specifically explained that the arrest “didn’t happen on school grounds, but it happened close enough to our community to feel its impact.”

That means, the superintendent said, that it “happened to an entire school community.” She also called out ICE officers for their use of masks.

McLaughlin’s statement concluded with this: “Any smears that ICE targeted an elementary school are contributing to the 1000% increase in assaults against our brave ICE law enforcement.”

Those numbers remain in dispute – yet the estimates are rapidly increasing. In June, federal officials said that there has been a 500% increase in alleged assaults of ICE officers since the beginning of the year, according to Rolling Stone. In that report, however, Homeland Security did not release actual assault numbers.

By July, federal agencies on up to the White House – the Trump administration blamed Democrats – were citing a 700% percent rise in alleged assaults on ICE.

Immigration arrests have skyrocketed since President Donald Trump took office in January. The administration often repeats that it is going after the “worst of the worst” criminal offenders, but in a new report, the Marshall Project, which covers criminal justice, found that of those immigrants deported between January and May, just around 12% had been convicted of a crime that was” “either violent or potentially violent.”

To date, ICE has targeted workplaces and public spaces where undocumented workers are thought to gather. The area around schools could be a new front for immigration officers.

The Linda Vista ICE arrest was the second at a San Diego-area elementary school in eight days. On Aug. 6, a woman was taken into custody outside Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista.

The 52-year-old Peruvian asylum-seeker held a valid work permit, paid his taxes, maintained health insurance and had no criminal record. That wasn’t good enough for the Trump administration.

During a routine check-in at an immigration office in July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Vega and now threaten to deport him. Vega is another victim of a broken immigration and asylum system that needs common sense reform.

ICE is reportedly holding Vega in a detention center in Arizona. He is hundreds of miles from his fiancee, his friends and his support network.

If someone who did everything by the book can be arrested and deported, it sends a chilling message to the entire immigrant community. Even those who committed no crime live in fear that masked federal agents could throw them into a van and drive them away at any time.

This harsh enforcement strategy is disruptive not just for families but also for businesses in the North Bay and beyond. The agricultural, hospitality and construction industries rely on immigrant workforces. They now struggle to find workers, and the entire regional economy suffers. In some cases, farmers have left food to rot in fields.

During his presidential campaign last year, Donald Trump talked about targeting immigrants with criminal records. If his administration had done so, he might have broad public support. Instead, 71% of detainees have no criminal record. ICE is sweeping up the sorts of immigrants that most Americans want to keep: longtime residents with jobs, families and community ties. Vega is one of them.

The nation needs comprehensive immigration reform that secures the border and reforms asylum processing but also opens more pathways to legal entry and creates options for permanent legal status.

In 2024, a bipartisan Senate package proposed the most significant immigration reforms in three decades. It combined enhanced border security with updated asylum processing. Republican leaders in Congress supported the changes, some of which could have affected Vega’s case.

Trump opposed those reforms, not because they were bad policy but because he didn’t want the issue taken off the table during the campaign. To their great shame, congressional Republicans obeyed.

The recently introduced Dignity Act (H.R. 4393), which has bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, offers them a second chance. It would provide a path to permanent legal status — although not citizenship — for many undocumented immigrants who arrived prior to 2021, something many Democrats support.

The legislation also would overhaul the asylum system, mandate national E-Verify by employers and create new criminal penalties for some immigration violations, all things that Republicans support. Critically, fees paid by participants would fund it all, not taxpayers.

The Dignity Act might not be the comprehensive compromise that the nation needs, but it would take huge steps to address an immigration crisis that entangles people like Vega. With Trump now in the White House and ever eager to take credit for a successful bill, maybe it has a chance of moving the United States closer to overdue immigration reform.

The anchor rally for the nationwide “Fight the Trump Takeover” protests was held in Austin, Texas, where Republicans in the state are poised to become the first in the nation to redraw their maps at the president’s behest.

Progressives in the Lone Star State capital rallied against Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for breaking with historical precedent by carrying out congressional redistricting in the middle of the decade. Independent experts have estimated that the Texas gerrymandering alone could yield the GOP five additional seats in the US House of Representatives.

Speaking before a boisterous crowd of thousands of people, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) charged that the Texas GOP was drawing up “districts set up to elect a Trump minion” in next year’s midterms. However, Doggett also said that progressives should still try to compete in these districts, whose residents voted for Trump in the 2024 election but who also have histories of supporting Democratic candidates.

“Next year, [Trump is] not going to be on the ballot to draw the MAGA vote,” said Doggett. “Is there anyone here who believes that we ought to abandon any of these redrawn districts and surrender them to Trump?”

Leonard Aguilar, the secretary-treasurer of Texas AFL-CIO, attacked Abbott for doing the president’s bidding even as people in central Texas are still struggling in the aftermath of the deadly floods last month that killed at least 136 people.

“It’s time for Gov. Abbott to cut the bullshit,” he said. “We need help now but he’s working at the behest of the president, on behalf of Trump … He’s letting Trump take over Texas!”

Aguilar also speculated that Trump is fixated on having Texas redraw its maps because he “knows he’s in trouble and he wants to change the rules midstream.”

Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas) went through a litany of grievances against Trump and the Republican Party, ranging from the Texas redistricting plan, to hardline immigration policies, to the massive GOP budget package passed last month that is projected to kick 17 million Americans off of Medicaid.

However, Casar also said that he felt hope watching how people in Austin were fighting back against Trump and his policies.

“I’m proud that our city is fighting,” he said. “I’m proud of the grit that we have even when the odds are stacked against us. The only answer to oligarchy is organization.”

Casar went on to accuse Trump and Republicans or “trying to pull off the most corrupt bargain I’ve ever seen,” and then added that “as they try to kick us off our healthcare, as they try to rig this election, we’re not going to let them!”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229634173-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 08:56:47.356514

After the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department located the subject at a residence and briefly had him in custody, he was set free.","Local police in California were caught in a crossfire of conflicting accounts between border patrol agents linked to ICE, who claimed a driver hit them, and the driver calling 9-1-1 that a group of masked men shot at his car.

What they're saying:

The San Bernardino Police Department responded to a call of a shooting near Acacia Avenue and Baseline Street a little after 8:45 a.m. on Saturday, August 16. Upon arrival, federal agents tied to ICE told San Bernardino PD that an officer-involved shooting broke out and the man they were looking for had drove off from the scene.

A little after the police spoke with the federal agents, the driver wanted by ICE had called 9-1-1 saying a group of masked men tried to get him to pull over, broke his car window and shot at him.

The driver told 9-1-1 he did not know who they were and was looking to get help from the police. An organization called Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice shared a video believed to be of the San Bernardino incident on social media. The video showed a driver and at least two passengers refusing to get out of a car and a CBP agent smashing the car's window, prompting the driver to take off from the scene.

As local police in San Bernardino heard both sides of the incident – federal agents and the driver wanted by ICE – SBPD officers found the car tied to the driver in the 1000 block of Mt. View Drive.

At the time of the car being found, SBPD got a hold of the driver, but left the scene without an arrest because it was not formally known what the driver was wanted for.

Around 1:15 p.m., federal officials called SBPD asking for help in addressing a large crowd. SBPD was told that federal agents tied to ICE had tried to arrest the driver for alleged assault on a federal officer. In a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security, the driver was accused of hitting two Border Patrol officers with his car.

The Department of Homeland Security added in the same statement that the driver was briefly taken into custody before letting him go.

San Bernardino Police Department said it responded to that scene for crowd control purposes, not necessarily to go out and arrest the man for immigration reasons.

Below is a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security:

""During a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino, CBP officers were injured during a vehicle stop when a subject refused to exit his vehicle and tried to run them down.

In the course of the incident the suspect drove his car at the officers and struck two CBP officers with his vehicle. Because of the subjects forcing a CBP officer to discharge his firearm in self-defense. The subject escaped the scene.

After the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department located the subject at a residence and briefly had him in custody, he was set free. This decision was made despite the subject refusing to comply and wounding two officers — another terrible example of California’s pro-sanctuary policies in action that shield criminals instead of protecting communities.""

What we don't know:

The cause of the shooting remains under investigation.

Officials have not released the identity of the driver wanted for allegedly assaulting a federal agent. As of 8 p.m. Saturday, no videos were released by federal officials showing the driver allegedly running CBP officers over.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.foxla.com/www.foxla.com/content/uploads/2025/08/1280/720/generic-web-main-3-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-08-17 07:56:28.275917

As a result of the firing, immigration courts are now down to 600 immigration judges out of the 800 authorized by EOIR.
The rise in detentions at the country's immigration courts has mobilized immigration advocates to camp out in front of San Francisco's immigration courthouse to keep an eye out for ICE agents.","SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- As the Trump administration looks to increase the number of deportations of undocumented immigrants, a new battle has opened inside the nation's immigration courts.

Immigration judges and lawyers are being targeted for following established procedures.

""I think there is a valid fear among the immigration community of attorneys and legal service providers that we are putting ourselves at risk, putting our careers at risk, our license at risk if we're too vocal about the work that we do,"" said Millie Atkinson of the San Francisco Bar Association's Immigrant Legal Defense Program.

The fear intensified in March when President Donald Trump issued an executive order that accused immigration lawyers of coaching their clients to lie in asylum petitions.

The president then directed the U.S. Attorney General to identify misconduct ""such as filing frivolous litigation or engaging in fraudulent practices"" and sanction attorneys who ""violate professional conduct rules.""

""The language in that executive order was very threatening, that by helping someone apply for asylum we're violating our ethical rules as attorneys and that we will be investigated and could be charged and lose our licenses if we continue to help people seeking asylum,"" said former immigration judge Ilyce Shugall.

Shugall was an immigration judge between 2017 to 2019. She resigned after then Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented case quotas during the first Trump administration.

""The executive order is written in such a way that it suggests that even attorneys who are acting as zealous advocates to help individuals pursue relief and are presenting truthful claims may be targeted for their zealous advocacy,"" said Shugall, who is now the managing attorney at Immigrant Legal Defense.

She expressed concern about the large number of people being arrested in immigration courts since Trump began his second term.

Shugall said many of those being targeted were allowed to enter the country under humanitarian parole when large caravans of migrants were flooding the border with Mexico during the last two years of Biden's presidency. These migrants were then able to asylum. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates 2.8 million immigrants were granted humanitarian parole.

Trump ended that program in January, exposing these migrants to deportation if Department of Homeland Security lawyers can convince immigration judges to close their cases.

""DHS is moving to dismiss the removal proceedings so that DHS can pursue something called expedited removal,"" Shugall said..

Immigrants put into expedited removal can still present an asylum claim with the Department of Homeland Security, but it has to be done while they are in detention, where they don't have the same protections they have in immigration court. If DHS denies their claim they can be deported immediately.

""Representation matters in terms of individuals being granted relief. So by putting them into detention, it reduces the likelihood of representation and reduces the likelihood of being granted relief,"" Shugall said.

There's been an ongoing purge of immigration judges since Trump took office.

On Inauguration Day, the Justice Department fired the acting head of the immigration court system and three top officials. Since then, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired.

Many were hired in the past two years and were still in their probationary period, but others -- like Jennifer Peyton, who oversaw Chicago's immigration court as assistant chief judge -- were also fired with no reason given. She got a three sentence email from Sirce Owen, acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), that simply stated ""your removal is effective today.""

EOIR, which oversees the nation's immigration courts, has declined to comment on the firings.

Immigration judges are different than criminal court judges. They are not appointed or elected. They're civil servants and can be fired like other federal employees. In San Francisco, four judges have been fired in the past three months.

A review of Tracreports, a website run by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, shows several of those fired were approving more than 90% of asylum cases. For comparison, just 4% of asylum seekers are being approved at Adelanto ICE Detention Center in San Bernardino County. Immigration judges have gotten policy memos pressuring them to reject more asylum cases.

""They can't flat out say if you don't do this, you will get fired. But it kind of puts pressure on the judges, knowing if they don't follow the advice in that memo, they might be putting themselves at risk for being fired or being targeted or being reassigned,"" Atkinson said.

As a result of the firing, immigration courts are now down to 600 immigration judges out of the 800 authorized by EOIR. It's expected the judges that will be hired will be more focused on the Trump administration's goals.

The rise in detentions at the country's immigration courts has mobilized immigration advocates to camp out in front of San Francisco's immigration courthouse to keep an eye out for ICE agents.

""We're doing protective presence at the immigration court. The idea is that if enough people are here, ICE won't bother abducting people out of the communities,"" said one demonstrator who did not want to be identified.

The activists hand out informational leaflets and offer to accompany immigrants to their appointments. Others are regularly going inside immigration courtrooms to watch over the proceedings and recording people's names and relevant information in case they get detained.

""Immigration courts are open to the public, and it's very important that we have observers there to make sure that due process is being followed and that the immigrants are aware of their rights,"" said Eric Leenson, who co-founded the Friends of La Peña Immigrant Rights Committee.

He said he has seen teenagers without a lawyer attend hearings and forced to make decisions about their asylum case.

Leenson said court watchers are also attending hearings in case ICE agents try to detain someone.

""We like to have more people there in case someone needs to go outside the room to accompany an immigrant out, and then we like to have more people there in case there is an incident in which someone does feel intimidated,"" Leenson said.

Detentions in the hallways of immigration court have become contentious.

In June, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was arrested while trying to hold onto a person being detained by immigration agents.

Despite the risk, more than 100 people turned out recently for a court observer training at La Peña in Berkeley.

""It's important to kind of follow people's whereabouts, because once they're picked up, they get lost in the system. And if we know who they were and what time they were picked, it's much easier subsequently to follow them within the system to look out for their rights,"" Leenson said.

Court observers noted that since the courthouse arrests began there's been an increase in the number of immigrants who are too afraid to show up for a hearing.

""There are a lot of no shows now. People are really scared,"" said one observer.

Immigrants who don't show up for an appointment could have their case dismissed, making them immediately deportable.

""If you don't show up, you basically abandon any claim that you have to stay in the United States legally,"" Atkinson said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17504097_AP_IMMIGRATIONCOURT.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-17 01:56:57.507222

You have to pass, no matter what, by the immigration agents.
Court accompaniment is an expression of faith, Contreras said.","San Diego Auxiliary Bishop Felipe Pulido noticed the way a father held his young daughter and stood close to his wife and teenage daughter in the courtroom. The love and care they had for each other was palpable on Tuesday (Aug. 12), when Pulido accompanied the asylum-seeking family for an immigration court hearing.

“As an immigrant, I got emotional because of that connection I have with my own family — I put myself in his shoes,” said the Catholic bishop, who was born in the Mexican state of Michoacán before immigrating to Yakima Valley in Washington as a teenager. He finished high school there, worked picking produce and eventually was ordained a priest.

Immigrants are facing court appointments with newly heightened levels of fear as the Trump administration has begun sending agents to detain migrants as they leave the courtroom. If immigration judges dismiss their cases, they can immediately face expedited removal proceedings without a chance to make their case for asylum. Previously, a 10-day response time to the dismissal was allowed.

Guided by their faith, clergy like Pulido and other representatives from religious groups are accompanying immigrants to court appointments to provide comfort and information and, in cases where their worst fears are realized, to pick up the pieces of a shattered American dream.

The Rev. Noel Andersen, national field director at Church World Service who is ordained in the United Church of Christ, holds a weekly call on faith-based court accompaniment. He told RNS that through accompaniment, “Faith leaders bear witness and speak out against the ways masked ICE agents are abducting our community members.” Accompaniment is taking place “in every major city and in some rural areas, just about everywhere there is an immigration court,” he said.

When it was time to leave their San Diego hearing, Pulido said, the family saw half a dozen United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and the mother told him she was scared. The bishop stuck close to the family, talking and reassuring them as they walked by the agents, he said. The judge had given them another hearing in December.

Pulido was present because the San Diego Catholic Church has partnered with Episcopal, Lutheran, Jewish and Muslim clergy, as well as lay people, to provide accompaniment for immigrants at the courthouse every day in August. They have more than 50 volunteers, and as more sign up, they’re planning to continue the ministry.

It was only when they’d gotten through the ordeal safely that the family asked Pulido which church he was with. The Catholic family were stunned to learn a bishop had accompanied them that day, he said.

Pulido said he was inspired by Pope Francis’ words last year when he attended “baby bishop camp,” an orientation for new bishops in Rome, to get involved in the court accompaniment ministry. “Be a sign of hope for the homeless, for the migrants, for those who are in prison,” he recalled Francis saying.

He said he believes sometimes ICE agents choose not to detain migrants even after their cases are dismissed because his priests are walking with them, though they have also witnessed detentions.

Pulido isn’t the only Catholic bishop who has gone to immigration court. In Orange County, where priests and deacons are also accompanying the faithful in immigration court, Bishop Kevin Vann attended the July bond hearing of Narciso Barranco, an immigrant without legal status and father of three U.S. Marines who was filmed being beaten in the head by immigration agents during his June arrest.

El Paso, Texas, Bishop Mark Seitz was also in immigration court on Tuesday, said Scalabrinian Sr. Leticia Gutiérrez, the director of the diocese’s migrant hospitality ministry.

Seitz witnessed the detention of three people — “the sobbing, the anguish of the wife of one of them,” said Gutiérrez in Spanish. Seitz told her, “I saw Jesus walking through the hallway, sister, defenseless.”

Gutiérrez, who has organized a precise system for the diocese’s immigration court accompaniment in the last two months, arrives at immigration court at exactly 7:50 a.m., four days a week, and stays until the final cases have concluded.

Before ICE agents arrive (about 20 minutes after she does), Gutiérrez and a priest who is a retired immigration lawyer introduce themselves to migrants arriving for court and provide them basic legal advice and information — and try to sit with them in their anxiety.

While some of the diocesan team members observe the court sessions, ICE agents have also allowed them a protected zone in the waiting room, so when immigrants leave their court appointments, Gutiérrez helps them arrange their affairs, sometimes taking up to 30 to 40 minutes before they walk toward the agents. She encourages them to call their families one last time and share their Alien Registration Number, and then to write phone numbers on their bodies so they can call family if they’re detained.

If they’re willing to share personal information and their keys, she offers to let their family know if they’re detained, send another team to visit them in detention, connect them with a lawyer when available and move their vehicle so it doesn’t incur fines before their family can pick it up.

Many people are in shock when judges dismiss their cases, Gutiérrez said. “It’s incomprehensible for many of them, who say, ‘I paid taxes. I already have an apartment. I have a car … why are they going to detain me?’”

At that point, Gutiérrez said, “There really is no escape. You have to pass, no matter what, by the immigration agents. So it’s like Jesus, who goes directly to the cross.”

In Los Angeles, Isaac Cuevas, director of immigration and public affairs for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, has trained about 180 priests, deacons and religious sisters in court accompaniment. While they make an effort to match parishioners who request accompaniment for immigration court with someone who has gone through the program, the vowed religious largely create their own schedules for going to courts in the area.

“If people are in need, then we try to come forward and answer that call however possible,” said Cuevas, emphasizing that they do so not by civil disobedience, but through prayer, solidarity and recommendations to seek legal advice.

In Arizona, Alicia Contreras, executive director of Corazón AZ, part of the grassroots multi-faith Faith in Action federation, said faith leaders in the state attend immigration court when community members request accompaniment. It is part of the group’s broader work, including know-your-rights and family defense planning, when a family makes plans for children, pets and bills in the event of a crisis. Corazón AZ has partnered with Puente, another Phoenix organizing group that maintains a more regular presence at the courthouse.

Corazón AZ has sent Disciples of Christ, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Catholics, Unitarian Universalists and volunteers without a specific tradition to the courthouse. The majority have been lay people.

“If I can offer a word of prayer, if I have brought folks a rosary or just sat with them, give them a gentle touch on their back, a hug when they need it, this goes a long way to calm the nerves,” Contreras said. She reminds immigrants to breathe. “We are not in control of a lot, but we are in control of our breathing.”

Fear can also cause immigrants to “black out” during their hearings, leaving them unable to remember what happened, Contreras said, explaining that faith leaders can help explain what happened afterward. In the worst cases, fear can lead community members to skip their court dates, a guaranteed way to enter deportation proceedings, she said.

Court accompaniment is an expression of faith, Contreras said.

“I know that their higher power, or in my faith tradition, God, does not want this for them,” said Contreras, a Catholic. “God is not putting the barriers, and God also is not wanting us to look away.”",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-08/NCR5.png?h=71976bb4&itok=cYy-Fb6S,N,,2025-08-17 01:56:46.924457

Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants.","WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District's police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement ""notwithstanding"" city law.

Bondi's new order Friday came after officials in the nation's capital sued to block President Donald Trump's takeover of the Washington police. On Thursday night. his administration escalated its intervention into the city's law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department.

The attorney general's new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi's earlier directive that sought to put the police force under the full control of the federal government. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

The District of Columbia's police chief said Trump's earlier move to sideline her would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. ""In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,"" Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing.

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department under the control of the Republican president's administration that exists in its midst. Trump's takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city -- from the streets to the legal system -- suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city's immigration and policing policies, the district's right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

After a court hearing on the district's request for a temporary restraining order against sidelining Smith, the Trump administration and city officials reached the temporary.

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn't grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

""The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can't control,"" said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.

The judge asked the two sides to hammer out a compromise, and promised to issue a court order temporarily blocking the administration from naming a new chief if they couldn't agree.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said in court that the move to sideline Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

Washington officials were pushing in court to halt U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi's order Thursday to put the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of Washington police.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city's homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation's capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city's police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he'd seek to extend it.

CHIEF HAD AGREED TO SHARE IMMIGRATION INFORMATION

Bondi's directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued practice of ""sanctuary policies,"" which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, Bondi said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media ""there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.""

Meanwhile, immigrant advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond to the new policies. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they're still parsing the legal aspects of the policies.

""Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,"" Sanai said. ""But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.""

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation's capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they've seen a ""really significant change,"" she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity ""is receiving calls almost off the hook.""

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested ""several"" people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

RESIDENTS ARE SEEING A SIGNIFICANT SHOW OF FORCE

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world's most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments -- to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters for a rally, chanting ""Protect home rule!"" and waving signs saying ""Resist!""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/08/16/210829727_210829727-c5bdfae541224245a1b8d9f8b44ae2f2_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-08-17 01:56:31.852504

The tense standoff between the Trump White House and the District of Columbia reached a critical juncture this week. Facing an imminent restraining order, the administration abruptly scaled back its unprecedented attempt to seize direct operational control of Washington D.C.’s police force, marking a significant, though incomplete, victory for local autonomy.

DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit on August 15th challenging the administration’s move, arguing it illegally usurped the District’s authority. The situation escalated rapidly, drawing public criticism from DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and Police Chief Pamela Smith, who questioned the legality of White House orders forbidding police action without federal permission.

How Did DC Challenge the Trump Police Takeover?

The legal showdown reached a boiling point in court. As reported by The Guardian (August 16, 2025), U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes made her skepticism of the administration’s position abundantly clear during a hearing. Faced with Schwalb’s arguments for a restraining order, Judge Reyes directly challenged Justice Department lawyers: “I still do not understand on what basis the president, through the attorney general, through Mr. Cole, can say: ‘You, police department, can’t do anything unless I say you can.’”

Facing the near-certainty of an adverse judicial ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi swiftly issued a revised directive. The initial plan, placing Drug Enforcement Administration head Terry Cole directly at the helm of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), was retracted. The new order states Cole will only direct Mayor Bowser “to provide such services of the Metropolitan Police Department as the attorney general deems necessary and appropriate.” This represents a significant, albeit partial, rollback of the attempted federal takeover.

What Sparked the Federal-Local Conflict?

The Trump administration justified its intervention by labeling Washington D.C. as “crime-ridden,” a claim starkly contradicted by official data showing crime at record lows. President Trump had vowed on Truth Social to reverse the perceived crime wave. However, the administration’s strategy quickly morphed into a broader clampdown on immigration, flooding DC streets with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel, sometimes with chaotic results.

A core casualty was DC’s status as a sanctuary city. Previously, like Newark, New Jersey, DC generally limited cooperation with federal immigration enforcement unless an individual was implicated in a serious crime. The Trump administration’s orders effectively dismantled this policy. Under the new regime, routine interactions, like traffic stops, could potentially escalate into immigration checks and deportations, fundamentally altering the relationship between local law enforcement and immigrant communities.

What Does This Legal Win Mean for DC’s Future?

While the court’s pressure forced a retreat on direct operational control, the victory for DC remains partial. The city has lost its sanctuary city designation. Federal influence over policing priorities, particularly concerning immigration enforcement, remains significantly heightened. Chief Smith has assured the White House of continued information sharing with federal agencies.

The confrontation underscores a critical boundary. Judge Reyes’ intervention demonstrates that even a president asserting broad authority faces limits when attempting to directly commandeer local police functions without clear legal justification. However, the underlying policy shift driven by the White House – the end of DC’s sanctuary status and the increased federal role in local law enforcement – largely persists. The legal battle may have paused the most extreme power grab, but the fundamental conflict over jurisdiction and policy continues.

This partial win proves citizens and local leaders can push back against federal overreach, preserving essential checks on power even amid sweeping political agendas.

Must Know

1. What was the Trump administration’s initial goal with the DC police?

The administration cited reducing crime as the primary reason, claiming DC was “crime-ridden” despite data showing record low crime rates. The strategy quickly expanded into a major immigration enforcement operation within the city limits.

2. What specific action did DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb take?

Schwalb filed a lawsuit on August 15, 2025, challenging the legality of the White House directive and sought a temporary restraining order to block the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department.

3. Why did the Trump administration back down?

Faced with a lawsuit and strong indications from Judge Ana C. Reyes that she would grant a restraining order due to the lack of legal basis for the takeover, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a revised directive scaling back federal control before the judge could rule.

4. Did DC completely win against the Trump police takeover?

No, it was a partial victory. While the administration retreated from direct operational command of the MPD, DC lost its sanctuary city status. Federal influence over policing, particularly regarding immigration enforcement, remains significantly increased.

5. What did Judge Reyes say that was pivotal?

Judge Reyes directly questioned the legal basis, asking DOJ lawyers how the President could order the DC police not to act without White House permission, signaling she found the argument legally unsound.",https://inews.zoombangla.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Donald-Trump-cruel-law.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 01:57:03.174787

According to Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin of the Department of Homeland Security, ICE had no involvement on campus. Her office issued a statement, shared by ICE’s San Diego Field Office, clarifying that ICE agents detained a man—identified as an unauthorized immigrant from Mexico—after he pulled into a nearby parking lot, not on school property.

Detained on Aug. 14, the man taken into custody is the father of a student at the local elementary school. Dr. Fabiola Bagula, superintendent of San Diego Unified School District, confirmed he had been waiting to pick up his child when the situation unfolded. Meanwhile, McLaughlin says he has since been placed in removal proceedings.

Despite the official explanation, the incident left many in the Linda Vista neighborhood feeling alarmed. Witnesses described seeing federal agents allegedly hitting the man’s car with their hands as they demanded he get out—and this all occurring just minutes before school let out for the day.

Dr. Bagula decried the action at a press conference on Friday morning, stating, “You can have your immigration reform without traumatizing children.” She added, “To our families and to every child, documented or not, every child had the legal right to attend public school in the United States. We will protect that right and we will do so together.”

This marks the second such incident in recent weeks, amplifying fears among families. Earlier this month, a mother was detained near Camarena Elementary in Chula Vista.

ICE did not respond to NPR requests for comment, but in the past agency officials have said they need more officers and detention spaces to meet administration goals. With billions of dollars of new money from Congress, ICE has launched a drive to recruit more officers and build more detention facilities.

But in the near-term, protesters and activists believe they may be able to slow the pace of arrests and deportations. Oregon is a case in point.

Creating ""noise"" and ""presence""

In Portland, demonstrators have gathered almost nightly outside ICE's field office, yelling curses through megaphones and occasionally crossing onto federal property. Federal officers have responded by shooting pepper balls and other crowd-control weapons. The building's lower windows are boarded up, covered with spray-painted curses aimed at the people working inside.

Chandler Patey, one of the few protesters who's not masked, said the group's presence keeps public attention on deportations. ""We need to be here and we need to create some amount of noise and a presence here,"" he says. ""And when ICE is here, they're not out kidnapping people, right?""

The protests have been going for more than two months, and sometimes just a few dozen people come out. They're far smaller than the protests outside of Portland's federal buildings in 2020.

Nevertheless, ICE has capitalized on the image of its Portland office under siege, and this summer White House ""border czar"" Tom Homan has twice pledged to go to Portland. So far there's no sign he has.

The late-night protests have also angered some nearby residents, and one has sued the city to get police to enforce its noise ordinance.

Despite the protests and the plywood, the ICE facility is still functioning. During the day, people with immigration cases are let in for ""check-ins,"" and some are detained. Government cars still come and go — though they often require an escort down the driveway by armed officers.

""Rapid-response"" system may also play a role

The greater impediment to large-scale arrests may be the ""rapid response"" system run by the Portland Immigration Rights Coalition and other non-profits. They run a state-wide hotline that collects ICE sightings and quickly connects arrestees with legal help.

Isa Peña is director of strategy for Innovation Law Lab, one of the groups involved. She says one strategy, when they get word of an arrest, is to file a habeas corpus petition asking a court to review the legality of the detention, before ICE can transport someone to the nearest overnight detention center, across the state line in Tacoma, Wash.

""If we are able to file a habeas petition in Oregon, we have gotten orders from the judge that the individual cannot be removed out of the state,"" Peña says. ""Because ICE does not have any detention facilities [in Oregon], they are often let go.""

The fact that ICE doesn't have an overnight detention center in Oregon makes it harder to rack up arrest totals here —which lag behind neighboring states. According to data collected by the Deportation Data Project, the state saw only 103 arrests in June, and 67 from July 1-29.

""Sanctuary"" states continue to get federal criticism

Another factor complicating ICE's efforts is Oregon's long-standing ""sanctuary"" law, which limits the ability of local police and jails to hand over potential immigration law violators unless the federal agents have a warrant.

The state also funds legal services for non-citizens facing immigration charges.

Earlier this week Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was on Fox News, criticizing ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions that offer this kind of aid to people accused of immigration violations.

""These individuals that are in our country undocumented, they're breaking our laws,"" Noem said. ""What I find so astounding by so many of these leaders in these sanctuary cities and in these sanctuary states is that they're willingly encouraging and protecting people who break our laws.""

In response to this kind of criticism, Isa Peña says she doesn't think the hotline system and legal aid is making it harder for ICE to do its job.

Immigrant-rights groups have alleged ongoing violations of the settlement’s protections, including the long-term detention of migrant children in punitive conditions at border stations.","A federal judge in downtown Los Angeles has rejected the Trump administration’s move to terminate a 28-year-old edict governing how immigrant children are detained in federal custody.

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee issued her ruling Friday, finding that “defendants fail to identify any new facts or law that warrant the termination of the Flores Settlement Agreement at this time.”

The so-called “Flores agreement” — overseen by Gee in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California — remains one of the only legal tools to prevent the prolonged incarceration of immigrant children detained at U.S. border crossings.

Approved in 1997, the settlement — named for lead plaintiff Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old detainee when the class-action complaint was filed in 1985 — requires that children be held in licensed, child-appropriate facilities and released to family members or guardians as quickly as possible. Under the terms of the settlement, Flores co-counsel are permitted to visit detention sites where children are being held and hear directly from them about their treatment and the duration of their detention.

Lawyers for the federal government had argued that the agreement is out of date and needed to be dissolved in order to reflect changes brought by the second Trump administration, including modifications to law, compliance, “facts,” shifts in policies and executive function.

During a hearing on Aug. 8, U.S. Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis told the judge that the Flores settlement was unusual in that it “dictates the operation of immigration law,” which should not be under the supervision of the court.

“It does not dictate the operation of immigration law,” the judge countered, explaining that the agreement dictates the conditions of children in immigration custody. Moreover, Gee said, the government bound itself to the consent decree nearly 30 years ago.

Immigrant-rights groups have alleged ongoing violations of the settlement’s protections, including the long-term detention of migrant children in punitive conditions at border stations.

Arguing for the plaintiffs on the motion to terminate, Carlos Holguin, an attorney at the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law, said the government wants to terminate the settlement “so it can detain children for as long as it wishes … given this administration’s propensity for hardship on children.”

Joshua McCroskey, a Justice Department attorney, responded that “there have always been difficult cases where processing takes longer periods of time. … (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) does try to transfer minors out of its custody as quickly as possible.”

ICE did not respond to NPR requests for comment, but in the past agency officials have said they need more officers and detention spaces to meet administration goals. With billions of dollars of new money from Congress, ICE has launched a drive to recruit more officers and build more detention facilities.

But in the near-term, protesters and activists believe they may be able to slow the pace of arrests and deportations. Oregon is a case in point.

Creating ""noise"" and ""presence""

In Portland, demonstrators have gathered almost nightly outside ICE's field office, yelling curses through megaphones and occasionally crossing onto federal property. Federal officers have responded by shooting pepper balls and other crowd-control weapons. The building's lower windows are boarded up, covered with spray-painted curses aimed at the people working inside.

Chandler Patey, one of the few protesters who's not masked, said the group's presence keeps public attention on deportations. ""We need to be here and we need to create some amount of noise and a presence here,"" he says. ""And when ICE is here, they're not out kidnapping people, right?""

The protests have been going for more than two months, and sometimes just a few dozen people come out. They're far smaller than the protests outside of Portland's federal buildings in 2020.

Nevertheless, ICE has capitalized on the image of its Portland office under siege, and this summer White House ""border czar"" Tom Homan has twice pledged to go to Portland. So far there's no sign he has.

The late-night protests have also angered some nearby residents, and one has sued the city to get police to enforce its noise ordinance.

Despite the protests and the plywood, the ICE facility is still functioning. During the day, people with immigration cases are let in for ""check-ins,"" and some are detained. Government cars still come and go — though they often require an escort down the driveway by armed officers.

The agency is looking to reopen shuttered prisons in Hudson northeast of Denver and Walsenburg in southern Colorado.

The federal government has allocated more than $170 billion for immigration enforcement. It's part of President Trump's promise of mass deportations.

This week Colorado members of Congress said ICE is close to signing a deal to add detention beds in Hudson.

On Friday, the Washington Post reported it obtained federal documents showing what ICE is planning for Colorado and other states.

That includes adding 1,400 beds in Walsenburg, 1,100 in Hudson, 28 in Ignacio on the Southern Ute reservation and 170 more beds at the current facility in Aurora -- bringing that capacity to more than 1,500 detainees, according to the Washington Post.

People in Walsenburg are wondering if a shuttered private prison will reopen as early as this fall.

""No, not in Colorado,"" said protestor Valerie Harper with Grassroots Pueblo. ""These are no longer criminals they're picking up. They're targeting Brown people and sorting it out later.""

""They're doing everything under wraps, nobody knows if they're going to open, where they're going to open,"" said protestor Eliott Kahn, who said he traveled to Walsenburg from Pueblo West.

Protestors gathered at the Huerfano County Correctional Center, where private prison company Core Civic has bid for a contract with ICE.

Kahn is concerned where this is headed.

""Everyone wants criminals deported, I mean these people in MS13 and Tren de Aragua, they're terrible people nobody minds that those people are deported. We want to stop the illegal deportations as well as the arrest of hard working immigrants. Everything is secretive. They wear masks, everything it's just all very illegal, very scary because if they come for these people they can come for us.""

Walsenburg's Mayor Gary Vezzani says reopening the Huerfano facility to detain immigrants will be a boost as the town tackles debt.

""I think ICE does a lot better more good things than they do bad things, it's too big an agency to say there isn't some bad but all in all I think you've got to support your country and they're part of our country,"" the mayor said.

Vezzani said that he's heard nothing official about the expanded detention plans for his town.

""Core Civic has never really contacted us, told us anything. They've kept it up all these years and they're just expecting back in. They have not asked our permission, they have not asked to be in joint contact, there's nothing in writing, nothing.""

ICE is close to signing a deal to reopen a facility in Hudson, according to Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Democrat who represents Colorado's 7th Congressional District.

Vera Palyo welcomes the move.

""We need more facilities to take care of America. We don't have enough places for these people to go so they can be processed whether to stay or to go,"" Palyo said.

Rural Colorado communities are being tasked to solve a problem they say originated long ago in Washington.

""It's the Congress's fault all these people are here illegally,"" added Kahn. ""If they would pass some sensible immigration law. And then Trump killed the last immigration law so he could use it in the election.""

ICE sent a statement:

Since Jan. 20, ICE has increased detention bed space to approximately 62,000, reflecting the urgent operational need created by the prior administration's open-border policies. The reckless lack of enforcement during that time overwhelmed our systems and made these expansions not only necessary but critical to restoring law and order.

ICE has worked with private detention operators, local governments, and other federal partners to identify and bring online over 60 new detention facilities and added permanent and temporary capacity to its existing facilities for a total of approximately 18,000 additional beds active or pending activation (see attached list).

These contracts ensure ICE has the resources and infrastructure required to carry out its enforcement mission and detain illegal aliens who commit crimes and violate our immigration laws.

While we cannot confirm individual pre-decisional conversations, we can confirm that ICE is exploring all options to meet its current and future detention requirements.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/15/36a5f4d8-fa86-44fe-b247-ee791706af2c/thumbnail/1200x630/10b344b4bffd1ee2b27ca75fd535da2a/walsenburg-protest.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 18:56:49.010278

HAPPENING NOW: Temporary restraining order hearing in DC v. Trump, a suit filed this morning over Trump's effort to takeover the DC police. Judge Ana Reyes just took the bench. I'm listening in for @lawfaremedia.org Follow along ⬇️

Judge Reyes starts off by explaining why we're here. At the outset, she says she WON'T rule on Trump's determination that there's an ""emergency"" under section 740 of the Home Rule Act. She also won't address the ""federal purpose"" issue. Wants to focus on AG Bondi's order.

Here's Bondi's order. Judge Reyes starts by saying that the AG orders the Mayor and the DC police department to do things directly and provides that Commissioner Cole shall have authority of the Chief of Police.

Judge Reyes: I mean, why can't the executive order just actually track the language of the statute, which is to say the President is requesting of the mayor the services of the MPD to help with X, Y and Z, and Mr. Cole is going to be the liaison.

Judge Reyes: Why is it that MPD can't go out and fight street crime [without permission from feds], or that they need Mr. Cole's permission to determine how you know where to whether to send people?

Judge Reyes: Are you saying if I was the chief of police and I wanted to issue directive that everyone wear dress blues on Tuesday, I wouldn't be able to do that unless I go through Mr. Cole? I mean, that's, this is incredibly broad DOJ: They haven't identified anything like that happening

Judge Reyes: You're making the argument that the President can basically run the entire police department based on language that doesn't even allow the President to talk to the police department. He has to go through the mayor. He has to issue the order through the mayor of DC.

DOJ: In the context of an emergency application, they do have a burden of showing that this poses a real problem. Because what is the order they want to give that they can't [bc of the AG's order]? Is it wearing dress blues? What are we talking about here, and why does it need to be addressed today?

DOJ: We want this to be successful over the 30 day period. It's not a long time. We want to work with DC police/leadership in a way that doesn't create confusion and delay. And we were doing that until this suit was filed...

Judge Reyes: Every wants this to be successful but my job is to make sure it's within constitutional and statutory bounds....By the way, did you just get this today? DOJ: Yes Reyes: Nice job.. I wonder if some of this is just cleaning up the language [in the federal orders]

Now counsel is up to argue on behalf of DC. He begins: The statute says, clear as day, that the President shall ask the mayor. What I took my friends to suggest is he thinks the president can ask of the mayor to tell everyone to listen to me. If that's right...hard to know where to begin

DC: Having the mayor in the middle of the statute would be completely negated. The statute would have a self destruct button because they could say, from day one, that the president can cut the mayor out of it.

DC: Another problem is that it allows the president to make the effective appointment of the police chief. And the Home Rule act clearly gives that power to the mayor. Nothing in the statute refers to appointments....

DC: The notion that any time the district and the federal government disagree about the manner of policing, the federal government has a tool in its back pocket that says ""Home Rule is over"" as it relates to the police department...that is clearly not authorized by the statute

Reyes: If the President called the mayor and said, ""I need the services of the MPD to help ICE""...I don't think that she could say no....Would that be appropriate? DC: I think that still is directing the mayor to provide a district-wide policy

DC: It would ask the mayor to provide services in a manner that violates DC law....This is not a federal preemption provision...I see nothing in this statute that involves having some ability to override commands [of DC law]

Counsel for DC mentions other provisions of the Home Rule act, says they support idea that Congress didn't intend to give power to the president to compel DC to adopt new policies or revoke policies that the federal government doesn't like

Counsel for DC says Bondi order is subject to arbitrary and capricious review under the APA. Reyes isn't sure. DC says president delegated power to her (head of an agency, DOJ) and she took final agency action so it is subject to that review.

Reyes is back to her assist ICE hypo. Reyes: What you're saying is that you're not going to answer the question of whether or not, if the President says, ""I'm asking mayor for help from the police department to assist ICE"", that is something he can do?

In response, DC takes position that president can't direct the provision of services that otherwise violate or are inconsistent with DC law. Reyes wonder if that negates Section 740 altogether by allowing DC council to get around it by passing laws saying MPD can't assist the President

Reyes: What relief do you want me to do? I don't think I can say the full order violates the statute. I don't think statute is as narrow as you think or as broad as DOJ thinks.

DC: I think you should enjoin in two buckets. One is installation of AG's hand picked person as chief of police to operate direct control over MPD. That's flagrantly unlawful. Should be enjoined from doing that.

DC: Second bucket is to enjoin the orders in the memo...those are directed directly to the MPD. Reyes: Well, it does say in intro that she's order mayor to implement the orders....I want to get to practical solution. I agree 2, 3, and 4 may be contrary to statute but answer isn't to say start over

Reyes: We've been going for an hour and I want to give court reporter a 15 minutes break. During recess, I want counsel to try to work something out for sections 2, 3, and 4... She warns DOJ that if they don't work something out and she enters a TRO that is then violated, that's contempt of court.

Update: We're still waiting! In the meantime: If you appreciate our @lawfaremedia.org live coverage of court proceedings, I hope you'll consider supporting our non-profit newsroom. Thanks to all who already have! ❤️🥹 www.givebutter.com/journalism

ALSO: My @lawfaremedia.org colleagues will discuss this case (and other legal happenings) during our live show at 4 pm ET. With special guest @chrismirasola.bsky.social! I'll likely join the show later on, depending on when this hearing is over

We're still waiting. Perhaps DOJ and DC are still trying to work something out with respect to sections 2, 3, and 4 of Bondi's order. Not sure. Those sections of the AG's memo purport to rescind certain local orders/policies that apply to the DC police.

We're back! Judge Reyes: Alright, how am I spending my evening? Counsel for DC says that they've had productive discussions, want to continue discussions as to 2, 3, and 4. Want court to hold in abeyance (not rule yet) as to those sections. Still think section 1 unlawful, want to be heard on 5

Reyes says she'd be happy to hear argument on Sectio 5 but she doesn't see how she can enjoin that section, essentially tells police to follow existing DC law",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-16 20:57:41.315046

Today, we are in another such red scare conjuncture.
Throughout the 20th century, the dissidents who most interested red scare committees were those organizing on behalf of racialized groups.
Red scare committees used a variety of tactics to subdue their radical foes.
Indeed, compelling troves of data from radical movements has long been a core red scare tactic.","AS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE took to the streets of Los Angeles to defend their communities against state-sanctioned abductions of immigrants this June, the Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism (SSCC) put three organizations—Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), and the independent political organization Unión del Barrio (UdB)—on notice. Led by Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, the SSCC normally oversees anti-terrorism enforcement and policy, and directs the work of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Justice Department Criminal Division. But in a letter dated June 11th, the SSCC accused the three leftist organizations of supporting “coordinated protests and riots” against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal law enforcement agencies. The letter called the LA uprisings “lawless mob actions,” and demanded the organizations “cease and desist” any further actions “aiding and abetting” the “criminal” protests. Even more notably, the three groups were instructed to preserve all communications and contractual, financial, travel, and strategy information related to their role in “planning, coordinating, or funding” the protests; failure to do so could result in a criminal investigation.

On the surface, the SSCC letter appeared to home in on a grassroots resistance campaign against the Trump regime’s escalation of the U.S.’s already draconian immigration policies. However, the commitment of government resources to criminalize, harass, and intimidate social justice organizations, and the express intent to seize their communications, signals a broader campaign of anti-radical repression—one that has historically been known by the name “red scare.” Though “red scare” is commonly used to refer to discrete historical moments of anti-left attack, most notably the periods of 1919-1920 and 1950-1954, historian Robbie Lieberman has argued that the term can be used more broadly to characterize any campaign of “attack on civil liberties in the name of Americanism aimed at undermining movements for justice and equality.” This broader definition illuminates how red scares have been an enduring feature of 20th and 21st century U.S. politics, and clarifies the outlines of the iteration that is developing in our own time.

Historically, red scares arise to suppress protest movements that emerge at the intersection of war, economic turmoil, and racialized violence. The red scare of 1919-1920, for instance, took place in the aftermath of World War I and amidst U.S. intervention in Russia against the Bolsheviks in 1918, in a period also characterized by high inflation and the “Red Summer” of anti-Black riots across the U.S. in 1919. At the time, organizations including the Socialist Party, the Industrial Workers of the World, the Universal Negro Improvement Association, and the African Blood Brotherhood arose to challenge U.S. imperialism, racism, and capitalist exploitation, drawing the ire of the government and triggering a red scare. Similarly, in 1950-1954, another red scare emerged as the Korean and Cold Wars took off alongside a fierce capitalist class assault on unions and rampant state and societal violence against African Americans that the 1951 “We Charge Genocide” petition described as constituting genocide. Once again, movements for peace, racial justice, economic redistribution, and international solidarity emerged, only to find themselves facing a protracted campaign of anti-radical repression.

The resulting red scares routinely codified militant challenges to U.S. racial capitalism as foreign-inspired or otherwise un-American. In the 1919-1920 red scare, for example, the Overman Committee, a subsidiary of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was created to investigate un-American activities and the influence of Bolshevism in the U.S. In the 1950-1954 red scare, the Attorney General’s List of Subversive Organizations, a compilation of primarily leftwing organizations deemed threatening to the order and stability of the United States, identified groups for censure. These efforts launched congressional hearings meant to discredit dissident organizations, leading to left groups being blacklisted, their members barred from participation in other groups and institutions, hounded by the FBI, and worse. (Indeed, as evident in the case of the Peekskill Riot in 1949—where civil society, police, and the New York governor colluded to violently attack accused communists, leading to attempted lynchings and thousands of injuries from knives, rocks, and fists—such red scares could even legitimate the use of armed force to crush radical protest.) Through the use of such anti-left committees and a range of other repressive measures—the convergence of all three branches of government in curtailing freedom of speech, assembly, and association; the central role of the corporate media in demonizing “enemies”; bans on “heretical” literature; and anti-intellectualism and attacks on the university—past red scares wreaked havoc on progressive politics in the U.S. They encouraged the expulsion of accused communists, who were some of the left’s most effective organizers, from mainstream organizations. They also led to the narrowing of the struggle for racial justice by removing its internationalist focus; created the groundwork for a repeated misconstruing of domestic peace protest as abetting the enemies of the U.S.; and generally cultivated an atmosphere of fear and suspicion that discouraged militancy over the decades.

Today, we are in another such red scare conjuncture. The U.S. is the enthusiastic partner of Zionist aggression across historic Palestine and the region more broadly, including the genocide in Gaza, the savage bombing of Lebanon and Syria, and most recently, the “12-Day War” between Israel and Iran. The U.S. has also used bombing as a key instrument of foreign policy, launching more than 500 airstrikes in 249 locations, from Somalia to Yemen, in the past seven months; imposing and maintaining brutal and deadly sanctions on more than two dozen countries, including Cuba, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe; and most recently, taking aim at international institutions like the United Nations and the International Criminal Court in an effort to illegitimize them. Domestically, meanwhile, the government has eroded almost all social safety nets; promoted deregulation and corporate price gouging, leading to inflation and widespread economic suffering; engaged in mass firings and layoffs; and escalated its bid to weaken a resurgent labor movement. All this has been accompanied by escalating government and vigilante white supremacist assaults on racialized minorities, including migrants (documented and undocumented), Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims, and Black people.

As in the past, the violence and dehumanization of U.S. imperialism has not gone uncontested. There have been mass mobilizations, like those in LA, against ICE; rebellion against the construction of “cop cities,” most prominently in Atlanta; and nationwide student encampments and grassroots campaigns fighting for Palestinian liberation. Black and brown people have confronted white nationalist vigilantism; women and LGBTQ+ folks have established national networks to protect their rights and bodies; and workers and labor unions have launched strikes for better wages and conditions. Unsurprisingly, another red scare has emerged that aims to degrade and demoralize these movements with well-worn tactics of red-baiting, charges of conspiracy, targeted harassment, criminalization, deportation, and other repressive measures. As this anti-radical campaign escalates, it becomes important to look back into how these tactics have been deployed in the past. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.

RED SCARES RECAST legitimate political thought and action as threats and conspiracies. Speaking in 1949 before the House Committee on Foreign Relations, W.E.B. Du Bois, the Black intellectual and co-chair of the Council on African Affairs (CAA), referred to this practice of mischaracterization as the invention of “witchwords.” “If in 1850 an American disliked slavery, the word of exorcism was ‘abolitionist.’ He was a ‘nigger lover.’ He believed in free love and murder of kind slave masters. He ought to be lynched and mobbed,” Du Bois said.

Today the word is ‘communist’. . . If anybody questions the power of wealth, wants to build more [Tennessee Valley Authorities], or advocates civil rights for Negroes, he is a communist, a revolutionist, a scoundrel, and is liable to lose his job or land in jail.

In the red scare moments after World War I, in the midst of the Great Depression, during the early Cold War, at the start of the civil rights movement, and beyond, such witchwords have allowed the state to circumscribe the rights and privileges of its critics. That trend continues into the present, with today’s witchwords including diversity, equity, and inclusion, or “DEI,” aimed at crushing any modicum of power, privilege, or access gained by minoritized people, particularly Black women; “antisemitism,” bastardized to mean any criticism of Israel or Zionism; “wokeness,” meant to denigrate racialized people generally, and Black people particularly, who challenge racial domination; and “domestic terrorism,” applied to any number of militant protestors, from those who reject cop cities to those who support Palestinian liberation. Prior to the June 2025 LA uprising, PSL had already been accused of antisemitism by mainstream media outlets for its pro-Palestine positions, demonstrating the way that witchwords help establish narratives of subversiveness that red scares can later capitalize on.

In addition to using witchwords, red scares justify crackdowns against left militancy by casting it as a pre-eminent threat to the law and its enforcement. Starting in 1919, J. Edgar Hoover, the founding and longest-serving director of the FBI (formerly the Bureau of Investigation) who worked closely with various anti-radical Congressional committees, continually asserted that it was the violent criminal elements that believed in and proffered radical doctrines like communism. “Disrespect for law and order is a fundamental cornerstone of communist tactics,” Hoover asserted. “Charges of ‘police brutality,’ ‘illegal arrest,’ and ‘persecution’ have long echoed in the Party press. These false communist charges, unfortunately, have been taken up by other groups whose basic purpose is to destroy law and order and to create chaos.” In its June letter, the SSCC employed the same line of argumentation, casting anti-ICE protests as “lawless mob action” and “criminal conduct,” and construing protestors as a danger to law enforcement—despite the latter maintaining a monopoly on force and violence.

Alongside the witchwords and accusations of lawlessness used to vilify radicals, red scares are marked by the deployment of Congressional committees to harass, humiliate, and discredit radicals through vicious, biased interrogations intent on establishing their “un-Americanness.” Examples of such committees abound. The 1918 Overman Committee was organized to investigate “pro-German” and “Bolshevik” elements in the United States. The 1930 Special Committee to Investigate Communist Activities in the United States, also known as the Fish Committee, was convened at the urging of American Federation of Labor leader Matthew Woll to investigate radicals accused of being funded by the Soviet Union. In 1934, the McCormack-Dickenstein Committee was formed to investigate Nazi propaganda in the United States but quickly turned its attention to the “dangers” of communism. There was the 1938 Dies Committee, which was a select committee organized to investigate “subversive” and “un-American” activity and was later transformed into the permanent House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1945, perhaps the most notorious and damaging of the anti-radical committees. The Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB) was formed as a result of the passage of the McCarran Act of 1950, and required communist and communist “front” organizations to register with the government or face five years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee was created in 1951 to oversee the enforcement of the McCarran Act and to investigate subversive activities including espionage, sabotage, and infiltration by those under the control of a foreign government or organization. The list goes on.

Congressional committees continue to be used to anti-radical ends today. In addition to the SSCC, the House Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee, which oversees the Department of Homeland Security’s effectiveness in fulfilling domestic security and counterterrorism measures, recently held a hearing on “The Rise of Anti-Israel Extremist Groups and Their Threat to U.S. National Security,” which conflated advocacy for Palestinian liberation with antisemitism and support for terrorism. Likewise, the Committee on Education and the Workforce, charged with overseeing an array of programs and policies related to legislation such as the National Labor Relations Act, the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, and the Higher Education Act, convened the hostile show hearings investigating “antisemitism” on college campuses, in addition to the hearing “Examining the Policies and Priorities of the Department of Labor,” which aimed to further curtail the power of unions and to root out the “radical DEI agenda” from the workforce. Taken together, these committees continue what American Studies scholar Michael Paul Rogin called a “countersubversive political tradition” aimed at creating, stigmatizing, and revoking the rights of critics of the U.S. government.

Throughout the 20th century, the dissidents who most interested red scare committees were those organizing on behalf of racialized groups. For instance, W. Alphaeus Hunton (dubbed the “unsung valiant” by his wife and biographer Dorothy Hunton), who worked alongside the likes of famed singer and activist Paul Robeson and W.E.B. Du Bois from the 1930s to the1960s in movements on behalf of Black equality, workers’ rights, and African decolonization, faced more than two decades of government attack in his role as the chairman of the labor committee of the Washington, DC, chapter of the National Negro Congress (NNC), trustee of the Civil Rights Bail Fund, and educational director of the CAA. In particular, during World War II, Hunton was branded a communist and a subversive by the Fish Committee because of his instrumental role in organizing Black workers in a campaign against the Glen Martin Aircraft Factory for refusing to hire them. The NNC was accused of attempting to sabotage the defense industry by infiltrating the factory with Black communist workers, leading Hunton to later note that “the history of all the congressional investigating committees from Martin Dies on down to the present McCarthy and Velde committees has been one of victimizing the fighters against Jim Crow.” Hunton’s assessment can be just as easily applied to today’s SSCC, which seeks to intimidate and discipline PSL, CHIRLA, and UdB for opposing the United States’ racist, imperialist immigration policy and the cruel and unusual tactics being used to enforce it.

Red scare committees used a variety of tactics to subdue their radical foes. The Fish Committee, for instance, did not call Hunton to testify, but it nonetheless spread “slanderous testimony without making the slightest effort to corroborate facts,” in the words of Dorothy Hunton; it was only when Hunton insisted that he had the right to face his accusers that he was told he had been “exonerated” of charges of subversion and disloyalty. More aggressive techniques were also used: In 1951, Hunton was imprisoned for contempt for six months for refusing to “name names” during a HUAC hearing. Specifically, he would not disclose the names of those who donated to the Civil Rights Bail Fund, which had been organized in 1946 to aid in the legal defense of those radicals who were rejected by private bond companies because of their politics. Here, HUAC not only turned Hunton’s activism into a crime, but also reframed the right to confidentiality into a threat to national security as it sought to expose radical groups’ donors to potential harassment and persecution. In demanding the same type of information from PSL, CHIRLA, and UdB on pain of a criminal investigation, the SSCC is similarly poised to cast a pall of criminality on radical organizations and their associates alike.

Indeed, compelling troves of data from radical movements has long been a core red scare tactic. The purpose of this is twofold. First, access to these records allows investigative committees to establish guilt by association to criminalize not only direct targets, but also anyone affiliated with the organization, however loosely, through donations, sympathy, indirect engagement (such as being on a mailing list), and so forth. Second, demanding an astronomical amount of information allows red scare committees to drain left organizations of resources, time, and manpower; to distract them from important organizing work; and to open them up to penalty for non-compliance. An example of the effectiveness of this tactic is the Subversive Activities Control Board’s demand for all correspondence between Hunton’s CAA and the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress. The committee demanded all communications and materials published and circulated from 1946 to 1955, and all records of funds sent internationally; it later accused the CAA of potentially violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act in order to gain access to the organization’s records. The resulting pressure was so insurmountable that in 1955, on Hunton’s recommendation, the CAA closed down after 18 years because ongoing government harassment had made it “difficult if not impossible to function.” Read in this context, it becomes clear that the SSCC’s attempt to strongarm sensitive information from a handful of left organizations portends a much broader strategy aimed at creating a wide dragnet to extirpate today’s radical movements.

The cumulative effect of these red scare tactics has been devastating for the U.S. left. As a result of these anti-radical campaigns, some of the ablest organizers in the U.S.’s long civil rights movement were ostracized and abandoned; the Black struggle for human rights was diluted to narrowly focus on civil rights; the peace movement was sidelined by charges of Soviet inspiration; and anti-colonialism became tolerable only when it was framed as a means of combatting communist influence in the Global South. It became commonplace for the threats of incarceration, deportation, passport suspension, and financial ruin to stalk those who levied militant challenges to the status quo, and these threats routinely discouraged everyday citizens from taking on political views that could be construed as “un-American” or subversive (or, in today’s parlance, “woke”). The aim of red scares, past and present, has been to get the public to become quiescent in the face of interlinked crises; it is a goal at which the government has too often succeeded.

But government success is not totalizing, especially when the oppressed fight back. One relevant lesson would be a willingness to work together across sectarian differences in order to combat state repression. In Hunton’s time, progressive groups such as the NAACP and the International Labor Defense worked together despite stark ideological differences to combat white supremacy. We should continue that practice today; the collaboration of PSL, CHIARA, and UdB during the anti-ICE protests demonstrates its efficacy. Secondly, mid-century radicals knew that in the face of government repression, the left needed to mount a defensive front. To that end, they organized defense committees and bail funds, mobilized the grassroots, and cultivated national and international allies in the cause of mutual protection. Collectivized resources, people power, and knowledge sharing are our best hope for effectively combatting U.S. government attacks.",https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-15-at-102020-AM.png,N,,2025-08-16 18:56:37.457845

New Zealander Sarah Shaw and her son were detained by ICE at the Canadian border last month after she dropped off her two eldest children at Vancouver International Airport.

Shaw, an employee at the state Department of Children, Youth, and Families, works at Echo Glen Children’s Center, a medium/maximum security juvenile rehabilitation facility in Snoqualmie.

Thorward said Shaw holds a “combo card,” a temporary immigration document that authorized her to work in the U.S. The combo card can also function as a travel document, but Shaw didn’t realize that part of the card was no longer valid, Thorward said. Only the work authorization part had been recently renewed.

It should have been a simple issue to fix, but instead it led to Shaw’s detainment at the border, Thorward said.

“It was completely unnecessary for that to happen,” she said. “There was no reason for it.”

A DCYF spokesperson confirmed earlier this month that Shaw’s employment eligibility was verified when she was hired. Her son had valid travel authorization, their attorney said.

Following their detainment, the mother and son were held at South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, Thorward said.

Shaw’s two older children are in New Zealand visiting their grandparents, Thorward said.

Victoria Besancon, Shaw’s close friend, said “being detained in the facility was very difficult for both her and her son.”

Shaw is her kids’ only financial support, and she’s worried about her bills and providing for the family, Besancon said. Besancon, who said she met Shaw almost four years ago when she came to the U.S., organized a GoFundMe fundraiser for her friend.

In the past year, there have been multiple cases of families with children — some U.S. citizens — being detained by immigration officers. Four American children were released last month after being detained with their mother for two weeks by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. In May, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported a pregnant mother of four spent three weeks in custody at Blaine Border Patrol Station.

Besancon noted Shaw’s son moved to the U.S. when he was around 2.

“All he’s ever known is America as his home,” she said. “So he didn’t understand why they were being treated like criminals.”

With its collection of hand-painted canvases and stuffed animals, though, the Teen Line corner is easy to pick out in the sea of staid cubicles.
People of any age can contact 988, teens included.
And I think that’s what teens need.” Teen Line isn’t intended to be a replacement for long-term therapy or other necessary professional services, Didi Hirsch Chief Executive Lyn Morris said.","There are a lot of reasons why people reach out to Teen Line, a Century City-based hotline that connects young people in crisis to trained teenage volunteers.

They call because someone is hurting them or they are afraid of hurting themselves. They text because an important relationship has ended or a troubling conflict has started. They feel disrespected, disregarded, dismissed.

At the heart of almost every call, text or email is the same cry of pain: Nobody is listening.

So the teenagers on the receiving end do what they wish adults would make time for more often, the thing nobody seems to be doing enough of these days: They listen.

Almost every single time, for at least the length of a call or a chat session, it’s enough.

“Even if their situation is really difficult, the best that we can do at the start is always just to listen,” said volunteer Mendez, 18. (The volunteers’ last names are withheld to protect their privacy and anonymity.) “And even if we don’t have a solution for them, I feel like that is one thing that just helps them so much.”

A project of the Los Angeles-based nonprofit Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, Teen Line is helping to fill an ever-widening gap between the need for mental health support and the resources available.

The phone and text lines are available to youth throughout the U.S. and Canada, and the email address can be used by teens anywhere in the world. Volunteers fielded 8,886 calls, texts and emails in 2024. Managers expect the total will surpass 10,000 this year.

The percentage of high school students who report feeling consistently sad or lonely has risen steadily in the last decade. A study published last fall by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 39.7% of students said they experienced persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and 20.4% had seriously considered dying by suicide.

At the same time, government spending cuts have hit many support services.

The Trump administration announced in April that it will stop paying $1 billion in federal grants that school districts nationwide have been using to hire psychologists and social workers.

The “Big Beautiful Bill” that Congress passed in May proposes major cuts to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which millions of Americans rely on to access mental healthcare for themselves and their kids.

In July, the administration removed an option on the 988 Suicide and Crisis Hotline that allowed young people identifying as LGBTQ+ to connect directly with counselors specially trained in supporting queer youth. More than 1.3 million queer young people in the U.S. have used the service since its launch in 2022.

None of this has deterred the 60 to 70 young volunteers at Teen Line, who commit to 65 hours of initial training and a minimum of two five-hour shifts per month. The program receives no federal funding and relies entirely on grants and private donations.

Each evening, eight to 12 high school students file into a sunny office in Century City, often after a long day of classes, homework, practices and part-time jobs.

They raid the snack room, settle into cubicles, pick up headsets and spend the next few hours talking and typing with fellow teens seeking support.

The lines are open for calls and texts from 6 to 10 p.m. Pacific Time each evening (the text option closes one hour earlier). Emails can be sent any time of the day or night.

They share an office with adult volunteers for the 988 hotline. With its collection of hand-painted canvases and stuffed animals, though, the Teen Line corner is easy to pick out in the sea of staid cubicles.

Didi Hirsch is by far the largest of the 12 centers in California that respond to 988. Last year, the organization fielded nearly 40% of the 454,146 calls to 988 placed in the state.

Total calls to the crisis hotline this year have already surpassed last year’s number, with more than 462,000 calls from California alone, a Didi Hirsch spokesperson said.

People of any age can contact 988, teens included. But a call or text to Teen Line, which has its own 800 number, guarantees a response from a peer who likely understands better than most well-meaning adults what it’s like to be a teenager today.

The public discussion about the youth mental health crisis “really becomes removed from the actual reality of what it’s like to be a teen, because the people having these conversations aren’t teens. They’re people kind of trying to look through the window from outside the glass,” said volunteer Max, 15.

The stereotype of today’s teenagers as anxious loners hunched over their phones is limiting and inaccurate, she said, as four fellow volunteers nodded in agreement.

It’s not that teens are cut off from real life. It’s that so much is coming at them that it can be hard to know how to field it all.

“Being a teen is a time of huge responsibility, but with so little control and so little power,” Max continued. “You’re not the one making decisions about your education. You’re not the one deciding where you live or what you’re doing until you get to college, and there’s so much pressure to succeed. ... We encourage them to think about their situation differently. We don’t hand them a different set of cards, but we encourage them to approach it differently. And I think that’s what teens need.”

Teen Line isn’t intended to be a replacement for long-term therapy or other necessary professional services, Didi Hirsch Chief Executive Lyn Morris said. But it can be a “stepping stone” for overwhelmed young people who aren’t sure where to turn or how to ask for help, she said.

Members of every generation have complained in adolescence that adults don’t understand them. But given the number of stressors that didn’t exist until recently — social media, school lockdown drills, accelerating climate change — today’s teenagers are very often justified in feeling that way.

“We don’t have experience in that stuff,” Morris said. “Thank God the teens have each other.”

It’s too soon to know how cuts to 988 and other services will affect Teen Line’s caller volume. Volunteers said they’re already hearing from people affected by recent policy changes. This includes teens who live in states that ban abortion and are worried that they might be pregnant, and those who tried calling the 988 suicide hotline but couldn’t get through to any operators in their state.

In the meantime, for adults concerned about the adolescents in their own lives, volunteers offered some sage advice.

Before whisking the phone away from a teen who’s too absorbed in their screen, ask what they’re trying to distract themselves from. Listen to teens’ opinions when they’re moved to share them. And don’t be afraid to say the hardest things out loud.

“Beating around the bush can be really suffocating,” said Jules, 17. “Suicidal ideation, suicidal thoughts, self-injury, stuff like that — just not calling it for what it is can be really harmful. ... Just letting them get it off their chest, and not keep it in or be ashamed of their thoughts, can have a really big impact. You don’t realize how much of a relief speaking and talking about it and being listened to can have.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2e87f48/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x2873+0+388/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc1%2F2c%2F4289902f44f5b78cbd0b562d2bbf%2F517468-la-me-teen-line-volunteers-help-peers-in-need-jey-16.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 18:56:25.144430

Some of these cuts are to FEMA programs, and involve the elimination of jobs specifically focused on building climate resilience.
Others are to NOAA weather stations and climate change monitoring outposts, as well as cuts to the National Weather Service.
Since Trump’s inauguration in January, roughly one-third of FEMA’s staff have either been fired, resigned, or retired, leaving the agency desperately short-handed.
Agencies with only a handful of staff can’t generate the sort of response that a huge federal agency — with extensive pools of manpower, equipment, and expertise — can draw on.","Late last month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that it waspreparing to slash $1 billion from grants that it gives communities to prepare for disaster, even though the agency’s internal memos acknowledge that this will leave the U.S. more vulnerable to “catastrophic incidents.” The cuts will target everything from transport infrastructure to the much-touted Next Generation Warning System, which used local media to help communities issue alerts to residents in the face of extreme weather events.

In an era of multibillion-dollar climate disasters, Donald Trump’s administration is fixated on both denying the realities of climate change — and hence the need for government agencies to prepare for climate-related disasters — and on eviscerating the roles of key federal government agencies, including FEMA.

In 2023, FEMA’s budget was just shy of $30 billion. This year, it was more than $33 billion. But that increase in overall spending hasn’t protected certain parts of FEMA’s budget from significant cuts, particularly those that are aimed at protecting communities from the worst impacts of disasters. The agency has seen mitigation efforts it coordinates reduced by $25 million; port security grants have lost $40 million; education, training, and exercises have lost $100 million; and federal assistance programs have seen a whopping $700 million hit.

Unless Trump follows through on his stated plans to scrap the entire agency, the overall FEMA budget for next year will again grow to $36 billion if the administration’s current budget proposals are enacted. But FEMA’s fiscal year 2026 budget hides a vast redistribution of funds away from disaster preparation and response, especially around climate change and anti-homelessness efforts.

Showcasing the new priorities, in a truly obscene departure from FEMA’s traditional disaster-relief mission, the agency is offering up more than $600 million to states to help them build immigration jails. And, earlier this year, FEMA froze the distribution of more than $10 billion to help rebuild disaster-hit hospitals, community centers, and other organizations, in an effort to root out any agency or group that might in any way be aiding undocumented immigrants. It has also slow-walked the distribution of funds to help rebuild Los Angeles’s Altadena and Palisades areas following the historic fires, likely worsened by climate change, this past January. Moreover, FEMA has put a hold on dollars already allocated to the Emergency Food and Shelter Program spending, while, according to reporting by the American Prospect, preparing to divert dollars from its Shelter and Services program to reimburse Florida for costs associated with building the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” concentration camp.

The latest cuts to federal grants come on top of a tranche of other reductions in spending on vital climate change-related areas — and in addition to ongoing Trump administration efforts to eliminate the agency. Some of these cuts are to FEMA programs, and involve the elimination of jobs specifically focused on building climate resilience. Others are to NOAA weather stations and climate change monitoring outposts, as well as cuts to the National Weather Service.

Since Trump’s inauguration in January, roughly one-third of FEMA’s staff have either been fired, resigned, or retired, leaving the agency desperately short-handed. At the same time, the federal government is raising the financial damage threshold for when to declare a disaster, and is limiting how much the feds will reimburse victims of these disasters. The Urban Institute has calculated that had these more restrictive criteria been in place between 2008 and 2024, 71 percent of disasters would not have qualified for federal relief, shifting more than $40 billion in disaster-response spending from the federal government onto the backs of already cash-strapped states and local governments.

None of this is accidental. The Trump administration appears to be operating on the assumption that if it just denies the realities of the climate crisis loudly enough, then magically, global warming will not occur. Witness the news that the Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of unraveling its own rules that allow it to regulate, and set limits on, the emissions of CO2, methane and the other gases that contribute to global warming. The result will be massively increased emissions (as much as 7.2 billion additional tons by 2055); an accelerated climate calamity; billions of dollars a year in health expenses related to global warming and dirtier air; and a federal government emergency response system that simply shrugs in the face of disaster.

Of course, not all disasters will be responded to equally. We are getting a glimpse of the desperately uneven and politicized disaster response future in the denial of FEMA assistance to communities in the western part of Maryland after heavy flooding in May. Maryland is Democrat-led (though the most-flooded counties voted for Trump in 2024). By contrast, West Virginia, which is heavily pro-Trump, quickly received assistance following flooding from a similar weather system a few weeks later. And Trump went out of his way to say GOP-dominated Texas would be taken care of following the deadly floods this summer, quickly signing a disaster declaration to allow federal dollars to flow to the state, even while he continued to threaten to deny disaster-response dollars to California because of its opposition to his immigration policies.

Yet in this era of stark cuts, even the reddest of states aren’t guaranteed that the feds will open the financial spigot. Communities in Arkansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina have also had their aid requests nixed in the wake of massive tornado, hurricane, and storm damage, with the feds arguing — in language reminiscent of the anti-welfare arguments long used by conservatives — that if FEMA is seen as being too lax on states, it encourages something of a dependency culture.

State and local officials are warning that they are struggling to hold the line. Agencies with only a handful of staff can’t generate the sort of response that a huge federal agency — with extensive pools of manpower, equipment, and expertise — can draw on. Anyone who has ever bought insurance can understand this concept: A large insurer has the resources to pay out claims allowing homeowners and communities to rebuild after a disaster that those individuals wouldn’t have if simply left to their own devices. Yet, under Trump, FEMA’s role of pooling resources in order to marshal large responses to disaster is being deliberately eviscerated by the ideologues now in charge of the federal government. As a result, many communities — especially those that are smaller and poorer (and, paradoxically, oftentimes more Republican) — will struggle more than would otherwise have been the case to recover from disasters.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2221173527-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 15:57:28.984715

The report, published in Psychiatric News, was authored by mental health professionals in the UCR School of Medicine and outlines how detention, deportation and workplace raids are contributing to widespread emotional trauma among both immigrant and U.S.-born children.

The latest wave of immigration enforcement raids began earlier this summer and has continued despite ongoing legal challenges that have placed limits on some enforcement tactics.","A new report from the University of California, Riverside warns that aggressive immigration enforcement practices in the United States are fueling a public health emergency for children in mixed-status families.

The report, published in Psychiatric News, was authored by mental health professionals in the UCR School of Medicine and outlines how detention, deportation and workplace raids are contributing to widespread emotional trauma among both immigrant and U.S.-born children.

“Psychiatry, as both a clinical discipline and a social institution, cannot remain on the periphery,” the authors wrote. “The current moment calls for a reexamination of how structural and intergenerational trauma are diagnosed, understood, and treated.”

The study details how children experience chronic anxiety, developmental disruptions and academic difficulties due to fear of family separation. Infants and toddlers may suffer attachment issues, while school-age children show signs of fear and anxiety, and adolescents often take on adult responsibilities, a phenomenon known as “parentification.”

“We are witnessing the effects of chronic fear, disrupted attachment, and intergenerational trauma on a massive scale,” said Dr. Lisa Fortuna, chair of psychiatry and neuroscience at UCR and lead psychiatrist on the report. “The threat or reality of separation from a caregiver fundamentally reshapes a child’s development and mental health.”

The report urges members of the media, policymakers and clinicians to confront the “human costs” of enforcement-driven immigration systems and to prioritize the emotional wellbeing of the youngest and most vulnerable.

“It’s hard to see how current enforcement can ever be humane,” said coauthor Dr. Kevin Gutierrez. “These practices create chronic stress and trauma in children and meet criteria for PTSD.”

The report also includes case studies and community data that researchers say illustrates how trauma transfers across generations, and is made worse by poverty, racism and the constant threat of enforcement.

The latest wave of immigration enforcement raids began earlier this summer and has continued despite ongoing legal challenges that have placed limits on some enforcement tactics.

Federal agents have conducted high-profile operations across Southern California, including one this week in Los Angeles that coincided with a speech by Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Since the surge began, at least two people have died during these immigration enforcement operations, including a farmworker in Camarillo who fell from a greenhouse in July, and a man struck by a vehicle after fleeing a Home Depot in Monrovia on Thursday.

The Los Angeles Unified School District celebrated the new school year earlier this week, but the joy was short-lived after a 15-year-old boy with disabilities was detained outside Arleta High School on Monday, according to District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.

“This is the exact type of incident that traumatizes our communities; it cannot repeat itself,” Carvalho told reporters.",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/AP25192726071193.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-16 15:57:34.135149

“Fight the Trump Takeover” was anchored in Austin, Texas, with other sites spread nationwide.
“Texas House Democrats are blocking a redistricting vote in the Texas House right now to Stop the Trump Takeover,” a website for the protests says.
“Though this fight started in Texas, it doesn’t end here,” Drucilla Tigner, executive director of Texas For All, said in a statement.
In June, as Trump held a military parade in Washington, millions turned out to more than 2,000 sites nationwide for “No Kings” protests.","Thousands gathered in cities and towns across 34 states on Saturday for a national day of protest against Republican redistricting plans in Texas and elsewhere.

“Fight the Trump Takeover” was anchored in Austin, Texas, with other sites spread nationwide.

In Austin alone, more than 5,000 protestors gathered at the city’s capitol in a show of defiance. Videos and photos on social media showed protestors holding various signs that read: “Abbott is a vote thief,” referring to the state’s Republican governor and “Fight the Trump takeover.”

Others chanted in a rally, yelling: “Shame on Abbott” and “The people, united, will never be divided.”

Speakers at the rally in Austin included the 95-year-old labor activist Dolores Huerta, Texas congressman Greg Casar and former congressman Beto O’Rourke.

“Texas House Democrats are blocking a redistricting vote in the Texas House right now to Stop the Trump Takeover,” a website for the protests says. “But Trump has made it clear that he’s not stopping at Texas. He’s targeting Missouri, Ohio, Florida and every state he can twist to help him steal Congress.”

The protests came as Texas Republicans are considering a mid-decade redistricting plan at Donald Trump’s request that would add five additional Republican House seats to the red state. In response Democratic lawmakers have left the state in protest, depriving the statehouse of a quorum needed to move its plans ahead.

“Though this fight started in Texas, it doesn’t end here,” Drucilla Tigner, executive director of Texas For All, said in a statement. “This isn’t just about redistricting or one state’s politics. It’s about the future of our democracy.”

Before the rally, O’Rourke wrote on X: “Thanks to everyone who has joined us in this fight for Texas, we’ve been able to donate over $1 MILLION to the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, the Texas House Democratic Caucus, and the Mexican American Legislative Caucus during the special session.”

On Thursday, the Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom, announced Democrats there would move ahead with a plan to redistrict the blue state in response to Texas’s effort. But, Newsom said, the plan for new California maps would only take effect if Texas or other red states pushed ahead with their own plans for partisan redistricting.

Texas Democrats said on Thursday that they would return to the state after a nearly two-week absence if certain conditions were met, including Republicans ending their special session and California introducing its new map that would add five Democratic seats to offset Texas’s proposal.

“The incredible support we’re seeing – not just back home in Texas, but from Democrats, Republicans and independents across the country – proves this fight is bigger than any one state,” said congressman Gene Wu, chair of the Texas house Democrats. “We’re defending our entire country from the Trump takeover, and I’m honored to stand with every patriotic American who refuses to let extremists rig the system.”

Major left-leaning organizations including Indivisible and MoveOn helped organize and support the protests, as is the Democratic National Committee. “Trump knows the only way he can hold the majority after his budget betrayal is by changing the rules in the middle of the game to avoid accountability for ripping healthcare and food away from millions of Americans,” the DNC chair, Ken Martin, told NBC News.

Organizers used an approach they have honed in the second Trump administration – holding protests in places big and small to show that dissent against the administration exists in all corners of the country.

Saturday’s protests also took place across the country, including in Washington DC where hundreds staged a demonstration outside the White House, carrying signs and banners that read: “No Kings in America Since 1776” and “Not Normal, Not American”.

An April day of protest called “Hands Off” drew people to more than 1,000 sites. In June, as Trump held a military parade in Washington, millions turned out to more than 2,000 sites nationwide for “No Kings” protests. Other days of action themed around labor and immigrants rights and voting rights also brought out tens of thousands of people on weekdays.

Planning is under way for another mass day of protest set for Labor Day, on 1 September.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc94b52b74e3a8efff1a032be075958524fa553/139_0_2861_2289/master/2861.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff306338ce504ccfe2612d8766e182ad",N,,2025-08-16 18:56:30.675845

Immigration enforcement arrests have increased locally within the first months of the Trump administration.
One of the administration’s first actions was to rescind Biden-era guidance that restricted immigration enforcement operations “in or near” certain protected places, including schools.
It happened to an entire school community,” San Diego Unified School District Superintendent Fabiola Bagula said Friday at a news conference outside the school.
In December, the San Diego Unified School District passed a resolution reaffirming its commitment to being a “welcoming district” for all students.","A parent waiting nearby to pick up his child from Linda Vista Elementary School was arrested Thursday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, school officials said.

The arrest occurred days after the start of the school year, and a week after another parent — who an immigration judge had ordered deportation in absentia — was taken into custody by federal immigration agents outside an elementary school in Chula Vista during morning drop-off.

Immigration enforcement arrests have increased locally within the first months of the Trump administration. One of the administration’s first actions was to rescind Biden-era guidance that restricted immigration enforcement operations “in or near” certain protected places, including schools.

Families and officials alike said such enforcement actions during school drop-off or pickup can send fear through the community.

“This did just not happen to one household. It happened to an entire school community,” San Diego Unified School District Superintendent Fabiola Bagula said Friday at a news conference outside the school. “It left children, families and staff, with questions and fears that no one, especially our youngest learners, should have to carry.”

Thursday’s arrest happened about 3:10 p.m., just before school dismissal, as the man waited in a line of cars near the campus, school officials said. Other families were present, but not students, officials added.

On Saturday, Tricia McLaughlin, the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement that ICE did not target the school, and that the arrest did not took place on school grounds.

She said the operation was targeting a man originally from Mexico who was “fraudulently using an American’s social security number.”

McLaughlin said officers approached the man after he pulled over in a parking lot. He was arrested and placed in removal proceedings, she added.

“Any smears that ICE targeted an elementary school are contributing to the 1000% increase in assaults against our brave ICE law enforcement.”

Homeland Security officials called the school’s principal, Miriam Atlas, following the arrest. She then informed the child’s mother of the situation, Bagula said.

“We have added counselors and district staff at the school today because the ripple effects of an incident like this extend far beyond the moment itself,” Bagula said. “They live in the stories that children will tell for the rest of their lives, in the questions they ask and in the worry that they carry home.”

Sabrina Bazzo, a trustee on the San Diego Unified School District board, referred to the incident as “unacceptable.”

“How do we expect our students to stay focused on learning when they have to worry about their parents and family members not feeling safe right outside this door,” she said.

Bazzo said she had heard that some parents had started organizing to pick up other students in case their parents felt uncomfortable about coming to school.

While dropping off their children at school Friday, some shared concerns about such enforcement near schools.

The mother of a first-grade student, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions, said she learned of the arrest on social media. “I’m afraid. I don’t know what might happen,” she said in Spanish. “The situation is worrying.”

Another mother, who walked her two children to school, said they have told her they are afraid. She also asked not to be identified out of fear for her safety.

Her 10-year-old daughter said that she fears for her family. “This has really changed my life,” she said. “I used to come to school feeling calm, knowing my mom would pick me up every day. Now, with everything that’s happening, I’m worried she won’t come back for me. It’s not just me; other children are worried, too.”

In a letter to parents on Thursday, Principal Miriam Atlas stressed that “school grounds are safe spaces that cannot be accessed by ICE without a proper, signed warrant.”

“We have reiterated our policies and protocols to all staff to ensure everyone understands these critical guidelines. In California, schools cannot ask about immigration status during enrollment or share student records without parental consent or a court order,” the letter reads.

Atlas said they were working with school agencies to make sure the affected family had access to the resources they needed.

In December, the San Diego Unified School District passed a resolution reaffirming its commitment to being a “welcoming district” for all students. Their actions included informing the school community about their rights and creating a new website with resources and additional information.

If there is one company most associated with the immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, it's Home Depot. Its stores have been the location of dramatic federal raids targeting day laborers. But the company has largely been quiet. NPR's Alina Selyukh reports.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Welcome to the Home Depot. Please enjoy your shopping experience.

ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Ray Hudson came to his local Home Depot in Los Angeles, preparing for a move.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Non-English language spoken).

SELYUKH: He picked up plastic crates, and usually, he would hire day laborers for help. They tend to gather nearby looking for work.

RAY HUDSON: See, and I could have used a couple of them.

SELYUKH: But they weren't there. Earlier that day, there was an immigration raid during which federal agents in tactical gear jumped out of a rental moving truck. Hudson heard it on the news.

HUDSON: It's just not right. They're not hurting nobody. They're not bothering nobody.

SELYUKH: Immigration officials have raided several Home Depot stores around Los Angeles and more around the country. This week, a man died as he ran from a raid by a Home Depot onto a freeway and was hit by a car. Home Depot did not comment on the death and has generally said little about the raids. A statement to NPR was the same it has issued time and again, that the company does not get notified, it's not involved, it has to follow federal and local rules, and its employees are instructed not to engage for their safety. This hands-off response has Chris Newman growing frustrated with Home Depot.

CHRIS NEWMAN: I sympathize with the fact that they are now ground zero for a big polarizing political and cultural issue.

SELYUKH: Newman advocates for day laborer rights as the legal director of the National Day Labor Organizing Network.

NEWMAN: However, I think that they have a responsibility and certainly a moral obligation to defend day laborers, who are both customers and service the stores where they seek work.

SELYUKH: Home Depot does not have a formal relationship with day laborers, but their history runs deep. As the chain grew to the biggest home improvement store by the 1990s, it set the stage for new demand for day laborers. Contracting crews used to compete for business on the cost of their supplies, but now everyone shops at Home Depot, and that makes the cost of labor a key way to get the edge over rivals. And there is a cheap, on-demand workforce right outside the store.

NEWMAN: Immigration laws change. Attitudes toward immigration change. But, you know, the law of supply and demand is immutable.

SELYUKH: About half of Home Depot's sales are to professional contractors who might need quick help with demolition, construction or cleanup. The other type of customer, Home Depot essentially created. It taught home owners to DIY and skip the contractor. And those shoppers now hire day laborers, too, for quick repairs or landscaping.

NEWMAN: In general, day laborers love Home Depot, and Home Depot's bottom line loves day laborers.

SELYUKH: Home Depot has said that day laborers are not part of its business model, and Wall Street analysts argue they're not a huge customer base and people who hire them would shop at Home Depot either way. Investors, so far, have shrugged off the rates.

JOE FELDMAN: I don't think that it's had any impact really on their sales.

SELYUKH: Joe Feldman is a financial analyst at Telsey Advisory Group.

FELDMAN: It's more of a perception. Is it a safe place to go shop?

SELYUKH: As Home Depot stays quiet, critics have zeroed in on the company's perceived politics. Two of its three founders have supported President Trump, except they have not run Home Depot for about 20 years. One of them died last year. The company donates to both political parties.

Back at the same Home Depot in Los Angeles a few hours after a raid, shopper Margarita Ochoa is noticing a change.

MARGARITA OCHOA: This parking lot is always full. So right now there is, like, so many spaces.

SELYUKH: Ochoa runs a housekeeping business and usually sends her employee to stock up on cleaning supplies and liquids for her pressure washer. But today, she's here herself for the first time in a while.

OCHOA: Because they afraid to come. They afraid to be here, so they didn't want to come today.

SELYUKH: Ochoa says, she hopes Home Depot would say more against the raids and do more, maybe protect people who run inside by closing the doors to immigration agents. She says she is thinking of taking her business elsewhere. But for now, this Home Depot is still the most convenient, and it's been her store for 33 years. Alina Selyukh, NPR News.

Today, all of this sounds very familiar, having been brought back into the American lexicon since President Donald Trump entered the political scene.
“Emergency powers,” it says, “are designed to let a president respond swiftly to sudden, unforeseen crises that Congress cannot act quickly or flexibly enough to address.
In April, the economist Paul Krugman identified what he called “The secret sauce of the Trump tariffs….Nobody knows what they will be.
And President Trump is not shy about channeling Clay and McKinley and again emphasizing his singular role.","As of August 2025, the remaining three commissioners are:

Dara Lindenbaum (Democrat)

Shana M. Broussard (Democrat)

Trey Trainor (Republican)

Former Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, also a Democrat, is no longer voting and is not listed as active. With no fourth member, the Commission lacks a quorum, meaning it cannot legally take action — including appointing new commissioners.

The FEC is supposed to be the referee that keeps our elections fair, transparent, and accountable. Instead, it’s been sidelined by years of intentional neglect, partisan obstruction, and political self-interest. And who benefits? Those who are willing to bend or break the rules to stay in power.

A System Designed to Fail

Congress created the FEC after Watergate to serve as a nonpartisan watchdog. But it has a fatal flaw: it requires four votes to take any action. With six commissioners split evenly between the two major parties, all it takes is one party refusing to play ball to stop enforcement entirely.

What we have today is worse: just three commissioners are seated. This means:

No investigations of illegal campaign donations

No rulings on dark money disclosures

No enforcement of super PAC coordination violations

No action at all

And with no quorum, there’s no way to even confirm new commissioners. This is not oversight; it’s sabotage.

How This Connects to Gerrymandering

The dysfunction of the FEC is precisely why, in The People’s Redistricting Act of 2025, I refused to entrust them with oversight. Instead, the Act proposes a new citizen-approved model that uses nonpartisan AI to generate district maps, which are then voted on directly by the people.

In contrast to the FEC’s gridlocked model, this process:

Requires no partisan appointees

Operates transparently and publicly

Returns power to voters rather than to entrenched elites

The lesson is clear: we cannot protect democracy using broken institutions. We must build new ones rooted in accountability and simplicity.

A Call for Structural Reform

If we’re serious about safeguarding our elections, we must:

Reform the structure of the FEC to eliminate the built-in deadlock.

Ensure timely appointments through fast-track confirmation procedures.

Expand the role of nonpartisan agencies, such as the Election Assistance Commission, to ensure continuity when the FEC fails.

But more than that, we need to listen to the growing cry from the American people: They are tired of being shut out, gerrymandered, and governed by systems that protect power instead of public trust.

We Can’t Wait

Every day the FEC remains broken is a day we accept an election system without referees. That is not democracy. That is a slow descent into democratic decay.

We don’t have to accept this. We can reform it. We can build something better.

Let's start by urging Congress to pass The People’s Redistricting Act — and by demanding that our institutions work for us, not against us.

Keith Davenport is a candidate for U.S. Congress, NC-06.

More than half a century later, Congressman (and later president) William McKinley championed tariffs and embraced Clay’s belief that import duties would protect domestic industries and workers from foreign competition. In 1890, he sponsored the legislation that raised tariff rates dramatically, saying that doing so would boost the American economy.

Today, all of this sounds very familiar, having been brought back into the American lexicon since President Donald Trump entered the political scene. On July 31, the president issued an Executive Order “imposing additional ad valorem duties on goods of certain trading partners.”

The order was another unilateral exercise of presidential authority rather than the result of democratic deliberation.

The order claims that tariffs are needed to protect “the domestic manufacturing base, critical supply chains, and the defense industrial base.“ However, it is challenging to discern how this purpose justifies the complex array of tariff rates it imposes on various countries.

No economic logic would result in a 25% tariff on goods from India and a 19% tariff for Pakistan, or a 15% rate for Jordan and a 41% rate for Syria. But that should not be surprising.

The president seems to care more about imposing tariffs as an exercise of power than about any such logic. That has been apparent for months as his on again-off again tariff policy unfolded. Or consider the president's actions with Brazil.

As the BBC notes, “Trump has raised Brazil's rate to a whopping 50% – potentially launching a trade war with Latin America's biggest economy, which sells large amounts of beef, coffee, steel and other products to the United States. The announcement on Wednesday means Brazil will face one of the highest US tariff rates in the world, at least so far.”

But, as the BBC observes, “this new policy isn't even really about trade….It's political, and part of a growing feud between the US and Brazil…..” Trump is using tariffs “as retaliation over the prosecution of his ally, right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.”

Since he took office in January, the president has ignored the fact that the Constitution assigns the authority to impose tariffs to Congress. He claims authority under “The International Emergency Economic Powers Act… (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended…and section 301 of title 3, United States Code.”

What’s the emergency?

As the Brennan Center for Justice argues, there is none. “Emergency powers,” it says, “are designed to let a president respond swiftly to sudden, unforeseen crises that Congress cannot act quickly or flexibly enough to address. Presidents can rely on these powers to create temporary fixes until the crisis passes or Congress has time to act.”

But, the Brennan Center continues, “Emergency powers are not meant to solve long-standing problems, no matter how serious those problems may be. Nor are they intended to give a president the ability to bypass Congress and act as an all-powerful policymaker.”

In fact, no president claimed emergency powers “to impose tariffs for 48 years…., until Trump did so this year.” But emergencies, real or not, and emergency powers are never good for democracy.

In May, the United States Court of International Trade recognized that when it ruled that nothing in the laws of the United States “delegates… powers to the President in the form of authority to impose unlimited tariffs on goods from nearly every country in the world. The court,” it added, “does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder.

The Administration’s position did not receive a better reception on July 31 in a hearing before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. The lawyer representing the administration conceded that “no president has ever read IEEPA this way.”

Members of the court, the Washington Post reports, “appeared unconvinced by the Trump administration’s insistence that the president could impose tariffs without congressional approval, and it hammered its invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to do so.”

Neal Katyal, Solicitor General in the Obama Administration, got it right when he told the court that what President Trump has done with tariffs is a “’ breathtaking’ power grab that amounted to saying ‘the president can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, for as long as he wants so long as he declares an emergency.’”

The president is using tariffs to reward those he likes and punish his enemies. He seems to want to stand astride this country and the world, making them both bend to his will.

Tariffs are a key weapon in his arsenal to be wielded as the president wants, regardless of the economic damage they do or the pain they inflict. Many economists warn that such damage will be substantial both here and abroad. According to CNBC, “The tariffs are expected to cost U.S. households an average $2,400 in 2025, with the levies disproportionally impacting clothes.”

While Trump’s tariffs are bringing additional revenue to the federal government, they are slowing economic growth and destabilizing the world economic order that for decades has been important to the prosperity this nation has enjoyed.

They are also not good for our political system. In April, the economist Paul Krugman identified what he called “The secret sauce of the Trump tariffs….Nobody knows what they will be. Nobody knows what comes next.” That may be bad for businesses trying to make plans, but it is good news for a political leader seeking to make his will and whims the center of the political universe.

The president has compared his role in imposing tariffs to that of a storekeeper who owns the store where everyone wants to shop. As he told The Atlantic, “I have to protect that store. And I set the prices.”

Note the singular.

And President Trump is not shy about channeling Clay and McKinley and again emphasizing his singular role. “I’m resetting the table. I’m resetting a lot of years….Our country was most successful from 1850 or so to, think of this, from 1870—really, from 1870 to 1913. And it was all tariffs.”

“And then some great genius said, ‘Let’s go and tax the people instead of taxing other countries.’”

The president, who frequently refers to himself as a genius, is using tariff policy in a way that the people who wrote the American Constitution would never have imagined. It is just another sign of trouble for our democracy.

The arrest occurred near the elementary school while the father was waiting to pick up his child, minutes before students were dismissed from their classrooms. The child’s mother was informed about the arrest and was able to pick them up from school, district officials said.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the name of the man arrested is Juan Jose Martinez Cortes, a Mexican national without legal status.

In an emailed statement Tricia McLaughlin, assistant DHS secretary for public affairs, told KPBS Martinez was ""fraudulently using an American’s social security number.""

""Officers approached Martinez after he pulled over in a parking lot. On August 14, ICE arrested Martinez and placed him in removal proceedings,"" she said. “Allegations that ICE targeted Linda Vista Elementary School are false. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) was never on school grounds.""

On Friday, district officials held a press conference to address the incident.

“Let me be clear: Our schools and our neighborhoods that surround them should be off limits to enforcement actions like this,” said SDUSD Superintendent Fabiola Bagula. “These are spaces for safety, for growth, for belonging, for joy. And there may be a lot of debates about immigration reform, but there should be no debate that this kind of tactic is inhumane.”

San Diego Unified Trustee Sabrina Bazzo said Linda Vista Elementary experienced a decline in attendance Friday as a result of the arrest.

In a letter sent to parents, the district said it’s working “to ensure the impacted family has the resources they need during this difficult time.”

This is the second time in two weeks ICE has conducted a targeted detainment outside an elementary school. Last week, a mother was arrested at Camarena Elementary in Chula Vista for allegedly overstaying her visa; her children were in the car at the time.

“Next time the city attorney comes asking us for outside counsel money, you could say ‘No’ and redirect those resources.","Good morning, and welcome to L.A. on the Record — our City Hall newsletter. It’s Noah Goldberg, with assists from Julia Wick, Seema Mehta and David Zahniser, giving you the latest on city and county government.

Days after the Trump administration’s mass immigration raids came to Los Angeles, City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado started looking for money to help the city’s undocumented residents.

In a June 10 motion, she asked City Administrative Officer Matt Szabo to detail options for finding at least $1 million for RepresentLA, which provides legal services for undocumented Angelenos facing deportation.

A week later, an official from Szabo’s office said they were “unable to identify eligible funding sources” for the $1 million, which would come on top of $1 million the city has already allocated to RepresentLA.

This summer in L.A., an immigration crisis is colliding with a budget crisis, leaving some councilmembers frustrated that the city cannot do more, as federal agents whisk thousands of immigrants away to detention centers and potential deportation.

The city has been active in court, joining an ACLU lawsuit that temporarily blocked federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests. Mayor Karen Bass also announced a program to provide immigrants with gift cards, funded by private philanthropy, when many were afraid to go to work.

But coming up with another $1 million for immigrant legal defense, after city officials closed a nearly $1-billion deficit through cuts and slated layoffs, has proved a slog.

“Why is it that we can’t find the money for this?” asked Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martínez during a Civil Rights, Equity, Immigration, Aging and Disability Committee meeting on Aug. 1. “It appears that level of urgency is not being transmitted through this report, because when we’re in other situations, we find the money.”

Jurado piggybacked off her colleague.

“This is an immigration legal crisis,” she said, adding that she felt “disappointment, frustration and, frankly, anger with the outcome here that we can’t find a single dollar to support immigrant communities and this legal defense fund.”

“I find it really hard to believe that the CAO couldn’t find any money for it,” she said in an interview.

RepresentLA, which is a public-private partnership with the county, the city, the California Community Foundation and the Weingart Foundation, has seen a surge in demand for legal services since the immigration raids began in June, said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA, which manages RepresentLA.

“The need is higher than the needs being met,” Cabrera said.

The city has contributed funding for RepresentLA since its inception in 2021 — initially $2 million each fiscal year before dropping to $1 million in 2024-2025 and $1 million this year out of a total budget of $6.5 million, with the other $5.5 million coming from L.A. County.

RepresentLA, which has served nearly 10,000 people, provides free legal representation for undocumented immigrants facing removal proceedings, as well as other services such as help with asylum applications. Some attorneys are on staff, while others are outside counsel.

In April, Bass said in her State of the City speech that the city would “protect every Angeleno, no matter where you are from, no matter when you arrived in L.A ... because we know how much immigrants contribute to our city in so many ways. We will always stand strong with you.”

But behind the scenes, the city’s financial struggles put even the initial $1 million for RepresentLA in jeopardy, with the mayor proposing to slash it to zero for this fiscal year.

“Getting the initial $1 million back was quite a battle,” said Angelica Salas, CHIRLA’s executive director. “It had been zeroed out. We were able to get just the money enough to continue the program for those who are currently in the program.”

The City Council managed to claw back the $1 million during budget negotiations by slowing down hiring at the LAPD, as well as “ending duplicative spending,” said Naomi Villagomez-Roochnik, a spokesperson for Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who sits on the budget committee. (The mayor and Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson have since said they are looking for money to reverse the hiring slowdown.)

“It’s a crumb when you compare it to the rest of the city budget,” Hernandez said.

RepresentLA has 23 attorneys working on deportation hearings, and Salas said each represents about 35 clients at any given time. An additional $1 million “would allow us to expand our capacity for the new people — the thousands of people who have now been picked up in this new sweep,” she said.

At the committee hearing earlier this month, Councilmember Monica Rodriguez said the City Council should find savings in other areas to help pay for important programs like RepresentLA.

“Next time the city attorney comes asking us for outside counsel money, you could say ‘No’ and redirect those resources. ... When the mayor comes for Inside Safe, for additional discretionary money that she is unaccountable for, you could say, ‘No, we’re taking $1 million and putting it for RepresentLA,’” she said. “Let’s effing go.”

The committee called on the city administrative officer’s staff to research options for funding RepresentLA, including grants or reallocating money from elsewhere.

Szabo confirmed to The Times that things will be different at the next committee meeting.

“Our next report will provide options to fund RepresentLA at the level requested,” he said in a text message.

State of play

BALLOT ROYALE: Labor unions and business groups have been locked in a heated battle of ballot measures for the last three months, after the City Council hiked the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers. Each side is trying to get measures on the ballot that would have far-reaching effects, including one that would put the minimum wage increase to a citywide vote. Unite Here Local 11, which represents hotel and restaurant workers, has proposed four ballot measures that, according to critics, would wreak havoc on the city’s economy. Business leaders, in turn, have filed a ballot petition to repeal the city’s $800-million business tax — a move denounced by city officials, who say it would gut funding for police and other essential services.

— SAGE ADVICE: The Jurado staffer who was arrested during an anti-ICE demonstration in June gave a heads-up to her boss that she planned to take part, according to text messages obtained by The Times through a public records request.

“Going to the protest at [City Hall] fyi,” Luz Aguilar wrote to Chief of Staff Lauren Hodgins.

Hodgins responded with words of caution.

“To reiterate what we spoke about a few mins ago, if you choose to take part in any community action, please ensure that you approach the event with peace and care for those around you and stay safe,” Hodgins wrote. “This is not a city-sanctioned activity and you are participating on your own accord so want to ensure your safety along with the safety of those around you.”

Aguilar did not text back. She was later arrested at the demonstration and ultimately charged with resisting arrest after allegedly assaulting a police officer.

— BACK TO COURT: Prosecutors filed two new corruption charges against City Councilmember Curren Price this week. The charges were connected to two votes he cast on funding for the city housing authority and the L.A. County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, both of which were paying Price’s wife, Del Richardson. Price’s attorney called the new charges “nothing more than an attempt to pile on to a weak case.”

Sources told The Times this week that prosecutors tried to get Richardson to testify in front of a grand jury as part of Price’s case. She did not ultimately do so.

— IT’S FUN TO STAY AT THE YMCA: Bass, L.A. County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath and City Councilmember Traci Park were all in the Palisades Thursday morning at a ceremony where Horvath pledged $10 million from her discretionary funds toward rebuilding the Palisades-Malibu YMCA.

— GIFT ECONOMY: Our public records request for all the gifts Bass received in the last year and a half came back, with the list largely composed of ceremonial gift exchanges with her foreign counterparts (chopsticks and a teacup from the mayor of Sejong, South Korea, estimated cost $32; a scarf and a hat from Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, estimated cost $45).

There were a few interesting tidbits: Bass received flowers (~$72) from race and gender scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term intersectionality. There were also fancy Dodgers tickets and food (~$590, but marked as “paid down”) from her longtime lawyers at Kaufman Legal Group, along with flights and travel for two speaking engagements.

— NOT RULING IT OUT: When Bass appeared on the podcast “Lovett or Leave It,” host Jon Lovett gave her a “crazy pitch”: What if the city of Los Angeles broke off from the county, forming its own city-county? Bass said it “wasn’t that crazy” and asked (jokingly) whether Lovett would be taking on the messy ballot initiative … before reverting back to her standard line on the need for intergovernmental cooperation. Bass also told Lovett that the city is still looking at ways to carve out an exemption to Measure ULA taxes for Palisades fire survivors selling their lots. And, she said, the city is in the process of hiring its long-promised film liaison “as we speak.”

— HOT SEAT: Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers launched a special election campaign on Thursday, urging California voters to approve new congressional districts to shrink the state’s Republican delegation, as Texas Republicans fight to redraw their own maps to favor the GOP. If the plan moves forward through the many hoops ahead, another district could be created in southeast Los Angeles County, which would undoubtedly kickstart frantic maneuvering ahead of 2026. (L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis’ name is already getting thrown around as a potential candidate, though her office didn’t respond to a half-dozen queries.)

— DON’T ASK, DON’T TELL: City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto came out swinging against SB 79, state Sen. Scott Wiener’s latest housing density bill, back in May. Now, both proponents and opponents are clamoring to know whether Bass will take a position on the controversial bill. The Times has been asking too, but so far the mayor and her team have not responded to questions.

QUICK HITS

Where is Inside Safe? The mayor’s signature homelessness program did not carry out any new operations this week. Her Shine LA initiative, which aims to clean up city streets and sidewalks, will be back Aug. 21.

On the docket for next week: The Charter Reform Commission will meet at City Hall twice — yes, twice — to discuss planning and infrastructure on Monday and “government structure” on Friday.

The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.
The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because it allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.","WASHINGTON: The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District’s police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police. The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

The attorney general’s new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi’s earlier directive. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

In a social media post Friday evening, Bondi criticized D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, saying he “continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety.” But she added, “We remain committed to working closely with Mayor Bowser, who is dedicated to ensuring the safety of residents, workers, and visitors in Washington, D.C.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office said late Friday that it was still evaluating the Justice Department’s new order.

“What we know is that D.C. residents are worried and concerned and we have a surge of federal officers,” Bowser said during an earlier news conference outside the courthouse.

Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said Trump’s earlier move to sideline her would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” she said in a court filing.

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department largely under the control of the Republican president’s administration. Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

A push for compromise

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before US District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.

The judge pushed the two sides to make a compromise, promising to issue a court order temporarily blocking the administration from naming a new chief if they couldn’t agree.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said in court that the move to sideline Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major US cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier on Thursday to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because it allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Meanwhile, immigrant advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond to the new policies. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they’re still parsing the legal aspects of the policies.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,” Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they’ve seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters for a rally, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!“

ANCHORAGE, Alaska: US President Donald Trump said that nearly three hours of direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday did not yield an agreement to pause Moscow’s war in Ukraine, though he characterized the meeting as “very productive.”

During brief remarks to reporters, the two leaders said they had made progress on unspecified issues, but they offered no details and took no questions.

“There were many, many points that we agreed on. I would say a couple of big ones that we haven’t quite got there, but we’ve made some headway,” Trump said, standing in front of a backdrop that read, “Pursuing Peace.”

“There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” he added.

It was not immediately clear whether the talks had produced meaningful steps toward a ceasefire in the deadliest conflict in Europe in 80 years, a goal that Trump had set at the outset.

In brief remarks, Putin said he expected Ukraine and its European allies to accept the results of the US-Russia negotiation constructively and not try to “disrupt the emerging progress.”

“I expect that today’s agreements will become a reference point, not only for solving the Ukrainian problem, but will also launch the restoration of business-like, pragmatic relations between Russia and the United States,” Putin said.

There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv.

The anticlimactic end to the closely watched summit was in stark contrast to the pomp and circumstance with which it began. When Putin arrived at an Air Force base in Alaska, a red carpet awaited him, where Trump greeted Putin warmly as US military aircraft flew overhead.

For Putin, the summit — the first between him and a US president since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 — was already a big win, regardless of its outcome. He can portray the meeting as evidence that years of Western attempts to isolate Russia have unraveled and that Moscow is retaking its rightful place at the high table of international diplomacy.

Trump hopes a truce in the 3-1/2-year-old war that Putin started will bring peace to the region as well as bolster his credentials as a global peacemaker worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court, accused of the war crime of deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. Russia denies the allegations, and the Kremlin has dismissed the ICC warrant as null and void. Russia and the United States are not members of the court.

Both Moscow and Kyiv deny targeting civilians in the war. But thousands of civilians have died in the conflict, the vast majority Ukrainian, and the war has killed or injured well over a million people from both sides.

No ceasefire

Trump and Putin, along with top foreign-policy aides, conferred in a room at an Air Force base in Anchorage, Alaska in their first meeting since 2019.

Trump’s publicly stated aim for the talks was to secure a halt to the fighting and a commitment by Putin to meet swiftly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to negotiate an end to the war, which began when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022.

Zelensky, who was not invited to the summit, and his European allies had feared Trump might sell out Ukraine by essentially freezing the conflict and recognizing — if only informally — Russian control over one-fifth of Ukraine.

Trump sought to assuage such concerns as he boarded Air Force One, saying he would let Ukraine decide on any possible territorial concessions.

“I’m not here to negotiate for Ukraine, I’m here to get them at a table,” he said.

Asked what would make the meeting a success, he told reporters: “I want to see a ceasefire rapidly ... I’m not going to be happy if it’s not today ... I want the killing to stop.”

Zelensky has ruled out formally handing Moscow any territory and is also seeking a security guarantee backed by the United States.

Trump said he would call Zelensky and NATO leaders to update them on the talks with Putin.

The meeting also included US Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Trump’s special envoy to Russia, Steve Witkoff; Russian foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov; and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Trump, who once said he would end Russia’s war in Ukraine within 24 hours, conceded on Thursday it had proven a tougher task than he had expected. He said if Friday’s talks went well, quickly arranging a second, three-way summit with Zelensky would be more important than his encounter with Putin.

Zelensky said Friday’s summit should open the way for a “just peace” and three-way talks that included him, but added that Russia was continuing to wage war. A Russian ballistic missile earlier struck Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding another.

“It’s time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,” Zelensky wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

LONDON: Microsoft has opened an external investigation into allegations that a top Israeli military intelligence unit used its cloud technology to carry out mass surveillance of Palestinians.

The probe follows a joint report by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call.

According to the report, Israel’s Unit 8200 spy agency, the rough equivalent of the US National Security Agency, used Microsoft’s Azure cloud service to store a vast archive of phone calls intercepted and recorded from Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

The joint media report also revealed extensive ties between Microsoft’s Israel office and the spy unit — a finding that prompted alarm among the tech giant’s US executives who feared that Israel-based employees might have concealed information about the nature of their work with Unit 8200.

Microsoft’s Israel office, as part of its work with the unit, created a custom, segregated suite within the Azure platform in order to store the archive of intercepted phone calls.

Unit 8200 chiefs aimed to use the surveillance project to record “millions of calls per hour” across the Palestinian territories.

In a statement, Microsoft said “using Azure for the storage of data files of phone calls obtained through broad or mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank” would be prohibited under its terms of service.

The tech giant appointed lawyers from US firm Covington & Burling to oversee the inquiry.

It is the second external probe initiated by Microsoft in relation to its ties with the Israeli military.

The first, conducted earlier this year, found “no evidence to date” that the Israel Defense Forces had broken Microsoft’s terms of service or used the Azure cloud service “to target or harm people” in Gaza.

However, the latest investigation will expand on the previous one, with Microsoft agreeing “that The Guardian’s recent report raises additional and precise allegations that merit a full and urgent review.”

Pressure is also mounting within Microsoft through an employee-led campaign group, No Azure for Apartheid.

The group, which is accusing the tech giant of “complicity in genocide and apartheid,” has called for Microsoft to cut all ties with the Israeli military.

Sources within Microsoft told The Guardian that the company’s leadership was scrambling to assess Azure data.

They are reportedly concerned about information revealed by Unit 8200 sources for the joint media report, which alleged that the data was used to identify targets for strikes in Gaza.

Microsoft pledged to “share with the public the factual findings that result from” the external review, a statement said.

LONDON: Britain’s human rights watchdog has urged ministers and police chiefs to avoid “heavy-handed” tactics when policing demonstrations over the war in Gaza, saying that such actions risk creating a “chilling effect” on the right to protest, it was reported on Friday.

In a letter to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley, the Equality and Human Rights Commission chairwoman Baroness Kishwer Falkner said the “right to protest is a cornerstone of any healthy democracy” and any interference “must be lawful and assessed case by case.”

Her intervention follows reports of individuals facing police action at recent demonstrations despite not expressing support for any banned organizations.

The EHRC cited the case of Laura Murton, who in July was threatened with arrest under the Terrorism Act by Kent Police in July for holding a Palestinian flag and signs reading “Free Gaza” and “Israel is committing genocide” during a demonstration in Canterbury.

Murton told officers she did not support any proscribed groups but was reportedly warned that her actions were linked to Palestine Action — which in July was banned by the government.

Membership of or support for the group is a criminal offence under the Terrorism Act, carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.

“Heavy-handed policing or blanket approaches risk creating a chilling effect, deterring citizens from exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly through fear of possible consequences,” Falkner said.

“This concern extends beyond those directly affected by police engagement to the broader health of our democracy, because the perception that peaceful protest may attract disproportionate police attention undermines confidence in our human rights protections,” she added.

She called on the UK government and police to ensure “all officers receive clear and consistent guidance on their human rights obligations” so that “the appropriate balance is maintained between public safety and the protection of essential human rights.”

In a separate statement, she said that the right to peaceful protest was fundamental to British democracy and must be protected even when dealing with complex and sensitive issues.

“We recognize the genuine challenges the police face in maintaining public safety, but we are concerned that some recent responses may not strike the right balance between security and fundamental rights,” she said.

“Our role as the national human rights institution is to uphold the laws that safeguard everyone’s right to fairness, dignity and respect. When we see reports of people being questioned or prevented from peaceful protests that don’t support proscribed organisations, we have a duty to speak out,” she added.

Last weekend, more than 500 people were arrested in London, most on suspicion of displaying items deemed supportive of Palestine Action. Police figures indicate that half of those detained were aged 60 or older.

Downing Street has described Palestine Action as “a violent organisation that has committed violence, significant injury, extensive criminal damage,” citing evidence and security assessments presented in closed court. The group has rejected the claims as “false and defamatory,” saying they were contradicted by the government’s own intelligence.

Meanwhile, campaigners including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and Quakers in Britain have urged Attorney General Richard Hermer to delay prosecution decisions for those arrested until after a High Court challenge to Palestine Action’s proscription, set for November.

They argued that moving ahead before the court’s ruling “raises significant legal and moral questions” and that delaying action “would demonstrate restraint, fairness and respect for the ongoing legal process.”

Murton’s lawyers have also issued a letter of claim to Kent Police over her case, which they said was intended to remind forces across the country of their obligations to protect peaceful protest.

LAMPEDUSA, Italy: Italian authorities on Friday were trying to identify the bodies of 27 people who died when two crowded boats sank off the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa.

One wooden coffin, marked with an “X,” could be seen at the local cemetery, where the bodies of some of the victims were being held, an AFP journalist said.

Broadcaster Rai reported that some of the coffins would be transported to Sicily for burial in several cemeteries there.

Lampedusa, just 90 miles (145 kilometers) off the coast of Tunisia, is often the first point of arrival for people trying to reach Europe in fragile or overcrowded boats.

Its reception center is currently home to 317 people, including about 70 mostly unaccompanied minors, said Giovanna Stabile of the Italian Red Cross, which runs the facility.

Most of them come from Egypt, Somalia and Bangladesh, she added.

Of the 60 survivors of Wednesday’s capsizing disaster, 58 were at the center. The two others were airlifted by helicopter to Sicily for treatment, she said.

“Last night, the procedures for identifying the bodies began,” said Stabile.

“This was a delicate moment, which was supported by the psychologist, the linguistic-cultural mediator and the multidisciplinary team,” she said.

“People reacted to the identification in a very composed manner.”

For some, however, it was too much.

One Somali teenager, in tears, identified a girl, his cousin, among the dead. “It can’t be! It can’t be!” he kept repeating, ANSA news agency reported.

The 27 victims, including three minors, died when two crowded boats heading from Libya capsized about 20 kilometers off Lampedusa.

The UN refugee agency said the boats were carrying at least 95 people. Italian news agency ANSA said 100 to 110 people may have been on board, meaning up to 23 could still be unaccounted for.

On Thursday, the Italian coast guard published a video of the rescue operation, showing young men desperately trying to cling to a floating rescue cylinder in the water.

The somber scene at the reception center was in stark contrast to elsewhere on the island, as throngs of tourists enjoyed Friday’s Ferragosto public holiday.

At the port, where dozens of migrants were still arriving by boat at the port, pleasure craft were bringing back tourists from sea trips to the sound of festive music.

At the cemetery, women came to pray and leave flowers for those who lost their lives, while a vigil in memory of the dead was held at a local Catholic shrine.

“Migrants continue to arrive... our arms are always open but when these deaths occur, it hurts us deeply,” one local woman, who gave her name only as Angela, told AFP.",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/08/16/4630953-1299543667.jpg?itok=KcFiZuLf,N,,2025-08-16 18:56:44.343177

When he was taken into custody Friday morning, immigration agents tied his dog to a tree and then unclipped his collar, allowing the animal to run loose on Sepulveda Boulevard, according to the GoFundMe page.
In April, immigration agents attempted to enter two elementary schools seeking information about several students but were turned away by administrators.
On Monday, federal agents reportedly drew their guns on and handcuffed a 15-year-old boy with disabilities outside Arleta High School.
“When children witness peers, parents, or other individuals detained, the image is not easily erased,” Carvalho said in a statement Monday.","Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz was walking his family’s dog in Van Nuys on a recent morning when he was taken into custody by federal immigration officials, according to authorities and published reports.

Guerrero-Cruz, who turned 18 this month, was set to start his senior year at Reseda Charter High School on Thursday, according to a GoFundMe page set up to support his family and legal fees. Instead, he’s being held in Department of Homeland Security custody pending removal from the United States, the agency confirmed in statement to The Times on Friday.

“Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, an illegal alien from Chile, overstayed his visa by more than two years, abusing the Visa Waiver Program under which he entered the United States, which required him to depart the United States on March 15, 2023,” the statement read.

The department did not immediately respond to an email from The Times for further comment.

When he was taken into custody Friday morning, immigration agents tied his dog to a tree and then unclipped his collar, allowing the animal to run loose on Sepulveda Boulevard, according to the GoFundMe page.

“He is more than just a student — he is a devoted son, a caring brother, a loyal friend, and a valued member of our community. He carries a tremendous amount of responsibility at home, helping care for his five-month-old twin brothers and his six-year-old brother. He is a good student, with a kind heart, who has always stepped up for his family,” according to the GoFundMe page.

Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Alberto Carvalho said during a news conference Thursday that he spoke to the boy’s mother, who described the dismal conditions her son is facing in custody. She said her son was in a small holding area filled with 40 men, most much older than her son.

“He is 18 years old, but he’s a kid. He has not been exposed to anything in his life,” Carvalho said, recounting his discussion with Guerrero-Cruz’s mother. “He drinks water once a day. The food is insufficient. Mom said that there was not enough room for everybody to sit or lie down at the same time.”

During their conversation, Carvalho said, she “was having difficulty holding back tears. She was crying with every word that came out of her mouth.”

A friend of Guerrero-Cruz’s, identified as Ronny C., said in a statement that the young man’s soccer team was devastated by his sudden disappearance.

“On the field, he was rock-solid—always showed up, worked hard, and could be counted on week after week. Off the field, he was just as reliable: kind, respectful, and someone who lifted up the people around him. He brought consistency, heart, and a quiet strength that made the team better in every way,” Ronny C. said.

Guerrero-Cruz’s arrest comes amid already heightened fears among Los Angeles students and parents over whether they might be targeted by immigration officials while traveling to or from school.

A person with knowledge of Guerrero-Cruz’s situation who declined to be named for fear of reprisal confirmed that he attended the high school in Reseda for his junior year. The person added that teachers are working to “make sure all students feel safe” despite the ongoing raids.

Agents have already focused enforcement efforts at LAUSD schools at least twice since the Trump administration launched raids targeting undocumented immigrants this year.

In April, immigration agents attempted to enter two elementary schools seeking information about several students but were turned away by administrators.

On Monday, federal agents reportedly drew their guns on and handcuffed a 15-year-old boy with disabilities outside Arleta High School. Federal officials said they were looking to apprehend a suspected MS-13 gang member and instead took the person’s cousin by mistake. The teen was ultimately released.

Carvalho has called for limits on immigration enforcement near schools, saying it impedes student learning.

“When children witness peers, parents, or other individuals detained, the image is not easily erased,” Carvalho said in a statement Monday. “These moments imprint on young minds, distracting them from academic lessons and replacing intellectual curiosity with worry.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25c04dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1338x702+0+280/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F53%2Ff3%2F33eb1a374f63927dfd87a6685a96%2Fme-benjamin-guerrero-cruz-taken-by-ice-01.JPG,N,,2025-08-16 14:56:44.264223

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles issued her ruling a week after holding a hearing with the federal government and legal advocates representing immigrant children in custody.

Gee called last week's hearing “déjà vu” after reminding the court of the federal government's attempt to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement in 2019 under the first Trump administration. She repeated the sentiment in Friday's order.

“There is nothing new under the sun regarding the facts or the law. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone,"" Gee wrote, referring to the government's appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement.

In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement.

Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.”

Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Tiberius Davis, one of the government attorneys, said the bill gives the government authority to hold families in detention indefinitely. “But currently under the Flores Settlement Agreement, that’s essentially void,” he said last week.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of migrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s.

The agreement set standards for how licensed shelters must provide food, water, adult supervision, emergency medical services, toilets, sinks, temperature control and ventilation. It also limited how long U.S. Customs and Border Protection could detain child immigrants to 72 hours. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services then takes custody of the children.

The Biden administration successfully pushed to partially end the agreement last year. Gee ruled that special court supervision may end when HHS takes custody, but she carved out exceptions for certain types of facilities for children with more acute needs.

In arguing against the Trump administration’s effort to completely end the agreement, advocates said the government was holding children beyond the time limits. In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours. That included 14 children, including toddlers, who were held for over 20 days in April.

The federal government is looking to expand its immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated.

Gee still has not ruled on the request by legal advocates for the immigrant children to expand independent monitoring of the treatment of children held in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities. Currently, the agreement allows for third-party inspections at facilities in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley regions, but plaintiffs submitted evidence showing long detention times at border facilities that violate the agreement's terms.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/immigrantchildrenpolicyAP25228073183977,N,,2025-08-16 13:57:37.656986

“We strongly condemn the decision to revoke the executive order on competition, a move that green lights more consolidation and signals to corporate America that they can continue padding their pockets at the expense of working people without fear of government intervention. This action proves that ‘make America competitive again’ was just a hollow slogan. President Trump can’t claim to care about competition while systematically dismantling the very tools designed to prevent concentration of power and monopolies in the hands of the very few largest players.

“The executive order made competition a national priority and gave agencies the mandate they needed to challenge corporate gatekeepers in every corner of the economy, from Big Tech’s control over our data to hospital mergers that inflate healthcare costs. It was a commitment to use the power of the government to fight for the people who are tired of paying more for prescriptions, getting hit with surprise airline junk fees, having their right to repair a simple tractor or smartphone stripped away, or trying to run a small business that competes on an uneven playing field.

“By gutting this policy, the administration is actively choosing to return to a status quo where the biggest corporations dictate the terms of our lives. The consequences of this decision will be felt when small businesses close and as people spend more, get less, and earn less – all so that billionaires can have more.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of migrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s.

The agreement set standards for how licensed shelters must provide food, water, adult supervision, emergency medical services, toilets, sinks, temperature control and ventilation. It also limited how long U.S. Customs and Border Protection could detain child immigrants to 72 hours. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services then takes custody of the children.

The Biden administration successfully pushed to partially end the agreement last year. Gee ruled that special court supervision may end when HHS takes custody, but she carved out exceptions for certain types of facilities for children with more acute needs.

In arguing against the Trump administration’s effort to completely end the agreement, advocates said the government was holding children beyond the time limits. In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours. That included 14 children, including toddlers, who were held for over 20 days in April.

The federal government is looking to expand its immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated.

Gee still has not ruled on the request by legal advocates for the immigrant children to expand independent monitoring of the treatment of children held in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities. Currently, the agreement allows for third-party inspections at facilities in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley regions, but plaintiffs submitted evidence showing long detention times at border facilities that violate the agreement's terms.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ap2689ff021bd03d.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.847xh;0,0.0624xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-08-16 13:57:03.937803

Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik said the man was fleeing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at the Home Depot on Thursday morning. Witnesses said they saw him run across the store’s parking lot and onto the eastbound 210 Freeway, where he was struck by an SUV and killed.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for more information from Nexstar’s KTLA. But a representative told the Los Angeles Times that the man was not being pursued by their agents when he ran onto the freeway.

Protesters at Thursday’s event, however, believed the man’s death was a direct result of ICE raids like the one in Monrovia.

“I was heartbroken,” said Selene Lockerbie, who attended Thursday’s protest. “I feel like Monrovia was violated … to know that a man lost his life today just trying to work. Just trying to take care of himself and his family.”

Karen Suarez, another demonstrator, said she consoled the victim’s daughter at the scene.

“I just went up to her and said, ‘I’m really sorry about your dad.’ She was so shaken up,” Suarez told KTLA’s Sandra Mitchell.

Immigrant advocates say 13 people were detained by federal agents during Thursday’s raid. Several were also injured, according to Pablo Alvarado from the National Day Laborer Union.

“They’re afraid of going to the clinics and hospitals, so we’re going to make sure there’s a doctor who comes to see them,” said Alvarado. “The first thing is humanity of people.”

Read on... for details on the ruling.

A federal judge in Los Angeles denied a motion from the Trump administration Friday to throw out a decades-old settlement that outlines protections for immigrant children in federal detention.

In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee said the federal government had not shown that Homeland Security regulations satisfy the agreement's requirements, including that minors be released quickly and that family detention centers be properly licensed.

She also said the government failed to ""identify any new facts or law"" since she rejected an effort to end the agreement in 2019.

The White House did not immediately respond to LAist's request for comment.

Gee heard arguments from the federal government and immigrant advocates in a hearing last week. Lawyers representing immigrant children said minors were being held in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities for extended periods of time and asked the judge to appoint an independent monitor.

The hearing centered on the Flores Settlement Agreement, a 1997 consent decree that outlines minimum standards for conditions for children in immigration custody. It broadly requires the government to quickly move minors out of immigration detention and into facilities licensed to care for children.

Last year, Gee ended part of that agreement for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees care for unaccompanied immigrant children in the U.S., with some exceptions. But the requirements of Flores are still in place for Homeland Security facilities like Border Patrol.

It's those requirements that the government was seeking to end, arguing that the executive branch needed more flexibility and citing recent legislation like the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which includes billions of dollars for new detention facilities including for families.

""We're raising this early in an administration that ran on immigration issues,"" Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis told the judge last week.

Multiple immigrant rights groups represented the Flores plaintiffs in court. Sergio Perez, executive director for the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, told LAist the government's attempt was ridiculous.

"" It's an absurd and political move that reflects this administration's seemingly insatiable disdain for the checks and balances,"" he said.

The judge also heard a second motion from immigrant advocacy organizations alleging that the government is violating the Flores agreement by keeping children in ""prison-like"" conditions for extended periods of time.

"" Nobody's supposed to be held in Border Patrol facilities for more than 72 hours,"" Diane de Gramont is an attorney with National Center for Youth Law told LAist. ""But kids had been held for over a week, even two weeks, three weeks. And there have been children held for over a month in a holding cell with no access to daylight or recreation, and infrequent access to even showers.""

The judge has not yet ruled on that motion, but she expressed concern about holding times at Border Patrol facilities at last week's hearing.

The origins of the Flores agreement protections are in Los Angeles in the 1980s. Lawyers brought the federal government to court over the treatment of a 15 year-old girl from El Salvador in federal custody in a Pasadena hotel. That eventually led the government to agree to the national standards for the treatment of children in immigration detention that still stand today.

She added that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now,” but added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy – even when we don’t have full access to it.”

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department largely under the control of the Republican president's administration. Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

A push for compromise

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district's lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden. The judge pushed the two sides to make a compromise.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint.

The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Meanwhile, advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they're still parsing the legal aspects of the policies.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,"" Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they’ve seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

The arrest happened around 3 p.m. outside a church just steps away from Linda Vista Elementary School, where parents were gathering to pick up their children. Witnesses said the man had been waiting to collect his child when ICE agents, with their faces covered, approached his vehicle.

“They were like hitting the car and telling the guy, ‘get out of the car,’ and he was like, ‘why? why?’” said Michelle, a bystander who recorded the arrest and asked not to be identified for safety reasons. She said she watched in horror as the man was handcuffed and taken away.

San Diego Unified Superintendent Fabiola Bagula condemned the timing and location of the arrest, saying it left families and staff shaken.

“It left children, families, staff with questions and fears that no one, especially our youngest learners, should have to carry,” Bagula said during a press conference. “A child did not get picked up from school by their parent. This is traumatic. There’s a reason why those people are wearing masks — because they know it’s wrong to do.”

Bagula emphasized that ICE agents are not allowed to enter campuses without a warrant and called on federal officials to avoid enforcement near schools.

“Our schools and the neighborhoods that surround them should be off limits to enforcement actions like this,” she said. “There may be a lot of debates about immigration reform, but there should be no debate that this kind of tactic is inhumane.”

Cody Petterson, president of the San Diego Unified school board, echoed those concerns.

“When you show up and cut out from work early to pick up your kids to make sure they are safe, you should not be abducted as you are waiting for your child to come out of school,” he said. “It doesn’t matter where you are on the political spectrum — no one thinks that’s a good thing.”

Thursday’s arrest comes one week after a similar incident outside Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista, where ICE agents detained a parent who had previously been ordered deported.

School officials said the Linda Vista student whose father was detained was later picked up safely by their mother.

Ester Soliman was deported to the Philippines on Friday after living in Lancaster for 25 years, her family said.

Her family said they received a call from their mother from the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, just before Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were putting her on a plane.

“We are heartbroken and reeling, and we want her home more than we can communicate,” the family said in an update on its fundraising page to pay for an immigration attorney. “Please keep our entire family in your prayers as we determine our next steps.”

ICE arrested Soliman on Aug. 4 when she reported to a meeting under the Alternatives to Detention program at the agency’s York office.

Soliman’s family never received notification from ICE that their mother was being deported, according to Damon Myers, a friend who has been acting as their spokesperson. Instead, the husband of a fellow detainee at the Clinton County Correctional Facility called Ester Soliman’s son, Sam, to say his mother had been moved. Sam and Soliman’s other two adult children, Sandra and Sanjee, remain in Lancaster.

As of 1 p.m. Friday, Soliman was still shown in ICE’s online detainee locator, but the correctional facility had been removed. Once people are deported, they are removed from the system entirely. Efforts to reach Soliman’s attorney on Friday were not immediately successful.

When ICE returned Soliman’s phone in the airport, she called her children, according to Myers. In another statement to the fundraising page, the family called the situation “a nightmare.”

ICE was not immediately available for a comment or to confirm the deportation but had previously released a statement on Soliman’s case.

""She legally entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa that allowed her to remain in the U.S. until March 4, 2000,” Tricia McLaughlin, the head of the Department of Homeland Security’s public communications, said Monday. “Over 25 years later, she is still illegally in the U.S. A judge issued her a final order of removal in 2011, and her appeal was denied.”

According to state court records, Soliman has two traffic tickets on record and no other incidents. A Manheim Township police officer issued Soliman citations on July 28, 2025, for improper safety restraints for a child under four years and for driving without a license. She was allowed to leave the scene after the citations when someone came to pick her up, according to Manheim Township Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Barry Waltz, Jr.

Soliman came to the U.S. with her husband, Albert S. Soliman, who died in 2015, according to a death notice published in LNP. Soliman never went back to the Philippines, according to Myers. Soliman still has family there, who have been notified and who plan to be at the airport when she lands. Her full name, as used by ICE, is Estrelita Soliman-Ramos.

Earlier Friday, the family posted an update to the fundraising page that the government denied a legal motion, called a “stay of removal,” meant to postpone deportation.

In that post, they called for help from the public to amplify Soliman’s case by calling elected officials in the hopes of keeping her in-country.

The advocacy and affinity group Lancaster Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders released a statement Friday evening calling Soliman “a cherished mother and friend” and said her deportation was a worst-case scenario.

“We are overwhelmed with grief and fury that our beloved Ester is not with her family in Lancaster, a place she has called home for 25 years,” Cindy Lam, president of Lancaster AAPI, said. “We are holding the entire Soliman family in our hearts right now as we process and mourn this new tragic reality.”

Over the last week, the family raised $88,431 through a crowdsourced fundraising tool called GoFundMe, an outpouring of support that surpassed their original goal of $35,000.

Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday sought to install an “emergency police commissioner” to approve any new Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) policies, while also demanding the department aid in federal immigration arrests.

It has led the administration in the span of a week to lose the cooperative tone struck Monday, when Bondi claimed she had a “productive meeting” with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and said the two would “work closely” together.

City officials have had their own evolution, from the controlled disappointment initially conveyed by Bowser when she said she would “work every day to make sure it’s not a complete disaster” to the city’s attorney general launching a suit challenging the police takeover.

The week ended with the fight landing in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who at a hastily scheduled hearing raised concerns about portions of Bondi’s new order but urged the two sides to work together. After convening privately for nearly two hours, the administration agreed to walk back the new commissioner appointment and instead make him a liaison.

“I am very happy that it looks like hopefully this can get figured out without a judge having to do anything, because I think these are the kind of issues that should be decided between the district and the government,” Reyes said.

Despite the détente, it’s likely not the end of the legal battle. Reyes said she’ll hold additional proceedings next week, and the city made clear it stands ready to renew its emergency legal effort if it isn’t satisfied. The judge even gave out her clerk’s cellphone number so the parties could reach out if any issues come up over the weekend.

“My sincere hope is that we don’t have to be back fighting over this issue again,” D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb (D) said at a press conference at the close of the hearing.

The move to court is a shift from when Bowser initially shrugged off a legal challenge at her Monday press conference after Trump moved to take over MPD. When asked about the possibility, Bowser noted that once Trump declares an emergency, the Home Rule Act “authorizes the president to make those requests and it says the mayor shall comply with those requests.”

But city leaders’ tune quickly changed following Bondi’s order Thursday that installed Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Terry Cole to effectively command the force.

Bondi also rescinded an hours-old D.C. order directing more MPD cooperation on immigration in favor of something stronger – likewise lifting policies that barred officers from conducting immigration arrests for individuals who have no other criminal arrest warrant and to not inquire about someone’s immigration status for the sole purpose of “enforcing civil immigration laws.”

“In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” MPD Chief Pamela Smith wrote in a sworn court filing.

Bowser said that she was caught off-guard by the late Thursday order.

“We were surprised,” Bowser said after the close of the court hearing, noting that Bondi had called their earlier meeting productive.

“And without notice, we got the order.”

But in court, Justice Department attorney Yaakov Roth suggested it was the city that was responsible for any breakdown in cooperation.

“We want it to work. We’re not looking to create delay and confusion,” Roth said.

The tensions come as the administration’s efforts in the capital ramp up, with 800 National Guard troops now having been mobilized to the city alongside a surge of federal law enforcement agents and city police.

They’ve been conducting checkpoints across the city along with other actions, with arrests nearing 200.

City and federal leaders are also at odds over the purpose of the policing activities.

Of the 33 arrests on Thursday, nearly half, 15, were of non-U.S. citizens.

And of the 135 arrests this week broken down by Bondi, 75 were listed as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests.

Federal officials have also stressed the seizure of illegally purchased weapons, something that Bowser indicated was a priority for her after decades of D.C. efforts to limit handguns, including in a ban that was struck down by the Supreme Court.

“We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our streets, and if we have this influx of enhanced presence, we know that it’s going to make our city even better,” Smith said earlier this week as she discussed how the city would be “working side by side with our federal partners.”

But immigration seems to be another matter, one where the city has traditionally sought to keep its officers outside of enforcement, though they may be compelled under the order.

D.C. officials on Thursday directed MPD officers to be even more cooperative with federal officials, allowing the sharing of citizenship information for those pulled over for traffic stops and also allowed local officers to provide transportation for detained subjects.

But under existing city policy, it still prohibited to use databases for the sole purpose of checking someone’s immigration status and for arresting people for civil immigration violations when they had no other outstanding criminal warrant.

It was that latest order, as well as the existing policies, that were targeted late Thursday by Bondi as she installed Cole, igniting the suit challenging the federal takeover.

The city asserts that Bondi went beyond the Home Rule Act’s emergency authorities, which only require D.C. to provide the president with MPD’s “services.” While that provision may mean Trump can ask for officers and resources, the city says it does not allow the administration to upend MPD’s command structure or upend D.C.’s immigration laws.

That suit said the shoving aside of D.C.’s protocols for officers when it comes to immigration matters failed to take into account the “considered judgment of MPD leaders who are deeply familiar with the District’s law enforcement and public safety needs.”

But even Schwalb’s office on Friday acknowledged the city may ultimately not have the power to resist demands to help with federal operations.

“Look we know that the law under the Home Rule Act allows the federal government, during a course of an emergency, to request the services of MPD in furtherance of a federal purpose. And whether it’s clearing [homeless] encampments that are adjacent to or near federal land or that might interfere with federal employees, if it’s enforcement of immigration laws…we will have to confront that as it comes,” he said.

“We have made very clear that we have laws in our city and that the services that MPD provides in furtherance of a request from the President, those services must comply with the law.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/washington_federal_enforcement_081425gn07_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-16 11:58:06.663027

The ACLU said HHS issued the directive last month, restricting access to 13 programs that had previously been open to everyone.
“It will deprive children of access to crucial early educational programming and undermine access to essential and life-saving health care for children and their families.
Those fears may now be worsened by the HHS directive, deepening health disparities and limiting critical services for immigrant communities.
Advocates including the ACLU continue to demand its withdrawal, warning that implementation will disrupt access to essential health care, education and social services for millions.","WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a comment Wednesday warning that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) new directive would exclude noncitizens from dozens of community health, early education and social support programs. In a press release Thursday, the ACLU called the directive both “unlawful” and “harmful” to vulnerable communities.

The ACLU said HHS issued the directive last month, restricting access to 13 programs that had previously been open to everyone. Under a reinterpretation of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), which allowed noncitizens to access federal public benefits, HHS now considers an expanded list of services as limited to U.S. citizens.

Programs at stake include Head Start, which provides early childhood education to low-income families, and community health clinics that offer primary care to underserved areas. Other restricted services include mental health and substance use disorder support programs, family planning, and homeless assistance projects—all of which were previously open regardless of immigration status, according to the ACLU.

Since the late 1990s, federal administrations from both parties have taken a narrower view of PRWORA, with the Clinton administration allowing undocumented immigrants to access such services on the grounds that they were not “federal public benefits.” The HHS directive reverses that approach.

“The directive conflicts with PRWORA and upends longstanding guidance respected by four prior administrations,” the ACLU said. The group warned that HHS’s reinterpretation ignores decades of administrative precedent.

Backing the directive, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, “For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration.” Kennedy added that the directive “enforces the rule of law.”

“This arbitrary and harmful directive exemplifies this administration’s tunnel vision, which prioritizes its anti-immigrant crusade, no matter the harm,” said Ming-Qi Chu, deputy director of the ACLU Women’s Rights Project.

Chu said the directive could strip medical and educational access from millions of children, immigrants with disabilities and individuals recovering from substance use disorder, as well as survivors of gender-based violence. “It serves no one’s interest to deny people these essential services, and HHS must withdraw this incredibly misguided directive,” Chu said.

The ACLU also warned that the directive fails to consider the toll on immigrant families who rely on these programs for health, education and basic stability.

“The directive has triggered chaos and uncertainty both for administering agencies and the individuals, families and communities who rely on the services at stake,” the ACLU’s filing said. “It will deprive children of access to crucial early educational programming and undermine access to essential and life-saving health care for children and their families. It will also disproportionately burden mixed-status families, people with disabilities and survivors of gender-based violence.”

Public health experts have highlighted the health and economic risks of the policy under a second Trump administration. The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) has reported that immigrants, including those without legal status, contribute billions in taxes each year and play a crucial role in the health care sector. KFF warned that restricting access could harm public health and economic stability nationwide.

The foundation also noted that many immigrant families may already avoid seeking health care due to fear and confusion. The Trump administration’s “public charge” policy likely decreased coverage for millions of noncitizens under Medicaid or CHIP, as families feared assistance would jeopardize residency.

Those fears may now be worsened by the HHS directive, deepening health disparities and limiting critical services for immigrant communities.

The 30-day public comment period on the policy closed this week, and the revised directive is set to take effect immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, according to HHS.

Advocates including the ACLU continue to demand its withdrawal, warning that implementation will disrupt access to essential health care, education and social services for millions.

The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration.
This mirrors the Nazi recruitment strategy: draw from those already trained to execute state directives.
The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration.","In the last month, ICE has launched a recruitment campaign of unusual scale and persistence. Reports document emails sent to county deputies in Florida, outreach to FEMA personnel, targeted solicitations to retired federal workers, and policy changes that expand the age range for applicants well past forty. The campaign is not framed as an emergency measure but as a permanent expansion, made possible by a $170 billion appropriation for immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. ICE’s leadership has portrayed this as necessary to fulfill the agency’s mission. Local law enforcement leaders, particularly in Florida, have voiced both irritation and unease, objecting to the federal government’s bypassing of their command structures and raising concerns about losing trained officers to ICE’s ranks.

The practical explanation is straightforward: ICE is attempting to rapidly scale up its workforce to meet the Trump administration’s stated political goal of removing an estimated 20 million Latino people from the United States. In 2024, Donald Trump described these individuals as “poisoning the blood” of the country. The recruitment model—its targets, its institutional framing, its bypassing of local intermediaries—mirrors patterns visible in the historical record of the Einsatzgruppen, the Nazi mobile killing units deployed in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. The comparison is not rhetorical excess. It is a study in method. The question is not whether ICE today is equivalent to the Einsatzgruppen. It is whether the logic of building a force for extraordinary enforcement has recurring features that should trigger historical alarm.

The Einsatzgruppen emerged from the SS security apparatus as Germany prepared for the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. According to Richard Rhodes in Masters of Death, they were formed from an existing pool of police officers, security agents, and civil servants. Recruitment was highly targeted. Men with experience in policing, intelligence, and military command were sought out for their capacity to operate under orders and within a rigid hierarchy. History makes clear that these were not simply volunteer fanatics. Many were approached through professional networks, offered postings that promised status and advancement, and placed within a structure that normalized their assignments as legitimate state work.

The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration. It is a recognizable pattern in the history of state enforcement agencies preparing for expansive and potentially coercive missions.

Stefan Kühl, in Ordinary Organizations, underscores that the Einsatzgruppen operated according to the routines of bureaucratic administration. Orders were written in formal language, couched in terms of security and order maintenance. Missions were framed as operational tasks rather than moral questions. Men were told they were combating “banditry” or “partisan activity,” categories that erased the civilian status of their victims. This was a central mechanism for recruiting and retaining participation: the transformation of killing into a technical job, embedded in the standard practices of an organization.

Zygmunt Bauman’s Modernity and the Holocaust identifies this as a hallmark of modern bureaucratic violence. The Holocaust was not an eruption of irrational savagery but the product of systems designed to translate political directives into manageable administrative processes. The Einsatzgruppen were a case study in how to assemble a killing force from ordinary professionals, train them to think in technical rather than moral terms, and deploy them with minimal overt coercion.

The contours of ICE’s recent recruitment push follow a comparable bureaucratic logic. The recruitment targets a pre-screened pool of law enforcement and security professionals. Florida deputies, FEMA personnel, and retired federal agents are not random job seekers. They are individuals whose careers have conditioned them to follow formal orders, work within hierarchical structures, and frame their actions in procedural rather than purely moral language. This mirrors the Nazi recruitment strategy: draw from those already trained to execute state directives.

ICE is actively lowering entry barriers. The policy change lifting the maximum age limit above forty broadens the eligible pool in a way that signals volume as the overriding goal. In Nazi recruitment, similar expansions occurred when the need for personnel outpaced the available pool, with the result that older men or those with less ideal physical profiles were nonetheless brought into field operations. ICE is also leveraging bureaucratic legitimacy. The agency’s recruitment messages describe “enforcement opportunities” and “critical response positions” in terms that emphasize lawful authority, federal mandate, and organizational purpose. This is the same language of legitimization that Kühl and Bauman document in the Einsatzgruppen’s framing: orders presented as components of a rational plan, embedded in established institutional structures.

The campaign shows a willingness to bypass local institutional intermediaries. Florida sheriffs’ complaints that ICE directly contacted their deputies without coordination recalls historical cases in which Nazi units were introduced into territories without consulting local military or police commanders. In both cases, central authority overrode local norms in pursuit of a larger strategic objective.

The deepest similarity lies in the bureaucratic ability to render extraordinary measures administratively ordinary. Bauman warns that this capacity is intrinsic to modern organizations. The division of labor fragments moral responsibility. Language reframes acts of violence as technical assignments. In the Einsatzgruppen, mass shootings of civilians were described as “executions” or “security operations,” terms that masked the nature of the task from the participant’s own conscience.

In ICE’s case, the recruitment pitch itself functions as this kind of framing device. Potential hires are told they will be part of “national security” and “public safety” operations. In the context of an administration that has already pursued mass deportations, family separations, and expanded detention, such language situates controversial or coercive actions within the acceptable vocabulary of law enforcement.

Franklin Mixon’s concept of the “entrepreneurial bureaucrat” sharpens this point. Bureaucracies, and the officials within them, seek opportunities to expand their remit. ICE’s leadership has seized on a political moment—backed by unprecedented funding—to expand its manpower. In historical terms, the Einsatzgruppen leadership did the same within the SS apparatus, enlarging their operational scope whenever political conditions permitted.

The United States is not operating under the same conditions as the Nazi Reich in 1941, but the present safeguards are functionally nonexistent. Judicial review now functions as a rubber stamp for the Trump administration, with courts repeatedly validating executive actions that stretch or disregard statutory limits. Congressional oversight is, in practice, nonexistent, with leadership unwilling to confront or even meaningfully question enforcement policy.

The United States is not operating under the same conditions as the Nazi Reich in 1941, but the present safeguards are functionally nonexistent.

National media outlets remain cautious to the point of self-censorship, their corporate owners fearing retaliatory measures against other business holdings. In this environment, the assumption that legal and institutional checks will restrain an expanded, specially recruited force is untenable. Political leadership can and does issue directives that push beyond the law’s original intent, and the mechanisms designed to resist such directives have already shown their willingness to accommodate them. When that reality is combined with a rapidly enlarging enforcement body trained to operate under centralized command, the potential for escalation is immediate and concrete.

The modern state’s capacity for violence is not determined by the moral character of its personnel but by the institutional and political boundaries within which it functions. Ordinary organizational processes can adapt to deliver extraordinary harm when circumstances shift. The Einsatzgruppen were assembled and deployed in exactly this way, with bureaucratic procedures serving as the mechanism rather than an afterthought.

The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration. It is a recognizable pattern in the history of state enforcement agencies preparing for expansive and potentially coercive missions. Its targeting of trained law enforcement personnel, lowering of entry barriers, bypassing of local intermediaries, and reliance on bureaucratic framing are all features visible in the assembly of past forces that went on to commit atrocities. To note this is not to equate the present with the past in outcome. It is to recognize the continuity in method, and to understand that method as a warning. The Einsatzgruppen remind us that the path from “ordinary” enforcement to extraordinary violence is often paved with administrative memos, recruitment drives, and appeals to professionalism.

“We are hearing extremely concerning reports about an immigrant family, including a 7-year-old local public school student and her 19-year-old brother, detained by ICE,” Councilman Shekar Krishnan (D-Queens) said in a statement.
On Thursday, local lawmakers and advocated rallied for their release ahead of the school year, which begins on Sept. 4.
The Patchogue-Medford School District, where advocates say Manuel attended high school, did not return a request for comment Friday.
“New York City Public Schools stands with all of our students, and we are committed to supporting every child and family in our system,” she said.","Federal immigration authorities have seized a 7-year-old New York City public school student, the youngest-known local school kid to be detained during the second Trump administration.

Dayra, an Ecuadorian student at P.S. 89 The Jose Peralta School of Dreamers in Queens, and her mom were separated from her 19-year-old brother during an immigration check-in on Tuesday at 26 Federal Plaza, according to the family and their advocates. Her last name is being withheld as a minor.

“We were all very scared,” Patricio, Dayra’s mom’s boyfriend who lives with the family, said in Spanish. “Because we knew they were going to arrest them.”

Dayra and her mom, Martha, were shipped off to a detention center in Texas, advocates said. The U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement locator showed Martha as of Friday afternoon at South Texas Family Residential Center, one of the largest immigration facilities in the country. The center was reopened this year after the Biden administration shuttered it. (The locator does not provide information for detainees under 18.)

“She called me yesterday, she told me she was fine. But she is very afraid of returning to Ecuador,” Patricio said of Martha, who fled domestic violence in the country. An immigration judge had previously denied her asylum bid and ordered the family deported, according to court records, but they continued to report to their check-ins as required by law.

Dayra’s brother, Manuel, 19, was being held at 26 Federal Plaza, before being moved to a detention center in Newark, New Jersey, according to the locator. He recently graduated high school on Long Island and was supposed to start college this year, Patricio said.

The Department of Homeland Security, the agency that houses ICE, did not immediately comment.

“We are hearing extremely concerning reports about an immigrant family, including a 7-year-old local public school student and her 19-year-old brother, detained by ICE,” Councilman Shekar Krishnan (D-Queens) said in a statement. “My office is working actively to obtain all the details. We are in contact with the local school, DOE officials, and federal offices to learn more and fight to make sure the family can be reunited.”

“Family separation is horrific, and ICE must stop these cruel tactics.”

In the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, P.S. 89 hosts a Spanish dual-language program and is in the process of launching a similar program in Bengali, according to school data and social media. More than half of students are learning English as a new language.

“The abuses of the federal government and neglect from City Hall have created an environment of terror for families in the streets of New York,” said Naveed Hasan, an advocate for the city’s immigrant students. “7-year-old Dayra is among the youngest children taken by ICE, and if she’s not immediately released, our own government will illegally deprive her of her right to learn and thrive with her loving PS 89Q community.”

Dayra and Manuel are the latest in a slew of New York students to be swept up in President Trump’s deportation agenda, including two young men, Dylan and Mouctar, who attend the city’s alternative high schools for students behind on credits. On Thursday, local lawmakers and advocated rallied for their release ahead of the school year, which begins on Sept. 4.

The Patchogue-Medford School District, where advocates say Manuel attended high school, did not return a request for comment Friday. Nicole Brownstein, the press secretary for the city’s public schools, said the agency has helped connect families with their permission to legal support and other resources.

Earlier this month, another parent was detained after a morning drop-off outside of an elementary school in Chula Vista.","SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — A father waiting to pick up his child from school in the Linda Vista neighborhood was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement this week, sparking outrage and inciting fear within the local community.

Officials from the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) publicly addressed the incident Friday morning, confirming that the situation unfolded around 3:10 p.m. the day before near Linda Vista Elementary School.

Though not technically on campus, SDUSD Superintendent Fabiola Bagula said the parent was detained about five minutes before the dismissal bell at a nearby location, with multiple families witnessing the encounter.

“I am told that the father who was detained was concerned about his child’s welfare and who was going to get them from school,” Bagula explained.

The Department of Homeland Security contacted the school’s principal, Dr. Miriam Atlas, after the parent was detained, according to the superintendent.

“She [Dr. Atlas] had the difficult responsibility of contacting the child’s mother to inform her of what happened,” said Bagula. “The mother was able to pick up the child from school.”

School officials emphasized that students at Linda Vista Elementary School are very young, just 3 to 11 years old. To that point Bagula added, “You can have your immigration reform without traumatizing children.”

The principal also explained that immigration status is not something that is discussed during school enrollment as California law mandates that all school-aged children residing in the state be enrolled in school, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. Additionally, schools cannot inquire about documents related to a student’s or their family’s immigration status.

Bagula relayed the following message to the community:

“To our families and to every child, documented or not, every child had the legal right to attend public school in the United States. We will protect that right and we will do so together. As Americans and as neighbors and as democracy, we must demand more from our leaders. We must call for laws and policies that reflect both justice and humanity.”

The status of the Linda Vista Elementary School father who was detained and taken away by ICE is unknown.

This isn’t the first time a San Diego-area parent has been approached by ICE near a school. Earlier this month, another parent was detained after a morning drop-off outside of an elementary school in Chula Vista.

How could that affect Nevada?,"undefined, thenevadaindependent.com, annie-vong, associated-press",,,,,https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-wants-census-to-exclude-immigrants-in-us-illegally-how-could-that-affect-nevada,"Trump stressed that as part of the changes people in ""our Country illegally"" will be excluded from census counts.
Sondra Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada political science professor and executive director of civic engagement for the nonprofit Vote Nevada, agreed.
If undocumented immigrants are not counted, the biggest impact to Nevada is how much federal aid the state gets, Damore said.
Experts said it was unclear what exactly Trump was calling for, whether it was changes to the 2030 census or a mid-decade census.
A census citizenship question In a 2019 decision, the Supreme Court effectively blocked Trump from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has instructed the Commerce Department to change the way the U.S. Census Bureau collects data, seeking to exclude immigrants who are in the United States illegally, he said last week.

The census' data collections will be based on ""modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,"" the Republican president said on his social media platform, an indication he might try to inject his politics into a head count that determines political power and how federal funding is distributed.

Trump stressed that as part of the changes people in ""our Country illegally"" will be excluded from census counts.

In Nevada, there were nearly 290,000 noncitizens and 2.7 million citizens, according to the 2020 census.

Excluding undocumented immigrants would have minimal impact on Nevada’s representation in the U.S. House of Representatives, said David Damore, a political science professor and executive director of Brookings Mountain West and the Lincy Institute. Nevada gained its fourth and newest congressional seat after the 2010 census.

“We are not positioned to get a new [House] seat and the likelihood of losing one is small given current [population] growth patterns,” Damore said in a statement.

He noted that Trump unsuccessfully tried to include a question on citizenship status in the 2020 Census and suggested this attempt was likely to be unsuccessful. Additionally, Damore noted, Trump’s presidential successor would have to carry out Trump’s plan.

Sondra Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada political science professor and executive director of civic engagement for the nonprofit Vote Nevada, agreed. She said the 14th Amendment clearly states “the whole number of persons in each state” shall be counted.

“[The amendment] does not say citizens, it does not say voters, it doesn't say men or women. It just says whole persons. And so the president is going to have the same problem if he tries to say to the Census Bureau, ‘Go out and only count people who are citizens,’” Cosgrove said in an interview.

What Cosgrove is worried about, however, is if Congress revokes or withholds funding from the Census Bureau to comply with Trump’s directives. That could be problematic right now as the bureau hires people and gears up for the 2030 census.

“Every state is basically going to be told we don't have enough money to accurately count the number of people in your state,” Cosgrove said in an interview. “So every state is probably going to have to then step up and backfill with enough money to make sure that the census happens.”

Cosgrove said that with other federal agency budget cuts, if Congress withholds funding for the census, Nevada will have to make difficult choices on which services the state can afford to provide.

If undocumented immigrants are not counted, the biggest impact to Nevada is how much federal aid the state gets, Damore said. Billions of dollars of federal aid are based on formulas that use census data to determine a state’s population.

Experts said it was unclear what exactly Trump was calling for, whether it was changes to the 2030 census or a mid-decade census. If it’s the latter, the question is whether it would be used for a mid-decade apportionment, which is the process of divvying up congressional seats among the states based on the population count.

A new census?

Any changes in the conduct of a national census, which is the biggest non-military undertaking by the federal government, would require alterations to the Census Act and approval from Congress, which has oversight, and there likely would be a fierce fight. While the Census Act permits a mid-decade census for things such as distributing federal funding, it can't be used for apportionment or redistricting and must be done in a year ending in 5, said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former congressional staffer who consults on census issues.

""He cannot unilaterally order a new census. The census is governed by law, not to mention the Constitution,"" Lowenthal said. ""Logistically, it's a half-baked idea.""

It would be almost logistically impossible to carry out a mid-decade census in such a short period of time, New York Law School professor Jeffrey Wice said.

""This isn't something that you can do overnight,"" said Wice, a census and redistricting expert. ""To get all the pieces put together, it would be such a tremendous challenge, if not impossible.""

Trump's Truth Social post fits into an overall pattern in which he has tried to reshape basic measures of how U.S. society is faring to his liking, a process that ranges from monthly jobs figures to how congressional districts are drawn going into the 2026 midterm elections. But there could be legal challenges if he were to reshape the census, which also guides the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal funds to the states for roads, health care and other programs.

A census citizenship question

In a 2019 decision, the Supreme Court effectively blocked Trump from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The 14th Amendment says that ""the whole number of persons in each state"" should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment, the process of allocating congressional seats and Electoral College votes among the states based on population.

The last time the census included a question about citizenship was in 1950, and the Census Bureau's own experts had predicted that millions of Hispanics and immigrants would go uncounted if the census asked everyone if he or she is an American citizen.

Changes to the census could also play into the efforts by Trump to urge several Republican-led states, including Texas, to redraw their congressional maps ahead of schedule in ways that would favor GOP candidates.

Redistricting efforts

Redistricting typically occurs once every 10 years following the census, as states adjust district boundaries based on population changes, often gaining or losing seats in the process.

Despite Texas having redrawn its maps just a few years ago, Trump is pressuring Republicans in the state to redistrict again, claiming they are ""entitled"" to five additional Republican seats. Texas Republicans have cited population growth as justification for redrawing the congressional map. The state currently has 38 House seats, 25 held by Republicans.

Trump's team is also engaged in similar redistricting discussions in other GOP-controlled states, including Missouri and Indiana.

Earlier this month, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after standard revisions to the monthly jobs report showed that employers added 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in May and June. The revisions suggested that hiring has severely weakened under Trump, undermining his claims of an economic boom.

The White House insists that the problem was the size of the revisions and that it wants accurate numbers. But outside experts disagreed with that assessment.

""Trump is basically destroying the federal statistical system,"" said Margo Anderson, a professor emerita at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who has written extensively on the history of the census. ""He wants numbers that support his political accomplishments, such as he sees them.""

After the citizenship question was stopped by the Supreme Court in 2019, Trump made another effort in 2020, announcing a plan to exclude people living in the country illegally from the apportionment figures.

After states, cities and organizations sued, lower courts ruled the plan was illegal. By the time the Supreme Court weighed in, Trump had lost his re-election bid.

The justices sidestepped a decision on the legality of Trump's plan, throwing out the case on technical procedural grounds. The court said in an unsigned opinion that spoke only for the six-justice conservative majority that ""we express no view on the merits of the constitutional and related statutory claims presented. We hold only that they are not suitable for adjudication at this time.""

The three liberal justices dissented, saying the effort to exclude people in the country from the population for divvying up House seats is unlawful.

""I believe this Court should say so,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.

In April, Judge Trevor McFadden of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied a motion filed by four organizations to block those new registration requirements from taking effect, and on August 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied those organizations request for a stay of the registration requirements pending appeal. The American people have a right to know who’s here, and a key component of Trump’s “self-deportation” push is now in place — for the time being, at least.

A Brief History of Alien Registration in the United States

This story begins during the lead-up to our entry into World War II, when in response to concerns about so-called “fifth columnists” in the United States, Congress passed the “Alien Registration Act of 1940”, also known as the “Smith Act” after its primary sponsor, then-Rep. Howard W. Smith (D-Va.).

As Britannica explains, the Smith Act “made it a criminal offense to advocate the violent overthrow of the government or to organize or be a member of any group or society devoted to such advocacy”.

That’s true, but Title III of the Smith Act also required aliens 14 or older who were in this country for 30 days or more to be registered and fingerprinted (if they had not been registered and fingerprinted when they obtained their visas), while mandating that the parents and guardians of aliens under 14 years of age complete this process for their kids.

Aliens would register at the local post office or other locations designated by the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) commissioner, and those who willfully failed or refused to comply with these requirements (or a separate change-of-address requirement) were subject to a fine or imprisonment.

Aliens were then issued a Form AR-3 as proof they registered, but as Judge McFadden explained in his April order:

Over the decades, the administrative state would dilute these statutory requirements by regulation. In 1944, the [INS] eliminated the division responsible for universal registration and shifted registration from post offices to ports of entry and INS offices. ... And in 1950, the INS suspended the use of the AR-3. ... Instead, the INS subbed in preexisting immigration forms that were only available to aliens with legal immigration status, like the Form I-151 for lawful permanent residents or the Form I-94 for aliens with a record of lawful entry. ... So through regulation, aliens who had entered the country illegally were effectively exempt from the statutory registration requirements, since there existed no process by which they could register. [Internal citations omitted.]

Regardless, when the INA was first enacted in 1952, the Smith Act registration regime carried over to the immigrant visa requirement in section 211 of the INA and to the “Registration of Aliens” provisions in sections 261 through 266 of the INA.

Actually, as Judge McFadden noted, section 264(e) of the INA goes the Smith Act one better, requiring aliens 18 and older to carry and have in their “personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to” them or face a $100 fine and a 30-day jail sentence.

So, if you’ve never seen an actual “green card”, just ask one of your lawful permanent resident alien friends to show you theirs — nearly every LPR I’ve known carries it.

Trump’s Executive Order 14159

Illogically, for 80 years, the INS and DHS only required legal aliens who had been vetted and complied with the visa-issuance and admissions processes to register. Respectfully, that’s like requiring only DEA-certified physicians and licensed pharmacists to obey our drug laws.

That changed on January 20, 2025, the day Trump returned to the White House and issued Executive Order (EO) 14159, “Protecting the American People Against Invasion”.

Section 7 of that EO, captioned “Identification of Unregistered Illegal Aliens”, directed the DHS secretary, in coordination with the State Department and attorney general, to: “immediately announce and publicize information about the legal obligation of all previously unregistered aliens in the United States to comply with” the INA registration requirements; “ensure that all previously unregistered aliens in the United States comply with” those requirements; and “ensure that failure to comply with” those “legal obligations ... is treated as a civil and criminal enforcement priority.”

The New “Alien Registration Requirement”

In accordance with EO 14159, as I’ve previously reported, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced on February 25 that she would begin enforcing the INA registration requirements as part of a suite of tools her department would use “to track illegal aliens and compel them to leave the country voluntarily”.

DHS then set up an “Alien Registration Requirement” web page for aliens to use to determine whether they are required to register, with a link to the new Form G-325R, “Biographic Information (Registration)”, which they can complete online.

And, on March 12, DHS published an interim final rule (IFR) laying out these new requirements (to take effect on April 11) and inviting public comments on them.

Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights v. U.S. DHS

Which brings me to the challenge brought against the new requirements in the IFR, and a complaint filed on March 31 in the D.C. District Court captioned Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights [CHIRLA] v. U.S. DHS.

In their complaint, CHIRLA and three other organizations — the United Farmworkers of America, CASA, and Make the Road New York — alleged that the IFR “violates the procedural and substantive requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act” (APA), and that “absent intervention” by the district court, “all [aliens] — as well as U.S. citizens wrongly suspected of being [aliens] — will be exposed to a new criminal enforcement regime and a ‘show me your papers’ country, ... without regard to the statutorily mandated guardrails of the APA”.

As my then-colleague Rob Law explained in February 2022, “before a regulatory change can occur” under the APA, “the relevant executive branch department must publish the proposed change in the Federal Register, explaining the justification for the revision and giving the public at least 30 days to provide feedback”.

DHS asserted, however, that it was publishing this rule as an IFR “without prior notice and opportunity for comment” because it is a “procedural rule”, that is, “a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice”.

On the contrary, the CHIRLA plaintiffs argued:

With just 30 days’ warning, the IFR abandons the eighty-year-old approach to registration and imposes a new universal registration scheme and attendant civil and criminal liabilities on an enormous number of people. According to Defendants’ own estimates, between 2.2 million and 3.2 million people would be newly required to register.

Judge McFadden’s Order

In his April order, Judge McFadden never got to the facts of that argument or any of the others that the plaintiffs raised in their motion or complaint, finding instead that they failed to show they have standing to bring the case to begin with.

As he explained:

Standing is a “bedrock constitutional requirement.” ... It requires that a plaintiff “possess a personal stake” in the outcome, which “helps ensure that courts decide litigants’ legal rights in specific cases, as Article III [of the U.S. Constitution] requires.” ... Standing doctrine thus “serves to protect the ‘autonomy’ of those who are most directly affected so that they can decide whether and how to challenge the defendant’s action.” ... And it ensures that “the Framers’ concept of the proper — and properly limited — role of the courts in a democratic society” is vindicated, by ensuring decisions meant for the political process are left to the political process. [Internal citations omitted.]

The first ellipsis above referenced U.S. v. Texas, the 2023 opinion in which the Supreme Court rejected a challenge brought by Texas and other states to Biden administration’s policies that ignored INA mandates requiring DHS to detain criminal aliens, on the ground that even states lack standing to force the federal government to take enforcement actions.

Thus, enforcement advocates who were sore about the ultimate outcome of Texas should take comfort in the knowledge that what goes around comes around.

Judge McFadden’s standing analysis consumes 14 pages of his 21-page order, and it gets arcane, but the key takeaways are that none of the four plaintiffs showed that they had either “organizational standing” — that is, that they “suffered a concrete and demonstrable injury to [their] activities” because of the rule — or that it had “associational standing”.

With respect to associational standing, as the court explained:

An organization has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when three requirements are met. First, “its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right.” ... Second, “the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose.” ... And third, “neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” [Internal citations omitted.]

Here, Judge McFadden concluded, none of the groups showed that “any of their individual members would independently have standing to challenge the” IFR.

Because the groups failed to demonstrate a “’substantial likelihood’ of standing”, the judge denied their motion to stay the effective date of the IFR and a preliminary injunction.

D.C. Circuit Court’s Per Curiam Order

On April 28, the CHIRLA plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of Judge McFadden’s order with the D.C. Circuit, and on May 2, they filed a Motion for Stay or, in the Alternative, Injunction Pending Appeal of his order.

Not surprisingly, they disagreed with Judge McFadden’s standing conclusions, arguing that each of them has organizational standing (and that CHIRLA had associational standing to boot) in the course of ultimately asserting that they would face “irreparable harm” if the IFR were to remain in effect.

On August 12, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit issued a brief per curiam order (unsigned but issued for the panel as a whole) denying plaintiffs’ motions for a stay or injunction pending appeal and allowing the IFR to proceed for now.

Simply put, the circuit panel concluded that the plaintiffs “have not satisfied the stringent requirements for an injunction pending appeal”, but the panel did order expedited consideration of the case.

Note that this wasn’t what most would think of as a “pro-Trump” panel. Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson has been on the circuit court since she was appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, Judge Robert L. Wilkins was a 2014 appointee of President Obama, and President Biden nominated Judge Bradley Garcia, who was confirmed in May 2023.

Trump administration requested voter data.
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.","BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.

Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.

The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.

Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.

SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.

“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”

Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.

Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.

“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.

Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.

But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.

Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.

Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”

“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.

At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.

Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.

Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.

The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.

“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.

Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.

“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.

The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.

In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.

“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.

“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”

GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.

Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.

Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.

On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.

As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.

The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.

Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.

Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.

The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.

The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.

Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.

“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.

During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.

“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.

Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.

Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.

Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.

“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.

Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.

When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.

“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/naturalization-ceremony.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 06:56:30.368734

California is also challenging the congressional resolution in federal court.
The industry’s top manufacturers sued on Aug. 11, and on Thursday the Trump administration filed its motion to join the lawsuit.
Government lawyers met via a video conference to discuss the matter on Aug. 14 and filed their motion the same day, documents in federal court show.
“Despite the President’s signature, this remains an unconstitutional, illegal, and foolish attempt to undermine California’s clean air protections,” she said after Trump signed the resolution in June.","The Trump administration has intensified its efforts to limit California’s ability to impose clean air standards, filing a motion in federal court to join a trucking industry lawsuit that seeks to end the state’s Clean Truck Partnership, which includes a plan to switch to battery operated heavy trucks by 2045.

The motion, which would make the federal government a plaintiff in the industry lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Sacramento, is the latest in several actions taken by the administration to weaken California’s air quality regulations, many of which are more stringent than those imposed by the federal law and the Environmental Protection Agency.

It targets a decision by the California Air Resources Board to continue enforcing the state’s standards even after President Donald Trump signed a congressional resolution aimed at invalidating them. A similar motion was filed in a lawsuit in Illinois, and another that takes aim at regulations regarding light-duty vehicles such as automobiles was filed this week in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

“In a stunning act of defiance, the State of California is attempting to use its own vehicle and engine emissions standards through a so-called ‘Clean Truck Partnership’ to ban internal-combustion engines in heavy-duty trucks, notwithstanding duly enacted federal statutes specifically providing that those regulatory standards are preempted,” the administration said in its motion.

Trump signed a congressional resolution in June revoking California’s ability to impose its own standards, which had been previously allowed under a waiver of federal rules what would otherwise have banned such state-level regulations.

However, the state continued to insist that an agreement it had reached with the trucking industry two years ago that required a reduction in emissions and a shift to electric trucks by 2045 was still enforceable. California is also challenging the congressional resolution in federal court.

The industry’s top manufacturers sued on Aug. 11, and on Thursday the Trump administration filed its motion to join the lawsuit.

The move highlights the administration’s determination to end what it sees as regulatory overreach by California and other Democratic-led states, and marks the latest in a series of lawsuits that have targeted California’s policies on immigration, rights for transgender people, environmental protection and even the price of eggs.

The motion was filed on the same day that California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a proposal to begin to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor more Democrats in response to actions by the state of Texas to draw more Republican seats as requested by Trump. It names the Air Resources Board, the board’s executive director Steven Cliff and Newsom as defendants.

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement Friday.

In their initial lawsuit, truck manufacturers Daimler Truck North America, International Motors, Paccar, Inc., and Volvo Group North America said that they were “caught in the crossfire” between the federal government and the state of California.

California, they said, continues to insist on compliance with its stricter rules and has threatened sanctions against the companies if they do not do so. But at the same time, their lawsuit says, the U.S. Department of Justice has sent the manufacturers cease-and-desist letters ordering them to stop complying with California’s demands.

“California demands that (manufacturers) follow preempted laws; the United States maintains such laws are illegal and orders (manufacturers) to disregard them,” the lawsuit says. “This situation is not tenable.”

In its motion, the federal government laid out the timeline for its decision to join the lawsuit. On Aug. 11, the day the trucking companies filed their complaint, a congressional committee sent a letter to the Air Resources Board demanding that it comply with federal regulations, the motions says.

The next day, the U.S. Department of Justice requested consent from the trucking companies to join their lawsuit. Government lawyers met via a video conference to discuss the matter on Aug. 14 and filed their motion the same day, documents in federal court show.

CARB spokeswoman Lynda Lambert said the agency continues to believe that the federal government’s actions limiting the state’s ability to enforce its environmental regulations were illegal.

“On June 12, 2025, President Trump signed unconstitutional and illegal resolutions purporting to overturn three of U.S EPA’s decisions to grant California waivers, including its Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Omnibus regulations,” Lambert said. “CARB disputes the legality and effect of these resolutions, and they are being challenged in court.”

CARB chair Liane Randolph declined to comment on the lawsuit itself.

But she has harshly criticized the administration’s efforts to weaken California’s environmental rules.

“Despite the President’s signature, this remains an unconstitutional, illegal, and foolish attempt to undermine California’s clean air protections,” she said after Trump signed the resolution in June. The action, she said, was the latest in a series of “vindictive” moves aimed at trapping consumers into using fossil fuels.

“CARB will use every tool at its disposal to continue our critical work to clean the air and address the climate crisis,” she continued at that time. “The health and well-being of all Californians depends on it.”

A hearing on whether to allow the federal government to join the lawsuit has been set for Sept. 19 in federal court in Sacramento.
